The band comprises John Petrucci (guitar), John Myung (bass), Mike Portnoy (drums), James LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keyboards).\nDream Theater was formed under the name Majesty by Petrucci, Myung and Portnoy\u2014all from Long Island, New York\u2014while they attended Berklee College of Music. They dropped out to concentrate on the band. Dream Theater has undergone various lineup changes, with Petrucci and Myung being the only constant members. Portnoy remained until 2010, when he was replaced by Mike Mangini after deciding to leave to pursue other musical projects, before rejoining the band in October 2023. After a brief stint with Chris Collins, followed by Charlie Dominici (who was dismissed from Dream Theater shortly after the release of their 1989 debut album \"When Dream and Day Unite\"), LaBrie was hired as the band's singer in 1991. Dream Theater's original keyboardist, Kevin Moore, left the band after three albums and was replaced by Derek Sherinian in 1995 after a period of touring. The band recorded one album (and an EP) with Sherinian, who was replaced by current keyboardist Jordan Rudess in 1999.\nDream Theater has released sixteen studio albums. The band's highest-selling release is their second album \"Images and Words\" (1992), which reached No.\u00a061 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Other albums such as \"Awake\" (1994) and \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" (2002) also entered the charts at No.\u00a032 and No.\u00a046 respectively, and each received critical acclaim. Their fifth album, \"\" (1999), was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of \"Guitar World\" magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It was also ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album in March 2003 by \"Classic Rock\" magazine.\nBy 2018, Dream Theater had sold over 12 million records worldwide; they have received four Grammy Award nominations, including one win in 2022. Along with Queensr\u00ffche and Fates Warning, the band has been referred to as one of the \"big three\" of the progressive metal genre, responsible for its development and popularization.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFormation (1985\u20131987).\nDream Theater (then-Majesty) was formed in Massachusetts in 1985 when guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy decided to form a band while attending Berklee College of Music in Boston. Petrucci and Myung were childhood friends from Kings Park, New York, and met Portnoy of Long Beach, New York while at Berklee. The trio started by covering Rush and Iron Maiden songs in the rehearsal rooms at Berklee.\nMyung, Petrucci, and Portnoy joined on the name Majesty for their newly formed group. According to \"The Score So Far...\" documentary, they were waiting in line for tickets to a Rush concert at the Berklee Performance Center while listening to the band on a boom box. Portnoy commented that the ending of the song \"Bastille Day\" (from the album \"Caress of Steel\") sounded \"majestic\". It was then decided that Majesty would be the band's name.\nThe trio then set out to fill the remaining positions in the group. Petrucci asked his high school bandmate Kevin Moore to play the keyboard. After he accepted the position, another friend from home, Chris Collins, was recruited as lead vocalist after band members heard him sing a cover of \"Queen of the Reich\" by Queensr\u00ffche. During this time, Portnoy, Petrucci, and Myung's hectic schedules forced them to abandon their studies to concentrate on their music, as they did not feel they could learn more in college. Moore also left his college, SUNY Fredonia, to concentrate on the band.\nThe beginning months of 1986 were filled with various concert dates in and around the New York City area. During this time, the band recorded a collection of demos, titled \"The Majesty Demos\". The initial run of 1,000 sold out within six months, and dubbed copies of the cassette became popular within the progressive metal scene. The \"Majesty Demos\" are still available in their original tape format today, despite being released officially on CD, through Portnoy's YtseJam Records (and on InsideOut in 2022, after YtseJam Records was shut down).\nIn November 1986, Chris Collins left the band after a few months of writing and performing together. After a year of trying to find a replacement, Charlie Dominici, who was far older and more experienced than anyone else in the band, successfully auditioned for the group. With the stability that Dominici's appointment brought to Majesty, they began to increase the number of shows played in the New York City area, gaining a considerable amount of exposure.\nShortly after hiring Dominici, a Las Vegas group also named Majesty threatened legal action for intellectual property infringement related to the use of their name, so the band was forced to come up with a new one. Various possibilities were proposed and tested, among them Glasser, Magus, and M1, which were all rejected, though the band did go as Glasser for about a week, with poor reactions from fans. Eventually, Portnoy's father suggested the name Dream Theater, the name of a small theater in Monterey, California, and the name stuck.\n\"When Dream and Day Unite\" (1988\u20131990).\nWith their new name and band stability, Dream Theater concentrated on writing more material while playing more concerts in New York and in neighboring states. This eventually attracted the attention of Mechanic Records, a division of MCA. Dream Theater signed their first record contract with Mechanic on June 23, 1988, and set out to record its debut album. The band recorded the album at Kajem Victory Studios in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. Recording the basic tracks took about ten days, and the entire album was completed in about three weeks.\n\"When Dream and Day Unite\" was released in March 1989 to far less fanfare than the band had anticipated. Mechanic ended up breaking the majority of the financial promises they had made to Dream Theater before signing their contract, so the band was restricted to playing around New York City. The promotional tour for the album consisted of just five concerts, all of which were relatively local. The first show was at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York opening for the classic rock power trio Zebra.\nAfter the fourth show, Charlie Dominici was let go because the band was starting to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a frontman. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was allowed to perform one last time. It would be nearly two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.\nAddition of James LaBrie and \"Images and Words\" (1991\u20131993).\nFollowing Dominici's departure, Dream Theater fought successfully to be released from their contract with Mechanic and set about auditioning singers and writing material for their next album. In their search for a new singer, they auditioned over 200 people, among them former Fates Warning frontman John Arch. Arch ultimately decided that his commitments were more important and he opted not to join the band. On June 9, 1990, at a gig at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as their new singer after playing half the set as an instrumental band. Stone had successfully recorded demos with Dream Theater, but he was fired following a single, ill-fated live performance. According to Mike Portnoy, Stone moved around the stage in a rather odd manner, seemingly doing a bad impression of Bruce Dickinson. Additionally, he shouted \"Scream for me Long Beach!\" several times throughout the show (Dickinson can be heard saying this on Iron Maiden's live album \"Live After Death\"), although they were performing in Bay Shore. The audience was immediately turned off by the new singer. It was five months before Dream Theater played another show, this time all-instrumental (under the name YtseJam). Until 1991, the band remained focused in an attempt to hire another singer and writing additional music. It was during this period that they wrote the majority of what would become \"Images and Words\" (1992).\nIn January 1991, the band received a demo tape from Kevin James LaBrie, of glam metal band Winter Rose. The band had received the tape just before they were about to commit to another singer. The band was so impressed by his demo that he was flown from Canada to New York for an audition. LaBrie jammed on three songs with the band and was immediately hired to fill the vocalist position. Once recruited, LaBrie decided to drop his first name to avoid confusion with the other Kevin in the band. For the next few months, the band returned to playing live shows (still mostly around New York City), while working on vocal parts for the music written before acquiring LaBrie. Derek Shulman and ATCO Records (now East West), a division of Elektra Records, signed Dream Theater to a seven-album contract based on a three-song demo (later made available as \"The Atco Demos\" through the Dream Theater fan club).\nThe first album to be recorded under their new record contract was \"Images and Words\" (1992). For promotion, the label released a CD single and video clip for the song \"Another Day\", but neither made significant commercial impact. The song \"Pull Me Under\", however, managed to garner a high level of radio airplay without any organized promotion from the band or their label. In response, ATCO produced a video clip for \"Pull Me Under\", which saw heavy rotation on MTV. A third video clip was produced for \"Take the Time\", but it was not nearly as successful as \"Pull Me Under\".\nThe success of \"Pull Me Under\", combined with relentless touring throughout the U.S. and Japan, caused \"Images and Words\" to achieve gold record certification in the States and platinum status in Japan. A tour of Europe followed in 1993, which included a show at London's famed Marquee Club. This show was recorded and released as \"Live at the Marquee\", Dream Theater's first official live album. Additionally, a video compilation of their Japanese concerts (mixed in with documentary-style footage of the off-stage portion of the tour) was released as \"Images and Words: Live in Tokyo\".\n\"Awake\" and Kevin Moore's departure (1994\u20131995).\nEager to work on fresh material, Dream Theater retreated to the studio in May 1994. \"Awake\", Dream Theater's third studio album, was released on October 4, 1994. Shortly before the album was mixed, Moore had announced to the rest of the band that he would be quitting Dream Theater to concentrate on his musical interests, since he was no longer interested in touring or the style of music which Dream Theater performed. As a result, the band had to scramble to find a replacement keyboardist before a tour could be considered.\nFormer Yngwie Malmsteen and Dio keyboardist Jens Johansson, who would go on to become a member of Stratovarius, was among the biggest names to audition, but the band members were eager to fill the position with keyboardist Jordan Rudess. Portnoy and Petrucci had come across Rudess in Keyboard Magazine, where he was recognized as \"best new talent\" in the readers' poll. The two invited him to play a trial gig with the band at the Concrete Foundations Forum in Burbank, California. Although the show was a success, and Rudess was asked to fill the keyboardist position permanently, he opted to tour with The Dixie Dregs instead, since it granted him more personal latitude. Dream Theater hired fellow Berklee alumnus Derek Sherinian, who had previously toured and recorded with Alice Cooper and Kiss, to fill in for the \"Waking Up the World Tour\". By the conclusion of the tour, the band decided to take Sherinian on as Moore's full-time replacement.\n\"A Change of Seasons\", \"Falling into Infinity\" (1995\u20131998).\nOnce again finding themselves with a new member, the band did not immediately start working on new material. Fans around the world, united on the YtseJam Mailing List (the most popular form of communication between Dream Theater fans at that point), had begun to put pressure on the band to officially release the song \"A Change of Seasons\". This had been written in 1989 and was intended to be a part of \"Images and Words\", but at almost 17 minutes, it was deemed too long for studio placement. It had nevertheless been performed live by the band, who continued to revise it in the years leading up to 1995.\nThe petition was successful, and the group entered BearTracks Studios in New York in May 1995 to rewrite and record the now 23-minute-long song with Sherinian contributing significantly to the final product. The band released \"A Change of Seasons\" as an EP along with a collection of cover songs from a live show recorded at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London earlier that year.\nAfter a brief run of small concerts and a short break, the band released a special Christmas CD through their official fan club, consisting of rare live tracks recorded during the band's early years. They continued releasing a new CD each Christmas until 2005.\nMeanwhile, there were several changes at East West, and Dream Theater's main contact within the label was fired. As a result, the new team at the company were unaccustomed to the relationship Dream Theater had with former East West personnel, and they pressured them to write an album that was more accessible. In mid-1997, they entered the studio to write their next album. In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a more mainstream sound, East West recruited writer/producer Desmond Child to work with Petrucci on polishing the lyrics to his song \"You or Me\". The whole band substantially reworked the song, and it appeared on the album as \"You Not Me\" with a chorus that bore little resemblance to the original. Child also had a noticeable impact on the album, with a shift towards less complex and more radio-friendly compositions.\nThe band wrote almost two CDs worth of material, including a 20-minute-long follow-up to the \"Images and Words\" song \"Metropolis\u2013Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper\". The label, however, did not allow the release of a double album because it felt that a 140-minute record would not be well received by the general public. James LaBrie also felt that the CD should be a single disc. The unused songs were later released in the YtseJam Records release \"The Falling into Infinity Demos\".\nThe material that made it onto the album proper was released as \"Falling into Infinity\", which received a mixed reception from fans who were more familiar with the band's earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as \"Hollow Years\" and \"You Not Me\" prompted some to believe it was the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for \"5 Years in a Livetime\" that he had been so discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.\nDuring the European leg of the Touring Into Infinity world tour, two shows were recorded for a live album titled \"Once in a LIVEtime\", in France and The Netherlands. The album was released at around the same time as the video \"5 Years in a Livetime\", which covered the years from Kevin Moore's departure to the \"Falling into Infinity\" promotional tour.\nDerek Sherinian's departure, addition of Jordan Rudess, and \"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\" (1999\u20132000).\nIn 1997, Magna Carta Records' Mike Varney invited Portnoy to assemble a progressive \"supergroup\" to work on an album, which would become the first in a long string of side-projects for the members of Dream Theater. The lineup consisted of Portnoy on drums, Petrucci on guitar, Tony Levin on bass, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who had finished with the Dixie Dregs. The band assumed the name Liquid Tension Experiment, and would act as a medium through which Portnoy and Petrucci could once again court Rudess to join Dream Theater. In 1999, he accepted an offer to become the third full-time Dream Theater keyboardist, replacing Sherinian.\nWith yet another new member, Dream Theater entered BearTracks Studio once again to write and record their next album. As a result of an ultimatum from Portnoy, the label gave the band complete creative control. The band began by revisiting the follow-up to \"Metropolis\u2013Part I\", which had been partially written during the \"Falling into Infinity\" sessions but which had not been completed or used on that album. They decided to expand the 21-minute song into a complete concept album, with a story revolving around themes such as reincarnation, murder and betrayal. To avoid stirring up the fan base, a tight veil of secrecy enveloped the writing and recording process. The only things fans were privy to before its release were a track list that had been leaked against the band's wishes, and a release date. In 1999, \"\" was released to high critical acclaim, being lauded as the band's magnum opus, despite only reaching No.\u00a073 on the US album chart.\nThe album was mixed by David Bottrill, but only a few of his mixes made it on the final album. The bulk was remixed by Kevin Shirley, who had produced \"Falling into Infinity\". The rest of the mixes can be heard in the band's official bootleg \"The Making of Scenes from a Memory\".\nThe subsequent Metropolis 2000 world tour was by far their largest to date, and took over a year to complete. The concerts reflected the theatrical aspect of the album, with the first half of each show comprising the entire \"Scenes From a Memory\" album accompanied by a film showing dramatized portions of the story projected onto a video screen behind the stage. For the last date of the North American leg, at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, actors were hired to play characters in the story, and a gospel choir was enlisted to perform in some sections of the performance. The show was filmed and eventually released in early 2001 as the band's first DVD release, \"\", which was certified Gold in the US on November 8, 2002.\nSince several songs from the second half of the four-hour show had to be cut from the DVD to save space, the band also released the full show on the live CD \"Live Scenes from New York\". The original cover depicted one of Dream Theater's early logos (the \"Images and Words\"-era burning heart, modeled on the Sacred Heart of Christ) modified to show an apple (as in \"Big Apple\") instead of the heart, and the New York skyline, including the twin towers of the World Trade Center, in the flame above it. In an unfortunate coincidence, the album was released on the same date as the September 11 attacks. The album was quickly recalled by the band and was re-released with revised artwork later, although the few copies which were sold with the original artwork have since become rare collector's items.\n\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" (2001\u20132002).\nPutting the whole ordeal behind them, Dream Theater once again entered BearTracks Studios to record their sixth studio album. Four years after they first petitioned East West to allow them to release a double album, they finally got their chance with \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\". The first disc consisted of five tracks of 7\u201313 minutes in length, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, which remains to date the longest song Dream Theater has written. Many of the song's melodies and musical themes originated in an instrumental piece, written by Rudess, which would eventually become the song's \"Overture\". Those themes were then expanded by the rest of the band to form individual chapters in a complete story.\n\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" was very well received by critics and the press. It was the most publicized of Dream Theater's albums since \"Awake\", debuting on the Billboard charts at No.\u00a046 and the Billboard Internet charts at No.\u00a01. The subsequent world tour included a select few special \"album cover\" gigs (see Cover songs section, below), in which they played Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" and Iron Maiden's \"The Number of the Beast\" in their entirety.\n\"Train of Thought\" (2003\u20132004).\nIn 2003, Dream Theater entered the studio to write and record another album. Unlike \"Scenes from a Memory\", which had been written and recorded simultaneously in the studio, the band took a different approach by setting aside three weeks for writing prior to recording. In the middle of the recording sessions for the album, a special tour with two other progressive metal bands, Queensr\u00ffche and Fates Warning, was undertaken in North America. Referred to in the band's promotional material as the \"Escape from the Studio American tour\", the tour featured Queensr\u00ffche and Dream Theater as co-headlining acts with Fates Warning performing supporting act duties. As a finale for each concert there was an extended encore in which both Dream Theater and Queensr\u00ffche performed together on stage simultaneously, often playing cover songs.\nAfter the tour, Dream Theater returned to the studio to finish the recording of their seventh album, \"Train of Thought\". In contrast to the extended songs of their previous album, the band aimed to write a more song-oriented album, inspired in part by covering the \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Number of the Beast\" albums on their previous concert tour. Although the album was a critical success, its more straightforward metal sound alienated many of the band's existing fans, who had been attracted by the band's roots in progressive rock. During this time they also re-released their first two live videos for the first time on DVD, titled \"Images and Words: Live in Tokyo/5 Years in a Livetime\" on June 29, 2004, through Rhino Records. This release was certified Platinum on March 22, 2006.\nAnother world tour followed, named the Train of Thought Tour. A modest North American tour was completed by the two bands, which Dream Theater supported Yes, a band that had been a major influence on their own musical style. After this Dream Theater continued to tour the world with their so-called \"An Evening With Dream Theater\" shows. The latter were captured in another live CD/DVD release, recorded at the famous Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan on their Train of Thought Tour. \"Live at Budokan\" was released on October 5, 2004, and was certified Platinum in the US on January 26, 2005.\n\"Octavarium\" (2005\u20132006).\nAfter their \"Train of Thought\" promotional tour, Dream Theater entered the Hit Factory studios in NYC to record their eighth album. They would become the final group to use the famous studio, which closed on April 1, 2005.\n\"Octavarium\" was released on June 7, 2005, and took the band's sound in yet another new direction. Its eight songs included a continuation of Portnoy's \"Twelve-step\" saga (\"The Root of All Evil\", steps 6\u20137 in the 12-step plan), as well as the title track, a musically versatile 24-minute epic rivaling \"A Change of Seasons\". \"Octavarium\" received mixed reviews from fans and has been the subject of spirited debate. \"Octavarium\" was the last album under their seven-album deal with Elektra Records, which had inherited the contract upon its absorption of EastWest Records.\nDream Theater started the Octavarium Tour extensively throughout 2005 and 2006 to celebrate their 20th Anniversary as a band, including a headlining spot on Gigantour alongside Megadeth and put together by frontman Dave Mustaine, also featuring Fear Factory, Nevermore and Symphony X. During a show on August 2, 2005, in Dallas, the band paid tribute to Pantera's late guitarist Dimebag Darrell by performing the song \"Cemetery Gates\" as an encore. In addition, was the unexpected appearance of fellow musicians Russell Allen (Symphony X vocalist), Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory vocalist) and Dave Mustaine (Megadeth vocalist/guitarist), who joined the band on stage to perform parts of the song.\nDream Theater later departed from Gigantour 2005 a few dates before it ended and continued on with their own series of concerts, several of which were recorded and released for the band's fanclubs. The 20th anniversary tour concluded with a show at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on April 1, 2006. Though the show had minimal promotion, it was sold out days after tickets were made available. This show, which was recorded for a CD/DVD called \"Score\" released on August 29, 2006, through Rhino Records, featured songs from the band's entire history, as well a second half accompanied by a full symphony orchestra (the \"Octavarium Orchestra\"). This release was the band's third Live DVD release to be certified Platinum in the US on October 11, 2006.\n\"Systematic Chaos\" and \"Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)\" (2006\u20132008).\nFor the first time in their career, the band took the summer off after their show at Radio City Music Hall. In September 2006, Dream Theater entered Avatar Studios to record their follow-up to \"Octavarium\" with studio engineer Paul Northfield. Dream Theater's ninth studio album, \"Systematic Chaos\", was released on June 5, 2007. The record marked their first with new label Roadrunner Records, which in 2010 became a wholly owned subsidiary of the band's previous label Atlantic Records. Roadrunner implemented increased promotion for the album and \"Systematic Chaos\" reached number 19 on the \"Billboard\" 200. It also oversaw the release of a video for \"Constant Motion\" on July 14, the band's first music video since Hollow Years in 1997. The album was bookended by the two parts of \"In the Presence of Enemies\", written and conceived as a single piece but split into two halves for the purposes of the album. The other six tracks included the most recent part of Portnoy's continuing Twelve-step Suite with the song \"Repentance\".\nIn 2007, the first version of Rich Wilson's \"Lifting Shadows\", an authorized history of the band's first twenty years, was released.\nThe 2007\u201308 Chaos in Motion Tour started off in Italy. Dream Theater played in the Gods of Metal concert on June 3, 2007, as well as various other European festivals including the Netherlands' Fields of Rock Festival, UK's Download Festival, the French festival Hellfest Summer Open Air alongside Megadeth, Korn, Mastodon and Slayer. The North American leg of the tour began on July 24 in San Diego, California and wrapped up on August 26 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They played with opening acts Redemption and Into Eternity. The Chaos In Motion Tour continued for the rest of the year and into 2008, playing shows in Asia, South America and, for the first time, Australia.\nOn April 1, 2008, a two-disc compilation album titled \"Greatest Hit (...and 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)\" was released by the band. The title jokingly references the song \"Pull Me Under\", the band's only significant radio hit. It also includes three song re-mixes from their second album, \"Images and Words\", five edited versions of previously released songs, and a track from a single B-side. Unlike most greatest hits compilations, Dream Theater was actively involved with the album, coming up with the track listing that they felt best represented their musical careers.\nAfter the release of \"Greatest Hit\", drummer Mike Portnoy organized a new tour called Progressive Nation 2008. Unlike previous Dream Theater tours, performances were held in cities that they had not visited before (such as Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) or cities they had not played in for several years. This tour also marked the first time, since the release of Images and Words, where the group performed in small venues and performance halls.\nIn September 2008, the band released a DVD set called \"Chaos in Motion 2007\u20132008\", featuring songs recorded at several shows during the \"Chaos in Motion\" tour.\n\"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\" (2008\u20132010).\nOn October 7, 2008, Dream Theater returned to Avatar Studios to begin work on their tenth album, resuming their relationship with Paul Northfield to engineer and mix the record. The album, titled \"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\", was released on June 23, 2009. In addition to the standard CD, the album was made available on vinyl LP, as well as a 3-disc Special Edition CD that includes the full album, a CD of instrumental mixes of the album and a CD of six cover songs from artists such as Queen and Rainbow. On July 1, 2009, the album debuted at No.\u00a06 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, with first week sales totalling 40,285, making their highest entry on the chart. The album featured \"The Shattered Fortress\", the last in Mike Portnoy's series of songs about his 12-step recovery from alcoholism, as well as the song \"The Best of Times\", described by Portnoy as \"a real heavy personal subject about my dad who passed away during the making of the album ... He was battling cancer throughout its making.\"\nThe band also embarked on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour's first performances in Europe. Opeth, Unexpect and Bigelf supported Dream Theater in Europe, while Zappa Plays Zappa, Pain of Salvation, and Beardfish were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands that filled the vacated slots for the Progressive Nation 2009 tour in North America were Bigelf and Scale the Summit with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.\nAfter the Progressive Nation Tour, Dream Theater re-entered the studio to write and record a brand new instrumental track for inclusion on the \"God of War III\" soundtrack EP \"\". The track, titled \"Raw Dog\" (\"God (of) War\" reversed), marked the first time that the band has written and recorded an exclusive track for an outside project. \"Raw Dog\" includes the first ever commercially recorded harpejji track, performed by Jordan Rudess, as well as Dream Theater's final recorded performance with Mike Portnoy on drums prior to his departure from the band in 2010. In December 2009, during their \"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\" tour whilst visiting Australia, Dream Theater appeared with one support act, Pain of Salvation. In March 2010, they toured South America with Bigelf. Afterwards, during the summer of 2010, Dream Theater supported Iron Maiden on the US and Canadian legs of their summer tour which were the last shows DT played during 2010.\nMike Portnoy's departure and arrival of Mike Mangini (2010\u20132011).\nOn September 8, 2010, drummer Mike Portnoy announced that he would be leaving Dream Theater, citing better relationships in other projects, burnout, and his desire for a break as reasons. Elaborating on the situation for MusicRadar, John Petrucci revealed that originally, Portnoy did not want to leave the band; he only wanted to take a five-year break. He eventually dropped this number to around one year. Only after the rest of the band rejected his proposal did Portnoy decide to quit.\nAfter Portnoy left Dream Theater, relationships between him and his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails. However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him. Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie \"disrespectful\" for comments LaBrie made during an interview, stating that Dream Theater were \"not sad at all\" that Portnoy was no longer a band member. By July 2011, LaBrie had not remained in touch with Portnoy. Portnoy later stated that he would rejoin the band in a heartbeat, stating: \"They are the ones that have closed the door on it. I've only needed a break, and I've had that break. So I'm ready, willing and able. But I honestly don't think they ever will; they've closed their door on it and I think they're too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn't count on it. But my door is always open.\"\nA little more than a month after Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater began auditioning for a new drummer in New York City. The drummers who auditioned were Mike Mangini, Derek Roddy, Thomas Lang, Virgil Donati, Marco Minnemann, Aquiles Priester, and Peter Wildoer. Fates Warning drummer Bobby Jarzombek was also invited to audition, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts. The candidates were notified whether they had been chosen on November 5; however, the results of the audition were not made public until April 2011 via a three-part YouTube documentary series called \"The Spirit Carries On\". In the last episode of the series, it was revealed that Mangini was the drummer selected. Petrucci later explained that Portnoy approached them to rejoin after they had selected Mangini; Mangini however, by this time had left his job as a professor at Berklee and committed to Dream Theater full-time, so Portnoy's offer was rebuffed.\n\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" (2011\u20132012).\nDream Theater entered Cove City Sound Studios to begin working on a new album on January 3, 2011. Writing was completed on March 2 and done without Mangini. On April 14, LaBrie began tracking vocals and by June 28, the album's mixing and mastering by Andy Wallace were finished. Released worldwide on September 12 and in the United States on September 13, \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" debuted at number one in some countries and attained the eighth position on the \"Billboard\" 200, the band's second ever top ten debut position on that chart after \"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\". Although the album received mixed reviews, it won numerous awards from music publications and its lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2012 Grammy Awards, representing the band's first ever Grammy nomination.\nDream Theater kicked off their tour in support of \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" on July 4, 2011, in Rome, Italy. The second leg of the tour took place in North America, where the band headlined with Trivium. After a short break to conclude 2011, the band returned to Europe with Periphery, to Asia with Andy McKee, to North America with Crimson Projekct and then to South America for the final leg of the tour. On August 19 and 20, two shows were recorded at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a live Blu-ray release by Over the Edge Productions. After a six-month delay, \"Live at Luna Park\" was released on November 5, 2013, by Eagle Rock Entertainment. The tour concluded on September 1, 2012, in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.\nOn December 25, 2013, at 06:00:00 EST, as a holiday gift to the fans, Dream Theater released a free electronic 2-CD set of live tracks that were not recorded for \"Live at Luna Park\" from their 2011\u20132012 tour in FLAC format via BitTorrent. The release date and time were an allusion to their 1994 song \"6:00\", the intro of which contains a repeated sample of the line \"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning\" as spoken by Helena Carroll in \"The Dead\".\n\"Dream Theater\" (2013\u20132014).\nWriting for Dream Theater's twelfth studio album commenced on A Dramatic Tour of Events. During soundchecks, the band would jam and record their ideas, and John Petrucci would bring in material he wrote independently. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band took a break but continued writing. They reconvened in early 2013 to enter the studio.\nIn December 2012, Dream Theater re-signed with Roadrunner Records. The band's self-titled twelfth album was released on September 23, 2013, as part of the new agreement with Roadrunner. The album sold more than 34,000 copies in its first week and landed on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at No. 7, the band's third consecutive top 10 album. In addition, the album cracked the top 10 in 24 countries including Japan, Germany, Argentina, The Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Australia and United Kingdom. The single \"The Enemy Inside\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards, marking the band's second Grammy nomination.\nDream Theater's seventh live album, \"Live at Luna Park\", was released on November 5, 2013.\nOn July 8, 2014, Dream Theater released \"The Studio Albums 1992\u20132011\", a box set spanning all albums from \"Images and Words\" to \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\".\nOn September 30, 2014, Dream Theater released their eighth live album and film, \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\", which was recorded live from The Boston Opera House on March 25, 2014. During this concert, the band were joined by the Berklee World Strings and the Berklee Concert Choir, directed by Eren Ba\u015fbu\u011f, for the second half of the set. The set list for the tour featured the entire second half of \"Awake\", in celebration of the album's 20th anniversary, including the song \"Space-Dye Vest\", which had never been performed live. The set list closed with a performance of four songs from \"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\", in celebration of the album's 15th anniversary. The Along for the Ride Tour concluded on October 30, 2014.\n\"The Astonishing\" and \"Images and Words\" anniversary tour (2015\u20132017).\nOn January 6, 2014, John Petrucci said that Dream Theater were already \"planting seeds for album No. 13\". He commented: \"There are some song ideas and little things like that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One of the great things about this career is that you have the opportunity every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying.\"\nThe band headed into the studio in February 2015 to record its thirteenth album. The album, titled \"The Astonishing\" was released on January 29, 2016. It is a concept album set in a dystopian future society devoid of real music, centering on a conflict between a group of rebels and an oppressive empire. Two singles, \"The Gift of Music\" and \"Moment of Betrayal\" were released on December 3, 2015, and January 22, 2016, respectively.\nThroughout 2016, Dream Theater went on a tour titled The Astonishing Live to support the album. They played the album in its entirety, with an intermission between the two acts, only playing songs from earlier albums on occasions later in the tour. Their performance was accompanied by a visual representation of the story on background screens. The band also made it a point to play at indoor theater halls such as Radio City Music Hall. In 2017, Dream Theater went on another tour, titled Images, Words &amp; Beyond, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of \"Images and Words\". Each night they performed the album in its entirety, as well as \"A Change of Seasons\", which was originally written during the \"Images and Words\" sessions, and other selections from their catalogue.\n\"Distance Over Time\" and \"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\" anniversary tour (2017\u20132019).\nIn a May 2017 interview with \"Rockbook\", frontman James LaBrie talked about the style of the band's fourteenth studio album: \"It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment. [...] But if along the way we feel that there is another album we should recognize once again, then we'll do it.\" In December 2017, Dream Theater announced that they had signed a worldwide longterm deal with Sony Music via Sony's progressive music label imprint Inside Out, for the release of the album.\nThe album was written in June and July 2018, and features pieces written collectively and lyrics written by Petrucci, LaBrie, Myung and, for the first time ever, Mangini. In anticipation of the album, the band launched a \"treasure hunt\" in the form of an alternate reality game, where participants would search for various clues across the internet. The game ultimately led to a site revealing the title of the album to be \"Distance Over Time\". The site also revealed the cover art for the album, its scheduled release date in February 2019, as well as dates for a tour in North America celebrating the 20th anniversary of the band's fifth album \"\". On November 6, 2018, a press release from Inside Out officially announced \"Distance Over Time\", with a release date of February 22, 2019. Upon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim.\n\"A View from the Top of the World\" and \"Lost Not Forgotten Archives\" (2020\u20132023).\nIn April 2020, Metal Addicts reported that Dream Theater was expected to begin working on their fifteenth studio album in 2021. About the direction of the album, guitarist John Petrucci stated in an August 2020 interview with Ultimate Guitar: \"The eight-string project with Ernie Ball Music Man is something we are working on and hoping to have developed as this year goes on. I'm hoping that on the next Dream Theater record I'll be able to explore that.\" This would later be confirmed in an interview with Ultimate Guitar in February 2021. Also in August 2020, Petrucci also told Spain's \"Metal Hammer\" that the band would begin working on their new album in the fall. Recording sessions started at DTHQ (the band's own studio) in October 2020. The band was confirmed on November 27, 2020, to be writing the songs, while LaBrie was writing his parts back home in Canada. When asked in an interview, Petrucci said that the writing sessions were \"off to a great start\".\nPetrucci released his first solo album in fifteen years, \"Terminal Velocity\", on August 28, 2020. The album was recorded at DTHQ earlier the same year. Its recording sessions marked the first time in ten years that Petrucci worked with his former Dream Theater bandmate Mike Portnoy, who played drums on all tracks from the album. This collaboration led to speculation of a Dream Theater reunion with Portnoy, which was denied by Petrucci, who told \"Metal Hammer\": \"I understand where people are coming from with that. One of the concerns I had, a little bit \u2013 not musically at all \u2013 but about Mike, is I didn't want people to get the wrong idea.\"\nOn November 27, 2020, Dream Theater released their ninth live album, \"Distant Memories \u2013 Live in London\", recorded at Hammersmith Apollo prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 1, 2020, the band released the single \"The Holiday Spirit Carries On\", a medley of holiday songs played in a progressive metal style, exclusively through Bandcamp. The title references the fan-favorite song \"The Spirit Carries On\" from \"Scenes from a Memory\". The proceeds from sales of the single benefited the band's road crew. On January 30, 2021, Dream Theater held a special streaming event titled \"Images, Words &amp; Beyond Live in Japan\", an online broadcast of a concert from the band's 2017 tour, which was originally recorded for Japanese television.\nOn May 5, 2021, Dream Theater announced a series of albums titled the \"Lost Not Forgotten Archives\", the first release of which is the second set of the \"Images, Words &amp; Beyond Live in Japan\" concert. The band said that the \"Lost Not Forgotten Archives\" will eventually include every YtseJam Records release on CD, vinyl and digital formats, along with previously unreleased archival material.\nDream Theater teased the new album on July 26, 2021, revealing that it would have seven songs, with more details to be released on July 28, 2021. On July 28, it was announced that the album was titled \"A View from the Top of the World\", and it was released on October 22, 2021. The album was supported by five singles, \"The Alien\", \"Invisible Monster\", \"Awaken the Master\", \"Transcending Time\" and \"Answering the Call\", and music videos were released for each of them. The band promoted the album with a concert tour of Europe from April 20 to June 1, 2022. They had previously announced a tour of North America from late October to mid-December 2021 on the same day as the album, but announced on September 27 that it had been rescheduled to early 2022, due to safety concerns related to the COVID pandemic. The rescheduled tour began on February 2, 2022, in Mesa, Arizona, with Arch Echo as a special guest.\nIn February 2022, rumors emerged of James LaBrie lip syncing during the North American leg of Dream Theater's Top of the World Tour as fan recordings from the tour were posted online. Specifically, fans pointed to the post-chorus section of the song \"Bridges In The Sky\" as evidence of LaBrie lip syncing to a pre-recorded vocal track. LaBrie addressed the controversy onstage during the band's performance in Houston, Texas, on March 18, 2022, denying the allegations and claiming he has never lip synced.\n\"A View from the Top of the World\"'s lead single \"The Alien\" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2022 Grammy Awards, marking Dream Theater's third nomination and first ever Grammy Award.\nThe band started the inaugural run of Dreamsonic, Dream Theater's own traveling progressive metal festival which also featured Devin Townsend and Animals as Leaders, on June 16, 2023. As described by John Petrucci: \"Dreamsonic promises to be a reoccurring musical event that will deliver history-making nights of amazing music for many years to come!\" The tour ended on July 26.\nDeparture of Mike Mangini, return of Mike Portnoy and \"Parasomnia\" (2023\u2013present).\nIn August 2023, John Petrucci said that studio time for their sixteenth album would begin in late 2023, though James LaBrie later said it would be more likely the beginning of 2024. On October 25, 2023, Dream Theater announced the departure of Mike Mangini as they were reuniting with Mike Portnoy. The reunion resulted from years of gradual reconciliation between Portnoy and individual members of the band, as he disclosed in an interview with Drumeo:\n\"Starting with John Petrucci maybe five, six, seven years ago or so, we just reconnected\u2014John decided he wanted to do a solo album and he asked me to play on it\u2014So I played on John's solo album. And then a few months later, we did a Liquid Tension Experiment album with John and Jordan. So that brought the three of us back together\u2014And then I think the final piece was me reconnecting with James LaBrie, 'cause James and I hadn't spoken for over a decade. I went to see Dream Theater play [at the Beacon Theatre] in New York, I guess around 2022, and that was my first time seeing James in over a decade. And literally, I'm not exaggerating, within five seconds of seeing each other, it was hugs, kisses and it was like any of the drama and bullshit that happened during all of those years of the split, it just melted away immediately.\"\nIn a group interview with \"Rolling Stone\", James LaBrie addressed his and Portnoy's reconciliation at the 2022 show, stating: \"Mike and I are both very emotional and passionate people. And I think that led to the reason for us not coming together until we did. But as soon as I saw him, like he said, I came out of my dressing room, I saw him, and I was like, 'Come here.' And I gave him a fucking hug. And that was it.\" Petrucci added in the interview that \"When Mike left the band, it was traumatic for all of us. We had to figure out how we were going to move our career forward. And those years that went by, they were also healing years because you don\u2019t just have something like that happen, and all of a sudden, you're all best buddies a week later. There's some trauma there that had to heal. Thirteen years was enough time for that to happen and be like, 'Hey, you know what, man? We love each other like we're brothers.'\"\nMangini spoke amicably about his departure: \"my place was not to fill all the roles that Mike held in the band. I was to play the drums in order to help the band carry on. My main role of keeping our live show working tightly on a nightly basis was an intense and rewarding experience. Thankfully, I got to experience playing music with these iconic musicians, as well as some fun times laced with humor.\" With Portnoy's return the band announced plans to record its first studio album with him in fifteen years.\nOn November 17, 2023, the band announced former lead vocalist Charlie Dominici's death at the age of 72 that month from unspecified causes.\nIn February 2024, Mike Portnoy posted pictures from DTHQ on his Instagram account, confirming that the new Dream Theater album was \"officially underway\".\nOn April 2, 2024, John Petrucci and Portnoy announced that all of the writing and the drum tracks were completed. John Petrucci later posted a video on YouTube on May 1, 2024, confirming that the guitar tracks were completed. On June 26, 2024, Jordan Rudess announced on his Instagram that all the keyboards had been recorded. On July 30, 2024, James LaBrie posted on his Instagram, a photo of himself in the studio with the caption \"Vocals\" with a green check mark, and the hashtag \"DT16\", signifying the vocals had been completed for the new album.\nOn October 10, 2024, Dream Theater released \"Night Terror\" as the first single for their sixteenth studio album \"Parasomnia\", which was released on February 7, 2025. The album was highly anticipated, with several publications (including \"Loudwire\", \"Stereogum\" and \"Ultimate Guitar\") naming it in their lists of the most anticipated albums of 2025.\nControversy surrounded \"Parasomnia\"'s visual art direction created by artist Hugh Syme. Syme was accused of double-selling artwork, as a piece of artwork contained in the \"Parasomnia\" deluxe edition appeared identical to a piece of Syme's artwork on Orion's \"The Lightbringers\", released six months prior. Additionally, the \"Parasomnia\" artwork also raised questions regarding Syme's possible usage of generative artificial intelligence tools and the integrity of the album's visual representation. Some fans and reviewers criticized the album's artwork for containing many mistakes common with AI-generated imagery, such as hands with the incorrect number of fingers and errors in lighting and shadow directions. Syme was also scrutinized for his possible usage of AI-generated imagery for Rush's anniversary collection \"Rush 50\" around the same time, which further fueled speculation.\nNearly six months after \"Parasomnia\"'s release, the band released \"Parasomnia - The Graphic Album\" in partnership with Z2 Comics. A companion book to \"Parasomnia\", \"Parasomnia - The Graphic Album\" features visual interpretations for all eight songs.\nDream Theater were spotlighted on an episode of Ernie Ball's \"Big Sound\" released August 22, 2025. Filmed at DTHQ, the episode featured live, in-studio performances of three full-length songs: \"Night Terror\", \"Panic Attack\", and \"Midnight Messiah\".\nThe Parasomnia Tour kicked off in Reading, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 2025. In addition to performing the \"Parasomnia\" album in its entirety, the band confirmed they would also perform the epic \"A Change of Seasons\" on the tour. In an Instagram post, Mike Portnoy speculated this tour cycle would likely be the last time the band ever performed \"A Change of Seasons\".\nOn November 7, 2025, \"Parasomnia\"'s lead single \"Night Terror\" received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 2026 Grammy Awards, marking the band's fourth career Grammy nomination and first ever Grammy nomination for Mike Portnoy.\nA new Dream Theater live album and Blu-ray, titled \"Quaranti\u00e8me: Live \u00e0 Paris\", was released on November 28, 2025. It was recorded live at the Adidas Arena in Paris, France on November 23, 2024 during the band's 40th anniversary tour of Europe. To mark the release, a special one-night showing of \"Quaranti\u00e8me: Live \u00e0 Paris\" ran at AMC Theatres in select cities on November 17, 2025.\nA week prior to \"Quaranti\u00e8me: Live \u00e0 Paris\", the band released two box sets, with \"The Studio Albums 1992\u20132016\" as a collection of CD reissues for all twelve of their studio albums from \"Images and Words\" to \"The Astonishing\", while \"Dream Theater Vol. 3\" serves as the final installment in the band's vinyl reissues series, containing reissues of all their studio albums from \"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\" to \"The Astonishing\" on that format.\nLive performances.\nThroughout their career, Dream Theater's live shows have gradually become bigger, longer and more diverse. Prior to Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater \"rotated\" its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows in the same area would see few, if any, songs repeated. Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours. The practice was abandoned with Portnoy away from the band, and the setlist remained static even after his return on the 40th anniversary tour, but Portnoy noted that the practice of rotating setlists would return eventually, and in July 2025 James LaBrie disclosed that it has been fully reinstated.\nThe band's full world tours, since \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\", have predominantly been \"Evening with...\" tours, in which the band performs for at least three hours without an opening act. Until 2012, such tours did not contain an intermission, but every tour since the Along for the Ride Tour in 2013\u20132014 until the Distance Over Time Tour had. The show that was recorded for \"Live Scenes From New York\" was well over three hours in length, and resulted in Portnoy almost being hospitalized after acquiring severe food poisoning from the food he ate before the show.\nDashes of humor, casualness, and improvisation are often attached to Dream Theater's concert. For example, the performance of \"A Change of Seasons\" on \"Live Scenes from New York\" features changes to a series of instrumental breaks, with Myung playing a baseball organ melody, Petrucci playing the opening theme to \"The Simpsons\", and Rudess playing the ragtime section of \"When the Water Breaks\" from \"Liquid Tension Experiment 2\" (the latter is also heard on the album \"Live at Budokan\"). Several songs included on \"Once in a LIVETime\" include snippets of others' pieces, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" and Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee.\" Other quotations include \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" during \"Endless Sacrifice\" on the Gigantour, a calliope-inspired break between verses of \"Under a Glass Moon\", a quote of \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\"'s main melody played by Petrucci while performing the intro solo of \"Through Her Eyes\" in Buenos Aires, the Turkish March at a concert in Istanbul, and the opening riff of Rush's \"A Passage to Bangkok\" at a show in Bangkok, Thailand. On the \"20th Anniversary World Tour\", Rudess has even thrown in a short \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" theme in a break during \"Endless Sacrifice,\" and during a concert in Israel he started a spontaneous \"Hava Nagila\", with the rest of the band later joining in. During the band's 2017 tour, a snippet of Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" was played during Dream Theater's own song \"As I Am\".\nDream Theater's most unconventional live shows were performed during Derek Sherinian's time with the band. At selected shows the band members all swapped instruments and performed an encore as the fictitious band dubbed Nightmare Cinema. They usually performed a cover of Deep Purple's \"Perfect Strangers,\" and, on one occasion, Ozzy Osbourne's \"Suicide Solution,\" At some shows, Sherinian, Petrucci and Portnoy would take the stage together under the name \"Nicky Lemons and the Migraine Brothers.\" Sherinian, wearing a feather boa and novelty sunglasses, would perform a pop-punk song titled \"I Don't Like You\" with Petrucci and Portnoy backing. During the Chaos in Motion tour, in several concerts before \"Trial of Tears,\" Portnoy and Petrucci would switch instruments.\nIn the \"Score\" and \"Chaos in Motion\" DVDs, an animation has accompanied certain parts of the songs, showing the band playing along to the music as cartoon characters. On the Score DVD, during the song Octavarium, the band is seen performing in an octagonal shaped maze. As the animation continues Jordan Rudess spontaneously turns into Santa Claus and John Petrucci catches fire. In \"The Dark Eternal Night\" from the Chaos in Motion DVD, the band battles against a monster by shooting fireballs from guitars, throwing drum sticks, and screaming.\nShows and concerts.\nDream Theater played and recorded a live performance at the Nippon Budokan Hall on April 26, 2004. It was later released as \"Live at Budokan\" on October 5, 2004.\nDream Theater's largest audience as a headlining act was 20,000 in Santiago, Chile on December 6, 2005. The show was released on DVD through Portnoy's YtseJam Records.\nIn 2007, after their show in Salt Lake City on July 30, Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. signed a proclamation officially marking July 30, 2007 as \"Dream Theater Day\" in the state of Utah.\nIn 2008 Dream Theater started the Progressive Nation 2008 tour, along with Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, and 3. The tour was the brainchild of Mike Portnoy, who stated, \"I've been wanting to assemble a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk.\"\nOn February 13, 2009, Dream Theater announced the official line up for their Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour was originally set to feature bands including Swedish bands Beardfish and Pain of Salvation, as well as Zappa Plays Zappa. On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced that Pain of Salvation and Beardfish would not be touring the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour because of record label complications. In the same announcement, Portnoy stated that the bands Scale the Summit and Bigelf would replace Pain of Salvation and Beardfish on the tour. This lineup change has put Bigelf on both the North American and European legs of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour's North American leg ran throughout July and August 2009. On March 26, 2009, it was announced that Dream Theater would take the Progressive Nation tour to Europe for the first time alongside Opeth, Bigelf and Unexpect. The tour ran throughout September and October 2009.\nIn June/July 2010 Dream Theater were the opening band for Iron Maiden during the first leg of their Final Frontier Tour which included Madison Square Garden as one of the many venues. On December 7, 2010, Dream Theater announced on their website that they would be headlining the High Voltage Festival alongside Judas Priest in 2011. In July 2011 they started A Dramatic Tour of Events to promote \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\". In January 2014, they started the Along for the Ride Tour to promote their self-titled album. On December 13, 2016, Dream Theater confirmed 5 UK tour dates for their Images, Words &amp; Beyond 25th Anniversary Tour, starting in Birmingham on April 18, 2017.\nDuring the Images, Words &amp; Beyond 25th Anniversary Tour, Dream Theater performed a cover of Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\" on May 20, 2017, in Bucharest, Romania, to pay tribute to rock musician Chris Cornell who had died a few days prior. The cover featured only piano and vocals, with LaBrie forgetting a portion of the lyrics and instead singing \"I forgot the fucking words\" in line with the tune's melody.\nDream Theater kicked off the \"Distance Over Time Tour\" in March 2019. In addition to promoting the titular new album, the band also performed \" in its entirety to celebrate the album's 20th anniversary.\nOn March 4, 2022, Mike Portnoy attended his first and only Dream Theater show as an audience member at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, taking photos with the band and receiving a shoutout from James LaBrie during the show. This attendance and backstage reconciliation with LaBrie ultimately led to Portnoy rejoining the band.\nOn April 22, 2023, Dream Theater announced the first edition of Dreamsonic, their traveling progressive festival, taking place in North America throughout June and July and celebrating the summer's ultimate progressive metal line-up. As described by John Petrucci: \"Dreamsonic promises to be a reoccurring musical event that will deliver history-making nights of amazing music for many years to come!\"\" Kicking off in Cedar Park, Texas, on June 16, 2023, the band was joined by special guests Devin Townsend and Animals As Leaders. The tour ended on July 26, and was Mike Mangini's last tour with the band. At the July 22 DREAMSONIC show in Redmond, Washington, John Myung performed sitting down with a large bandage on his head with no explanation, with James LaBrie telling the crowd the band nearly cancelled the show. Myung later revealed in an interview he passed out at a border checkpoint due to dehydration and hit a metal post with his forehead that cut him open.\nAfter rejoining Dream Theater, on April 8, 2024, the band announced their first tour with Mike Portnoy in fourteen years, titled the \"40th Anniversary Tour 2024 \u2013 2025\", which began with a month-long European leg in the fall of 2024. The reunion with Portnoy kicked off at The O2 Arena in London, England on October 20, 2024. The show was described by the band as a very surreal and emotional experience, with LaBrie choking up and weeping onstage and had to briefly pause singing.\nOn December 24, 2024, Dream Theater performed the Christmas classic \"O Holy Night\" for the first time in 26 years to close-out the South American leg of the \"40th Anniversary Tour 2024 \u2013 2025\" in Santiago, Chile, on the second night of back-to-back shows. On March 22, 2025, Dream Theater performed \"The Best of Times\" for the first time ever at their tour-closing concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, with special guest Jonathan Dinklage on violin.\nOn July 2, 2025, Dream Theater performed for the first time ever at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii in Pompeii, Italy, the same venue where Pink Floyd made their 1972 concert film \"\". To mark the occasion, the band performed a cover of \"Echoes\".\nThe band began their Parasomnia Tour in Reading, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 2025. In addition to performing the \"Parasomnia\" album in its entirety, the band confirmed they would also perform their song \"A Change of Seasons\" on the tour. Mike Portnoy speculated that this tour cycle would likely be the last time the band would ever perform the song.\nCover songs.\nDream Theater have covered other artists' work throughout their career. They have performed cover songs live and in studio, with many of those live performances being recorded for official release. \"A Change of Seasons\" features Elton John, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Kansas, Queen, Journey, Dixie Dregs and Genesis live covers. Through YtseJam Records, the band have also released full album live cover performances of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", Iron Maiden's \"The Number of the Beast\", Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", and Deep Purple's \"Made in Japan\". The special edition of \"Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\" includes a bonus disc with Rainbow, Queen, Dixie Dregs, Zebra, King Crimson, and Iron Maiden covers. Other notable artists covered by Dream Theater include Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Rush, the Who, and Yes.\nLogo and imagery.\nDespite the band being forced to change their name, Dream Theater adopted a custom logo (known as the \"Majesty symbol\") and wordmark, both of which have appeared on most of their promotional material. The Majesty symbol has been featured on the front cover of every Dream Theater studio album, while the wordmark appears on all except \"Falling into Infinity\" and \"Dream Theater\". The Majesty symbol is derived from Mary, Queen of Scots' mark, which was re-worked by Charlie Dominici for use on the album artwork for \"When Dream and Day Unite\".\nIn September 2010, a fan of Dream Theater discovered that all of the letters of \"DOMINICI\" fit together perfectly into the Majesty symbol. When Charlie discovered this, he laughed and mentioned that \"it only took them 25 years to figure out the 'Dominici Code!'\" This has earlier also been discovered as shown on the comment section of DTFAQ and in the DTNorway Podcast Episode 2 from 2008, with Charlie Dominici.\nMusical style.\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Dream Theater's music as a \"dense blend of progressive rock and post-Halen metal\". The band is well noted for being one of the early progenitors of the progressive metal genre, and they are considered a member of the so-called \"big three\" of the genre, along with Queensr\u00ffche and Fates Warning. The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, and Pink Floyd, heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, various speed metal bands, and even the glam metal of the day. John Petrucci described Dream Theater's musical style as a blend of Rush, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Yes, and Metallica, while Mike Portnoy described their style as a blend of progressive rock and heavy metal. They encompass the progressive aspect, influenced by Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd, and Genesis, alongside the metal aspect influenced by Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Black Sabbath. When combined, that's precisely what characterizes Dream Theater. This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band's music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots. In the liner notes for the 2008 \"Greatest Hit\" compilation, Mike Portnoy cited artists such as Peter Gabriel, U2, and Journey as inspirations for Dream Theater's softer songs. Dream Theater's music has also been described as art rock.\nDream Theater's 2003 album \"Train of Thought\" showcased a heavier sound. This decision was inspired by the positive feedback received from their previous heavier songs on stage. 1999's \"\" was praised for its display of old-fashioned progressive rock, and was influenced by classic conceptual rock records such as the Beatles' \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and \"The Final Cut\", the Who's \"Tommy\", and Genesis's \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\".\nDream Theater's music usually borrows elements from other musical styles including symphonic rock, symphonic metal, arena rock, soft rock, and classical music.\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nTimeline.\nNotes\nBootleg culture.\nDream Theater have released a series of official bootlegs, demos, and other rarities through YtseJam Records, at the time headed by Portnoy.

{"id": "73068", "revid": "50498973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73068", "title": "Church of the SubGenius", "text": "Parody religion created in the US in the 1970s\nThe Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, Jehovah\u00a01, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs's followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.\nIvan Stang, who co-founded the Church in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of culture jamming in an attempt to parody better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in absolute truths. The group holds that the quality of \"Slack\" is of utmost importance, but it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to Discordianism. Journalists often consider the Church an elaborate joke, but some academics have defended it as a real system of deeply held beliefs.\nOrigins.\nThe Church of the SubGenius was founded by Ivan Stang (born Douglas St. Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox) as the SubGenius Foundation. Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception. The organization's first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, \"Sub Genius Pamphlet #1\", disseminated in Dallas, Texas, in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers. It criticized Christian conceptions of God and New Age perceptions of spirituality.\nChurch leaders maintain that a man named J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs founded the group in 1953. SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of Dobbs's life, which commentators describe as fictional. The members assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Stang to join shortly afterward. Stang has called himself Dobbs's \"sacred scribe\" and a \"professional maven of weirdness\".\nOnline history.\nThe popularization of the Internet in the mid-1990s brought a new surge of interest in the church, resulting in dozens of homemade, elaborately decorated websites and two Usenet newsgroups, \"alt.slack\" and \"alt.binaries.slack\". A third newsgroup, \"alt.binaries.multimedia.slack\", was created in 2005. Ivan Stang currently maintains the official SubGenius home page. The church's weekly radio program, the \"Hour of Slack\", is a staple of many college radio stations. It draws from live broadcasts by Stang, his wife Princess Wei R. Doe and voice comic \"Lonesome Cowboy Dave\" (comedian/musician Dave DeLuca), as well as from other SubGenius radio shows.\nBeliefs.\nDeities.\nThe Church of the SubGenius's ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative. The group has an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants. Its primary deity, generally known as Jehovah\u00a01, is an extraterrestrial who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah\u00a01 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.\nJehovah\u00a01 and his spouse Eris, regarded by the Church as \"relatively evil\", are classified as \"rebel gods\". SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah\u00a01 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his \"stark fist of removal\". The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah\u00a01 is \"relatively good\" in comparison. Yog-Sothoth, a character from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, is the Elder Gods' leader. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole M. Cusack of the University of Sydney states that Lovecraft's work is a \"model for the Church of the SubGenius's approach to scripture\", in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality.\nJ. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs.\nSubGenius leaders teach that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs's nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his nickname \"Bob\" with quotation marks even when used alone. They call him a \"World Avatar\" and hold that he has died and been reborn many times. The Church's primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe. Stang has said the image was taken from Yellow Pages clip art, and it has been likened to Ward Cleaver, Mark Trail, or a 1950s-era salesman. The Church's canon contains references to aspects of United States culture in that decade; religious scholar Danielle Kirby of RMIT University argues that this type of reference \"simultaneously critiques and subverts\" the American dream.\nIn one version of the Church's mythology, Jehovah\u00a01 intended Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused; instead, he infiltrated and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders have taught that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet, where he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis; the Church teaches that SubGenius members are descended from them. Originally, the only relative of Dobbs the Church identified was his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs\u00a0\u2013 Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father.\nIn another version, as a child \"Bob\", then known as Bobby, was not highly intelligent, but incredibly lucky. He copied the homework of Constance \"Connie\" Marsh, who later became a model, actress, and finally his wife as Constance \"Connie\" Marsh Dobbs. SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs's occupation as \"drilling equipment\" or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe he is capable of time travel, and that this results in occasional changes to doctrine (the \"Sacred Doctrine of Erasability\"). Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.\nConspiracy and \"Slack\".\nThe Church of the SubGenius's literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories, teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones. It says that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, though a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church's view, this conspiracy uses a fa\u00e7ade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service. The Church calls these individuals \"pinks\" and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization's power and control. SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy's propaganda. They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church's followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack. Cultural studies scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a \"satiric commentary\" on religion, morality, and conspiracies.\nSubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from \"Slack\", a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on \"Slack\" (always capitalized). While Slack is never concisely defined, Dobbs is said to embody it. Church members seek to acquire Slack and believe it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) they claim as an entitlement. Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain Slack. Davidoff believes that Slack is \"the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals\". Cusack states that the Church's description of Slack as ineffable recalls the way that Tao is described, and Kirby calls Slack a \"unique magical system\".\nMembers.\nThe Church of the SubGenius's founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1999. In 2009, Stang claimed the Church had 40,000 members, but the actual number may have been much lower. As of 2022, becoming a minister in the Church costs $50, but is on sale for $44.99. Stang has estimated that there are 10,000 ministers and that the Church's annual income has reached $100,000. In October 2017, the Church moved to Glen Rose, Texas.\nMost SubGenius members are male, and, according to Stang, many are social outcasts. He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do. The Church has experienced success \"converting\" college students, particularly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including San Francisco, Little Rock, and Cleveland. \nNotable associates of the Church include Mark Mothersbaugh, Mojo Nixon, Zoogz Rift, Paul Mavrides, Paul Reubens, members of Negativland, David Byrne, and R.\u00a0Crumb. Crumb provided early publicity for the church by reprinting \"Sub Genius Pamphlet\" #1 in his comics anthology \"Weirdo\". References to the Church are present in several works of art, including the Internet-based collaborative fiction \"Ong's Hat\", the comic book \"The Middleman\", the band Sublime's album \"40oz. to Freedom\", and the television program \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\".\nInstructions.\nChurch leaders have issued instructions to their followers; Robert Latham of the University of California, Riverside, calls their ideology \"anarcholibertarian\". Five commands embody the group's values:\nEvents.\nDevivals.\nLocal groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as \"clenches\". They host periodic events known as \"devivals\", which include sermons, music, and other art forms. The term is used by both the Church of the SubGenius and Discordianism for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on Christian revivals.\nAt devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants. Many take place at bars or similar venues. Cusack compares the style of the services to Pentecostal revivalism; David Giffels of the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" calls them \"campy preaching sessions\". Cusack posits that these events are examples of Peter Lamborn Wilson's concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended. On one occasion, the presence of a Church leader's wife at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. However, the publicity surrounding the event was a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts.\nThe Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters from fiction and popular culture, such as Monty Python, Dracula, and Klaatu. The Association for Consciousness Exploration and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events. Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism; however, the \"Book of the SubGenius\" discusses community.\nSubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website. Devivals have been held in multiple U.S. states, as well as China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as Burning Man and the Starwood Festival.\n\"The Cyclone of Slack\" was a devival in Portland, Oregon, in October 2009; it was organized by the Church of the SubGenius and the organizers of Esozone. One of its more bizarre moments was when the alcohol and fire-and-brimstone sermon-fueled crowd in front of the stage began to sit down in twos and threes when the Duke of Uke began to play his ukulele.\nX-Day.\nIn early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as \"X-Day\". The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s, claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet X, would arrive on Earth. SubGenius leaders said their paying members would be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed, though a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell. In anticipation of the event, X-Day \"drills\" were held in 1996 and 1997.\nIn July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a \"clothing-optional\" campground in Sherman, New York, attended by about 400\u00a0members. The event was ostensibly to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at the time, Stang produced a sacred piece of paper with \"Bob\"s handwritten date of X-day, proving judgment was officially scheduled for 1998. However, Papa Joe Mama (the \"Minister of Sinister\") snatched the paper from Stang's hands and turned it upside down, declaring that Stang must have read it backward (8661); this has been interpreted by the authors David Beard and Joshua Gunn as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics dismissed the event as a prank or \"performance art\". Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack calls the productions carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.\nPublishing.\nOnline.\nThe Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993, and its members were very active on Usenet in the 1990s.\nPrint.\nAlthough it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities. The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices.\nThe SubGenius Foundation published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang. The \"Book of the SubGenius\", which discusses Slack at length, was published by Simon\u00a0&amp; Schuster and sold 30,000\u00a0copies in its first five years in print. Kirby calls it a \"call to arms for the forces of absurdity\". Its juxtaposition, visual style, and content mirror the group as a whole. It draws themes from fiction as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself.\nA number of SubGenius members have written stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published. Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage. Kirby notes that the group's texts are a bricolage of cultural artifacts remixed into a new creation. In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she calls a \"web of references\".\nVideo.\nThe group was promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992. \nRadio.\nThe Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. Several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada broadcast \"The Hour of Slack\", the Church's most popular audio production.\nPodcast.\nThe \"Hour of Slack\" radio show can also be heard in podcast form.\nAnalysis and commentary.\nComparative religion.\nThe Church's teachings have been perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology, earning the Church a reputation as a parody religion. Church leaders have said that Dobbs met L.\u00a0Ron Hubbard, and SubGenius narratives echo extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology. Cusack notes Jehovah\u00a01 bears similarities to Xenu, a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings. The Church's rhetoric text has also been described as a satirical imitation of the televangelism of the 1980s. Cusack sees the Church's faux commercialism as culture jamming targeting prosperity theology, calling the faux commercialism \"a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion\". Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the University of London views the Church as attempting to \"subvert the idea of authenticity in religion\" by mirroring other religions to create a sense of both similarity and alterity.\nCusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the Ranters, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England that made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has \"legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion\". The American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight likens the Church to the Moorish Orthodox Church of America, a 20th-century American syncretic religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.\nThere are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and Discordianism. Eris, the goddess of chaos worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be Jehovah\u00a01's wife and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes. Religious scholar David Chidester of the University of Cape Town views the Church as a \"Discordian offshoot\", and Kirby sees it as \"a child of the Discordians\". Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, whom SubGenius members call \"Pope Bob\". Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture.\nCategorization.\nAccording to Carole M. Cusack, scholars often have difficulty defining the Church. Commentators generally place the Church in the category of \"joke religions\", which is often seen as pejorative. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of the faith. Other terms used to describe the Church include \"faux cult\", \"[postmodern] cult\", \"satirical pseudoreligion\", \"sophisticated joke religion\", \"anti-religion religion\", and \"high parody of cultdom\". Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion. Stang described the group as both \"satire and a real stupid religion\", and contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.\nCusack states that the Church \"must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion\". She sees it as \"arguably a legitimate path to liberation\", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term \"fake religion\" to describe it. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of \"popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence, and arbitrariness seem to mock religion\". Knight characterizes the Church as \"at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right\".\nAppraisal.\nKirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to Jean Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality, arguing, \"they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality\". She calls their remixing of popular culture sources an \"explicitly creative process\", maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group's views by forcing \"the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content\". She states that the group attempts to \"strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons\".\nKirby also sees the Church's goal as deconstructing \"normative modes of thought and behavior\" in American culture; she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people. She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a commonplace value that most religions have ignored. By embracing the quality of irony, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.\nLiterature scholar Paul Mann of Pomona College is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself. In addition, he believes that the group responds to criticism in a \"hysterical, literal, fantastic\" way.\nAnarchist writer Bob Black, a former member, criticized the Church, alleging that it has become conformist and submissive to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper \"Bedfordshire on Sunday\" after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.\nNotable members or associates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublications.\nBooks\nVideos\nFurther reading.\nBooks\nJournals\nMagazines\nNewspapers\nWebsites"}
{"id": "73070", "revid": "5831124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73070", "title": "St Albans Cathedral", "text": "Anglican cathedral in Hertfordshire, England\nSt Albans Cathedral, officially the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban, also known as \"the Abbey\", is a Church of England cathedral in St Albans, England.\nMuch of its architecture dates from Norman times. It ceased to be an abbey following its dissolution in the 16th century and became a cathedral in 1877. Although legally a cathedral church, it differs in certain particulars from most other cathedrals in England, being also used as a parish church, of which the dean is rector with the same powers, responsibilities and duties as those of any other parish. At 85 metres long, it has the longest nave of any cathedral in England.\nProbably founded in the 8th century, the present building is Norman or Romanesque architecture of the 11th century, with Gothic and 19th-century additions.\nBritain's first Christian martyr.\nAccording to Bede, whose account of the saint's life is the most elaborate, Alban lived in Verulamium, some time during the 3rd or 4th centuries. At that time Christians began to suffer cruel persecution. The legend proceeds with Alban meeting a Christian priest (known as Amphibalus) fleeing from persecutors, and sheltering him in his house for a number of days. Alban was so impressed with the priest's faith and piety that he soon converted to Christianity. Eventually Roman soldiers came to seize the priest, but Alban put on his cloak and presented himself to the soldiers in place of his guest. Alban was brought before a judge and was sentenced to beheading. As he was led to execution, he came to a fast flowing river, commonly believed to be the River Ver, crossed it and went about 500 paces to a gently sloping hill overlooking a beautiful plain When he reached the summit he began to thirst and prayed that God would give him drink, whereupon water sprang up at his feet. It was at this place that his head was struck off. Immediately after one of the executioners delivered the fatal stroke, his eyes fell out and dropped to the ground alongside Alban's head. Later versions of the tale say that Alban's head rolled downhill and that a well gushed up where it stopped. St Albans Cathedral stands near the supposed site of Alban's martyrdom, and references to the spontaneous well are extant in local place names. The nearby river was called Halywell (Middle English for 'Holy Well') in the medieval era, and the road up to Holmhurst Hill on which the Abbey now stands is now called Holywell Hill but has been called Halliwell Street and other variations at least since the 13th century. The remains of a well structure have been found at the bottom of Holywell Hill. However, this well is thought to date from no earlier than the 19th century.\nThe date of Alban's execution has never been firmly established. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" lists the year 283, but Bede places it in 305. Original sources and modern historians such as William Hugh Clifford Frend and Charles Thomas indicate the period of 251\u2013259 (under the persecutors Decius or Valerian) as more likely.\nThe tomb of St Amphibalus is in the cathedral.\nHistory of the abbey and cathedral.\nRomano-British Shrine.\nA \"memoria\" over the execution point holding the remains of Alban existed at the site from the mid-4th century (possibly earlier). According to Bede, a Christian shrine together with its martyr cult survived from Roman times until the eighth century, although this may be due to British control of this area. Bede also mentions a church and Gildas a shrine. Bishop Germanus of Auxerre visited in 429. This is seen as evidence of the continuation of Christianity in heavily Saxonised south and east Britain. The style of this structure is unknown; the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris (see below) said the Saxons destroyed the building in 586.\nSaxon buildings.\nKing Offa of Mercia, is said to have founded a double monastery at St Albans in 793. It followed the Benedictine rule. The Abbey was built on Holmhurst Hill \u2013 now Holywell Hill \u2013 across the River Ver from the ruins of Verulamium. Again there is no information to the form of the first abbey.\nAbbot Ulsinus founded St Albans Market outside of the Waxhouse Gate, on what is now Market Place, in c.\u2009860 to generate income for the Abbey and to form the centre of a new town.\nThe Abbey was probably sacked by the Danes around 890 and, despite Paris's claims, the office of abbot remained empty from around 920 until the 970s when the efforts of Dunstan reached the town.\nThere was an intention to rebuild the Abbey in 1005 when Abbot Ealdred was licensed to remove building material from Verulamium. With the town resting on clay and chalk, the only tough stone is flint. This was used with a lime mortar and then either plastered over or left bare. With the great quantities of brick, tile and other stone in Verulamium, the Roman site became a prime source of building material for the Abbey and other projects in the area. Sections demanding worked stone used Lincolnshire limestone (Barnack stone) from Verulamium; later worked stones include Totternhoe freestone from Bedfordshire, Purbeck marble, and different limestones (Ancaster, Chilmark, Clipsham, etc.).\nRenewed Viking raids from 1016 stalled the Saxon efforts and very little from the Saxon abbey was incorporated in the later forms.\nNorman abbey.\nMuch of the current layout and proportions of the structure date from the first Norman abbot, Paul of Caen (1077\u20131093). The 14th abbot, he was appointed by his uncle, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc.\nBuilding work started in the year of Abbot Paul's arrival. The design and construction were overseen by the Norman Robert the Mason. The plan has very limited Anglo-Saxon elements and is clearly influenced by the French work at Cluny, Bernay and Caen, and shares a similar floor plan to Saint-\u00c9tienne in Caen and Lanfranc's Canterbury\u2014although the poorer quality building material was a new challenge for Robert and he clearly borrowed some Roman techniques, which were learned while gathering material in the ruins of Verulamium.\nTo make maximum use of the hilltop the Abbey was oriented to the south-east. The cruciform abbey was the largest built in England at that time, it had a chancel of four bays, a transept containing seven apses, and a nave of ten bays\u2014fifteen bays long overall. Robert gave particular attention to solid foundations, running a continuous wall of layered bricks, flints and mortar below and pushing the foundations down to twelve feet to hit bedrock. Below the crossing tower special large stones were used.\nThe tower was a particular triumph\u2014it is the only 11th-century great crossing tower still standing in England. Robert began with special thick supporting walls and four massive brick piers. The four-level tower tapers at each stage with clasping buttresses on the three lower levels and circular buttresses on the fourth stage. The entire structure masses 5,000 tons and is 144 feet high. The tower was probably topped with a Norman pyramidal roof; the current roof is flat. The original ringing chamber had five bells\u2014two paid for by the Abbot, two by a wealthy townsman, and one donated by the rector of Hoddesdon. None of these bells has survived.\nThere was a widespread belief that the Abbey had two additional, smaller towers at the west end. No remains have been found.\nThe monastic abbey was completed in 1089 but not consecrated until Holy Innocents' Day (28 December), 1115, by the Archbishop of Rouen. King Henry I attended as did many bishops and nobles.\nA nunnery (Sopwell Priory) was founded nearby in 1140.\nInternally the Abbey church was bare of sculpture, almost stark. The plaster walls were coloured and patterned in parts, with extensive tapestries adding colour. Sculptural decoration was added, mainly ornaments, as it became more fashionable in the 12th century\u2014especially after the Gothic style arrived in England around 1170.\nIn the current structure the original Norman arches survive principally under the central tower and on the north side of the nave. The arches in the rest of the building are Gothic, following medieval rebuilding and extensions, and Victorian era restoration.\nThe Abbey was extended in the 1190s by Abbot John de Cella (also known as John of Wallingford) (1195\u20131214); as the number of monks grew from fifty to over a hundred, the Abbey church was extended westwards with three bays added to the nave. The severe Norman west front was also rebuilt by Hugh de Goldclif\u2014although how is uncertain; it was very costly but its 'rapid' weathering and later alterations have erased all but fragments. A more prominent shrine and altar to Saint Amphibalus were also added. The work was very slow under de Cella and was not completed until the time of Abbot William de Trumpington (1214\u20131235). The low Norman tower roof was demolished and a new, much higher, broached spire was raised, sheathed in lead.\nThe St Albans Psalter (c.\u20091130\u20131145) is the best known of a number of important Romanesque illuminated manuscripts produced in the Abbey scriptorium. Later, Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans from 1217 until his death in 1259, was important both as a chronicler and an artist. Eighteen of his manuscripts survive and are a rich source of contemporary information for historians.\nNicholas Breakspear was born near St Albans, reportedly at Abbots Langley, and applied to be admitted to the Abbey as a novice, but he was turned down. He eventually managed to be accepted into an abbey in France. In 1154 he was elected Pope Adrian IV, the only English Pope there has ever been. The head of the Abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England also in 1154.\nThe Abbey had a number of daughter houses, ranging from Tynemouth Priory in the north to Binham Priory near the Norfolk coast.\n13th to 15th centuries.\nAn earthquake shook the Abbey in 1250 and damaged the eastern end of the church. In 1257 the dangerously cracked sections were knocked down \u2014 three apses and two bays. The thick Presbytery wall supporting the tower was left. The rebuilding and updating were completed during the rule of Abbot Roger de Norton (1263\u201390) who founded an additional market in Watford.\nOn 10 October 1323 two piers on the south side of the nave collapsed dragging down much of the roof and wrecking five bays. Mason Henry Wy undertook the rebuilding, matching the Early English style of the rest of the bays but adding distinctly 14th-century detailing and ornaments. The shrine to St Amphibalus had also been damaged and it was remade.\nRichard of Wallingford, abbot from 1327 to 1336 and a mathematician and astronomer, designed a celebrated astronomical clock, which was completed by William of Walsham after his death, but apparently destroyed during the Reformation. In 1334 he founded two additional markets in Codicote and High Barnet.\nA new gateway, now called the Abbey Gateway, was built to the Abbey grounds in 1365, which was the only part of the monastery buildings (besides the church) to survive the dissolution, later being used as a prison and now (since 1871) part of St Albans School. The other monastic buildings were located to the south of the gateway and church.\nIn the 15th century a large west window of nine main lights and a deep traced head was commissioned by John of Wheathampstead. The spire was reduced to a 'Hertfordshire spike', the roof pitch greatly reduced and battlements liberally added. Further new windows, at \u00a350 each, were put in the transepts by Abbot Wallingford (also known as William of Wallingford), who also had a new high altar screen made.\nDissolution and after.\nAfter the death of Abbot Ramryge in 1521 the Abbey fell into debt and slow decay under three weak abbots. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and its surrender on 5 December 1539 the income was \u00a32,100 annually. The abbot and remaining forty monks were pensioned off and then the buildings were looted. All gold, silver and gilt objects were carted away with all other valuables; stonework was broken and defaced and graves opened to search for riches. The Abbey became part of the diocese of Lincoln in 1542 and was moved to the diocese of London in 1550. \nThe buildings suffered\u2014neglect, second-rate repairs, even active damage. Richard Lee purchased all the buildings, except the church and chapel and some other Crown premises, in 1538, 1539, or 1540. In 1549, Lee began systematic demolition, including the removal and sale of the stone, except for what may have been retained to improve Lee Hall at Sopwell. In March 1550, Lee returned the land to the abbot by grant. The area was named Abbey Ruins for the next 200 years or so.\nIn 1553 the Lady chapel was used as a school, the Great Gatehouse as a town jail, some other buildings passed to the Crown, and the Abbey Church was sold to the town for \u00a3400 in 1553 by King Edward VI to be the church of the parish.\nThe cost of upkeep fell upon the town, although in 1596 and at irregular intervals later the Archdeacon was allowed to collect money for repairs by Brief in the diocese. After James I visited in 1612 he authorised another Brief, which collected around \u00a32,000\u2014most of which went on roof repairs. The English Civil War slashed the monies spent on repairs, while the Abbey Church was used to hold prisoners of war and suffered from their vandalism, as well as that of their guards. Most of the metal objects that had survived the Dissolution were also removed and other ornamental parts were damaged in Puritan sternness. Another round of fund-raising in 1681\u20131684 was again spent on the roof, repairing the Presbytery vault. A royal grant from William III and Mary II in 1689 went on general maintenance, 'repairs' to conceal some of the then considered unfashionable Gothic features, and on new internal fittings. There was a second royal grant from William in 1698.\nBy the end of the 17th century the dilapidation was sufficient for a number of writers to comment upon it.\nIn 1703, from 26 November to 1 December, the Great Storm raged across southern England; the Abbey lost the south transept window which was replaced in wood at a cost of \u00a340. The window was clear glass with five lights and three transoms in an early Gothic Revival style by John Hawgood. Other windows, although not damaged in the storm, were a constant drain on the Abbey budget in the 18th century.\nA brief written in 1723\u20131724, seeking \u00a35,775, notes a great crack in the south wall, that the north wall was eighteen inches from vertical, and that the roof timbers were decayed to the point of danger. The money raised was spent on the nave roof over ten bays.\nAnother brief was not issued until 1764. Again the roof was rotting, as was the south transept window, walls were cracked or shattered in part and the south wall had subsided and now leant outwards. Despite a target of \u00a32,500 a mere \u00a3600 was raised.\nIn the 1770s the Abbey came close to demolition; the expense of repairs meant a scheme to destroy the Abbey and erect a smaller church almost succeeded.\nA storm in 1797 caused some subsidence, cracking open graves, scattering pavement tiles, flooding the church interior and leaving a few more arches off-vertical.\n19th century.\nThis century was marked with a number of repair schemes. The Abbey received some money from the 1818 \"Million Act\", and in 1820, \u00a3450 was raised to buy an organ\u2014a second-hand example made in 1670.\nThe major efforts to revive the Abbey Church came under four men\u2014L. N. Cottingham, H. J. B. Nicholson (Rector), and, especially, George Gilbert Scott and Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe.\nIn February 1832 a portion of the clerestory wall fell through the roof of the south aisle, leaving a hole almost thirty feet long. With the need for serious repair work evident, the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham was called in to survey the building. His \"Survey\" was presented in 1832 and was worrying reading: everywhere mortar was in a wretched condition and wooden beams were rotting and twisting. Cottingham recommended new beams throughout the roof and a new steeper pitch, removal of the spire and new timbers in the tower, new paving, ironwork to hold the west transept wall up, a new stone south transept window, new buttresses, a new drainage system for the roof, new ironwork on almost all the windows, and on and on. He estimated a cost of \u00a314,000. A public subscription of \u00a34,000 was raised, of which \u00a31,700 vanished in expenses. With the limited funds the clerestory wall was rebuilt, the nave roof re-leaded, the tower spike removed, some forty blocked windows reopened and glazed, and the south window remade in stone.\nHenry Nicholson, rector from 1835 to 1866, was also active in repairing the Abbey Church\u2014as far as he could, and in uncovering lost or neglected Gothic features.\nIn 1856 repair efforts began again; \u00a34,000 was raised and slow moves started to gain the Abbey the status of cathedral. George Gilbert Scott was appointed the project architect and oversaw a number of works from 1860 until his death in 1878.\nScott began by having the medieval floor restored, necessitating the removal of tons of earth, and fixing the north aisle roof. From 1872 to 1877 the restored floors were re-tiled in matching stone and copies of old tile designs. A further 2,000 tons of earth were shifted in 1863 during work on the foundation and a new drainage system. In 1870 the tower piers were found to be badly weakened with many cracks and cavities. Huge timbers were inserted and the arches filled with brick as an emergency measure. Repair work took until May 1871 and cost over \u00a32,000. The south wall of the nave was now far from straight; Scott reinforced the north wall and put in scaffolding to take the weight of the roof off the wall, then had it jacked straight in under three hours. The wall was then buttressed with five huge new masses and set right. Scott was lauded as \"saviour of the Abbey.\" From 1870 to 1875 around \u00a320,000 was spent on the Abbey.\nIn 1845 St Albans was transferred from the Diocese of Lincoln to the Diocese of Rochester. Then, in 1875, the Bishopric of St Albans Act was passed and on 30 April 1877 the See of St Albans was created, which comprises about 300 churches in the counties of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. Thomas Legh Claughton, then Bishop of Rochester, elected to take the northern division of his old diocese and on 12 June 1877 was enthroned first Bishop of St Albans, a position he held until 1890. He is buried in the churchyard on the north side of the nave.\nGeorge Gilbert Scott was working on the nave roof, vaulting and west bay when he died on 27 March 1878. His plans were partially completed by his son, John Oldrid Scott, but the remaining work fell into the hands of Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, whose efforts have attracted much controversy\u2014Nikolaus Pevsner calling him a \"pompous, righteous bully.\" However, he donated much of the immense sum of \u00a3130,000 the work cost.\nWhereas Scott's work had clearly been in sympathy with the existing building, Grimthorpe's plans reflected the Victorian ideal. Indeed, he spent considerable time dismissing and criticising the work of Scott and the efforts of his son.\nGrimthorpe first reinstated the original pitch of the roof, although the battlements added for the lower roof were retained. Completed in 1879, the roof was leaded, following on Scott's desires.\nHis second major project was the most controversial. The west front, with the great Wheathampstead window, was cracked and leaning, and Grimthorpe, never more than an amateur architect, designed the new front himself\u2014attacked as dense, misproportioned and unsympathetic: \"His impoverishment as a designer ... [is] evident\"; \"this man, so practical and ingenious, was utterly devoid of taste ... his great qualities were marred by arrogance ... and a lack of historic sense\". Counter proposals were deliberately substituted by Grimthorpe for poorly drawn versions and Grimthorpe's design was accepted. During building it was considerably reworked in order to fit the actual frontage and is not improved by the poor quality sculpture. Work began in 1880 and was completed in April 1883, having cost \u00a320,000.\nGrimthorpe was noted for his aversion to the Perpendicular\u2014to the extent that he would have sections he disliked demolished as \"too rotten\" rather than remade. In his reconstruction, especially of windows, he commonly mixed architectural styles carelessly (see the south aisle, the south choir screen and vaulting). He spent \u00a350,000 remaking the nave. Elsewhere he completely rebuilt the south wall cloisters, with new heavy buttresses, and removed the arcading of the east cloisters during rebuilding the south transept walls. In the south transept he completely remade the south face, completed in 1885, including the huge lancet window group\u2014his proudest achievement\u2014and the flanking turrets; a weighty new tiled roof was also made. In the north transept Grimthorpe had the Perpendicular window demolished and his design inserted\u2014a rose window of circles, cusped circles and lozenges arrayed in five rings around the central light, sixty-four lights in total, each circle with a different glazing pattern.\nGrimthorpe continued through the Presbytery in his own style, adapting the antechapel for Consistory Courts, and into the Lady Chapel. After a pointed lawsuit with Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham, over who should direct the restoration, Grimthorpe had the vault remade and reproportioned in stone, made the floor in black and white marble (1893), and had new Victorian arcading and sculpture put below the canopy work. Externally the buttresses were expanded to support the new roof, and the walls were refaced.\nAs early as 1897, Grimthorpe was having to return to previously renovated sections to make repairs. His use of over-strong cement led to cracking, while his fondness for ironwork in windows led to corrosion and damage to the surrounding stone.\nGrimthorpe died in 1905 and was interred in the churchyard. He left a bequest for continuing work on the buildings.\nDuring this century the name \"St Albans Abbey\" was given to one of the town's two railway stations.\n20th century.\nJohn Oldrid Scott (died 1913) (George Gilbert Scott's son), despite frequent clashes with Grimthorpe, had continued working within the cathedral. Scott was a steadfast supporter of the Gothic revival and designed the tomb of the first bishop; he had a new bishop's throne built (1903), together with commemorative stalls for Festing (a bishop) and two archdeacons, and new choir stalls. He also repositioned and rebuilt the organ (1907). Further work was interrupted by the war.\nA number of memorials to the war were added to the cathedral, notably the painting \"The Passing of Eleanor\" by Frank Salisbury (stolen 1973) and the reglazing of the main west window, dedicated in 1925.\nFollowing the Enabling Act of 1919, control of the buildings passed to a Parochial Church Council (replaced by the Cathedral Council in 1968), who appointed the woodwork specialist John Rogers as Architect and Surveyor of the Fabric. He uncovered extensive death watch beetle damage in the presbytery vault and oversaw the repair (1930\u201331). He had four tons of rubbish removed from the crossing tower and the main timbers reinforced (1931\u201332), and invested in the extensive use of insecticide throughout the wood structures. In 1934, the eight bells were overhauled and four new bells added to be used in the celebration of George V's silver jubilee.\nCecil Brown was architect and surveyor from 1939 to 1962. At first he merely oversaw the lowering of the bells for the war and established a fire watch, with the pump in the slype. After the war, in the 1950s, the organ was removed, rebuilt and reinstalled, and new pews added. His major work was on the crossing tower. Grimthorpe's cement was found to be damaging the Roman bricks: every brick in the tower was replaced as needed and reset in proper mortar by one man, Walter Barrett. The tower ceiling was renovated as were the nave murals. Brown established the Muniments Room to gather and hold all the church documents.\nIn 1972, to encourage a closer link between celebrant and congregation in the nave, the massive nine-tonne pulpit along with the choir stalls and permanent pews was dismantled and removed. The altar space was enlarged and improved. New 'lighter' wood (limed oak) choir stalls were put in, and chairs replaced the pews. A new wooden pulpit was acquired from a Norfolk church and installed in 1974. External floodlighting was added in 1975.\nA major survey in 1974 revealed new leaks, decay and other deterioration, and a ten-year restoration plan was agreed. Again the roofing required much work. The nave and clerestory roofs were repaired in four stages with new leading. The nave project was completed in 1984 at a total cost of \u00a31.75 million. The clerestory windows were repaired with the corroded iron replaced with delta bronze and other Grimthorpe work on the clerestory was replaced. Seventy-two new heads for the corbel table were made. Grimthorpe's west front was cracking, again due to the use originally of too strong a mortar, and was repaired.\nA new visitors' centre was proposed in 1970. Planning permission was sought in 1973; there was a public inquiry and approval was granted in 1977. Constructed to the south side of the cathedral, close to the site of the original chapter house of the Abbey, the new 'Chapter House' cost around \u00a31 million and was officially opened on 8 June 1982 by Queen Elizabeth II. The main building material was 500,000 replica Roman bricks.\nOther late 20th-century works include the restoration of Alban's shrine, with a new embroidered canopy, and the stained glass designed by Alan Younger for Grimthorpe's north transept rose window, unveiled in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2015 seven new painted stone statues by Rory Young were installed in the medieval niches in the nave screen. This was a rare occurrence, as the last painted figures placed in a church screen were put there before the Reformation and the English Civil War.\n21st century.\nThe shrine of St Amphibalus was restored between 2019 and 2021, funded by a grant and the contribution of over a thousand donors. Due to be unveiled in 2020, work was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a new figure wearing a face mask was added to commemorate this.\nModern times.\nThe bishop of St Albans is Alan Smith, installed in September 2009. Jonathan Smith is Archdeacon of St Albans, installed in October 2008. On 4 December 2021, Jo Kelly-Moore became the tenth dean of the cathedral.\nRobert Runcie, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was Bishop of St Albans from 1970 to 1980 and returned to live in the city after his retirement; he is commemorated by a gargoyle on the cathedral as well as being buried in the graveyard. Colin Slee, former dean of Southwark Cathedral, was sub-dean at St Albans under Runcie and the then dean, Peter Moore. The bishop's residence, Abbey Gate House, is in Abbey Mill Lane, St Albans, as is the house of the bishop of Hertford. Eric James, Chaplain Extraordinary to the Queen, was canon at St Albans for many years.\nDean and chapter.\nAs of 1 July 25:\nMinor Canons\nMusic and choirs.\nOrganists.\nThe master of the music and the assistant master of the music share the responsibility of directing the St Albans Cathedral Choir and the St Albans Cathedral Girls' Choir respectively.\nThe earliest known name of an organist at St Albans is Adam from the early 13th century. Robert Fayrfax, the prominent English Renaissance composer, is recorded as being organist from 1498 to 1502, and was buried there following his death some 20 years later. Since 1820 the post of organist and master of the music has been held by a number of well-known musicians, including Peter Hurford, Stephen Darlington and Barry Rose. The current master of the music, since 1998, is Andrew Lucas. The assistant master of music at the cathedral is sometimes also the master of music at St Albans School \u2014 for example, Simon Lindley and Andrew Parnell.\nSince 1963 the cathedral has been home to the St Albans International Organ Festival, founded by Peter Hurford, and winners of which include Dame Gillian Weir, Thomas Trotter and Naji Hakim.\nBells.\nIn total, there are 23 bells housed in the tower. The main ring of 12 bells (with a sharp 2nd) was cast in 2010 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. These replaced the previous ring, 8 of which still remain in the tower and are used for the clock chime and carillon; the carillon plays a different tune every day of the week.\nIn the 17th century the cathedral housed a ring of 5 bells, until they were recast and augmented to 6 in 1699. In 1731 the bells were augmented to a ring of 8 by adding two new bells. Finally, in 2010 the 13 new bells were cast, and were rung for the first time at Easter 2011. The oldest bell in the tower was cast in c.1290 and is still used today as the sanctus bell.\n*Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford (1414\u201355)\n*Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (1392/1393\u20131455)\n*Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1406\u201355)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. \"Bob\" Dobbs is the figurehead of the parody religion\nthe Church of the SubGenius. His image is derived from a collection of clip art distributed by the Bell Telephone Company of West Texas in 1946.\nAccording to SubGenius dogma, \"Bob\" was a salesman who, in 1953, saw a vision of the god JHVH-1 on a television set he had built. The vision inspired him to write or dictate the \"PreScriptures\" (as described in the \"Book of the SubGenius\") and found the Church. The theology holds that \"Bob\" is the greatest salesman who ever lived, and has cheated death a number of times. He is also revered for his great follies and believed to be a savior of \"Slack\". He was assassinated in San Francisco in 1984, though the Church claims that he has come back from the dead several times since then.\nThe quotation marks in \"Bob\"'s name are always included when spelling his name, according to the Church.\nPersonal history.\nAccording to \"Revelation X; The \"Bob\" Apocryphon\", \"Bob\" was born in Dallas, Texas, to Xinucha-Chi-Xan M. Dobbs (a pharmacist) and Jane McBride Dobbs. At an early age, he possessed a talent for making large amounts of money by playing the stock market over the telephone. He married his wife Constance \"Connie\" Marsh in Las Vegas in 1955 and worked as a photographer's model while inventing and patenting novelty gag items. In 1957, he worked weekends doing Evangelical Christian preaching \"strictly for the money\".\nConnie Dobbs.\nConstance \"Connie\" Marsh Dobbs, the wife of \"Bob\", has become nearly as legendary in SubGenius circles as \"Bob\". Although \"Bob\" has been married to other women, spirits, deities, and inanimate objects, Connie is described in the SubGenius documentary \"Arise!\" as \"his first, and \"still\" his primary wife\". Connie, an actress and model who formed the Home for Slackless Children, is the patron of SubGenius women, and she is seen as a vision of true liberation for women. She refuses to submit to anyone (especially \"Bob\"). She is just as free-wheeling and promiscuous as her husband, although she has a more level head on her shoulders when it comes to domestic issues.\nConnie has been described as the \"brains\" of the couple, she wrote at a 4th grade level when in 1st grade and let \"Bob\" copy her homework when they were children. She is also said to be a shapeshifter who celebrated her 100th birthday, and sang, danced, and spoke, at a gathering in 2022.\nDobbstown.\nAccording to Church lore, \"Bob\" and \"Connie\" travelled to Sarawak, Malaysia, and founded his headquarters, a secret enclave there, called Dobbstown, where he often stays.\nImages of \"Bob\".\n\"Bob\"'s image first appeared in the original SubGenius publication, \"SubGenius Pamphlet #1\" (a.k.a. \"The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die\"; 1979). The Church of the SubGenius maintains the trademark and copyright on \"Bob\"'s image, though it has tried to avoid taking legal action unless absolutely necessary. \"Bob\"'s image is commonly seen on the Usenet newsgroup alt.binaries.slack, where he appears regularly in images by many artists. Proper etiquette on the newsgroup dictates that credit be given where it is due, and acknowledgement of the ownership of \"Bob\"'s image by the Church is accepted by the regular newsgroup participants.\nThe picture of \"Bob\" is also used in one of the earliest Linux distributions, Slackware, created by Patrick Volkerding, a member of the Church.\nIn 2012, a member of the Virginia Newspaper Project who was archiving 1956 copies of the \"Blue Ridge Herald\" found an advertisement for Edward's Drug Store in Leesburg, Virginia, that included the floating head of a pipe-smoking character similar in appearance to \"Bob\".\nSacred Ikon.\nAround 2002, the Church adopted a new symbol called the \"Sacred Ikon\" or \"Dobbs Ikon\", which is a stylized cross consisting of three bars and a pipe, placed in a pattern that matches the eyes, nose, mouth, and pipe of \"Bob\"'s image.\nIn popular culture.\nSince his initial appearance, his face has appeared in numerous places around the world, and it has made cameo appearances on everything from graffiti art on highway overpasses and as part of the graphical character set of the Atari ST operating system, to musical albums by many underground bands (and several popular mainstream rock bands, ranging from Devo to Sublime) and the occasional film (\"The Wizard of Speed and Time\"), TV show (\"Pee-wee's Playhouse\") and cartoon (\"SpongeBob SquarePants\"). There are also two German comics with \"Bob\" (\"Future Subjunkies\" and \"Space Bastards\", both by Gerhard Seyfried and Ziska Riemann).\nRobert Anton Wilson's short story \"The Horror on Howth Hill\" involves a conversation between Dobbs and the mad scientist De Selby.\nJ. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs served as the inspiration for the character of Professor Utonium in the cartoon \"The Powerpuff Girls\". The DC Comics character Doc Magnus also bears a strong visual resemblance to \"Bob\".\nIn its January 1, 2000, issue, a \"Time\" Internet-based poll named J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs the No.\u202f1 \"Phoney or Fraud\" of the 20th century, with noted journalist Geraldo Rivera placing second.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally founded as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n19th century.\n\"Huntingdon Normal School\", a normal school, was established by a young Huntingdon physician, Andrew B. Brumbaugh, and his two cousins, Henry and John Brumbaugh. Henry provided a second-story room over his local print shop for classes, while John lodged and fed the college's first teacher, Jacob M. Zuck. Andrew was to \"provide students and furniture\". Juniata's first classes were held on April 17, 1876, with professor Zuck teaching Rebecca Cornelius, Maggie D. Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh (the only son of physician Andrew Brumbaugh).\nIn 1877, the school changed its name to the \"Brethren Normal School\". At this time, Zuck also discussed adding a \"Scientific Course\" and issuing \"Certificates of Graduation\". In 1879, classes were moved into Founder's Hall, the school's first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as \"The Building\". On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32, which he probably caught from sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater. James Quinter was then chosen to lead the school as the school's first president.\nIn 1894, due to a ruling at the Brethren Church's Annual Meeting against using the term \"Brethren\" in naming a school, the college's name was changed to \"Juniata College\" for the nearby Juniata River. This was made the school's legal name two decades later in 1896.\nIn 1895, Martin Grove Brumbaugh (1862-1930), of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, an 1881 graduate from the Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the presidency of Juniata College, leading the growing institution until 1910. He later became the 26th Governor of Pennsylvania. Governor Brumbaugh returned to Huntingdon and Juniata College in 1924 to again assume the office of college president, which he held until his death, six years later, in March 1930, while on vacation in North Carolina.\nPresidents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCampus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe main campus area is , and the college manages a Baker-Henry Nature Preserve. Two new buildings since 2000 include the von Liebig Center for Science and the Suzanne von Liebig Theatre. Founders Hall, the first building on campus, has also been renovated recently. Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a LEED Gold building.\nOther off-campus sites include the Baker Peace Chapel, designed by Maya Lin, and the cliffs, all of which have views of the Juniata River. The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a reserve on Raystown Lake, which includes a LEED Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics.\nAthletics.\nJuniata is a Division III collegiate sports institution. It is a charter member of the Landmark Conference, where it competes in all sports. The athletic teams are known as the Juniata Eagles.\nFootball.\nThe Juniata College football program is a member of the Landmark Conference. The Goal Post Trophy goes to the winner of the annual football game with rival Susquehanna University. It is a section of the goal post that was torn down after the 1952 Juniata-Susquehanna game. The visiting Indians (now Eagles) upset the Crusaders (now River Hawks) in Selinsgrove, and Juniata fans tore down the goal post after the game.\nVolleyball.\nJuniata College is known for both its men's and women's volleyball program. The men's volleyball team competes in the Continental Volleyball Conference; it previously competed in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, where it won several titles, even while under Division I and Division III sanctions.\nIn 2022, 2023, and 2024 the Juniata women's volleyball team won the NCAA D-III national championship. In 2023 and 2024 the Eagles completed a perfect season, going 35-0, earning the NCAA DII and DIII volleyball record for consecutive wins with 103\nNotable people.\nNotable alumni.\nNotable alumni include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder, lead vocalist and keyboardist of the new wave band Devo, whose \"Whip It\" was a top 20 single in the US in 1980, peaking at No. 14, and which has since maintained a cult following. Mothersbaugh was one of the primary composers of Devo's music.\nIn addition to his work with Devo, Mothersbaugh has made music for television series, films and video games via his production company, Mutato Muzika. He composed the music for the 13-year run of the animated series \"Rugrats\" and its three related theatrical films. He has created film scores for Wes Anderson and for Marvel Comics films. As a solo musician, Mothersbaugh has released four studio albums: \"Muzik for Insomniaks\", \"Muzik for the Gallery\", \"Joyeux Mutato\" and \"The Most Powerful Healing Muzik in the Entire World\".\nIn 2004, he received the Richard Kirk award at the BMI Film and TV Awards for his contributions to film and television music. In 2008, Mothersbaugh received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University, his alma mater.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly years.\nMark Allen Mothersbaugh was born on May 18, 1950, in Akron, Ohio. His parents are Mary Margaret (\"Mig\") and Robert Mothersbaugh Sr. He grew up with two younger brothers, Bob and Jim, who are both musicians, and two sisters, Amy and Susan, and graduated from Woodridge High School in Peninsula, Ohio.\nHis father appeared in early Devo films and fan events as the character General Boy and his brothers participated in the band, although Jim's tenure was brief, appearing only on several early demos.\nCareer.\nDevo.\nMothersbaugh attended Kent State University as an art student, where he met Devo co-founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis. In early 1970, Lewis and Casale formed the idea of the \"devolution\" of the human race after Casale's friends Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen on university grounds during what came to be known as the Kent State shootings. Intrigued by the concept, Mothersbaugh joined them, building upon it with elements of early post-structuralist ideas and oddball arcana, most notably unearthing the infamous \"Jocko-Homo Heavenbound\" pamphlet (the basis for the song \"Jocko Homo\"). This association culminated in 1973, when the trio started to play music as Devo.\nFollowing the commercial failure of their sixth studio album \"Shout\", Warner Bros. dropped Devo. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, drummer Alan Myers left the band, causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a \"Shout\" video LP, as well as a tour.\nIn 1987, Devo reformed with new drummer David Kendrick, formerly of Sparks, to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film \"Slaughterhouse Rock\", starring Toni Basil and they released the studio albums \"Total Devo\" (1988) and \"Smooth Noodle Maps\" (1990), on Enigma.\nDevo had a falling-out and played two shows in 1991 before breaking up. Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film \"The Spirit of '76\" (1990), except for Bob Mothersbaugh. In 1989, Mark Mothersbaugh established Mutato Muzika, a commercial music production studio, hiring Ryan Moore and Bob Casale; Bob Mothersbaugh was also involved.\nIn 2006, Devo worked with Disney on the Devo 2.0 project: a band of child performers was assembled to re-record Devo songs. The \"Akron Beacon Journal\" wrote, \"Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut studio album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled \"DEV2.0\", was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for family-friendly airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits. Mothersbaugh doesn't rule out the idea of the band gathering in the studio, eventually, to record a new Devo album.\" The studio album, \"Something for Everybody\" was eventually released in June 2010, preceded by a 12\" single of \"Fresh\"/\"What We Do\".\nDevo was awarded the first Moog Innovator Award on October 29, 2010, during Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. The award aims to celebrate \"pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog\". Devo was scheduled to perform at Moogfest, but canceled three days beforehand after Mark's brother Bob Mothersbaugh (lead guitar) injured his hand. He and Gerald Casale collaborated with Austin, Texas, band the Octopus Project to perform \"Girl U Want\" and \"Beautiful World\" at the event instead.\nOther work.\nIn 1989, Mothersbaugh and other members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled extended play (EP) on the New Rose label in 1990. The group featured his then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob's daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh co-wrote some of the songs, and produced the album with Bob Casale. A promotional video was filmed for the song \"Trilobites\". Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film \"Rockula\", as well as on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\nSince Devo, Mothersbaugh has developed a successful career writing musical scores for film and television. In film, he has worked frequently with filmmaker Wes Anderson, scoring four of his feature films: \"Bottle Rocket\" (1996), \"Rushmore\" (1998), \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), and \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" (2004). He composed for \"The Lego Movie\" (2014) and \"\" (2017).\nHis music has been a staple of the children's television shows \"Rugrats\", \"Beakman's World\", \"Santo Bugito\" and \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\". He wrote the new theme song for the original \"Felix the Cat\" show when it was sold to Broadway Video, some music for \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" in 1986\u20131990 and the theme song for the \"Super Mario World\" TV series for DIC Entertainment in 1991. The character design for Chuckie on \"Rugrats\" was loosely based on him. Along with Bob Casale, he produced \"Heroes &amp; Villains\" (2000), a soundtrack album with music inspired by \"The Powerpuff Girls\". Mothersbaugh originally sought out to be the show's main composer, but his demo was rejected by creator Craig McCracken, who despite being a Devo fan, had concerns about his cartoon being pushed aside if a big feature film came to Mothersbaugh's production company.\nMothersbaugh produces music for video games, including Sony's \"Crash Bandicoot\" and \"Jak and Daxter\" series (both music scores were created by Josh Mancell), and for EA Games' \"The Sims 2\" (2004). This work is often performed with Mutato Muzika, the music production company he formed with several other former members of Devo including his brother, Bob Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh composed the original score for \"\" (2021).\nMothersbaugh composed:\nIn 2013, Mothersbaugh appeared on an episode of \"The Aquabats! Super Show!\", an action-comedy series by the creators of \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\" starring the Devo-influenced band the Aquabats, playing the eccentric scientist father of one of the main characters, Jimmy the Robot.\nMothersbaugh and Casale have produced music for other artists, including Toni Basil.\nVisual art and exhibitions.\nMothersbaugh has also been successful as a visual artist. In November 2014, Mothersbaugh said, \"I've done over 150 art gallery shows in the last 20 years.\"\nOn February 6, 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (MCA Denver) announced a retrospective exhibition to bring together the first comprehensive presentation of Mothersbaugh's art and music. This nationally touring exhibition was accompanied by a publication, \"Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia\", published by Princeton Architectural Press. 50 selections of postcard art from \"Myopia\" were published as a postcard book titled \"Mark Mothersbaugh: Collected Facts &amp; Lies\" in 2015.\nAs a prelude to the \"Myopia\" exhibit opening in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mothersbaugh held a concert gathering which included Devo songs and movie scores played in a classical style, an address to the audience with anecdotes, and musical pieces he specifically composed for a six-keyboard hybrid originally used for teaching lessons, that was refurbished by his brother Bob and contained a counter in the center for keeping time. The instrument was played by six people simultaneously.\nMothersbaugh hosted a drawing segment on the Nick Jr. Channel television series \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\" called Mark's Magic Pictures, teaching children how to draw simple pictures. The pictures often come alive at the end of the segment through animation.\nPersonal life.\nAt the age of seven, Mothersbaugh began wearing glasses to correct his severe myopia and astigmatism. Over the years, he took an interest in designing his own distinctive eyewear for use in Devo shows. He favored a set of stainless steel frames for regular use made by a Los Angeles shop called LA Eyeworks and says he purchased as many pairs as he could find because they tended to break or get stolen by fans. In a joint venture with eyewear manufacturer Shane Baum, Mothersbaugh has designed his own branded frames for sale, made of beryllium with a stainless steel chrome finish, in three different styles as of 2015. The Baumvision press release states that the unisex model \"Francesca\" is named for one of Mothersbaugh's pug dogs which is a simultaneous hermaphrodite that is also called Frank.\nIn a 2016 interview, Mothersbaugh mentioned having attention deficit disorder (ADD).\nHe has been married twice. His first wife was actress Nancye Ferguson, who can be seen briefly performing with him in the 1999 superhero comedy film \"Mystery Men\". His current wife is Anita Greenspan, who runs the film music managing company Greenspan Kohan Management with Neil Kohan. The couple has two daughters from China, adopted after Greenspan learned of the practice in that country of female children being abandoned because of their gender.\nMothersbaugh is a collector and connoisseur of song poems and unusual or vintage musical devices. He is the owner of Raymond Scott's Electronium (although it is currently not functional).\nMothersbaugh contracted COVID-19 in May 2020, and was placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for 18 days. In August 2020, Mothersbaugh recounted that he \"nearly died\" of the disease, and was in a delusional state while infected; he came to believe that he had been hospitalized after being hit by a brick in Little Tokyo, and repeatedly urged his family members to search for his attackers. He described having lasting neuropathic pain as a result of the illness. He also lost most of his vision in his right eye during the first few days in the ICU while intubated. The condition was determined not to have been caused by COVID and cannot be repaired. He says the eye's vision is now permanently blurred like what he saw as a child, and calls himself a \"cyclops\".\nMothersbaugh was once a member of the parody religion the Church of the SubGenius.\nHonors and awards.\nMothersbaugh was honored with the Richard Kirk Award at the 2004 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer of film and television music.\nOn May 10, 2008, Mothersbaugh was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University.\nOn May 28, 2016, Mothersbaugh was awarded the key to the city of Akron during a ceremony at the Akron-Summit County Public Library.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nSolo.\nStudio albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his \"Pavane\", Requiem, \"Sicilienne\", nocturnes for piano and the songs \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" and \"Clair de lune\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style.\nFaur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a young boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, he was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Faur\u00e9's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.\nFaur\u00e9's music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Faur\u00e9's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nFaur\u00e9 was born in Pamiers, Ari\u00e8ge, in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 Faur\u00e9 and Marie-Antoinette-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lal\u00e8ne-Laprade. According to the biographer Jean-Michel Nectoux, the Faur\u00e9 family dates to the 13th century in that part of France. The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced. The composer's paternal grandfather, Gabriel, was a butcher whose son became a schoolmaster. In 1829 Faur\u00e9's parents married. His mother was the daughter of a minor member of the nobility. He was the only one of the six children to display musical talent; his four brothers pursued careers in journalism, politics, the army and the civil service, and his sister had a traditional life as the wife of a public servant.\nThe young Faur\u00e9 was sent to live with a foster mother until he was four years old. When his father was appointed director of the \u00c9cole Normale d'Instituteurs, a teacher training college, at Montgauzy, near Foix, in 1849, Faur\u00e9 returned to live with his family. There was a chapel attached to the school, which Faur\u00e9 recalled in the last year of his life:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I grew up, a rather quiet well-behaved child, in an area of great beauty.\u00a0... But the only thing I remember really clearly is the harmonium in that little chapel. Every time I could get away I ran there\u00a0\u2013 and I regaled myself.\u00a0... I played atrociously\u00a0... no method at all, quite without technique, but I do remember that I was happy; and if that is what it means to have a vocation, then it is a very pleasant thing.\nAn old blind woman, who came to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Faur\u00e9's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Faur\u00e9 play and advised Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 to send him to the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer de Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After reflecting for a year, Faur\u00e9's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.\nHelped by a scholarship from the bishop of his home diocese, Faur\u00e9 boarded at the school for 11 years. The r\u00e9gime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Faur\u00e9's tutors were Cl\u00e9ment Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.\nWhen Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns took charge of piano studies and introduced contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. Faur\u00e9 recalled in old age, \"After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known.\u00a0... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment\u00a0... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life.\"\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns took great pleasure in his pupil's progress, which he helped whenever he could; Nectoux comments that at each step in Faur\u00e9's career \"Saint-Sa\u00ebns's shadow can effectively be taken for granted.\" The close friendship between them lasted until Saint-Sa\u00ebns died sixty years later.\nFaur\u00e9 won many prizes while at the school, including a \"premier prix\" in composition for the \"Cantique de Jean Racine\", Op. 11, the earliest of his choral works to enter the regular repertory. He left the school in July 1865, as a \"Laureat\" in organ, piano, harmony and composition, with a \"Ma\u00eetre de chapelle\" diploma.\nOrganist and composer.\nOn leaving the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer, Faur\u00e9 was appointed organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He took up the post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving \"countless piano lessons\". At Saint-Sa\u00ebns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Faur\u00e9's religious conviction. Faur\u00e9 was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for a cigarette, and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, he was asked to resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Sa\u00ebns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and Cr\u00e9teil. He was awarded a \"Croix de Guerre\".\nAfter France's defeat by Prussia, there was a brief, bloody conflict within Paris from March to May 1871 during the Commune. Faur\u00e9 escaped to Rambouillet where one of his brothers lived, and then travelled to Switzerland, where he took up a teaching post at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer, which had temporarily relocated there to avoid the violence in Paris. His first pupil at the school was Andr\u00e9 Messager, who became a lifelong friend and occasional collaborator. Faur\u00e9's compositions from this period did not overtly reflect the turmoil and bloodshed. Some of his colleagues, including Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Gounod and Franck, produced elegies and patriotic odes. Faur\u00e9 did not, but according to his biographer Jessica Duchen, his music acquired \"a new sombreness, a dark-hued sense of tragedy\u00a0... evident mainly in his songs of this period including \"L'Absent\", \"Seule!\" and \"La Chanson du p\u00eacheur\".\"\nWhen Faur\u00e9 returned to Paris in October 1871, he was appointed choirmaster at the \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice under the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor. In the course of his duties, he wrote several canticles and motets, few of which have survived. During some services, Widor and Faur\u00e9 improvised simultaneously at the church's two organs, trying to catch each other out with sudden changes of key. Faur\u00e9 regularly attended Saint-Sa\u00ebns's musical salons and those of Pauline Viardot, to whom Saint-Sa\u00ebns introduced him.\nFaur\u00e9 was a founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, to promote new French music. Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, C\u00e9sar Franck, \u00c9douard Lalo and Jules Massenet. Faur\u00e9 became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.\nIn 1874 Faur\u00e9 moved from Saint-Sulpice to the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine, acting as deputy for the principal organist, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, during the latter's many absences on tour. Some admirers of Faur\u00e9's music have expressed regret that although he played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument. He was renowned for his improvisations, and Saint-Sa\u00ebns said of him that he was \"a first class organist when he wanted to be\". Faur\u00e9 preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only because it gave him a regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because \"for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough.\"\nThe year 1877 was significant for Faur\u00e9, both professionally and personally. In January his first violin sonata was performed at a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing career at the age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer's first great masterpiece. In March, Saint-Sa\u00ebns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by Th\u00e9odore Dubois, his choirmaster; Faur\u00e9 was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July Faur\u00e9 became engaged to Pauline Viardot's daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear. To distract Faur\u00e9, Saint-Sa\u00ebns took him to Weimar and introduced him to Franz Liszt. This visit gave Faur\u00e9 a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged for the rest of his life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" at the Cologne Opera; the complete \"Ring\" cycle at the Hofoper in Munich and at Her Majesty's Theatre in London; and \"Die Meistersinger\" in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw \"Parsifal\". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\". This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from \"The Ring\". Faur\u00e9 admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.\nMiddle years.\nIn 1883 Faur\u00e9 married Marie Fremiet, the daughter of a leading sculptor, Emmanuel Fremiet. Nectoux comments that Marie was \"without beauty, wit or a fortune ... narrow and cold\", but records that \"in spite of everything [Faur\u00e9] still felt a tenderness towards her\". The marriage was affectionate, but Marie was, in Nectoux's phrase, \"a stay-at-home\", and she did not share her husband's wish to go out in the evenings, and became resentful of his frequent absences, his dislike of domestic life\u00a0\u2013 \"horreur du domicile\"\u00a0\u2013 and his love affairs, while she remained at home. Though Faur\u00e9 valued Marie as a friend and confidante, writing to her often\u00a0\u2013 sometimes daily\u00a0\u2013 when away from home, she did not share his passionate nature, which found fulfilment elsewhere. Faur\u00e9 and his wife had two sons. The first, born in 1883, Emmanuel Faur\u00e9-Fremiet (Marie insisted on combining her family name with Faur\u00e9's), became a biologist of international reputation. The second son, Philippe, born in 1889, became a writer; his works included histories, plays, and biographies of his father and grandfather.\nContemporary accounts agree that Faur\u00e9 was extremely attractive to women; in Duchen's phrase, \"his conquests were legion in the Paris salons.\" After a romantic attachment to the singer Emma Bardac from around 1892, followed by another to the composer Adela Maddison, in 1900 Faur\u00e9 met the pianist Marguerite Hasselmans, the daughter of Alphonse Hasselmans. This led to a relationship which lasted for the rest of Faur\u00e9's life. He maintained her in a Paris apartment, and she acted openly as his companion.\nTo support his family, Faur\u00e9 spent most of his time in running the daily services at the Madeleine and giving piano and harmony lessons. His compositions earned him a negligible amount, because his publisher bought them outright, paying him an average of 60 francs for a song, and Faur\u00e9 received no royalties. During this period, he wrote several large-scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed most of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motifs. Among the works surviving from this period is the Requiem, begun in 1887 and revised and expanded, over the years, until its final version dating from 1901. After its first performance, in 1888, the priest in charge told the composer, \"We don't need these novelties: the Madeleine's repertoire is quite rich enough.\"\nAs a young man Faur\u00e9 had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his \"youthful, even somewhat child-like, mirth.\" From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as \"spleen\", possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by Paul Verlaine was aborted by the poet's drunken inability to deliver a libretto. Faur\u00e9 was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health. Winnaretta de Scey-Montb\u00e9liard, always a good friend to Faur\u00e9, invited him to Venice, where she had a \"palazzo\" on the Grand Canal. He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing the first of his five \"M\u00e9lodies de Venise\", to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.\nAbout this time, or shortly afterwards, Faur\u00e9's liaison with Emma Bardac began; in Duchen's words, \"for the first time, in his late forties, he experienced a fulfilling, passionate relationship which extended over several years\". His principal biographers all agree that this affair inspired a burst of creativity and a new originality in his music, exemplified in the song cycle \"La bonne chanson\". Faur\u00e9 wrote the \"Dolly Suite\" for piano duet between 1894 and 1897 and dedicated it to Bardac's daughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, known as \"Dolly\". Some people suspected that Faur\u00e9 was Dolly's father, but biographers including Nectoux and Duchen think it unlikely. Faur\u00e9's affair with Emma Bardac is thought to have begun after Dolly was born, though there is no conclusive evidence either way.\nDuring the 1890s Faur\u00e9's fortunes improved. When Ernest Guiraud, professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, died in 1892, Saint-Sa\u00ebns encouraged Faur\u00e9 to apply for the vacant post. The faculty of the Conservatoire regarded Faur\u00e9 as dangerously modern, and its head, Ambroise Thomas, blocked the appointment, declaring, \"Faur\u00e9? Never! If he's appointed, I resign.\" However, Faur\u00e9 was appointed to another of Guiraud's posts, inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces. He disliked the prolonged travelling around the country that the work entailed, but the post gave him a steady income and enabled him to give up teaching amateur pupils.\nIn 1896 Ambroise Thomas died, and Th\u00e9odore Dubois took over as head of the Conservatoire. Faur\u00e9 succeeded Dubois as chief organist of the Madeleine. Dubois' move had further repercussions: Massenet, professor of composition at the Conservatoire, had expected to succeed Thomas, but had overplayed his hand by insisting on being appointed for life. He was turned down, and when Dubois was appointed instead, Massenet resigned his professorship in fury. Faur\u00e9 was appointed in his place. He taught many young composers, including Maurice Ravel, Florent Schmitt, Charles Koechlin, Louis Aubert, Jean Roger-Ducasse, George Enescu, Paul Ladmirault, Alfredo Casella and Nadia Boulanger. In Faur\u00e9's view, his students needed a firm grounding in the basic skills, which he was happy to delegate to his capable assistant Andr\u00e9 Gedalge. His own part came in helping them make use of these skills in the way that suited each student's talents. Roger-Ducasse later wrote, \"Taking up whatever the pupils were working on, he would evoke the rules of the form at hand\u00a0... and refer to examples, always drawn from the masters.\" Ravel always remembered Faur\u00e9's open-mindedness as a teacher. Having received Ravel's String Quartet with less than his usual enthusiasm, Faur\u00e9 asked to see the manuscript again a few days later, saying, \"I could have been wrong\". The musicologist Henry Pruni\u00e8res wrote, \"What Faur\u00e9 developed among his pupils was taste, harmonic sensibility, the love of pure lines, of unexpected and colorful modulations; but he never gave them [recipes] for composing according to his style and that is why they all sought and found their own paths in many different, and often opposed, directions.\"\nFaur\u00e9's works of the last years of the century include incidental music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (1898) and \"Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e\", a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at B\u00e9ziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at B\u00e9ziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter.\nFrom 1903 to 1921, Faur\u00e9 regularly wrote music criticism for \"Le Figaro\", a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Faur\u00e9's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the positive aspects of a work.\nHead of Paris Conservatoire.\nIn 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Faur\u00e9's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Faur\u00e9 radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Faur\u00e9 was dubbed \"Robespierre\" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, \"where Auber, Hal\u00e9vy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme\u00a0... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner\u00a0\u2013 up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls\". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy.\nFaur\u00e9's new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, \"P\u00e9n\u00e9lope\" (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle \"La chanson d'\u00c8ve\", Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9\u201311; Barcarolles Nos. 7\u201311, written between 1906 and 1914).\nFaur\u00e9 was elected to the Institut de France in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 musicale ind\u00e9pendante. While Faur\u00e9 accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid.\nDuring this time, Faur\u00e9 developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.\nThe turn of the 20th century saw a rise in the popularity of Faur\u00e9's music in Britain, and to a lesser extent in Germany, Spain and Russia. He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at Buckingham Palace in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond. He was in London for the premiere of Elgar's First Symphony in 1908 and dined with the composer. Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend Frank Schuster that Faur\u00e9 \"was such a real gentleman\u00a0\u2013 the highest kind of Frenchman and I admired him greatly.\" Elgar tried to get Faur\u00e9's Requiem put on at the Three Choirs Festival, but it did not finally have its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France. Composers from other countries also loved and admired Faur\u00e9. In the 1880s Tchaikovsky had thought him \"adorable\"; Alb\u00e9niz and Faur\u00e9 were friends and correspondents until the former's early death in 1909; Richard Strauss sought his advice; and in Faur\u00e9's last years, the young American Aaron Copland was a devoted admirer.\nThe outbreak of the First World War almost stranded Faur\u00e9 in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France for the duration of the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Sa\u00ebns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Faur\u00e9 and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Sa\u00ebns. Faur\u00e9 did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art \"a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation.\" Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, \"The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's no question about it, French and German are two different things.\"\nLast years and legacy.\nIn 1920, at the age of 75, Faur\u00e9 retired from the Conservatoire because of his increasing deafness and frailty. In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, Alexandre Millerand, led a public tribute to Faur\u00e9, a national \"hommage\", described in \"The Musical Times\" as \"a splendid celebration at the Sorbonne, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [which] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note. He sat gazing before him pensively, and, in spite of everything, grateful and content.\"\nFaur\u00e9 suffered from poor health in his later years, brought on in part by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of Les Six, most of whom were devoted to him. Nectoux writes, \"In old age he attained a kind of serenity, without losing any of his remarkable spiritual vitality, but rather removed from the sensualism and the passion of the works he wrote between 1875 and 1895.\"\nIn his last months, Faur\u00e9 struggled to complete his String Quartet. Twenty years earlier he had been the dedicatee of Ravel's String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Faur\u00e9 to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, on the grounds that it was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, \"I've started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be \"terrified\" of it.\" He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it. The quartet was premiered after his death; he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted in his ear.\nFaur\u00e9 died in Paris from pneumonia on 4 November 1924 at the age of 79. He was given a state funeral at the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and is buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris.\nAfter Faur\u00e9's death, the Conservatoire abandoned his radicalism and became resistant to new trends in music, with Faur\u00e9's own harmonic practice being held up as the farthest limit of modernity, beyond which students should not go. His successor, Henri Rabaud, director of the Conservatoire from 1922 to 1941, declared \"modernism is the enemy\". The generation of students born between the wars rejected this outdated premise, turning for inspiration to Bart\u00f3k, the Second Viennese School, and the latest works of Stravinsky.\nIn a centenary tribute in 1945, the musicologist Leslie Orrey wrote in \"The Musical Times\", \"'More profound than Saint-Sa\u00ebns, more varied than Lalo, more spontaneous than d'Indy, more classic than Debussy, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 is the master \"par excellence\" of French music, the perfect mirror of our musical genius.' Perhaps, when English musicians get to know his work better, these words of Roger-Ducasse will seem, not over-praise, but no more than his due.\"\nMusic.\nAaron Copland wrote that although Faur\u00e9's works can be divided into the usual \"early\", \"middle\" and \"late\" periods, there is no such radical difference between his first and last manners as is evident with many other composers. Copland found premonitions of late Faur\u00e9 in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Faur\u00e9 in the works of his old age: \"The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound.\" When Faur\u00e9 was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Faur\u00e9's early influences. In his later years Faur\u00e9 developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the atonal music of Schoenberg, and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz. Duchen writes that early works such as the \"Cantique de Jean Racine\" are in the tradition of French nineteenth-century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.\nInfluences on Faur\u00e9, particularly in his early work, included not only Chopin but Mozart and Schumann. The authors of \"The Record Guide\" (1955), Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, wrote that Faur\u00e9 learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\" His work was based on the strong understanding of harmonic structures that he gained at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer from Niedermeyer's successor Gustave Lef\u00e8vre. Lef\u00e8vre wrote the book \"Trait\u00e9 d'harmonie\" (Paris, 1889), in which he sets out a harmonic theory that differs significantly from the classical theory of Rameau, no longer outlawing certain chords as \"dissonant\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Faur\u00e9 anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers.\nIn contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Faur\u00e9's rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he used discreet syncopations, similar to those found in Brahms's works. Copland referred to him as \"the Brahms of France\". The music critic Jerry Dubins suggests that Faur\u00e9 \"represents the link between the late German Romanticism of Brahms\u00a0... and the French Impressionism of Debussy.\"\nTo Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, Faur\u00e9's later works do not display the easy charm of his earlier music: \"the luscious romantic harmony which had always been firmly supported by a single tonality, later gave way to a severely monochrome style, full of enharmonic shifts, and creating the impression of several tonal centres simultaneously employed.\"\nVocal music.\nFaur\u00e9 is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or \"m\u00e9lodie\". Ravel wrote in 1922 that Faur\u00e9 had saved French music from the dominance of the German \"Lied\". Two years later the critic Samuel Langford wrote of Faur\u00e9, \"More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought\". In a 2011 article the pianist and writer Roy Howat and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His devotion to the \"m\u00e9lodie\" spans his career, from the ever-fresh \"Le papillon et la fleur\" of 1861 to the masterly cycle \"L'horizon chim\u00e9rique\", composed sixty years and more than a hundred songs later. Faur\u00e9's songs are now core repertoire for students and professionals, sung in conservatories and recital halls throughout the world.\nIn Copland's view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" or \"Au bord de l'eau\", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of \"the real Faur\u00e9\". He instanced \"Les berceaux\", \"Les roses d'Ispahan\" and especially \"Clair de lune\" as \"so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America\", and drew attention to less well known m\u00e9lodies such as \"Le secret\", \"Nocturne\", and \"Les pr\u00e9sents\". Faur\u00e9 also composed a number of song cycles. \"Cinq m\u00e9lodies \"de Venise\"\", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Faur\u00e9 as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle \"La bonne chanson\", Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Faur\u00e9. He also wrote that \"La bonne chanson\" was his most spontaneous composition, with Emma Bardac singing back to him each day's newly written material. Among later works were cycles drawn from the poems of Charles van Lerberghe, \"La chanson d'\u00c8ve\" (1910) and \"Le jardin clos\" (1914). \nThe Requiem, Op. 48, first performed in 1888, was not composed to the memory of a specific person but, in Faur\u00e9's words, \"for the pleasure of it.\" It has been described as \"a lullaby of death\" because of its predominantly gentle tone. Faur\u00e9 omitted the Dies irae, though reference to the day of judgment appears in the Libera me, which, like Verdi, he added to the normal liturgical text. Faur\u00e9 revised the Requiem over the years, and a number of different performing versions are now in use, from the earliest, for small forces, to the final revision with full orchestra.\nFaur\u00e9's operas have not found a place in the regular repertoire. \"Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e\" is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered \"P\u00e9n\u00e9lope\" (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, \"distinctly non-theatrical.\" The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Faur\u00e9's late style, \"tonality is stretched hard, without breaking.\" On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, \"A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.\u00a0... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective.\" However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, \"Faur\u00e9's \"P\u00e9n\u00e9lope\" is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was.\"\nPiano works.\nFaur\u00e9's major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across the decades of his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are \"Romances sans paroles\", Ballade in F\u266f major, Mazurka in B\u266d major, \"Th\u00e8me et variations\" in C\u266f minor, and \"Huit pi\u00e8ces br\u00e8ves\". For piano duet, Faur\u00e9 composed the \"Dolly Suite\" and, together with his friend and former pupil Andr\u00e9 Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\".\nThe piano works often use arpeggiated figures, with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists. Even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he found Faur\u00e9's music hard to play. The early piano works are clearly influenced by Chopin. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Faur\u00e9 loved more than any other. In Copland's view, it was with the sixth Nocturne that Faur\u00e9 fully emerged from any predecessor's shadow. The pianist Alfred Cortot said, \"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the charming earlier piano works, such as the Impromptu No. 2, rather than the later piano works, which express \"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\" that listeners are left uneasy. In his piano music, as in most of his works, Faur\u00e9 shunned virtuosity in favour of the classical lucidity often associated with the French. He was unimpressed by purely virtuoso pianists, saying, \"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\"\nOrchestral and chamber works.\nFaur\u00e9 was not greatly interested in orchestration, and on occasion asked his former students such as Jean Roger-Ducasse and Charles Koechlin to orchestrate his concert and theatre works. In Nectoux's words, Faur\u00e9's generally sober orchestral style reflects \"a definite aesthetic attitude\u00a0... The idea of timbre was not a determining one in Faur\u00e9's musical thinking\". He was not attracted by flamboyant combinations of tone-colours, which he thought either self-indulgent or a disguise for lack of real musical invention. He told his students that it should be possible to produce an orchestration without resorting to glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, bells or electrical instruments. Debussy admired the spareness of Faur\u00e9's orchestration, finding in it the transparency he strove for in his own 1913 ballet \"Jeux\"; Poulenc, by contrast, described Faur\u00e9's orchestration as \"a leaden overcoat\u00a0... instrumental mud\". Faur\u00e9's best-known orchestral works are the suites \"Masques et bergamasques\" (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or \"divertissement comique\"), which he orchestrated himself, \"Dolly\", orchestrated by Henri Rabaud, and \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" which draws on incidental music for Maeterlinck's play; the stage version was orchestrated by Koechlin, but Faur\u00e9 himself reworked the orchestration for the published suite.\nIn the chamber repertoire, his two piano quartets, in C minor and G minor, particularly the former, are among Faur\u00e9's better-known works. His other chamber music includes two piano quintets, two cello sonatas, two violin sonatas, a piano trio and a string quartet. Copland (writing in 1924 before the string quartet was finished) held the second quintet (in C minor, Opus 115) to be Faur\u00e9's masterpiece: \"...\u00a0a pure well of spirituality\u00a0... extremely classic, as far removed as possible from the romantic temperament.\" Other critics have differed somewhat: \"The Record Guide\" commented, \"The ceaseless flow and restricted colour scheme of Faur\u00e9's last manner, as exemplified in this Quintet, need very careful management, if they are not to become tedious.\" Faur\u00e9's last work, the String Quartet, has been described by critics in \"Gramophone\" magazine as an intimate meditation on the last things, and \"an extraordinary work by any standards, ethereal and other-worldly with themes that seem constantly to be drawn skywards.\"\nRecordings.\nFaur\u00e9 made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. Well over a hundred recordings of Faur\u00e9's music were made between 1898 and 1905, mostly of songs, with a few short chamber works, by performers including the singers Jean Not\u00e9 and Pol Plan\u00e7on and players such as Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot. By the 1920s a range of Faur\u00e9's more popular songs were on record, including \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" sung by Olga Haley, and \"Automne\" and \"Clair de lune\" sung by Ninon Vallin. In the 1930s better-known performers recorded Faur\u00e9 pieces, including Georges Thill (\"En pri\u00e8re\"), and Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot (Violin Sonata No. 1 and Berceuse). The Sicilienne from \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" was recorded in 1938.\nBy the 1940s there were a few more Faur\u00e9 works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Th\u00e8me et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte. Faur\u00e9's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s. \"The Record Guide\", 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles \"La bonne chanson\" and \"La chanson d'\u00c8ve\".\nIn the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies have built up a substantial catalogue of Faur\u00e9's music, performed by French and non-French musicians. Several modern recordings of Faur\u00e9's music have come to public notice as prize-winners in annual awards organised by \"Gramophone\" and the BBC. Sets of his major orchestral works have been recorded under conductors including Michel Plasson (1981) and Yan Pascal Tortelier (1996). Faur\u00e9's main chamber works have all been recorded, with players including the Ysa\u00ffe Quartet, Domus, Paul Tortelier, Arthur Grumiaux, and Joshua Bell. The complete solo piano works have been recorded by Kathryn Stott (1995), Paul Crossley (1984\u201385) and Lucas Debargue (2021-2022) with substantial sets of the major piano works from Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, Jean-Philippe Collard (1982\u201384), Pascal Rog\u00e9 (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002). Faur\u00e9's songs have all been recorded for CD, including a complete set (2005), anchored by the accompanist Graham Johnson, with soloists Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court, Felicity Lott, John Mark Ainsley and Jennifer Smith, among others. The Requiem and the shorter choral works are also well represented on disc. \"P\u00e9n\u00e9lope\" has been recorded twice, with casts headed by R\u00e9gine Crespin in 1956, and Jessye Norman in 1981, conducted respectively by D\u00e9sir\u00e9-\u00c9mile Inghelbrecht and Charles Dutoit. \"Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e\" has not been recorded in full, but extensive excerpts were recorded under Roger Norrington (1980).\nModern assessment.\nA 2001 article on Faur\u00e9 in \"Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians\" concludes thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Faur\u00e9's stature as a composer is undiminished by the passage of time. He developed a musical idiom all his own; by subtle application of old modes, he evoked the aura of eternally fresh art; by using unresolved mild discords and special coloristic effects, he anticipated procedures of Impressionism; in his piano works, he shunned virtuosity in favor of the Classical lucidity of the French masters of the clavecin; the precisely articulated melodic line of his songs is in the finest tradition of French vocal music. His great Requiem and his \"\u00c9l\u00e9gie\" for Cello and Piano have entered the general repertoire.\nFaur\u00e9's biographer Nectoux writes in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" that Faur\u00e9 is widely regarded as the greatest master of French song, and that alongside the \"m\u00e9lodies\", the chamber works rank as \"Faur\u00e9's most important contribution to music\". The critic Robert Orledge writes, \"His genius was one of synthesis: he reconciled such opposing elements as modality and tonality, anguish and serenity, seduction and force within a single non-eclectic style, as in the \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" suite, his symphonic masterpiece. The quality of constant renewal within an apparently limited range\u00a0... is a remarkable facet of his genius, and the spare, elliptical style of his single String Quartet suggests that his intensely self-disciplined style was still developing at the time of his death\".\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It forms an affluent suburb of Oslo on the west coast of the city. B\u00e6rum is Norway's fifth largest municipality with a population of 128,760 (2021). The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. B\u00e6rum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838.\nB\u00e6rum has the highest income per capita in Norway and the highest proportion of university-educated individuals. B\u00e6rum, particularly its eastern neighbourhoods bordering West End Oslo, is one of Norway's priciest and most fashionable residential areas, leading B\u00e6rum residents to be frequently stereotyped as snobs in Norwegian popular culture. The municipality has been voted the best Norwegian place to live in considering governance and public services to citizens.\nName.\nThe name (Old Norse: \"Bergheimr\") is composed of \"berg\", which means \"mountain\", and \"heimr\", which means \"homestead\" or \"farm\". It probably originally belonged to a farm located at the base of the prominent mountain of Kols\u00e5s. In Old Norse times, the municipality was often called \"Bergheimshera\u00f0\", meaning \"the \"hera\u00f0\" (parish/district) of \"Bergheimr\"\".\nCoat-of-arms.\nThe coat-of-arms was granted on 9 January 1976. They show an old silver-colored lime kiln on a green background. That was an important aspect of the local economy from the Middle Ages until around 1800. There are still some original ovens visible in the municipality.\nHistory.\nThe area known today as B\u00e6rum was a fertile agricultural area as far back as the Bronze Age, and several archeological finds stem from the Iron Age. The first mention of the name is from the saga of Sverre of Norway, from about 1200. There are ruins of stone churches from the 12th century at Haslum and Tanum.\nThe pilgrim road to Trondheim, established after 1030, went through B\u00e6rum, and there is evidence that lime kilns were in use in the area in 850. There were shipping ports for the quicklime at Slependen and Sandvika. The lime kiln is the main motif for the municipality's coat of arms.\nIn the 17th century, iron ore was discovered in B\u00e6rum and the ironworks at B\u00e6rums Verk were founded. Industries such as paper mills, nail factories, sawmills, glassworks, and brickworks were established along the rivers Lysakerelven and Sandvikselva in the following centuries. There were orchards and other agricultural concerns throughout the area, remnants of which still exist today.\nA number of artists established themselves in B\u00e6rum, particularly around the art school run by Johan Fredrik Eckersberg. Among the artists who did much of their work in B\u00e6rum are Frits Thaulow, Christian Skredsvig, Harriet Backer, Kitty Lange Kielland, Otto Sinding, Eilif Pettersen, Gerhardt Munthe, and Erik Werenskiold.\nStarting in the mid-20th century, B\u00e6rum's agricultural base gradually gave way to residential construction. Still, only a third of the area, , is built up for residential use; over half is productive forestry; and nearly is still agricultural.\nIn 2010, the Eurovision Song Contest was hosted in B\u00e6rum.\nOn 10 August 2019, a gunman opened fire on congregants at the Al-Noor Islamic Centre, after shooting and killing his ethnically Chinese adopted stepsister at their home.\nGeography.\nThe physical geography of B\u00e6rum is dominated by a craggy coastline along the Oslofjord and inland, hilly areas rising to the north and east, where there are large forested areas. The mountain of Kols\u00e5s forms a natural center, but the municipality also includes the secluded valley of Lommedalen. Four major rivers flow through the municipality: Lysakerelven, Sandvikselva, Lomma, and \u00d8verlandselva, and there are numerous lakes, both in residential and forested areas. The official municipality flower is \"Anemone ranunculoides\".\nThe geology of B\u00e6rum is part of the Oslo Graben and includes Rhomb porphyry at Kols\u00e5s.\nSince nearly two-thirds of B\u00e6rum's area consists of forests, there are rich opportunities for outdoor activities, such as skiing, hiking, and fishing. The forests are considered part of Marka, the forested areas in and around Greater Oslo. Areas within the municipality of B\u00e6rum include B\u00e6rumsmarka, Vestmarka, and Krokskogen.\nThe highest point in B\u00e6rum is Vidvangsh\u00f8gda at with an altitude of . The largest lake is Stovivatnet with an area of at \nEconomy.\nB\u00e6rum's industrial base has since the 1950s given way to service industries, including retailing, engineering, public services, etc. It derives much of its tax base by being a bedroom community to Oslo. It is one of the most affluent areas in Norway.\nTwo of Norway's busiest highways (E18 and E16) and one railroad traverse the municipality. There has been considerable development of office parks along E18, especially around Lysaker in the last 20\u201330 years, reducing some of the pressure on downtown areas of Oslo.\nScandinavian Airlines System Norway has its offices in Fornebu, B\u00e6rum. The airline Wider\u00f8e has some administrative offices in Lysaker, B\u00e6rum. Norwegian Air Shuttle has its head office in Fornebu.\nPartnair, a charter airline, was headquartered at Fornebu Airport. When the airline Busy Bee of Norway existed, its head office was on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. Braathens and SAS Braathens had their head office facilities in a building on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. In 2010, Norwegian Air Shuttle bought the former Braathens head office.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;B\u00e6rum (2009) is the fifth most densely populated municipality in Norway. Along the E18 highway, the residential area is continuous with Oslo and continues with some interruption through to the neighboring municipality of Asker.\nB\u00e6rum is also the most affluent of Norwegian municipalities, with average per capita income (2002 figures) of NOK 370,800; compared with the national average of NOK 262,800. It also has the highest level of education nationwide.\nAdministratively, B\u00e6rum is divided into 22 sections. The population for each section on 1 January 2005 was:\nCommunity.\nAccording to a local survey conducted by \"Dagbladet\", B\u00e6rum is the best place to live in Norway in terms of governance and services to residents. In addition is it also one of the best places for young people to grow up. B\u00e6rum score high on national surveys when it comes to local economical governance, education and possibilities for young people, health coverage, school rankings, and work rights and possibilities\nSchools in B\u00e6rum.\nThere are a number of schools in B\u00e6rum, both public and private. There are a total of 43 public elementary schools ( primary and / or secondary ) and some private, including B\u00e6rum Montessori School. According to national surveys, Jar public elementary school ranks the highest when it comes to math, while Lommedalen public elementary school ranks the highest in reading, both are located in B\u00e6rum.\nThere are eight public high schools in B\u00e6rum; D\u00f8nski, Eikeli, Nadderud, Rosenvilde, Rud, Sandvika, Stabekk and Valler. In addition, the Norwegian College of Elite Sport and Steiner School. The Folk University also has a branch in Sandvika. Valler High School has been ranked within the top 5 high schools in Norway for several years, while Nadderud High School ranks within the top 20. In the later years both schools have met competition from the newly established Sandvika High School. Sandvika High School has had the highest number of applications in the county for the past six years, and is now ranked within top 10 in the country. In 2013 the school also won for Best Entrepreneurship School in Norway.\nSports.\nStab\u00e6k IF plays in Eliteserien, the highest division for men's football in Norway. B\u00e6rum SK\nplays in the 2. divisjon, the third highest division of the Norwegian football league system.\nStab\u00e6k IF's women's football team, Stab\u00e6k Fotball Kvinner, plays in Toppserien, the Norwegian top division.\nH\u00f8vik IF and Stab\u00e6k IF plays in the highest bandy division and Hauger BK in the second highest.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities.\nThe following cities are twinned with B\u00e6rum:\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before dedicating himself to aviation he gained fame as a sportsman, specifically in cycling and motor racing. Henri acquired French nationality in 1937.\nFamily and early life.\nHenri Farman was born in Paris, France, and was baptised as Harry Edgar Mudford Farman. He was a son of Thomas Frederick Farman, the Paris correspondent of the \"London Standard.\" His father was born in 1845 at Layer Marney, Essex, England. His mother, Sophia Ann Louisa Mudford, was born in Canterbury, Kent, on 9 September 1841. She was baptised on 16 July 1844 at St Pancras Old Church in London, and was a daughter of the author William Mudford, who by the time of Sophia's baptism was living at Harrington Square. Sophia and Thomas were married at St George's Hanover Square Church London, on 31 August 1868.\nHenri trained as a painter at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts, but soon became interested in the new mechanical inventions that were appearing at the end of the 19th century. He was able to pursue this interest as an amateur sportsman.\nCycling.\nHe took part in cycle races from the age of fourteen, and started winning some races. Brother Maurice Farman also began cycle racing at the same age and started winning prizes. Henri became a championship cyclist, and won the Paris - Clermont-Ferrand race on 6 June 1892. On 6 October 1892 he won the French Championship, at the V\u00e9lodrome Buffalo in Paris, over a distance of 100 kilometres.\nOn 25 June 1893, Henri went by bicycle from Paris to Madrid with the journalist, author, and French cyclist Edouard de Perrodil. Edouard had written an account of this journey, and a book was published by MM. C. Marpon and Flammarion, titled \"V\u00e9lo ! Toro! Paris-Madrid bicyclette en 1893,\" which included drawings by Farman. They were received by the French Ambassador, among others upon reaching Madrid.\nHe then took part in tandem races with his brother Maurice Farman, forming a successful partnership.\nOn 31 January 1895, at the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, the Farman brothers broke the tandem bicycle record, covering 44.906 kilometres in an hour.\nThey announced their retirement from cycling in November 1896.\nMotor racing.\nAt around the same time as his brother Maurice, Henri discovered motor racing. On 17 February 1901, he won the light car class (400 \u2013 650\u00a0kg) \"Grand Prix du Palais d'Hiver,\" of the \"Circuit du sud-ouest.\" Maurice Farman won the heavy car class of the race. On 29 May 1901, Henri took part in the Paris-Bordeaux race and finished in seventh place. This was an open-entry race held concurrently with the 1901 Gordon Bennett Cup, and over the same course. Fifth place was taken in the 1901 Paris to Berlin Race. Henri won the heavy class section of the 1902 Paris - Vienna race. Marcel Renault came first in the general classification of this race. He took third place in the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup.\nHe had an accident during the elimination trials for the 1905 Gordon Bennett Cup, on 16 June, over the hilly Auvergne circuit. While on the last round of this circuit, descending the Clermont Ferrand hill, on one of the turns in that descent, his car skidded. Henri and his chauffeur were lifted from the car, and ended up on top of a tree. Many onlookers believed he had been killed. But Henri was unharmed, came down from the tree and smoked a cigarette. He believed his car had ended up at the bottom of a ravine after this accident, but was not certain about the final destination of it.\nAviation.\nFarman started practicing in 1907 with a homemade biplane glider on the sandhills of Le Touquet, after first experimenting with model aeroplanes of different sizes. He then decided he wanted a powered plane, and ordered a Voisin 1907 biplane on 1 June 1907. He used this aircraft to set many official records for both distance and duration.\nOn 26 October 1907, at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, he made flights, among others, of 363, 403, and 771 metres in the plane. He also started to turn the plane in the air on this date. The distance of 771 metres was completed in 52 seconds. It was the longest flight in the world that year, and won Farman the Ernest Archdeacon Cup. He made a complete circular flight of 1,030 metres, in 1 minute 14 seconds on 10 November 1907 at Issy. This was the first time that a European aeroplane had completed a full circle. And the first time that an aeroplane, other than a Wright brothers one, had stayed in the air for longer than a minute.\nThe \"Voisin-Farman I\" was also the first biplane in Europe to fly a circular circuit of 1 kilometre, over a predetermined course, on 13 January 1908. This again occurred at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, and won Farman the 50,000 franc Grand Prix d'Aviation offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe. And on 21 March 1908, at the same place, he made a flight of 2.004 kilometres.\nOn 30 October 1908, Farman went on to make the first cross-country flight in Europe. Farman flew from his hangars at Camp de Ch\u00e2lons, Bouy, to Reims, landing at the cavalry ground. It was a distance of 27 kilometres.\nBy early 1909, Farman fell out with Gabriel Voisin because Voisin had sold an aircraft that had been built to Farman's specifications to J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon. This aircraft was named the \"Bird of Passage\" by Brabazon. Farman then started manufacturing aircraft to his own design. The first of these, the Farman III, first flew in April 1909. It was an immediate success and widely imitated.\nIn 1909, he opened a flying school at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne at which George Bertram Cockburn was the first pupil. In this same year he made further record breaking flights. One of 180 kilometres in just over 3 hours, at Reims on 27 August. And one of 232 kilometres in 4 hours 17 minutes and 53 seconds, at Mourmelon-le-Grand on 3 November. In October 1909 he appeared at the Blackpool Aviation Week, Britain's first air show, at which he won over \u00a32000 in prizes.\nIn partnership with his two brothers Maurice and Richard (Dick), he built a highly successful and innovative aircraft manufacturing plant. Their 1914 model was used extensively for artillery observation and reconnaissance during World War I. The Farman Aircraft company's \"Goliath\" was the first long-distance passenger airliner, beginning regular Paris-London (Croydon Airport) flights on 8 February 1919.\nHe was made a chevalier of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1919. Along with Maurice, he retired in 1937 when the French Popular Front government nationalised the aircraft industry; Farman's company becoming part of the \"Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques du Centre\".\nFarman took French nationality in 1937. He died in Paris on 17 July 1958 and is buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Passy in Paris.\nIn 1988, Farman was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He is considered to be the father of modern dispensationalism and futurism. Pre-tribulation rapture theology was popularized extensively in the 1830s by Darby and the Plymouth Brethren, and further popularized in the United States in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the Scofield Reference Bible.\nHe produced translations of the Bible in German, the \"Elberfelder Bibel\", in French, the \"Pau\" Bible, the Dutch New Testament, and the famous and influential English translation (finished posthumously) based on the Hebrew and Greek texts called \"The Holy Scriptures: A New Translation from the Original Languages by J. N. Darby\". It has furthermore been translated into other languages in whole or part.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJohn Nelson Darby was born in Westminster, London, and christened at St Margaret's on 3 March 1801. He was the youngest of the six sons of John Darby and Anne Vaughan. The Darbys were an Anglo-Irish landowning family seated at Leap Castle, King's County, Ireland, (present-day County Offaly). He was a nephew of Admiral Henry D'Esterre Darby who served with Lord Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, and it was in recognition of this family connection that John was given his middle name.\nDarby was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College Dublin where he graduated Classical Gold Medallist in 1819. Darby embraced Christianity during his studies, although there is no evidence that he formally studied theology. He joined an inn of court, but felt that being a lawyer was inconsistent with his religious belief. The future Bishop of Meath and evangelical Joseph Singer tutored him at Trinity. He, therefore, chose ordination as an Anglican clergyman in Ireland, \"lest he should sell his talents to defeat justice\". In 1825, Darby was ordained deacon of the established Church of Ireland and the following year as priest.\nMiddle years.\nDarby became a curate in the Church of Ireland parish of Delgany, County Wicklow, and distinguished himself by persuading Roman Catholic peasants in the Calary district within this parish to abandon the Catholic Church. The gospel tract \"How the Lost Sheep was Saved\" gives his personal account of a visit he paid to a dying shepherd boy in this area, painting a vivid picture of what his work among the poor people involved. He later claimed to have won hundreds of converts to the Church of Ireland. However, the conversions ended when William Magee, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, ruled that converts were obliged to swear allegiance to George IV as the rightful king of Ireland.\nDarby resigned his curacy in protest. Soon afterwards, in October 1827, he fell from a horse and was seriously injured. He later stated that it was during this time that he began to believe that the \"kingdom\" described in the Book of Isaiah and elsewhere in the Old Testament was entirely different from the Christian church.\nOver the next five years, he developed the principles of his mature theology \u2013 most notably his conviction that the very notion of a clergyman was a sin against the Holy Spirit, because it limited the recognition that the Holy Spirit could speak through any member of the Church. During this time (1827\u201328) he joined an interdenominational meeting of believers (including Anthony Norris Groves, Edward Cronin, J. G. Bellett, and Francis Hutchinson) who met to \"break bread\" together in Dublin as a symbol of their unity in Christ. By 1832, this group had grown and began to identify themselves as a distinct Christian assembly. As they travelled and began new assemblies in Ireland and England, they formed the movement now known as the Plymouth Brethren.\nIt is believed that John Nelson Darby left the Church of Ireland around 1831. He participated in the 1831\u201333 Powerscourt Conference, an annual meeting of Bible students organized by his friend, the wealthy widow Lady Powerscourt. At the conference, Darby publicly described his ecclesiological and eschatological views, including the pre-tribulation rapture. For about 40 years William Kelly (1821\u20131906) was his chief interpreter and continued to be a staunch supporter until his own death. Kelly in his work \"John Nelson Darby as I Knew Him\" stated that \"a saint more true to Christ's name and word I never knew or heard of\".\nDarby defended Calvinist doctrines when they came under attack from within the Church in which he once served. His biographer Goddard states, \"Darby indicates his approval of the doctrine of the Anglican Church as expressed in Article XVII of the Thirty-nine Articles\" on the subject of election and predestination. Darby said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For my own part, I soberly think Article XVII to be as wise, perhaps I might say the wisest and best condensed human statement of the view it contains that I am acquainted with. I am fully content to take it in its literal and grammatical sense. I believe that predestination to life is the eternal purpose of God, by which, before the foundations of the world were laid, He firmly decreed, by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and destruction those whom He had chosen in Christ out of the human race, and to bring them, through Christ, as vessels made to honour, to eternal salvation.\nLater years.\nDarby travelled widely in Europe and Britain in the 1830s and 1840s, and established many Brethren assemblies. He gave 11 significant lectures in Geneva in 1840 on the hope of the church (). These established his reputation as a leading interpreter of biblical prophecy. America did not embrace Darby's ecclesiology as it did his eschatology, which is still being propagated (in various forms) at such places as Dallas Theological Seminary, and by authors and preachers such as Hal Lindsey and John Hagee.\nIn 1848, Darby became involved in a complex dispute over the proper method for maintaining shared standards of discipline in different assemblies that resulted in a split between Open Brethren, which maintained a congregational form of government and Exclusive Brethren. After that time, he was recognized as the dominant figure among the Exclusives, who also came to be known as \"Darbyite\" Brethren. He made at least 5 missionary journeys to North America between 1862 and 1877. He worked mostly in New England, Ontario, and the Great Lakes region, but took one extended journey from Toronto to Sydney by way of San Francisco, Hawaii, and New Zealand. A Geographical Index of his letters is currently available and lists where he travelled. He used his classical skills to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek texts into several languages. In English, he wrote a Synopsis of the Bible and many other scholarly religious articles. He wrote hymns and poems, the most famous being, \"The Man of Sorrows\", (not to be confused with \"Man of Sorrows, What a Name\" by Philip Bliss (1838\u20131876)). He was also a Bible commentator. His writings were collected in his lifetime and published from January 1866 as \"The Collected Writings of J. N. Darby\"; there were 32 volumes published \u2013 two per year 1866\u20131881 and two more soon after. He translated the Bible with the help of various brethren in different countries into German, French and English. He declined, however, to contribute to the compilation of the Revised Version of the King James Bible even though the revisers consulted Darby's work.\nHe died in 1882 at Sundridge House, Bournemouth and is buried in Bournemouth, Dorset, England.\nDarby is noted in the theological world as the father of \"dispensationalism\", whose eschatology was adopted and later made popular in the United States by Cyrus Scofield's Scofield Reference Bible.\nCharles Henry Mackintosh (1820\u20131896) with his popular style spread Darby's teachings to humbler elements in society and may be regarded as the journalist of the Brethren Movement. Mackintosh popularised Darby more than any other Brethren author. In the early twentieth century, the Brethren's teachings, through Margaret E. Barber, greatly influenced the Little Flock or Church Assembly Hall of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.\nDarby has been credited with originating the \"pretribulational rapture theory\". Dispensationalist beliefs about the fate of the Jews and the re-establishment of the Kingdom of Israel put dispensationalists at the forefront of Christian Zionism.\nCriticism.\nCharles Haddon Spurgeon, Pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle and contemporary of Darby, published criticism of Darby and Brethrenism. His main criticism was that Darby and the Plymouth Brethren rejected the vicarious purpose of Christ's obedience as well as imputed righteousness. He viewed these of such importance and so central to the Gospel that it led him to publish this statement about the rest of their belief in the Sword and Trowel.\nJames Grant wrote: \"With the deadly heresies entertained and taught by the Plymouth Brethren, in relation to some of the most momentous of all the doctrines of the Gospel, and to which I have adverted at some length, I feel assured that my readers will not be surprised at any other views, however unscriptural and pernicious they may be, which the Darbyites have embraced and zealously seek to propagate\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known for directing and producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation. His most significant work was for the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, where he was crucial in the creation and evolution of famous animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd for Warner Bros. and Droopy, Butch Dog, Screwy Squirrel, The Wolf, Red Hot Riding Hood, and George and Junior for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nHe gained influence for his technical innovation, directorial style, and brand of humor that appealed especially towards adults. Avery's attitude toward animation was opposite that of Walt Disney and other conventional family cartoons at the time. Avery's cartoons were known for their essentially darker, sarcastic, ironic, absurdist, irreverent, and sometimes sexual tone in nature. They focused on visual gags, meta humor, physically impossible gags, social satire, surrealist humor, rapid pacing, racial stereotypes, and violent slapstick occurring around brash, outlandish characters who broke the fourth wall, stating that cartoons are meant to do anything.\nEarly life and education.\nAvery was born to Mary Augusta \"Jessie\" (n\u00e9e Bean; 1886\u20131931) and George Walton Avery (1867\u20131935) in Taylor, Texas. His father was born in Alabama and his mother was born in Chickasaw County, Mississippi.\nAvery graduated in 1926 from North Dallas High School. A popular catchphrase at his school was \"What's up, doc?\", which he later used for Bugs Bunny in the 1940s. Interested in becoming a newspaper cartoonist, he took a three-month summer course at the Chicago Art Institute but left after a month.\nTex Avery's major inspirations were comedians such as Laurel &amp; Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and especially The Marx Brothers; the latter of which was inspiration for Bugs Bunny. He was especially inspired by Winsor McCay, Pat Sullivan, Otto Messmer, Max Fleischer and Walt Disney in term of animation field. He additionally liked the works of newspaper comic strip artist Virgil Partch, mainly praising for his surrealist gags.\nAnimation career.\nOn January 1, 1928, Avery arrived in Los Angeles. He spent the next few months working in menial jobs. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, these jobs included working in a warehouse, working on the docks at night, loading fruits and vegetables, and painting cars. He began his animation career when hired by the Winkler studio (named after producer Margaret J. Winkler and later known as Screen Gems). He was an inker, inking cels for animated short films in the \"Oswald the Lucky Rabbit\" series; the character had been created by Walt Disney. Avery then moved to a new studio, Universal Cartoon Studios (later known as Walter Lantz Productions). He was again employed as an inker, but moved rapidly up the studio's hierarchy. By 1930, Avery had been promoted to the position of animator.\nAvery continued working at the Walter Lantz Studio into the early 1930s. He worked on most of the \"Oswald the Lucky Rabbit\" cartoons from 1931 to 1935. He is shown as \"animator\" on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons. He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time.\nAccident to eye.\nDuring some office horseplay at the Lantz studio, a thumbtack or paper clip flew into Avery's left eye and caused him to lose sight in that eye. Some speculate it was his lack of depth perception that gave him his unique look at animation and bizarre directorial style, but it did not stop his creative career. The incident is described in some detail by Barrier, based in part on old interviews with Avery. Part of the typical crude horseplay at the Universal studio was using a rubber band or a paper spitball to target the back of a colleague's head. An animator called Charles Hastings decided to take the game one step further, by using a wire paper clip, instead. Avery heard one of his colleagues telling him to look out. He reacted by turning around. Instead of the back of his head, the paper clip hit Avery in his left eye. He instantly lost the use of his eye.\nFrom inker to storyboards.\nAs an animator, Avery worked under director Bill Nolan. Nolan reportedly delegated work to Avery, whenever Avery had to animate a sequence. Nolan's instructions for a scene involving Oswald being chased by bees were reportedly simple. He would describe in which direction Oswald was running (\"right to left\") and for how many feet. The rest of the details were left up to Avery. Avery started handing out work to other animators working under Nolan.\nAvery wanted still greater control over the creative process and served as a \"de facto\" director for a couple of films. Based on Avery's recollections, here is a description of how this happened. He was submitting sight gags for use in the short films. Some of them were used in the actual films, and some funny ones were left out. He wanted to somehow get all his gags in the finished film. So, he asked Nolan to let him create the entire storyboard for a film. Nolan instructed Avery to not only draw the storyboard, but also to work on the timing and the layout on his own. Avery completed two films using this process. An older Avery recalled that both films \"were terrible\", though they got accepted for release.\nAvery was reportedly displeased with his salary and had started giving up on his work. After about six weeks of substandard work, his superiors let him go. In April 1935, Avery lost his job at the Universal studio.\n\"Termite Terrace\".\nLater in 1935, Avery applied for a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions (the company later known as Warner Bros. Cartoons). Avery reportedly managed to convince producer Leon Schlesinger that he was an experienced director, a false claim. In Avery's own words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;'Hey, I'm, a director.' Hell! I was no more a director than nothing, but with my loud mouth, I talked him into it.\nBy 1935, when Avery was hired, the Schlesinger studio had only two full-time, regular film directors: Friz Freleng and Jack King. Avery became the third regular director. The staff of the Schlesinger studio had become too large to be housed in a single building, at the Warner Bros. backlot on Sunset Boulevard. The new Avery unit of the studio was granted their own building, a five-room bungalow. The unit staff dubbed their quarters \"Termite Terrace\", due to its significant termite population. \"Termite Terrace\" later became the nickname for the entire Schlesinger/Warner Bros. studio, primarily because Avery and his unit were the ones who defined what became known as \"the Warner Bros. cartoon\".\nAvery was granted exclusive use of four animators: Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Sid Sutherland, and Virgil Ross. The first animated short film produced by this unit was \"Gold Diggers of '49\" (1935), the third \"Looney Tunes\" film starring Beans. Beans was also featured in the film's title card, signifying that he was the intended protagonist. The film had a Western setting and cast Beans as a gold miner. Also featured in the film was a redesigned Porky Pig, making his second appearance. The Avery unit was assigned to work primarily on the black-and-white \"Looney Tunes\" instead of the Technicolor \"Merrie Melodies\", but was allowed to make color \"Merrie Melodies\" beginning with \"Page Miss Glory\" from 1936. Avery was also noted to be the first to stray away from using song breaks in color cartoons starting with the 1937 short \"Uncle Tom's Bungalow\", later saying that \"We were forced to use a song, which would just ruin the cartoon. You'd try like a fool to get funny, but it was seldom you did.\"\nAvery stopped using Beans following \"Gold Diggers of '49\", but continued using Porky as a star character. According to Michael Barrier, Beans was more of a straight man. However, Porky had to be redesigned again. The early Porky was decidedly \"piglike\" in appearance. In Michael Barrier's description, Porky was very fat, had small eyes, a large snout, and pronounced jowls. He was like a porcine version of Roscoe Arbuckle. Starting with \"Porky the Rainmaker\" (1936), his fourth animated short starring Porky, Avery introduced a cuter version of Porky. The new design gave Porky more prominent eyes and a smaller snout. The jowls were replaced by chubby cheeks. Porky's body now had a rounder shape; its defining trait was not fatness, but softness. Barrier notes that the new design by Avery departed from the \"Disneyish\" realism in the previous drawing style. Porky became a less realistic pig and looked more like a cartoon character.\nAccording to Martha Sigall, Avery was one of the few directors to visit the ink and paint department \u2014 where he would answer questions and was always in good humor \u2014 as he liked to see how his cartoons were developing. When some of the artists humorously criticized the wild action in his animated shorts, Avery would take time to explain his rationale. He recalled that while working at Warner Bros., the animators had a great deal of liberty, and were subject to very little censorship.\nCreation of Looney Tunes stars.\nAvery, with the assistance of Clampett, Jones, and the new associate director Frank Tashlin, laid the foundation for a style of animation that rivaled The Walt Disney Studio as the leader in animated short films, and created a group of cartoon characters that are still known today. Avery, in particular, was deeply involved. He crafted gags for the shorts, and sometimes provided voices for them (including his trademark belly laugh) and held such control over the timing of the shorts that he would add or cut frames out of the final negative if he felt a gag's timing was not quite right.\n\"Porky's Duck Hunt\" (1937) introduced the character of Daffy Duck, who possessed a new form of \"lunacy\" and zaniness that had not been seen before in animated cartoons. Daffy was an almost completely crazy \"darn fool duck\" who frequently bounced around the film frame in double-speed, screaming \"Hoo-hoo!\" in a high-pitched, sped-up voice provided by voice artist Mel Blanc, who, with this cartoon, also took over providing the voice of Porky Pig. Avery directed two more Daffy Duck cartoons: \"Daffy Duck &amp; Egghead\" and \"Daffy Duck in Hollywood\". Egghead was a character inspired by comedian Joe Penner and first appeared in Avery's \"Egghead Rides Again\".\n\"Little Red Walking Hood\" first introduced the early character of Elmer Fudd as a character mostly taking part of some running gag. Elmer in this early form had green clothes, a brown bowler hat, and a pink nose. He was also named \"Elmer\" on the lobby cards for \"The Isle of Pingo Pongo\" (1938), his second appearance, \"Cinderella Meets Fella\" (1938), his third appearance, and was fully called \"Elmer Fudd\" on screen in \"A Feud There Was\" (1938), also his fourth appearance. Elmer even appears on early merchandise and in the early Looney Tunes books in 1938 and 1939 and was later promoted as \"Egghead's Brother\" on the Vitaphone Release Sheet for \"Cinderella Meets Fella\" because Elmer was also voiced by Danny Webb in his Joe Penner voice that was also use for Egghead.\nBen Hardaway, Cal Dalton, and Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts that featured a Daffy Duck-like rabbit, created by Ben \"Bugs\" Hardaway. As is the case with most directors, each puts his own personal stamp on the characters, stories, and overall feel of a short. So, each of these cartoons treated the rabbit differently. The next to try out the rabbit, known around Termite Terrace as \"Bugs' bunny\" (named after Hardaway), was Avery. Since the recycling of storylines among the directors was commonplace, \"A Wild Hare\" was a double throwback. Avery had directed the short \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" featuring Porky Pig, which also introduced Daffy Duck.\nHardaway remade it as \"Porky's Hare Hunt\", introducing the rabbit. So, Avery went back to the \"hunter and prey\" framework, incorporating Jones's \"Elmer's Candid Camera\" gag for gag and altering the new design of Elmer Fudd, polishing the timing, and expanding the Groucho Marx smart-aleck attitude already present in \"Porky's Hare Hunt\"; he made Bugs a kind of slick Brooklynesque rabbit who was always in control of the situation. Avery has stated that it was very common to refer to folks in Texas as \"doc\", much like \"pal\", \"dude\", or \"bud\". In \"A Wild Hare\", Bugs adopts this colloquialism when he casually walks up to Elmer, who is \"hunting wabbits\" and while carefully inspecting a rabbit hole, shotgun in hand, the first words out of Bugs's mouth is a coolly calm, \"What's up, doc?\" Audiences reacted riotously to the juxtaposition of Bugs's nonchalance and the potentially dangerous situation. \"What's up, doc?\" instantly became the rabbit's catchphrase. Originally, Avery wanted Bugs Bunny to be called Jack E. Rabbit because he hunted for jack rabbits when he was a kid. Numerous suggestions for names came up, but publicist Rose Horsely liked the name that was on Thorson's model sheet, saying that it was cute and they will \"play it two ways.\" Avery argued on his stance for the name \"Jack E. Rabbit\" saying that \"Mine's a rabbit! A tall, lanky, mean rabbit. He isn't a fuzzy little bunny.\" He also said the name Bugs Bunny sounded like a Disney character. Nevertheless, Schlesinger settled on Bugs Bunny.\nAvery ended up directing only four Bugs Bunny cartoons: \"A Wild Hare\", \"Tortoise Beats Hare\", \"The Heckling Hare\", and \"All This and Rabbit Stew\". During this period, he also directed a number of one-shot shorts, including travelogue parody (\"The Isle of Pingo Pongo\", which is the second cartoon to feature an early character that evolved into Elmer Fudd); fractured fairy-tales (\"The Bear's Tale\"); Hollywood caricature films (\"Hollywood Steps Out\"); and cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny clones (\"The Crackpot Quail\").\nAvery's tenure at the Schlesinger studio ended in late 1941 when the producer and he quarreled over the ending to \"The Heckling Hare\". In Avery's original version, Bugs and the hunting dog were to fall off a cliff \"three times\", making it an early example of the wild take. According to a DVD commentary for the cartoon, historian and animator Greg Ford explained that the problem Schlesinger had with the ending was that, just before falling off the third time, Bugs and the dog were to turn to the screen, with Bugs saying, \"Hold on to your hats, folks, here we go again!\", a punchline to a potentially risqu\u00e9 joke of the day. However, Barrier uncovered a typewritten dialogue transcript of the cartoon that mentions the three falls at the end, but the \"Hold on to your hats\" line is absent, with the rest of the dialogue in the cartoon transcribed accurately. This inferred that Avery either misremembered or embellished the story and Schlesinger made the cut not because of any risqu\u00e9 content, but because he did not think that it was funny that Avery was killing Bugs three times, and the ending simply dragged on for too long. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported on the quarrel on July 2, 1941. Avery was slapped with a four-week, unpaid suspension.\n\"Speaking of Animals\".\nWhile at Schlesinger, Avery created a concept of animating lip movement to live-action footage of animals. Schlesinger was not interested in Avery's idea, so Avery approached Jerry Fairbanks, a friend of his who produced the \"Unusual Occupations\" series of short subjects for Paramount Pictures. Fairbanks liked the idea and the \"Speaking of Animals\" series of shorts was launched. When Avery left the Schlesinger studio in mid-1941, he went straight to Paramount to work on the first three shorts in the series before joining Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The series continued without him, lasting seven years.\nAvery at MGM.\nOn September 2, 1941, the \"Reporter\" announced that Avery had signed a five-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was to form his own animation unit and direct shorts in Technicolor. By 1942, Avery was in the employ of MGM, working in their cartoon division under the supervision of Fred Quimby. Avery felt that Schlesinger had stifled him. When asked if he missed the Looney Tunes characters, he responded: \"Sometimes, but I don't miss anything else. MGM is a heck of a better place to work, in every way, and the people here are just as great.\"\nAt MGM, Avery's creativity reached its peak. His cartoons became known for their sheer lunacy, breakneck pace, and penchant for playing with the medium of animation and film in general that few other directors dared to approach. MGM also offered him larger budgets and a higher quality production level than the Warner Bros. studio; plus, his unit was filled with talented ex-Disney artists such as Preston Blair and Ed Love. These changes were evident in Avery's first short released by MGM, \"Blitz Wolf\", an Adolf Hitler parody of the \"Three Little Pigs\" story, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) in 1942. Avery's cartoons at MGM somewhat felt like Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons done during that same period at Warner Bros., albeit the Bros.' series gained more popularity than Avery's MGM cartoons.\nAvery's best-known MGM character debuted in \"Dumb-Hounded\" (1943). Droopy (originally \"Happy Hound\") was a small, calm, slow-moving, and slow-talking dog who always won out in the end, whatever difficulties he faced. He also created a series of risqu\u00e9 cartoons, beginning with \"Red Hot Riding Hood\" (also 1943), featuring a sexy female star who never had a set name, but has been unofficially referred to as \"Red\" by fans. Her visual design and voice varied somewhat between shorts. Other Avery characters at MGM included Screwy Squirrel, Butch Dog and the \"Of Mice and Men\"-inspired duo of George and Junior.\nOther MGM cartoons directed by Avery include \"Bad Luck Blackie\", \"Cellbound\", \"Magical Maestro\", \"Lucky Ducky\", \"Ventriloquist Cat,\" and \"King-Size Canary\". Avery began his stint at MGM working with lush colors and realistic backgrounds, but he slowly abandoned this style for a more frenetic, less realistic approach. The newer, more stylized look reflected the influence of the up-and-coming UPA studio, the need to cut costs as budgets grew higher, and Avery's own desire to leave reality behind and make cartoons that were not tied to the real world of live action. During this period, he made a series of films that explored the technology of the future: \"The House of Tomorrow\", \"The Car of Tomorrow\", \"The Farm of Tomorrow,\" and \"TV of Tomorrow\" (spoofing common live-action promotional shorts of the time). He also introduced a slow-talking wolf character, who was the prototype for MGM associates Hanna-Barbera's Huckleberry Hound character, right down to the voice by Daws Butler.\nAvery took a year's sabbatical from MGM beginning in 1950 (to recover from overwork), during which time Dick Lundy, recently arrived from the Walter Lantz studio, took over his unit and made one \"Droopy\" cartoon, as well as a string of shorts featuring Barney Bear. Avery returned to MGM in October 1951 and began working again. Avery's last two original cartoons for MGM were \"Deputy Droopy\" and \"Cellbound\", completed in 1953 and released in 1955. They were co-directed by the Avery unit animator Michael Lah. Lah began directing a handful of CinemaScope Droopy shorts on his own. On March 1, 1953, Avery's unit was terminated and he was fired from MGM. Fred Quimby spoke of bringing back the unit, but in December of that year, Walter Lantz announced that Avery would be working for him.\nReturn to Walter Lantz Productions.\nAvery directed four cartoons for Walter Lantz Productions in 1954\u201355: \"Crazy Mixed Up Pup\", \"Sh-h-h-h-h-h\", \"I'm Cold\", and \"The Legend of Rockabye Point\", in which he defined the character of Chilly Willy the penguin. He brought his signature wild gags and fast pacing to the Lantz studio, and the Lantz cartoons received new energy and recognition. \"The Legend of Rockabye Point\" and \"Crazy Mixed Up Pup\" were nominated for Academy Awards. \nAvery had agreed to a salary and a percentage of the profits. He did not realize that his share came out of the \"net\" profits: \"I made about four cartoons for [Lantz], then I started thinking about the contract. I took it to an attorney, and he said, 'Oh, brother! You'll never get a dime out of this. You're getting charged for everything but the paving out in front of the studio.' I was getting my percentage off the bottom instead of off the top. By the time all the charges went in, why, my goodness, there was nothing left. So, I gave up there.\" Avery left behind three new Chilly Willy storyboards, which were later made into cartoons by director Alex Lovy.\nCascade Studios.\nAvery turned to animated television commercials at Cascade Studios, including those for Raid (1950s through 1970s), in which cartoon insects, confronted by the bug killer, screamed \"RAID!\" and died flamboyantly, and Frito-Lay's controversial mascot, the Frito Bandito. Avery also produced ads for Kool-Aid fruit drinks starring the Looney Tunes characters he had once helped create during his Termite Terrace days. Funnily enough, the Cascade executives did not even know that he created the characters. His earliest commercial work is advertisements for the toothpaste brand Pepsodent.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Avery became increasingly reserved and depressed due to the suicide of his son and the break-up of his marriage, although he continued to draw respect from his peers. After Cascade, he briefly animated commercials for his own company, Tex Avery Cartoons, from June to July 1973. Avery then went back to Cascade, and closed the cartoon department in 1978. He had an offer from Friz Freleng, to write for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, but was not interested.\nHanna-Barbera Productions.\nFrom 1979 until his death, his final employer was Hanna-Barbera Productions, where he wrote gags for Saturday morning cartoons such as \"Fred and Barney Meet the Thing\" and the Droopy-esque \"Kwicky Koala\". According to an interview by John Dunn in his diary, Avery did not like the late animation industry at the time, feeling that it lacked quality.\nInnovation.\nGary Morris described Avery's innovative approach:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Above all, [Avery] steered the Warner Bros. house style away from Disney-esque sentimentality and made cartoons that appealed equally to adults, who appreciated Avery's speed, sarcasm, and irony, and to kids, who liked the nonstop action. Disney's \"cute and cuddly\" creatures, under Avery's guidance, were transformed into unflappable wits like Bugs Bunny, endearing buffoons like Porky Pig, or dazzling crazies like Daffy Duck. Even the classic fairy tale, a market that Disney had cornered, was appropriated by Avery, who made innocent heroines like Red Riding Hood into sexy jazz babes, more than a match for any Wolf. Avery also endeared himself to intellectuals by constantly breaking through the artifice of the cartoon, having characters leap out of the end credits, loudly object to the plot of the cartoon they were starring in, or speak directly to the audience.As noted by Lambiek, Tex Avery's cartoons would often include realistic backgrounds but he then have the characters do any physically impossible gags or talk to the audience.\nDirecting style.\nAvery had developed a directing style unlike anything moviegoers had ever seen, a distinct, signature style at Warner Bros. Studio, which had breakneck pacing, outlandish, over-the-top acting from his characters, and seemingly nonstop jokes and gags. Avery's style of directing encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of a live-action film. An often-quoted line about Avery's cartoons was, \"In a cartoon, you can do anything.\" He also performed a great deal of voice work in his cartoons, usually throwaway bits. He also occasionally filled in for Bill Thompson as Droopy.\nPersonal life and death.\nTwo days after being fired from Universal in spring 1935, Avery married his girlfriend, Patricia Johnson. She was also employed at Universal Studios as an inker. The newlyweds spent a long honeymoon in Oregon, but had to return to Los Angeles when they ran out of money.\nOn Tuesday, August 26, 1980, Avery died from gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, California, at the age of 72. At the time of his death, he was developing a character named \"Cave Mouse\" for a new \"Flintstones\" series. According to Chuck Jones, when watching a baseball game with another animator, Avery's last words were, \"I don't know where animators go when they die, but I guess there must be a lot of them. They could probably use a good director, though.\" He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.\nInfluence and legacy.\nThe Tex Avery's influence can be seen in modern later cartoons such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\", \"Animaniacs\", \"The Mask\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", and \"Cat Burglar\". An Avery-esque cowboy character bore his name in the otherwise unrelated series \"The Wacky World of Tex Avery\". Avery's work has been featured on shows such as \"The Tex Avery Show\" and \"Cartoon Alley\".\nIn the mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics released a trio of three-issue miniseries that were openly labelled tributes to Avery's MGM cartoons, \"Wolf &amp; Red\", \"Droopy\", and \"Screwy Squirrel\", in which other characters make appearances in the comics such as \"George and Junior\", \"Spike\", and the one-shot characters. Tex Avery, unlike most Warner Bros. directors, kept many original title frames of his cartoons; several were otherwise lost due to Blue Ribbon Reissues. Rare prints and art containing original titles and unedited animation from Avery's MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons are now usually sold on eBay or in the collections of animators and cartoon enthusiasts. In 2008, France issued three postage stamps honoring Tex Avery for his 100th birthday, depicting Droopy, the redheaded showgirl, and the Wolf.\nAll of his MGM shorts were released in a North American MGM/UA laserdisc set called \"The Compleat Tex Avery\". While two cartoons in the set were edited versions---the blackface gags in \"Droopy's Good Deed\" and \"Garden Gopher\"---others, including the controversial \"Uncle Tom's Caba\u00f1a\" and \"Half-Pint Pygmy\" were included intact (although they were removed from the Region 2 DVD release, now out of print). Several of his cartoons were released on VHS, in four volumes of \"Tex Avery's Screwball Classics\", two VHS Droopy collections, and various inclusions on MGM animation collection releases, with many gags left in that had been edited out for television.\nAvery's Droopy cartoons are available on the DVD set \"Tex Avery's Droopy: The Complete Theatrical Collection\". The seven Droopy cartoons produced in CinemaScope were included here in their original widescreen versions (letter-boxed), instead of the pan-and-scan versions regularly broadcast on television.\nAlso, some of his works could be found on home video releases (from VHS to Blu-ray) of Warner Bros.' Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts, and the same is true of his few Lantz Studio cartoons included in the DVD set \"The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection\".\nJust like with the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award, first awarded to Forrest J Ackerman in 1984 and the Friz Freleng Lifetime Achievement of Excellence, first award to Isadore Freleng himself in 1994, The Texas Avery Award, first awarded to Brad Bird in 2005, 25 years after Avery's death. First presented by the Deep Ellum Film Festival, it is now presented by Reel FX. Notable recipients include Henry Selick, Pete Docter, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders for \"How to Train Your Dragon\", John Kricfalusi for his contributions to the animation industry, and Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\nAvery is honored by Texas Historical Marker #17073, which was unveiled in his hometown of Taylor, Texas, in 2014. The marker says Avery spent \"a lifetime...reinventing the American cartoon.\"\nIn February 2020, Warner Archive released \"Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 1\" on Blu-ray containing 19 of his MGM cartoons. According to Jerry Beck, most of MGM's pre-1951 cartoons had their original negatives destroyed in a 1978 George Eastman House fire, causing great difficulties in terms of restoration. However, using the best surviving archival elements, all 19 shorts on the set have been digitally restored in HD and are uncut. In March 2020, Warner Archive announced they were working on \"Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 2\", which was released in December 2020 and contained 21 restored and uncut shorts as well as \"Tex Avery: The King of Cartoons\", an archival documentary as a special feature. \"Volume 3\" was released on October 5, 2021, with an additional 20 uncut restored cartoons with the Avery directed \"Merrie Melodies\" short, \"The Crackpot Quail\", as a bonus feature restored with its original 1941 soundtrack.\nFilmography.\nMany of Avery's cartoons have been released on home video over the years:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(More generally, residues can be calculated for any function &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; that is holomorphic except at the discrete points &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which may include essential singularities.) Residues are typically readily computed and, once known, allow the determination of general contour integrals via the residue theorem.\nDefinition.\nThe residue of a meromorphic function formula_1 at an isolated singularity formula_2, often denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, is the unique value &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; has an analytic antiderivative in a punctured disk &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. \nAlternatively, residues can be calculated by finding Laurent series expansions, and one can define the residue as the coefficient &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; of a Laurent series. \nThe concept can be used to provide contour integration values of certain contour integral problems considered in the residue theorem. According to the residue theorem, for a meromorphic function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the residue at point &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is given as: \n formula_3\nwhere formula_4 is a positively oriented simple closed curve around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and not including any other singularities on or inside the curve.\nThe definition of a residue can be generalized to arbitrary Riemann surfaces. Suppose &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a 1-form on a Riemann surface. Let formula_5 be meromorphic at some point\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, so that we may write &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in local coordinates as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Then, the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is defined to be the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at the point corresponding to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nContour integration.\nContour integral of a monomial.\nComputing the residue of a monomial\n formula_6\nmakes most residue computations easy to do. Since path integral computations are homotopy invariant, we will let formula_7 be the circle with radius formula_8 going counter clockwise. Then, using the change of coordinates formula_9 we find that\n formula_10\nhence this integral now reads as\n formula_11\nThus, the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if integer &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; otherwise.\nGeneralization to Laurent series.\nIf a function is expressed as a Laurent series expansion around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; as follows: formula_12 Then, the residue at the point &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is calculated as: formula_13 using the results from contour integral of a monomial for counter clockwise contour integral &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; around a point &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Hence, if a Laurent series representation of a function exists around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then its residue around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is known by the coefficient of the term &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nApplication in residue theorem.\nFor a meromorphic function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with a finite set of singularities within a positively oriented simple closed curve formula_7 which does not pass through any singularity, the value of the contour integral is given according to residue theorem, as: formula_15 where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the winding number, is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is in the interior of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if not, simplifying to: formula_16 where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are all isolated singularities within the contour &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nCalculation of residues.\nSuppose a punctured disk &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; in the complex plane is given and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a holomorphic function defined (at least) on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The residue &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is the coefficient &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; in the Laurent series expansion of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Various methods exist for calculating this value, and the choice of which method to use depends on the function in question, and on the nature of the singularity.\nAccording to the residue theorem, we have:\n formula_17\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; traces out a circle around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in a counterclockwise manner and does not pass through or contain other singularities within it. We may choose the path &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to be a circle of radius &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Since &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be as small as we desire it can be made to contain only the singularity of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; due to nature of isolated singularities. This may be used for calculation in cases where the integral can be calculated directly, but it is usually the case that residues are used to simplify calculation of integrals, and not the other way around.\nRemovable singularities.\nIf the function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be continued to a holomorphic function on the whole disk &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The converse is not in general true.\nSimple poles.\nIf &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a simple pole of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is given by:\n formula_18\nIf that limit does not exist, then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; instead has an essential singularity at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. If the limit is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is either analytic at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or has a removable singularity there. If the limit is equal to infinity, then the order of the pole is higher than &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIt may be that the function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be expressed as a quotient of two functions, &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are holomorphic functions in a neighbourhood of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In such a case, L'H\u00f4pital's rule can be used to simplify the above formula to:\n formula_19\nLimit formula for higher-order poles.\nMore generally, if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a pole of order &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be found by the formula:\n formula_20\nThis formula can be very useful in determining the residues for low-order poles. For higher-order poles, the calculations can become unmanageable, and series expansion is usually easier. For essential singularities, no such simple formula exists, and residues must usually be taken directly from series expansions.\nResidue at infinity.\nIn general, the residue at infinity is defined as:\n formula_21\nIf the following condition is met:\n formula_22\nthen the residue at infinity can be computed using the following formula:\n formula_23\nIf instead\n formula_24\nthen the residue at infinity is\n formula_25\nFor functions that are meromorphic on the entire complex plane with finitely many singularities, the sum of the residues at the (necessarily) isolated singularities plus the residue at infinity is zero, which gives:\n formula_26\nSeries methods.\nIf parts or all of a function can be expanded into a Taylor series or Laurent series, which may be possible if the parts or the whole of the function has a standard series expansion, then calculating the residue is significantly simpler than by other methods. The residue of the function is simply given by the coefficient of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; in the Laurent series expansion of the function.\nExamples.\nResidue from series expansion.\nExample 1.\nAs an example, consider the contour integral\n formula_27\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is some simple closed curve about &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nLet us evaluate this integral using a standard convergence result about integration by series. Substituting the Taylor series for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; into the integrand, the integral becomes\n formula_28\nLet us bring the term in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; into the series. The contour integral of the series then writes\n formula_29\nSince the series converges uniformly on the support of the integration path, we are allowed to exchange integration and summation. \nThe series of the path integrals then collapses to a much simpler form because of the previous computation. So now the integral around &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of every other term not in the form &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; is zero, and the integral is reduced to\n formula_30\nThe value 1/4! is the \"residue\" of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and is denoted\n formula_31\nExample 2.\nAs a second example, consider calculating the residues at the singularities of the functionformula_32which may be used to calculate certain contour integrals. This function appears to have a singularity at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, but if one factorizes the denominator and thus writes the function as formula_33 it is apparent that the singularity at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a removable singularity and then the residue at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is therefore &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe only other singularity is at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Recall the expression for the Taylor series for a function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; about &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;: formula_34 So, for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; we have formula_35 and for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; we have formula_36 Multiplying those two series and introducing &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; gives usformula_37 So the residue of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nExample 3.\nThe next example shows that, computing a residue by series expansion, a major role is played by the Lagrange inversion theorem. Let formula_38 be an entire function, and let formula_39 with positive radius of convergence, and with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. So &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; has a local inverse &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and formula_40 is meromorphic at 0. Then we have: formula_41 Indeed, formula_42because the first series converges uniformly on any small circle around 0. Using the Lagrange inversion theorem formula_43 and we get the above expression. For example, if formula_44 and also formula_45, then formula_46 and formula_47 The first term contributes &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to the residue, and the second term contributes &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; since it is asymptotic to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nWith the corresponding stronger symmetric assumptions on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, it also follows that formula_48 where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a local inverse of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; at\u00a0&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;."}

When played by women, it is called camogie ('), which shares a common Gaelic root. One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players and much terminology.\nThe objective of the game is for players to use an ash wood stick called a hurl or hurley (in Irish a ', pronounced or in English) to hit a small ball called a ' (pronounced in English) between the opponent's goalposts either over the crossbar for one point or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for three points. The ' can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air or struck on the ground with the hurley. It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass), for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the ' on the end of the stick (solo), and the ball can be handled only twice while in the player's possession. Provided that a player has at least one foot on the ground, he may make a shoulder-to-shoulder charge on an opponent who is in possession of the ball or is playing the ball, or when both players are moving in the direction of the ball. No protective padding is worn by players though a plastic protective helmet with a faceguard has been mandatory for all age groups since 2010.\nEarly forms of hurling have been played since at least the Middle Ages, with the earliest written references appearing in Irish law tracts from the seventh century. The earliest archaeological evidence dates from the twelfth-century. The first written rules for hurling were published in January 1883 by the Dublin Hurling Club.\nHurling is today administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It has featured regularly in art forms such as film, music and literature. The final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was listed in second place by CNN in its \"10 sporting events you have to see live\", after the Olympic Games and ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. \"Financial Times\" columnist Simon Kuper wrote after Stephen Bennett's performance in the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final that hurling was \"the best sport ever and if the Irish had colonised the world, nobody would ever have heard of football\". UNESCO lists hurling as an element of intangible cultural heritage. A 2024 survey found that hurling was the favourite sport of 25% of Irish people.\nRules.\nPlaying field.\nA hurling pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching long and wide. There are \"H\"-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually high, set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts. The same pitch is used for Gaelic football; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 13 metres, 20 metres and 59 metres (41 metres for Gaelic football) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.\nTeams.\nTeams consist of fifteen players: a goalkeeper, three full backs, three half backs, two midfielders, three half forwards and three full forwards (see diagram). The panel is made up of 24\u201330 players and five substitutions are allowed per game. An exception can now be made in the case of a blood substitute being necessary. Blood substitutes are a result of one player needing medical treatment for a laceration and another coming on as a temporary replacement while the injured player is tended to.\nHelmets.\nFrom 1 January 2010, the wearing of helmets became compulsory for hurlers at all levels. A standard hurling helmet is a helmet designed specially for the games of hurling and camogie. It consists of a plastic rigid shell, lined with foam cushioning, which covers the forehead, temples, crown of the head and down to the nape of the neck. A wire grille faceguard covers the whole face and is secured by straps that clip at the back of the head.This saw senior players follow the regulations already introduced in 2009 at minor and under 21 grades. The GAA hopes to significantly reduce the number of injuries by introducing the compulsory wearing of helmets with full faceguards, both in training and matches. Hurlers of all ages, including those at nursery clubs when holding a hurley in their hand, must wear a helmet and faceguard at all times. Match officials will be obliged to stop play if any player at any level appears on the field of play without the necessary standard of equipment.\nDuration, extra time, replays.\nSenior inter-county matches last 70 minutes (35 minutes per half). All other matches last 60 minutes (30 minutes per half). For teams under-13 and lower, games may be shortened to 50 minutes. Timekeeping is at the discretion of the referee who adds on stoppage time at the end of each half. In 2020, water breaks were brought in after the first 15 minutes in each half.\nThere are various solutions for knockout games that end in a draw, such as a replay, or what the rules refer to as \"Winner on the Day\" measures such as extra time (20 minutes), further extra time (10 more minutes), or a shoot-out. The application and details of these measures vary according to the importance of the match and the difficulty of scheduling possible replays, and can change from year to year. The general trend is that the GAA have been trying to reduce the need for replays, to ease scheduling.\nTechnical fouls.\nThe following are considered technical fouls (\"fouling the ball\"):\nAggressive fouls.\nCan be deliberate or accidental, often accompanied by a card. They are as follows:\nScoring.\nScoring is achieved by sending the \"sliotar\" between the opposition's goal posts. The posts, which are at each end of the field, are \"H\" posts as in rugby football but with a net under the crossbar as in association football. The posts are 6.4 m apart and the crossbar is 2.44 m above the ground.\nIf the ball goes over the crossbar, a \"point\" is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a \"goal\", worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal must be scored by either a striking motion or by directly soloing the ball into the net. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format {goal total} \u2013 {point total}. For example, the 1996 All-Ireland final finished: Wexford 1\u201313 Limerick 0\u201314. Thus Wexford won by two points (1\u201313 being worth sixteen points).\nIn speech, a score consisting of at least one goal and one point is read as simply the two numbers, so Wexford's 1\u201313 is read \"one thirteen\"; the words \"goals\" and \"points\" invariably omitted. Goals are never \"converted\" into points; it is incorrect to describe a score of 1\u201313 as \"sixteen\". 2\u20130 would be referred to as \"two goals\", never \"two zero\". Likewise, 0\u201310 would be referred to as \"ten points\", never \"zero ten\". 0\u20130 is said \"no score\". So the Wexford/Limerick match score would be read as \"Wexford one thirteen, Limerick fourteen points\".\nTackling.\nPlayers may be tackled but not struck by a one-handed slash of the stick; exceptions are two-handed jabs and strikes. Jersey-pulling, wrestling, pushing, and tripping are all forbidden. There are several forms of acceptable tackling, the most popular being:\nOfficials.\nA hurling match is watched over by eight officials:\nThe referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees, noting infractions, and issuing yellow (caution) and red (sending off) penalty cards to players after offences. A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal.\nLinesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee and also for conferring with the referee. The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board. The umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 65 m puck (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), or a goal (wave green flag).\nContrary to popular belief within the association, all officials are not obliged to indicate \"any misdemeanours\" to the referee, but are in fact permitted to inform the referee only of violent conduct they have witnessed which has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman or umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \"third time in the hand\", where a player catches the ball for a third time in succession after soloing or an illegal pick up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.\nInjury risk.\nBlunt injury to the larynx is an infrequent consequence of contact sports despite protective equipment and stringent rules. Hurling, one of the two national sporting games of Ireland, is seen as one of the fastest field sports on earth and played with only a facemask and helmet as protection, making injury an unavoidable feature of the game without further padding. The two most common sites of injury in hurling are the fingers and the hamstrings. Hurling is also considered to have \"a notable proportion of blunt scrotal trauma.\"\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nForms of stick-and-ball games have been played in Ireland since at least the Early Middle Ages. References to \"iom\u00e1in\" and \"b\u00e1ire\" are found across early Irish law tracts, annals and poetry. The word 'hurling' appears first as 'horlinge' in the 1366 Statute of Kilkenny, which prohibited Gaelic Irish cultural practices in the English colony.\nThe eighteenth century is frequently referred to as \"The Golden Age of Hurling\". This was when members of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry kept teams of players on their estates and challenged each other's teams to matches for the amusement of their tenants.\nFirst rules.\nThe earliest effort to codify the rules was not made until the late nineteenth century, by which time the traditional forms of hurling had all but died out throughout most of country. \nGaelic Athletic Association.\nThe founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884 in Hayes Hotel, Thurles, County Tipperary, ended decline by organising the game around a common set of written rules. In 1888, Tipperary represented by Thurles Blues beat Meelick of Galway to win the first All-Ireland Championship. However, the twentieth century saw Cork, Kilkenny as well as Tipperary dominate hurling with each of these counties winning more than 20 All-Ireland titles each. Wexford, Waterford, Clare, Limerick, Offaly, Antrim, Dublin, and Galway were also strong hurling counties during the twentieth century.\nAn extended qualifier system resulted in a longer All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Pay-for-play remains controversial and the Gaelic Players Association continues to grow in strength. The inauguration of the Christy Ring Cup and Nicky Rackard Cup gave new championships and an opportunity to play in Croke Park to the weaker county teams. Further dissemination of the championship structure was completed in 2009 with the addition of the Lory Meagher Cup to make it a four tier championship.\nInternational.\nAlthough many hurling clubs exist worldwide, only Ireland has a national team (although it includes only players from weaker counties in order to ensure matches are competitive). It and the Scotland shinty team have played for many years with modified match rules (as with International Rules Football). The match is the only such international competition. However, competition at club level has been going on around the world since the late nineteenth century thanks to emigration from Ireland, and the strength of the game has ebbed and flowed along with emigration trends. Nowadays, growth in hurling is noted in Continental Europe, Australia, and North America.\nArgentina.\nIrish immigrants began arriving in Argentina in the 19th century. The earliest reference to hurling in Argentina dates from the late 1880s in Mercedes, Buenos Aires. However, the game was not actively promoted until 1900, when it came to the attention of author and newspaperman William Bulfin. Under Bulfin's patronage, the Hurling Club was formed on 15 July 1900, leading to teams being established in different neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and the surrounding farming communities.\nGames of hurling were played every weekend until 1914 and received frequent coverage from Argentina's Spanish language newspapers, such as \"La Naci\u00f3n\". After the outbreak of World War I, it became almost impossible to obtain hurleys from Ireland. An attempt was made to use native Argentine mountain ash, but it proved too heavy and lacking in pliability. Although the game was revived after the end of the war, the golden age of Argentine hurling had passed. World War II finally brought the era to its close.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, immigration from Ireland slowed to a trickle. In addition, native born Irish-Argentines assimilated into the local community. The last time that hurling was played in Argentina was in 1980, when the Aer Lingus Hurling Club conducted a three-week tour of the country and played matches at several locations. Since 2009, with the realization of several Summers Camps and the visit of the All Stars in December, hurling returned to be a frequent activity at the Hurling Club, where many boys and young men have since been trained and taught to play. The Hurling Club have even been invited to take part in the Hurling Festival within The Gathering events organised by Aer Lingus. This team was present in September 2013 in the city of Galway. The team consists of 21 players from Hockey and Rugby teams. Many have contributed to the return of hurling as an activity in the club. As an example we can name Alejandro Yoyo Wade, Johnny Wade, Barbie, Cecilia and Irene Scally, David Ganly, Dickie Mac Allister, Eduardo Cabrera Punter, Hernan Magrini Scally. Several Irish have participated in many opportunities to work with the skills and education: Jonathan Lynch, Kevin O'Connors and Michael Connery, who currently works with the team's training to participate in the Aer Lingus International Hurling Festival.\nAustralia.\nThe earliest reference to hurling in Australia is related in the book \"Sketches of Garryowen\". On 12 July 1844, a match took place at Batman's Hill in Melbourne as a counterpoint to a march by the Orange Order. Reportedly, the hurling match attracted a crowd of five hundred Irish immigrants, while the Orange march shivered out of existence.\nSeveral hurling clubs existed in Victoria in the 1870s including Melbourne, Collingwood, Upper Yarra, Richmond and Geelong.\nIn 1885, a game between two Sydney-based teams took place before a crowd of over ten thousand spectators. Reportedly, the contest was greatly enjoyed despite the fact that one newspaper dubbed the game \"Two Degrees Safer Than War\".\nArden Street Oval in North Melbourne was used by Irish immigrants during the 1920s.\nThe game in Australasia is administered by Australasia GAA.\nGreat Britain.\nHurling was brought to Great Britain in the 19th century. The game is administered by British GAA. Warwickshire and Lancashire compete at inter-county level in the Lory Meagher Cup, competing against other counties in Ireland. London is the only non-Irish team to have won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (having captured the title in 1901), and after winning the 2012 Christy Ring Cup gained the right to contest the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2013.\nThe first ever hurling game played in the Scottish Highlands was played at Easter 2012 between CLG Micheal Breathnach and Fir Uladh, an Ulster select of Gaeiligoiri, as part of the Iomain Cholmcille festival, na Breathnaich coming out victorious.\nWales has its own club, St. Colmcilles in Cardiff.\nSouth Africa.\nSoldiers who served in the Irish Brigade during the Anglo-Boer War are believed to have played the game on the veldt. Immigrants from County Wicklow who had arrived to work in the explosives factory in Umbogintwini, KwaZulu-Natal formed a team c. 1915\u201316. A major burst of immigration in the 1920s led to the foundation of the \"Transvaal Hurling Association\" in Johannesburg in 1928. Games were traditionally played in a pitch on the site of the modern-day Johannesburg Central Railway Station every Easter Sunday after Mass.\nIn 1932, a South African hurling team sailed to Ireland to compete in the Tailteann Games, where they carried a banner donated by a convent of Irish nuns in Cape Town. On their arrival, they were personally received by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) at the time, \u00c9amon de Valera.\nSouth African hurling continued to prosper until the outbreak of the Second World War, which caused immigration from Ireland to cease and made it impossible to import equipment. Games of hurling and Gaelic football were occasionally sponsored by the Christian Brothers schools in Boksburg and Pretoria well into the 1950s. Both games have all but ceased to be played.\nNorth America.\nReferences to hurling on the North American continent date from the 1780s in modern-day Canada concerning immigrants from County Waterford and County Kilkenny, and also, in New York City. After the end of the American Revolution, references to hurling cease in American newspapers until the aftermath of the Great Famine when Irish people moved to America in huge numbers, bringing the game with them. Newspaper reports from the 1850s refer to occasional matches played in San Francisco, Hoboken and New York City. The first game of hurling played under GAA rules outside Ireland was played on Boston Common in June 1886.\nIn 1888, there was an American tour by fifty Gaelic athletes from Ireland, known as the 'American Invasion'. This created enough interest among Irish Americans to lay the groundwork for the North American GAA. By the end of 1889, almost a dozen GAA clubs existed in America, many of them in and around New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Later, clubs were formed in Boston, Cleveland, and many other centers of Irish America. Concord, New Hampshire has its state's only hurling team, New Hampshire Wolves, sponsored by Litherman's Limited Craft Brewery.\nIn 1910, twenty-two hurlers, composed of an equal number from Chicago and New York, conducted a tour of Ireland, where they played against the County teams from Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick, Dublin and Wexford.Traditionally, hurling was a game played by Irish immigrants and discarded by their children. Many American hurling teams took to raising money to import players directly from Ireland. In recent years, this has changed considerably with the advent of the Internet and increased travel. The Barley House Wolves hurling team from New Hampshire was formed when U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq saw a hurling game on the television in Shannon Airport as their plane refuelled. Outside of the traditional North American GAA cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, clubs are springing up in other places where they consist of predominantly American-born players who bring a new dimension to the game and actively seek to promote it as a mainstream sport, especially Joe Maher, a leading expert at the sport in Boston. The Milwaukee Hurling Club, with 300 members, is the largest Hurling club in the world outside Ireland, and is made of mostly Americans and very few Irish immigrants. The St. Louis Gaelic Athletic Club was established in 2002 and has expanded its organization to an eight team hurling league in the spring and six team Gaelic football league in the fall. They also have a 30-member camogie league. Saint Louis has won two National Championships in Jr C Hurling (2004 and 2011), as well as two National Championships in Jr D Gaelic Football (2005, and 2013). The Indianapolis Hurling Club began in 2002, then reformed in 2005. In 2008, the Indy Hurling Club won the Junior C National Championship. In 2011, Indy had 7 club teams and sent a Junior B, Junior C and Camogie team to nationals.\nThe GAA have also begun to invest in American college students with university teams springing up at University of Connecticut, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Purdue University, Indiana University, University of Montana and other schools. On 31 January 2009, the first ever US collegiate hurling match was held between UC Berkeley and Stanford University, organized by the newly formed California Collegiate Gaelic Athletic Association. UC Berkeley won the challenge match by one point, while Stanford won the next two CCGAA matches to win the first collegiate cup competition in the U.S. On Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, the first ever National Collegiate GAA championship was played. The Indiana University Hurling Club won all matches of the tournament, and won by four points in the championship final to be crowned the first ever U.S. National Collegiate Champions.\nOlympic Games.\nHurling was an demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. A single match was played between two American clubs, Innisfails from St. Louis and Fenians from Chicago. Innisfails won 2-2 to 0-2.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was opened in November 1876 and is located north of Moore Park, a neighbourhood of Toronto. The cemetery has kilometres of drives and walking paths interspersed with fountains, statues and botanical gardens, as well as rare and distinct trees. It was originally laid out by German-born landscape architect Henry Adolph Engelhardt, inspired by the European and American garden cemeteries of the 19th century, and with influences from Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston.\nAs the final resting place of more than 168,000 persons, Mount Pleasant Cemetery contains remarkable architecture amongst its many monuments. The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2000.\nHistory.\nIn the early 19th century, the only authorized cemeteries within the town of York (predecessor to present-day Toronto) were limited to members of either the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. Deceased citizens who did not belong to either of these Christian denominations had no choice but to find burial arrangements outside of the city. Notably, those of Jewish faith who wanted a Jewish burial had to resort to cemeteries beyond Ontario (Montreal and Buffalo) until Pape Avenue Cemetery was opened outside of Toronto in 1849.\nIn response to a petition to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, which included \"it has become desirable that a Plot be obtained for the purpose of a General Burying Ground, as well for Strangers as for the Inhabitants of the Town, of whatever sect or denomination they may be\", a statute named \"An act to authorize certain persons therein named, and their successors, to hold certain lands for the purpose therein mentioned\" was passed and received Royal Assent in 1826: \"Acts of U.C. 7 Geo. IV, c. 21\". The land that came to be known as the \"Potters Field\" was acquired and started operation as a cemetery soon afterwards. Over time, additional cemetery lands were added to what became the Toronto General Burying Ground.\nIn 1873, a new cemetery available to all citizens was established. The new cemetery was situated on an farm on Lot 19 Concession 3 (also referred to as Yonge Street Farm) that was once owned by the Cawthra family (and likely by William Cawthra) at the far outskirts of the city. Mount Pleasant Cemetery formally opened on 4 November 1876, with more than of carriage drives along rolling hills and ponds. Mount Pleasant Road was later constructed to pass through the centre of the cemetery and is named after it. The cemetery also has remains and a number of stone markers that were moved from the Potter's Field. The urban expansion of Toronto eventually led to Mount Pleasant Cemetery being situated in the centre of the city.\nA number of Canadian servicemen who died during the World Wars were interred at the cemetery. It contains 231 Commonwealth War Graves, comprising 126 burials in World War I and 105 in World War II. 188 are of the Canadian, and 43 the British, armed forces.\nIn the autumn of 2009, the cemetery opened Mount Pleasant Visitation Centre. The new building is approximately and is built on the property grounds. It was built with the intention to provide visitation space and chapel services.\nThe cemetery began planning the building as early as 2004, but disputes with the City of Toronto government, local funeral homes, and the Ontario Municipal Board all delayed the project. Changes were made as a result of this process, most notably vehicle access is now through the cemetery grounds only (near the cemetery offices), not directly from Moore Avenue.\nControversy.\nDespite the cemetery having been created as a public trust by Special Act of the Ontario legislature in 1826 (Toronto General Burying Grounds Act), Mount Pleasant Group began to assert publicly that it had been converted in 1871 into a corporation subject to the Corporations Act of Ontario and that it was no longer a trust. Community activist Margot Boyd and others argued that its status as a public trust remained unchanged.\nWith donations from the community, Boyd engaged the McCarthy Tetrault law firm in 2009 to review the statutes pertaining to Mount Pleasant Group. An 18-page letter sent to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated: \u201cLegally, this trust might be characterized in several ways, but an accurate description of the trust in question is a \u2018public trust.\u2019 \u201d Local politicians Toronto Centre MPP Glen Murray and Ward 12 Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow both agreed at the time.\nAs early as 2006, Mount Pleasant Group began describing itself as a commercial privately owned entity, and refused to disclose its financial records, giving rise to allegations that it was engaged in the stealth privatization of a public asset. In 2012, Mount Pleasant Group commenced a public relations campaign against Boyd and others in an attempt to deflect criticism, and to discredit its detractors by labelling them NIMBYs.\nIn December 2012, Boyd and lawyer and community activist Pamela Taylor organized a public trustee election in accordance with the requirements of the 1849 Special Act.\nIn 2013, over the objections of local residents, Mount Pleasant Group installed a new crematorium. The siting of the facility was a mere 16.5 metres from neighbouring houses, and contrary to Toronto City By-laws. Ward 13 City Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam sought leave to appeal against the Ontario Ministry of the Environment decision to allow the crematorium.\nAlso in 2013, Boyd and Taylor, together with historian and environmental consultant Lorraine Tinsley, founded the not-for-profit association Friends of Toronto Public Cemeteries and brought an Application to the Superior Court of Ontario to interpret the cemetery statutes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73107", "revid": "50997630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73107", "title": "Shinty", "text": "Team sport with ball and sticks\nShinty () is a team sport played with sticks and a ball. It is played mainly in the Scottish Highlands and among Highland migrants to the major cities of Scotland. The sport was formerly more widespread in Scotland and even played in Northern England into the second half of the 20th century and other areas in the world where Scottish Highlanders migrated.\nWhile comparisons are made with hockey, the two games have several important differences. In shinty a player is allowed to play the ball in the air and use both sides of the stick. The latter is called a , which is wooden and slanted on both sides. The stick may also be used to block and to tackle, although a player may not come down on an opponent's stick, a practice called hacking. Players may also tackle using the body as long as it is shoulder to shoulder.\nThe game was derived from the same root as the Irish game of hurling/camogie and the Welsh game of bando, but has developed unique rules and features. These rules are governed by the Camanachd Association. A composite rules shinty\u2013hurling game has been developed in which Scotland and Ireland play annual international matches.\nAnother sport with common ancestry is bandy, which is played on ice. In Scottish Gaelic the name for bandy is \"ice shinty\" () and \"bandy\" and \"shinty\" (and \"shinney\") could be used interchangeably in the English language.\nOrigins.\nHurling, an Irish pastime for at least 2,000 years similar to shinty, is derived from the historic game common to both peoples. Shinty/hurling appears prominently in the legend of C\u00fachulainn, the Celtic mythology hero. A similar game is played on the Isle of Man known as cammag, a name cognate with camanachd. The old form of hurling played in the northern half of Ireland, called \"commons\", resembled shinty more closely than the standardised form of hurling of today. Like shinty, it was commonly known as and was traditionally played in winter. It is still played regularly on Saint Stephen's Day in St John's.\nThe origins of the name \"shinty\" are uncertain. There is a theory that the name was derived from the cries used in the game; \"shin ye\", \"shin you\" and \"shin t'ye\", other dialect names were \"shinnins\", \"shinnack\", \"shinnup\". \"chinnup\", Alernatively, as Hugh Dan MacLennan proposes, from the Scottish Gaelic . However, there was never one all-encompassing name for the game, as it held different names from glen to glen, including ('play-ball' in English) and in the Scottish Lowlands, where it was formerly referred to as \"hailes\", \"common\"/\"cammon\" (\"caman\"), \"cammock\" (from Scottish Gaelic ), \"knotty\", carrick and various other names, as well as the terms still used to refer to it in modern Gaelic, or . Shinty was once a popular game in lowland Scotland, as shown by its name \"shintie\", a term which took that form around 1700, displacing the earlier \"shinnie\" \u2013 of which there is a written record about 100 years earlier. \"Shinnie\" may also derive from \"shin\" in English, with the affix \"-ie\", a common termination to the name of many games in Scotland.\nGame.\nPlaying area.\nThe objective of the game is to play a small ball into a goal, or \"hail\", erected at the ends of a by pitch. The game is traditionally played on grass, although as of 2009 the sport may be played on artificial turf. The pitch also has marks indicating a area around the goals, the penalty and centre spots (along with their associated arcs/circles of radius), and corner arcs at the corners of the rectangular pitch of radius. The goals, at opposite ends of the field, measure wide and high and a net is affixed to catch the ball when a goal is scored.\nBall.\nThe ball is a hard solid sphere of around half the diameter of a tennis ball, consisting of a cork core covered by two pieces of leather stitched together. The seam is raised. It is very similar to a hurling sliotar in that it resembles an American baseball with more pronounced stitching. The permitted circumference is between and weight between . The ball is usually white, but there is no statutory colour, black being a common colour for Kyles Athletic, and fluorescent balls now being available.\nPlastic balls or soft balls are often used in youth competitions such as the variant \"First Shinty\".\nStick.\nThe ball is played using a \"caman\", which is a stick about long with two slanted faces. The stick has a wedge shaped head, roughly triangular in cross section, which must be able to pass through a ring in diameter. Unlike the Irish \"cam\u00e1n\", it has no blade. The \"caman\" is traditionally made of wood, traditionally ash but now more commonly hickory, and must not have any plate or metal attached to it. The \"caman\" would be made from any piece of wood with a hook in it, hence \"caman\", from the Scottish and Irish Gaelic word \"cam\", meaning bent or crooked. It can also be called a stick or club. The slant of the face will vary according to the position that the stick is used for. It can be made according to the player's height.\nPlastic camans are common in the youth variant \"First Shinty\".\nRules of play.\nA player can play the ball in the air and is allowed to use both sides of the stick. The stick may also be used to block and to tackle, although a player may not bring their stick down on an opponent's stick, which is defined as hacking. A player may tackle an opponent using the body as long as it is shoulder-to-shoulder as in association football (soccer).\nA player may only stop the ball with the stick, the chest, two feet together or one foot on the ground. Only the goalkeeper may use his hands, but only with an open palm since he is not allowed to catch it. Playing the ball with the head constitutes a foul whether intentional or not, as it is considered dangerous play. Other examples of dangerous play, which will be penalised, are a player, while grounded, playing the ball, or a player recklessly swinging the caman in the air in a way which might endanger another player.\nFouls are penalised by a free-hit, which is indirect unless the foul is committed in the penalty area, commonly referred to as \"The D\". This results in a penalty hit from .\nA ball played by a team over the opposing bye line results in a goal hit from the edge of the D, while a ball played by a team over their own line results in a corner. A ball hit over the sideline results in a shy: a shinty shy involves the taker tossing the ball above his head and hitting the ball with the shaft of the caman, and the ball must be directly overhead when struck.\nScoring.\nThe winner of a game is the team that scores the most goals. A team scores a goal \"when the whole of the ball has passed over the goal-line and under the cross-bar\". A goal can only be scored with the caman; there is no goal when the ball \"has been kicked, carried or propelled by hand or arm by a player of the attacking side.\" A goal cannot be scored directly from a free-hit.\nTeam size.\nTeams consist of 12 players (men) or 10 players (women), including a goalkeeper. A match is played over two halves of 45 minutes. With the exception of the goalkeeper, no player is allowed to play the ball with his hands. There are also variants with smaller sides, with some adjustments in the field size and duration of play.\nSubstitutions.\nAs with sports such as football, shinty originally did not have substitutes. These were introduced in the 1960s, progressively expanding to allow a maximum of three substitutions per game. As of 2011, a rule change allowed for rolling substitutions to be made at the senior level.\nOrganisation.\nIn common with many sports, shinty became formalised in the Victorian Era and the first organised clubs were established in cities such as Glasgow and London where there were thousands of Gaels resident.\nIn 1887, a historic game was played between Glenurquhart Shinty Club and Strathglass Shinty Club in Inverness. This game was attended by thousands of people and was a major milestone in developing a set of common rules. This fixture was to be repeated on 12 January 2007 in Inverness as the opening centrepiece of the Highland 2007 celebrations in Scotland, but was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.\nThe modern sport is governed by the Camanachd Association (). The association came into being in the late Victorian era as a means of formulating common rules to unite the various different codes and rules which differed between neighbouring glens. Its first meeting was held in Kingussie in 1893.\nThe Camanachd Association maintained its initial structure for much of its first century. The 'Future of Shinty' Report published in 1981 led to a complete restructuring of the way in which shinty was organised and managed. That led to the move away from a dependence on volunteers to govern the sport, to the Association's first salaried employees.\nCompetitions.\nThere are shinty clubs in Aberdeen, Aberdour (Fife), Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Cornwall, Oxford and even London. University Shinty is a popular section of the sport, with almost all Scotland's main universities possessing a team. Historically, Glasgow University, Aberdeen University and Edinburgh University have vied for supremacy, but in recent years, Strathclyde University, Robert Gordon University, Dundee University, and the University of St. Andrews have risen to prominence. Clubs compete in various competitions, both cup and league, on a national and also North/South basis. While the top Premier Division has been played on a Scotland-wide basis since 1996, the lower leagues are based on geography. Many clubs run second teams that also compete in these leagues against clubs with only one senior side.\nSeason.\nShinty was traditionally played through the winter, based around the tradition of the \"Iomain Challainn\", where New Year was marked by a game between neighbouring parishes. The summer was left free for seasonal work and friendly tournaments. The Winter season always ran over, however, and many teams would find themselves finishing the previous season only weeks before the next one would start.\nIn 2003, shinty clubs voted for a trial period of two years of a summer season from March to October, with a view to moving permanently to summer shinty if the experiment was judged to be a success. Despite opposition from the \"Big Two\", Kingussie and Newtonmore, and other small groups in the game, an EGM in November 2005 voted by an overwhelming majority (well over the required two thirds) to make summer shinty the basis upon which the game would proceed.\nThere have been teething problems since the move to summer shinty, with a couple of teams being culpable for the season running over into November and December. Season 2010 saw the league season finished by the first weekend in October, almost on schedule.\nShinty does still get played during the winter, in University Shinty which has teams compete for the second most valuable trophy in Scottish sport \u2013 the Littlejohn Vase \u2013 and in New Year fixtures, the most prestigious of which is the Lovat Cup, played between Beauly and Lovat.\nLeagues.\n\"For more information, see Shinty league system\"\nLeague shinty was originally organised on a regional basis, with distinct competitions for the North District and at one time, two separate leagues for Argyll (the Dunn League) and the Southern League, for clubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh and the surrounding areas. Over time, there have been moves to amalgamate leagues and, since the 1980s, a push for national competition at the highest levels. In the modern era of league shinty, Kingussie have been unsurpassed in their domination of the sport; according to the Guinness Book of Records 2005, Kingussie is world sport's most successful sporting team of all time, winning 20 consecutive league championships and going four years without losing a single fixture in the early 1990s. \nKingussie's unmatched run of dominance was ended on 2 September 2006 by rivals Newtonmore, who defeated Oban Camanachd 2\u20130 to ensure that Kingussie could not catch the team at the top of the Premier Division. However, Newtonmore were unable to replace their neighbours as champions, as the first post-Kingussie champions were confirmed as Fort William, who sealed the title on 30 September 2006, having won their games in hand over Newtonmore. Kingussie regained the title in 2007. Since 2010, Newtonmore have been the dominant league force.\nCup.\nCup shinty has always been seen as being more important than league shinty, and the premier national competition remains the Scottish Cup or the Camanachd Association Challenge Cup, the Camanachd Cup for short. Until 1983 the competition was designed to ensure the final was between the North and South.\nThe Macaulay Cup still preserves a guaranteed North/South Final. There are national equivalents for the Camanachd Cup for intermediate and junior teams. There are regional cups for both senior and junior teams; the MacTavish Cup is the senior cup for the North and the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup is the one for the South.\nShinty and hurling internationals.\nIn recognition of shinty's shared roots with hurling, an annual international between the two codes from Scotland and Ireland is played on a home and away basis using composite rules. In recent years, the Irish have had the upper hand, but the Scots won the fixture narrowly in 2005 and again in 2006, this time at Croke Park, Dublin, albeit with the Irish fielding weaker players from the second tier Christy Ring Cup. Scotland made it four in a row when they won in 2008.\nOutside Scotland.\nCanadian Gaelic-speaking pioneers in Nova Scotia adapted shinty, which was traditionally a winter sport, to the much colder Canadian climate by wearing ice skates while playing on frozen lakes. This led to the creation of the modern winter sport known as ice hockey.\nThe game of shinny in Canada is a synonym for street hockey, pond hockey or any informal game of hockey. It derives its name from shinty, although a myth there perpetuates that it came from children tying Eaton's catalogues around their legs to protect their shins from flying pucks or slashing.\nThe English Shinty Association (ESA) is the main body for promoting and encouraging the sport of shinty in England.\nLondon Camanachd is a shinty club first established in the Victorian era, competing in English and Scottish competitions such as the English League, the Bullough Cup and most recently in the Camanachd Cup in 1994. They went into abeyance in 1995, but were reconstituted in 2005. They played the first officially recognised shinty match outside Scotland in 80 years on 22 July 2006 against the Highlanders. They compete annually in the English Shinty Championships against Cornwall, Oxford, Devon and Bristol as well as playing shinty\u2013hurling matches and organising sporadic friendlies against visiting teams.\nOn 28 December 2010 Ireland held its first dedicated shinty match in Westmeath, with players who have played the Compromise rules Shinty/Hurling.\nA Cornwall Shinty Club was established in 2012, playing their first game on 21 April 2012 against London; the match finished a draw. They also entered the St Andrew's Sixes tournament in 2012. Following this, in December 2012, two more Cornish clubs were created; the first being the Combined Universities of Cornwall and the second being Mabe. These two teams put forward their best players to play for the Cornwall Shinty Club.\nThere was a team in Northallerton in the 1970s, which competed in six-a-sides; and on 1 August 2012 a re-vamped Northallerton Shinty Club was formed. The club is hoping to draw in a few former players, but wants to focus on raising awareness of the game in Yorkshire and bringing new local players into the game.\nShinty was played widely in England in the 19th century and early 20th century, with teams such as London Scots, Bolton Caledonian and Cottonopolis; Nottingham Forest F.C. was established by shinty players.\nSince 2012 London has hosted the annual \"London Shinty Festival\", which has been attended by Cornwall, London, Oxford Shinty Club, St Andrews university ladies team, and the Scots. It is an open tournament held in late September after the Shinty season is finished to allow any travelling teams the opportunity to attend.\nSince 2013, a combined English Shinty Association side has entered the Bullough cup, being beaten in 2013 by Tayforth and then in 2014 by Ballachulish.\nShinty is played in the British Army, with The Scots Shinty Club keeping alive the tradition of the game being played in the Forces.\nShinty is also being revived among the Scottish diaspora in North America, where it was originally played in the 18th and 19th century by Scottish immigrants, but died out. More recent teams such as Northern California Camanachd Club (NCCC), Central California Cammanchd (CCC), and Oregon Shinty-Camanachd (OSC) play at Highland games and other venues across the USA.\nMedia coverage.\nLocal papers, such as the \"West Highland Free Press\", \"The Buteman\", the \"Oban Times\" and the \"Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard\", have in-depth shinty reports. The Inverness-based media reduce shinty coverage to one summary of the whole weekend's action, as do national newspapers, such as the \"Sunday Herald\" and the \"Sunday Post\". The only significant national press coverage is of the Camanachd Cup final. Regional newspaper \"The Press and Journal\" runs shinty coverage twice a week (Mondays and Fridays).\nThe first-ever shinty match broadcast live on television was the 1964 Celtic Society Cup Final. Although Camanachd Cup finals and internationals have been shown over the years, 2006 marked the first-ever regular TV deal for shinty with matches being shown on the BBC Sports show \"Sp\u00f2rs\". This was then followed by the STV show \"An Caman\".\n2009 saw the Camanachd Association sign a deal with BBC Alba to broadcast all national finals as well as the Marine Harvest Festival. The MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup final were also shown on BBC Two. There is also an increasing amount of shinty on the internet, with various clips garnering attention on video sites such as YouTube. 2011 was a sparse year for TV coverage outside of the usual games, but 2012 saw several games filmed live on BBC Alba.\nThe sport is featured on BBC Radio nan Gaidheal by the programme, Sp\u00f2rs na Seachdain, although English-language radio interest is usually restricted to the big events in the year. Commentary on the Camanachd Cup Final is provided in both English and Gaelic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.\nA variant of the game \"hurling\" (which is played by men only), it is organised by the Dublin-based Camogie Association (An Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta). The annual All Ireland Camogie Championship has a record attendance of 33,154, while average attendances in recent years are in the range of 15,000 to 18,000. The final is broadcast live, with a TV audience of as many as over 300,000.\nUNESCO lists Camogie as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The game is referred to in \"Waiting for Godot\" by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett and in 'Fair Play' a detective novel by Irish author Louise Hegarty.\nGame and Rules.\nThe game consists of two thirty-minute halves. There is a half-time interval of 15 minutes. In event of extra time, halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of one goalkeeper, three full back players, three half back players, two centre-field players, three half forward players and three full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times. The rules are almost identical to hurling, with a few exceptions.\nUnder the original 1903 rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields long and wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a \"points bar\" was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation, although it was more a \"squeezed lemon\" formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation.\nField and equipment.\nField.\nThe field is not of a fixed size, but must be long by wide.\nSticks.\nThe length of the stick, called a \"hurley\", varies depending on the player's height.\nGoals and scoring.\nH-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a \"point\", the team earns one point. If the ball goes under the bar for a \"goal\", the team earns three points.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe name was invented by Tadhg Ua Donnchadha (T\u00f3rna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904. The term camogie is derived from the name of the stick used in the game. Men play hurling using a curved stick called a \"cam\u00e1n\" in Irish. Women in the early camogie games used a shorter stick described by the diminutive form \"cam\u00f3g\". The suffix -\"a\u00edocht\" (originally \"uidheacht\") was added to both words to give names for the sports: \"cam\u00e1na\u00edocht\" (which became \"iom\u00e1na\u00edocht\") and \"cam\u00f3ga\u00edocht\". When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name \"hurling\" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name \"cam\u00f3ga\u00edocht\" to \"camogie\".\nThe experimental rules were drawn up for the female game by M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide, Se\u00e1n (Sceilg) \u00d3 Ceallaigh, Tadhg \u00d3 Donnchadha and S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Braon\u00e1in. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Ch\u00e9itinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and C\u00fachulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta, was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta na nGael.\nM\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide and C\u00e1it N\u00ed Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of N\u00ed Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg \u00d3 Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de si\u00e8cle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing. Nonetheless, the creation of camogie was not universally supported - even by women - with leading figures such as president of the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Conradh na Gaeilge member, Kit Ahern (despite her support of GAA clubs for men) describing camogie as \"too strenuous for girls\".\nLeagues.\nThough the finals are given prominent TV slots and efforts to market the game are extensive, this has not stopped media descriptions of attendances of a few hundred at vast arenas like Croke Park (capacity of over 80,000) and Semple Stadium (capacity only 45,000) as \"paltry and embarrassing\".\nIreland.\nAn Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta has a similar structure to the Gaelic Athletic Association, with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council\u2014the Ard Chomhairle\u2014which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin. Each of 28 county boards takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo), with the number of clubs ranging from 63 in Cork to one in Leitrim. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in Asia, Australia, Britain, Europe, New York, New Zealand and North America. However, Ireland does not have as much local coverage of ladies' sport as other countries such as Australia.\nClubs.\nIreland.\nThere are 538 camogie clubs, of which 513 are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in Connacht, 195 in Leinster, 160 in Munster, and 110 in Ulster.\nConnacht.\nThere are 47 camogie teams in Connacht.\nLeinster.\nThere are 195 camogie teams in Leinster.\nMunster.\nThere are 172 camogie teams in Munster.\nUlster.\nThere are 110 camogie teams in Ulster.\nCompetitions in Ireland.\nAll-Ireland Championship.\nThe county is the unit of structure in elite competition, responsible for organising club competitions within the county unit and for fielding inter-county teams in the various grades of the All-Ireland championships and National Camogie League. The All Ireland Club Championship is staged at Senior, Intermediate and Junior level, usually reaching the final stages in November\u2013December or the following March. London competed in the National Camogie League in the 2010 season, but not in 2011.\nCounties compete for the elite All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship in which the O'Duffy Cup is awarded. The All-Ireland Final is held every year in Croke Park during September, usually on the week between the hurling final and Gaelic football final, and attracts attendances of up to 33,000.\nThere are age-graded All Ireland championships at Minor A, Minor B, and Minor C, and Under-16 A, B and C level.\nSix teams contest the fourth-tier Nancy Murray Cup (or Junior A championship), Carlow, Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Westmeath, and the second team of Offaly.\nThree teams contest the fifth-tier M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide Cup, (or Junior B championship), Wicklow, and the second teams of Kildare and Meath.\nAlthough six counties do not compete at adult level: Donegal, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo and Sligo do not compete at adult level, clubs from Fermanagh, Kerry and Mayo have won honours and Donegal have contested divisional finals at under-14 Feile na nGael level. Both Louth (in 1934 and 1936) and Mayo (in 1959) have contested the All Ireland senior final in the past.\nNational League.\nThe National League is staged during the winter-spring months, with four divisions of team graded by ability.\nProvincial championships.\nProvincial championships take place at all levels, independent of the All Ireland series which has been run on an open draw basis since 1973.\nInternational and inter-provincial.\nIreland plays a camogie-shinty international against Scotland each year. The Gael Linn Cup is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the Celtic Congress. Two former Camogie Association presidents M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide and Agnes O'Farrelly were also presidents of Celtic Congress and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the Isle of Man in 1938, marked the first appearance of Kathleen Cody, who became one of the stars of the 1940s.\nInter-collegiate.\nThe Ashbourne and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions.\nSchools.\nThere is also a programme of provincial and All Ireland championships at secondary schools senior and junior levels, differentiated by the years of secondary school cycle, with years 4\u20136 competing in the senior competition, and years 1\u20133 competing at junior level. Cumann na mBunscoil organises competitions at primary school level.\nF\u00e9ile na nGael.\nCamogie competitions for club teams featuring under-14 players are played in four divisions as part of the annual F\u00e9ile na nGael festival. The county that is selected for a particular year, all their clubs host teams from all around the country representing their county. Host clubs get families to take in two or three children for a couple of days.\nInternational presence.\nThough camogie is played predominantly in its native homeland of Ireland, it has spread to other countries, largely among the Irish diaspora due to immigrants and the immigrant population. The sport is known to have arrived in places in such as Great Britain, North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina.\nSoutheast Asia has teams in Vietnam, Thailand, and Kuala Lumpur.\nIn North America camogie is played in the United States, Canada, and in parts of the Caribbean. Camogie has also been included as a part of the GAA World Games.\nGAA World Games.\n2019 Renault GAA World Games.\nRenault GAA World Games - Camogie (Native Born)\nNorth American presence.\nCamogie teams in North America have existed for at least a century.\nUnited States.\nThe national organizing body for Gaelic Games in the United States, with the exception of New York City, is the USGAA where camogie can be found.

He fled Rome on 24 January 1059 and is today generally regarded as an antipope.\nHe was a son of Guido, Lord of Poli, who was the youngest son of Alberic III, Count of Tusculum, a member of the dominant political dynasty in the region at that time. Giovanni was a nephew of the notorious Pope Benedict IX, who was deposed in 1048. Benedict X reportedly later was given the nickname of \"Mincius\" (thin) due to his ignorance. His mother was present at his trial in April 1060.\nBiography.\nGiovanni, Bishop of Velletri, was created a cardinal by Pope Leo IX in 1050. He was highly esteemed, however, by those who wanted to reform the Church, and was one of five men proposed by Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine when consulted during the summer of 1057 concerning a possible successor to Pope Victor II, whom Frederick himself succeeded as Pope Stephen IX. Pope Victor had died at Arezzo on 28 July 1057, where he had just held a synod, but his successor was elected in Rome, in the Basilica of S. Pietro in vincoli, on 2 August 1057 and consecrated the next day.\nIn less than a year, Stephen IX (Frederick of Lorraine) created thirteen new cardinals. Peter Damian was a native of Ravenna and had been educated in northern Italy. Ubderto Poggi was from Poggio (now Poggio Lucenzio), in the duchy of Lucca. Bruno, cardinal priest of S. Sabina, was from Germany. Ugobaldo degli Obizi came from Lucca. The Benedictine Alberic came from the neighborhood of Benevento. Of the more senior cardinals, Boniface of Albano was from Apulia, Hugo of Silva Candida was a Burgundian, and Stephen of S. Crisogono was a monk of Cluny.\nIn 1058, Pope Stephen was relieved, by force on the part of the Romans, of the treasure which he had brought to Rome from Constantinople, in the wake of his participation in the embassy which excommunicated the Patriarch Michael Cerularius and began the Great Schism. He transferred the remaining treasure to Montecassino, and then hastened into Tuscany, in order to consult with his elder brother Godfrey, whom he had enfeoffed as Duke of Spoleto in January 1058. It was even suggested that Stephen intended to make his brother emperor. He suddenly grew weak, and died in Florence on 29 March 1058. It is said that he was given poison on the journey by an agent of the Romans. The Romans also asserted that Godfrey had dispatched 500 troops and money to regain control of Rome, which motivated the Romans to act.\nPope Stephen, before he left Rome, issued a decree, in the presence of the bishops, clergy, and people of Rome, that no election was to be held until the return of Cardinal Hildebrand from a mission to Germany, under penalty of anathematization. Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII) had been sent to the court of Empress Agnes, who had questioned the validity of Stephen's own election. A somewhat different version of the story has it that Pope Stephen summoned the bishops, cardinals, and deacons, and informed them that he knew that some of them were planning to fill the papal seat with the help of lay persons, not in accordance with the decrees of the holy fathers. The assembled clergy then swore that they would never consent to someone becoming pope except in accordance with canon law.\nEnthroned as pope.\nNews of Pope Stephen's death was brought to Rome by two cardinal-bishops, Humbert of Silva Candida and Peter of Tusculum. A section of the Roman aristocracy, along with numerous members of the clergy who were opposed to the reforms being pushed by the German popes and Cardinal Hildebrand, engineered a coup. The leaders were Rome's traditional leaders for more than a century, Gregory, the son of Alberic of Tusculum and brother of Pope Benedict IX; Count Gerard of Galeria, the son of Rainerius; and members of the Monticelli branch of the Crescentius family from Tivoli. On the night of 4\u20145 April, they forced their way into Rome with large forces, and seized control, establishing a \"tyranny\", in the words of their enemies. Cardinal Giovanni, Bishop of Tusculum, was enthroned, unwillingly, as pope, on 5 April 1058. His election, it is stated, was arranged by his own family. Since he was already a bishop, he did not need to be consecrated, only enthroned. Cardinal Peter Damiani and his supporters in the reform party, objected loudly to the proceedings and began to cast anathemas. At length, he and his followers fled in terror. Cardinal Humbert and Cardinal Peter of Tusculum, who witnessed the disorders of April 5, fled to Benevento a few days later. As a result, a number of cardinals alleged that the election was irregular. These cardinals were soon moved to flee Rome.\nWhen Hildebrand heard of Benedict's election during his return journey from the German court, he decided to oppose it. He went to Florence where he obtained the support of Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine, Duke of Spoleto, and Marquis of Tuscany for the election of Gerhard of Burgundy, Archbishop of Florence, as pope instead. Godfrey was the elder brother of the recently deceased Pope Stephen IX. Support for this was given by Empress Agnes. Those cardinals who had opposed Benedict's election met at Siena in December 1058, and elected Gerhard, who then took the name of Nicholas II.\nDeposition.\nNicholas then proceeded towards Rome, along the way holding a synod at Sutri, where he pronounced Benedict deposed and excommunicated. The supporters of Nicholas then gained control of Rome, and forced Benedict to flee to the castle of Count Gerard of Galeria. Having arrived in Rome, Nicholas was crowned as pope on 24 January 1059. He then proceeded to wage war against Benedict and his supporters, with the assistance of Norman forces based in southern Italy, after he agreed to recognize Count Richard of Aversa as ruler of Capua. An initial battle was fought in Campagna in early 1059, which was not wholly successful for Nicholas; but later that same year, his forces conquered Praeneste, Tusculum and Nomento, and then attacked Gal\u00e9ria, forcing Benedict to surrender and to renounce the papacy in the Fall of that year.\nAfter he returned to Rome, Archdeacon Hildebrand interrogated the cardinals about their behavior in regard to the oath they had taken, not to elect a pope until he had returned from his embassy to the German court. Some did not defend themselves, saying that it was not done well, and that those who enthroned Benedict did not do so with their consent. Others defended themselves, saying, \"Since he was good, wise, humble, chaste, kindly, and whatever else is found in a good person was found in him, what we did we believe that we did well.\" The disagreement between them and Hildebrand continued. One of those cardinals, Peter Damiani, testified independently to Benedict's character, stating that he was \"bene litteratus\", with a lively personality, chaste and with no suspicion, and generous in giving charity.\nBenedict was allowed to go free, departing from the Lateran Palace a few days before the consecration of Nicholas II (24 January 1059). He retired to one the castle of Passerani (a suburb of Rieti), which was held by Regetellus, the son of the Prefect Crescentius, and from there to Galeria (not far from Bracciano), which was held by Count Gerard, the son of Rainerius. In March 1060 he returned to Rome and took up residence in his own house near S. Maria Maggiore, where he remained for thirty days. Then the Archdeacon Hildebrand arrested him by force, and brought him along with himself to the Lateran, where the council was in session. Pope Nicholas deemed his submission inadequate and had him publicly tried in April 1060, with Hildebrand serving as his prosecutor. Hildebrand put a document into Benedict's hands, and demanded that he read it aloud and sign it. Benedict refused, unwilling to accuse himself and saying it had nothing to do with himself. With tears and lamentations, he was forced to read it. Despite Benedict's pleading that he had been forced to assume the papal crown, he was convicted, deposed, and stripped of all his titles and his ordination as priest and bishop. He was further sentenced to confinement in the guest house ('hospitium') attached to the Basilica of .\nSuppus, the Archpriest of S. Anastasia, who was the spiritual advisor of Pope Nicholas II, requested that he show Benedict indulgence, and thereupon Benedict was restored to the post of Lector.\nHe died, still in confinement, sometime during the reign of Gregory VII, between 1073 and 1080. The Archpriest Seppus went to Pope Gregory to inform him of the death and the ceremonies with which they had buried him. Gregory burst out, saying they should have buried him with pontifical honors, and on the pope's orders, he was interred with those honors in the Basilica of Saint Agnes.\nAftermath.\nThe most important consequence of these events was the adoption of new regulations for papal elections, laid out at a synod presided over by Pope Nicholas in the Lateran Palace at Easter 1059. It was attended by 113 bishops and other clergy. It limited the vote in a papal election to the cardinal Bishops, and the right of approval to the College of Cardinals. The imperial sanction, whether obtained before an election or after one, was eliminated. This was a major step in depriving the lower clergy, the nobility, and Roman citizenry from their role in the election of future popes. Additionally, the diocese which Benedict had held as Bishop of Velletri was given in administration to the Bishop of Ostia in the bull of Pope Alexander II \"Si Extraneis\", dated 11 June 1065. Ca. 1150, Pope Eugenius III permanently combined the two dioceses into one.\nBenedict X was never considered a legitimate pope, having been condemned as an antipope in the Synod of Sutri in 1059. However, several lists of popes down until the time of Pope Honorius III in the thirteenth century listed his name. The \"Liber Pontificalis\" assigns him a reign of eight months and twenty days, which would be 5 April to 24 December 1058. Nicholas II was consecrated on 24 January 1059.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their lineup has seen many changes over the years; Blackmore and Night have been the only two constant members. They have released eleven studio albums. Their early releases were mostly acoustic and imitated early music, but eventually Blackmore's Night started using more electric guitars and other modern instruments, as well as performing folk-rearranged cover versions of pop and rock songs. \nHistory.\nEarly.\nCandice Night was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music.\nDuring the reformed Rainbow's recording of the album \"Stranger in Us All\" in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.\n1997 to 2005.\nTheir debut album \"Shadow of the Moon\" was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song \"Play Minstrel Play\". In subsequent albums, particularly \"Fires at Midnight\", there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, while maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent on a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.\nThe group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including \"castle tours\" of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: \"Renaissance Night\", the Italian \"Morning Star,\" The \"Midnight\" and \"Elflore\".\nThey have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game.\n2006\u2013present.\nIn 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween's \"Light the Universe\", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album \"\", released in the same year.\nOn 27 June 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called \"Secret Voyage\", a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (\u201cLocked Within the Crystal Ball\" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore's Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (\u201cRainbow Eyes\u201d) and an Elvis Presley cover (\"Can't Help Falling in Love\").\nA new album titled \"Autumn Sky\" was released at the end of 2010 in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S. This was followed by \"Dancer and the Moon\", in 2013, an album featuring covers of songs by Randy Newman (\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\"), Uriah Heep (\"Lady in Black\") and another Rainbow song (\u201cTemple Of The King\u201d, originally from the album \"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\").\nTheir album, \"All Our Yesterdays\", was released on 18 September 2015. Their latest studio album, \"Nature's Light\" was released worldwide on 12 March 2021.\nIn 2022, Night was featured on the single \"We're Gonna Be Drinking\" with the German folkrock band dArtagnan from their album \"Felsenfest\" (2022). Blackmore's Night had previously made a version of the song on their 2003 album \"Ghost of a Rose\" called \"All for One\".

The Lightning compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. They play their home games at Benchmark International Arena in Downtown Tampa. The Lightning are one of two NHL franchises based in Florida, with the other being the Florida Panthers.\nThe franchise is owned by Doug Ostrover while Julien BriseBois is the general manager. Jon Cooper has served as head coach since March 2013, and is the longest-tenured active head coach in the NHL.\nThe Lightning were founded as an expansion team on December 6, 1990, and began play in the 1992\u201393 NHL season. The team has won three Stanley Cup championships in 2004, 2020, and 2021, and also played in two additional Stanley Cup Final series in 2015 and 2022. The team's sustained success in the time period from 2015 to 2022 (which also includes making the Eastern Conference finals in 2016 and 2018) has led some outlets to regard the Lightning as a modern NHL dynasty within that time span; the Lightning also went to the conference finals in 2011. Additionally, the Lightning won the Presidents' Trophy in 2019 after they tied the then all-time record for regular season wins in the 2018\u201319 season, tying the 62 wins of the 1995\u201396 Detroit Red Wings, which later broken by the 2022\u201323 Boston Bruins, and won 11 straight playoff series from 2020 to 2022.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1992\u20132000).\nBringing hockey to Tampa.\nIn the late 1980s, the NHL announced it would expand. Two rival groups from the Tampa Bay Area decided to bid for a franchise: a St. Petersburg-based group fronted by future Hartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes owners Peter Karmanos and Jim Rutherford, and a Tampa-based group fronted by Phil Esposito, his brother Tony (both members of the Hockey Hall of Fame), and Mel Lowell, who was vice-president of Madison Square Garden for 14 years. One of the Esposito group's key backers, the Pritzker family, backed out a few months before the bid, to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. Although it appeared on paper that the Karmanos/Rutherford group had more financial resources, it only wanted to pay $29 million of the $50 million expansion fee before starting operations. In contrast, the Esposito/Kokusai Green group was one of the few groups willing to pay the full $50 million fee up front. The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise on December 6, 1990, and name the team the Lightning, after Tampa Bay's status as the \"Lightning Capital of North America\".\nPhil Esposito assigned himself president and general manager, while Tony became chief scout, and Mel Lowell executive vice-president and treasurer. Terry Crisp, who played for the Philadelphia Flyers when they won two Stanley Cups in the mid-1970s and coached the Calgary Flames to a Stanley Cup in 1989, was tapped as the first head coach. Phil Esposito also hired former teammates from the Boston Bruins of the 1970s, including former linemate Wayne Cashman as an assistant coach and former Bruin trainer John \"Frosty\" Forristal as the team's trainer. The inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player Ken Hodge, Jr., son of his other Bruins' linemate.\nIn 1991, Angus Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester announced that a company of which he was a director would raise millions of dollars in investments in the Lightning, but his plans were unsuccessful and he was later convicted of wire fraud.\nThe Lightning played their first preseason game in September 1992 against the Minnesota North Stars, and then turned heads later that preseason when Manon Rh\u00e9aume became the first woman to play in an NHL game, which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues. She played for the Lightning against the St. Louis Blues, and stopped seven of nine shots.\nThe Lightning played their first regular season game on October 7, 1992, in Tampa's tiny 11,000-seat Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds. They surprised the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, winning 7\u20133 with four goals by little-known Chris Kontos. The team rose to the top of the Campbell Conference's Norris Division within a month, behind Kontos' initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward Brian Bradley. However, it buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL\u2014their nearest division rival, the Blues, were over away\u2014and finished in last place with a record of 23\u201354\u20137 for 53 points. This was, at the time, one of the best-ever showings by an NHL expansion team. Bradley's 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season; it would be a team record until the 2006\u201307 season.\nThe following season saw the Lightning shift to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division, as well as move into the Florida Suncoast Dome (a building originally designed for baseball) in St. Petersburg, which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed the \"ThunderDome\". The team acquired goaltender Daren Puppa, left wing goal scorer Petr Klima, and veteran forward Denis Savard. While Puppa's play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed (from 332 to 251), Savard was long past his prime and Klima's scoring was offset by his defensive lapses. The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in 1993\u201394 with a record of 30\u201343\u201311 for 71 points. Another disappointing season followed in the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season with a record of 17\u201328\u20133 for 37 points.\nOn-ice and off-ice struggles.\nIn their fourth season, 1995\u201396, backed by Bradley's team-leading 79 points, second-year forward Alexander Selivanov's 31 goals, and Roman Hamrlik's All-Star year on defense, the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs, posting a 38\u201332\u201312 record for 88 points, ahead of the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win. Due to his stellar play in net, Puppa was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy (losing out to Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals). Playing the Philadelphia Flyers, a team seen as a Stanley Cup contender, in the first round, the Lightning split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking game 3 in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of 28,183. This was the largest crowd for an NHL game, a record that stood until the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton; and it still stands today as the largest crowd at a Stanley Cup playoffs game. An injury to Puppa in that game, however, would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series.\nThe Lightning moved into a new arena in downtown Tampa, the Ice Palace (later the St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa Bay Times Forum, Amalie Arena, and now Benchmark International Arena) for the 1996\u201397 season. They had acquired goal-scorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, and he did not disappoint, scoring 35 goals while Chris Gratton notched another 30 goals. The team appeared destined for another playoff appearance, but suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but six games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996\u201397 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. They would not tally as much as 60 points again for five years.\nMost of the Lightning's early stars were gone by the 1998\u201399 season due to free agency and a series of ill-advised trades. Crisp was fired 11 games into the 1997\u201398 season and replaced by Jacques Demers. Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993, he was unable to change the team's fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games. That team's .268 winning percentage is still the worst in franchise history.\nBy most accounts, the Lightning's plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green. Rumors abounded as early as the team's second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a money laundering scheme for the yakuza (Japanese crime families). Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes. The Internal Revenue Service investigated the team in 1994 and 1995, and nearly threatened to put a tax lien on the franchise for $750,000 in back taxes. The situation led longtime NHL broadcaster and writer Stan Fischler to call the Lightning a \"skating vaudeville show.\"\nEven in their first playoff season, the team was awash in red ink and Kokusai Green was looking to sell the team; however its asking price of $230\u00a0million for the team and the lease with the Ice Palace deterred buyers. A possible sale was further hampered by the team's murky ownership structure; many team officials (including Crisp) did not know who really owned the team. Kokusai Green's owner, Takashi Okubo, had never met with the Espositos or with NHL officials in person prior to being awarded the Lightning franchise, and never watched his team play during his seven years as owner.\nNearly all of Kokusai Green's investment in the team and the Ice Palace came in the form of loans, leaving the team constantly short of cash. At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed. In fact, the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL even saw Okubo was in the spring of 1998. Esposito was forced into several trades just to keep the team above water. The team's financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials; rumors surfaced that the NHL was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998.\n\"Forbes\" wrote an article in late 1997 calling the Lightning a financial nightmare, with a debt equal to 236% of its value, the highest of any major North American sports franchise. Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant, \"Forbes\" called the team's deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years. It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes.\nFinally, in 1998, Kokusai Green found a buyer. Although William Davidson, longtime owner of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), was thought to be the frontrunner, the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker Art Williams, who previously owned the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The team was $102\u00a0million in debt at the time the sale closed. Williams knew very little about hockey, but was very visible and outspoken, and immediately pumped an additional $6\u00a0million into the team's payroll. He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era. After taking control, Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe, only to fire them two games into the 1998\u201399 season. He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier first overall in 1998, a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come.\nWilliams was widely seen as being in over his head. Early in the 1998\u201399 season, the Lightning lost ten games in a row, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. They ended up losing 54 games that year, more than the expansion Nashville Predators.\nPlayoff contention and first Cup (2000\u20132010).\nBy the spring of 1999, Williams had seen enough. He had not attended a game in some time because \"this team broke my heart\". He lost $20 million in the 1998\u201399 season alone, as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years. Williams sold the team for $115 million\u2014$2 million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier\u2014to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson, who had almost bought the team a year earlier. Along with the sale, the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate; Davidson also owned the Detroit Vipers of the now-defunct International Hockey League (IHL).\nDavidson remained in Detroit, but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day-to-day management of the team. Wilson immediately fired Demers, who despite his best efforts (and fatherly attitude toward Lecavalier) was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership. Wilson persuaded Ottawa Senators general manager (and former Vipers general manager) Rick Dudley to take over as the Lightning's new general manager; Dudley, in turn, brought Vipers coach Steve Ludzik in as the team's new head coach. Wilson, Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises, having won a Turner Cup in only their third season in Detroit (the team had originally been based in Salt Lake City).\nHowever, as had been the case with Demers, the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome. Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa (a move that eventually doomed the Vipers, which folded along with the IHL in 2001), the Lightning lost 54 games in 1999\u20132000 and 52 in 2000\u201301, becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight 50-loss seasons. The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Lecavalier and Brad Richards into NHL stars. Ludzik was replaced in early 2001 by career NHL assistant John Tortorella. The March 5 trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold-out goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin from the Phoenix Coyotes for three players and a draft pick.\nThe 2001\u201302 season, Tortorella's first full year behind the bench, saw some improvement. Martin St. Louis was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost for the remainder of the season. Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the NHL All-Star Game but was not named its MVP, by all accounts due to the game's voting protocol. By mid-February, the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries. Dudley, who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season, was fired and replaced by his assistant, Jay Feaster. Still the Lightning showed some signs of life, earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997. Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season.\nTwo dream seasons and first Stanley Cup championship (2002\u20132004).\nWith a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis and Fredrik Modin, the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability. However, they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in 2002\u201303. The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier, St. Louis, Modin, Richards and Ruslan Fedotenko. Throughout the season, the Lightning battled the Washington Capitals for first place in the Southeast Division. They finished with a record of 36\u201325\u201316 for 93 points, breaking the 90-point barrier for the first time in team history. They won the division by just one point, giving them home-ice advantage in their first-round match-up with the Capitals. At season's end, coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award, losing out to Jacques Lemaire of the Minnesota Wild.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins for their first playoff series win in franchise history. However, in the semifinals, they went down in five games to the New Jersey Devils, who went on to win the Stanley Cup.\nThe Lightning's dramatic improvement continued through the 2003\u201304 regular season, finishing with a record of 46\u201322\u20138\u20136 for 106 points, second-best in the NHL after the Western Conference's Detroit Red Wings \u2013 the first 100-point season in franchise history. The Lightning lost only 20 man-games to injury. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning ousted the New York Islanders in five games, with Khabibulin posting shutouts in games 1, 3, and 4.\nIn the second round, the Lightning faced the Montreal Canadiens; Lecavalier, Richards, and Khabibulin led the team to a four-game sweep of Montreal. Next, they faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the conference finals. After a tightly fought seven-game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games, Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game, earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first-ever berth in the Stanley Cup Final.\nTheir opponent in the final round was the Calgary Flames. The final round also went the full seven games, with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7, 2004. This time, Ruslan Fedotenko was the game 7 hero, scoring both Lightning goals in a 2\u20131 victory. Brad Richards, who had 26 points in the postseason, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season. Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year. Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses, and in only their 12th year of existence, the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup, an accomplishment since surpassed by the Florida Panthers. Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points (his 38 goals were fourth-most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla, Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk), and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player. St. Louis also won the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL's most outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players' Association, and tied the Vancouver Canucks' Marek Malik for the NHL Plus/Minus Award. A season of superlatives was capped with one final accolade, as \"The Sporting News\" named general manager Jay Feaster as the league's executive of the year for 2003\u201304.\nPost-championship successes and playoff disappointments (2004\u20132007).\nThe Lightning had to wait a year to defend their title due to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, but in 2005\u201306, they barely made the playoffs with a record of 43\u201333\u20136 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points. They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs.\nDuring the off-season, the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and Fredrik Norrena to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for goaltender Marc Denis in an effort to replace the departing John Grahame, who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes. However, free agent Johan Holmqvist would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club's wins. The first half of 2006\u201307 was inconsistent for the Lightning, maintaining an 18\u201319\u20132 record throughout the first few months. January and February were far better months for the team, going 9\u20134\u20130 in January and 9\u20132\u20132 in February, driving them back into the playoff race. Fourteen games in March were split even, and on March 16, 2007, Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season, with 95 (finishing with 108). The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis, who had set the record in the 2003\u201304 Stanley Cup-winning year. Lecavalier also broke the franchise's goal-scoring record, finishing with a league-leading 52 goals.\nThe Lightning were busy during the final weeks before the NHL's trade deadline, acquiring wingers Kyle Wanvig, Stephen Baby and defenseman Shane O'Brien. Former first-round pick Nikita Alexeev was traded on deadline day to the Chicago Blackhawks. Other mid-season additions to the team included Filip Kuba, Luke Richardson and Doug Janik. Veteran Andre Roy, who had won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004, was claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThroughout March, the Lightning had been competing with the Atlanta Thrashers for first place in the Southeast Division. With a chance to overtake the Thrashers one final time and once again become division champions for the third time in team history, on April 6, 2007, in the final week of the regular season, the Lightning suffered a loss to the Florida Panthers, the night before the season finale in Atlanta. That same night, the Thrashers defeated the Carolina Hurricanes and subsequently clinched the division. For the Lightning, this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of 44\u201333\u20135 (93 points). However, the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April 22, after a 3\u20132 home loss to the New Jersey Devils in game 6 of the conference quarterfinals.\nFollowing their playoff exit, on August 7, 2007, Absolute Hockey Enterprises, a group led by Doug MacLean, announced it had signed a purchase agreement for the team and the leasehold on the St. Pete Times Forum. MacLean is the former president and general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and former head coach for both the Blue Jackets and the Florida Panthers. The group announced it planned to keep the team in Tampa, but the deal collapsed during the 2007\u201308 season.\nDecline (2007\u20132008).\nThe Lightning struggled to maintain success during the 2007\u201308 campaign. Although the \"Big 3\" of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards, along with Vaclav Prospal, had performed up to expectations, they had little consistent play from supporting players.\nAt the start of the All-Star Break on January 25, 2008, the Lightning had a 20\u201325\u20135 record, and with 45 points, were in last place in both the Southeast Division and the Eastern Conference. Only the Los Angeles Kings had a lower point total at this time of the season, with 40 points.\nOn February 13, 2008, it was announced that Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment had agreed to sell the Lightning to OK Hockey LLC, a group headed by Oren Koules, a producer of the \"Saw\" horror movies, and Len Barrie, a former NHL player and real estate developer.\nThe Lightning were active during the trade deadline, similar to the previous season. More notable trades included Vaclav Prospal's trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect Alexandre Picard and a conditional draft pick. Additionally, former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brad Richards and goaltender Johan Holmqvist were traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for goaltender Mike Smith and forwards Jussi Jokinen and Jeff Halpern, as well as a fourth-round draft pick in 2009. Jan Hlavac, a regular contributor, was also traded, moving to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a seventh-round pick in 2008. Defenseman Dan Boyle was re-signed to a six-year contract extension reportedly worth $40\u00a0million.\nHowever, after the trade deadline, the Lightning fared no better than they had throughout the entire season. After the February 26 trade deadline, the Lightning won only five games. Finishing with a 31\u201342\u20139 record, with 71 points, they had the highest chance of winning the top overall pick in the 2008 NHL entry draft through the draft lottery, which they eventually won on April 7. They would use their first overall pick to select Steven Stamkos of the Ontario Hockey League's Sarnia Sting who, like Lecavalier before, was expected to become a franchise cornerstone player for years to come.\nThe Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL, winning only 11 games. Another showing of the team's poor play was the difference from the previous season's success in the overtime/shootout periods. In the 2006\u201307 season, the Lightning had one of the best extra period records, winning 15 games in either overtime or the shootout. However, in the 2007\u201308 season, they won only three games, losing nine.\nVincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open-ice hit from Matt Cooke of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta. Lecavalier, who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season's ending, would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well. Cooke was fined $2,500 by the NHL for the hit, as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time. Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier's winning both the King Clancy Memorial Trophy and the NHL Foundation Player Award for work through his foundation, including a $3\u00a0million pledge to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at All Children's Hospital.\nHead coach John Tortorella was fired by the Lightning following their worst season since Tortorella was hired. At the time working as an NHL analyst for ESPN, Barry Melrose stated on June 4 during an episode of \"Pardon the Interruption\" that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, \"I miss not having a dog in the fight.\" On June 23, ESPN reported Melrose had been chosen to be the head coach of the Lightning, beginning in 2008\u201309. The next day, the Lightning officially introduced him as their new head coach.\nArrival of Steven Stamkos (2008\u20132010).\nSteven Stamkos was selected first overall by Tampa Bay. On July 29, 2008, he signed an entry-level contract with the Lightning in which he could earn as much as $8.55\u00a0million in performance bonuses. Leading up to the start of the 2008\u201309 season, the Lightning centered their promotional efforts around Stamkos, including a website with the slogan \"Seen Stamkos?\" On July 4, 2008, Dan Boyle, despite coming off a recent contract extension, was traded (along with Brad Lukowich) to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle, Ty Wishart, a first-round draft pick in 2009 and a fourth-round pick in 2010. Boyle was pressured to waive his no-trade clause by Tampa Bay's ownership, who said they would otherwise place him on waivers, where he would likely be claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers. In the fallout from the trade, Boyle would call Lightning ownership \"liars\" for misrepresenting the aforementioned events to the public, while former coach Tortorella later labeled them as \"cowboys\" and said he had zero respect for them. Frustrated at interference in the team's hockey operations by Barrie and Koules, seven days later, Jay Feaster resigned as general manager, despite having three years remaining on his contract.\nThe Lightning opened the 2008\u201309 season in the Czech Republic against the New York Rangers as a part of the NHL's regular season \"Premiere\" that selects several teams to open the regular season in Europe. Barry Melrose would record his first win as a head coach in over 13 years on October 21, 2008, with a 3\u20132 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5\u20137\u20134 record. Rick Tocchet, who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous off-season, was promoted to interim head coach. On March 4, veterans Mark Recchi and Olaf Kolzig were traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. The Lightning acquired top round picks Matt Lashoff and Martins Karsums from the Bruins. After the firing of Melrose, the Lightning went 19\u201333\u201314 and would finish the season 24\u201340\u201318 with 66 points, their lowest point total since the 2000\u201301 season.\nWith the second overall pick in the 2009 NHL entry draft, the Lightning selected Swedish defenseman Victor Hedman, who would also be another major part of the franchise for years to come. In the 2009 off-season, the Lightning removed the interim status of Rick Tocchet, making him the full-time head coach and signing him to a multi-year contract. The Lightning had an up-and-down beginning to the 2009\u201310 campaign. Despite an overmatched roster on paper, and a team that struggled in the first two periods of many games, the Lightning remained competitive in the playoff race until March, when they went 5\u201310\u20131 for the month and fell eight points out of a playoff spot. Unable to make a final push for the playoffs, they were officially eliminated from contention within the first week of April. The Lightning finished the season 34\u201336\u201312 for 80 points, fourth in the Southeast Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference.\nStamkos scored 51 goals in just his second NHL season along with 44 assists and 95 points. His 51 goals earned himself a share of the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy by finishing tied for the NHL lead in goals with Pittsburgh Penguins star and captain Sidney Crosby. During the season, the team was sold to Bostonian investment banker Jeffrey Vinik. Following the late-season collapse, Vinik cleaned house, firing both head coach Rick Tocchet and general manager Brian Lawton on April 12, 2010, one day after the season ended.\nSteve Yzerman era (2010\u20132018).\n2011 run to the Eastern Conference finals (2010\u20132011).\nIn May 2010, Vinik hired Steve Yzerman away from the Detroit Red Wings front office to be the new general manager on a five-year contract. Yzerman then hired Guy Boucher from the Montreal Canadiens organization to succeed Rick Tocchet as the head coach two weeks later.\nYzerman's first off-season with Tampa Bay began with a splash. With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL entry draft, the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Prince George Cougars. On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second-round pick in 2011. Later that day, the Lightning signed star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5\u00a0million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay's fourth-round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger Simon Gagne. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim, Dominic Moore and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, along with defensemen Brett Clark, Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis, as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two-year, $3.7\u00a0million deal.\nWith starting goaltender Mike Smith injured, the Lightning called up Cedrick Desjardins, who played with a .950 save percentage and a 1.00 goals against average (GAA) in two games. The team then acquired veteran Dwayne Roloson from the New York Islanders for further coverage in net.\nThe Lightning compiled a 46\u201325\u201311 record with 103 points in the 2010\u201311 season, matching a franchise record for wins in a season. After holding the first place in the Southeast Division for several months, they fell to second after a poor performance in March. However, their record was solid enough for second in the Southeast Division and fifth in the Eastern Conference, and they returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2007. Scoring 31 goals and assisting on 68 for 99 points, Martin St. Louis finished second in the NHL in points only behind the 104 points by Daniel Sedin of the Vancouver Canucks. Steven Stamkos recorded 45 goals as the runner-up to the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy only behind the 50 goals scored by Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks and was a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award as the most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players' Association, which ultimately went to Vancouver's Daniel Sedin.\nIn the 2011 playoffs, Tampa Bay played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference quarterfinals who finished the season as the fourth seed in the Eastern Confernence. After losing game 4 at home in the second overtime period, they fell behind in the series one game to three. However, the Lightning went on to win the next three games, including a 1\u20130 game 7 win on the road, taking their first playoff series since winning the Stanley Cup against the Calgary Flames in 2004. In the conference semifinals, the Lightning swept the top-seeded Washington Capitals. Tampa Bay played the Boston Bruins in the conference finals. In game 4 of the series, the Lightning trailed 3\u20130 at the end of the first period. When Dwayne Roloson was pulled for Mike Smith, the Bruins failed to score again, and the Lightning tied the game in the second period by scoring three goals in 3:58, going on to win the game 5\u20133 and tying the series at two games apiece. The series went the full seven games, though the Lightning were eliminated by a single goal, as they lost game 7 (0\u20131) to lose the series to the eventual Stanley Cup champion and third-seeded Bruins in seven games, one win short from reaching the 2011 Stanley Cup Final.\nTransition seasons (2011\u20132013).\nThe Lightning finished the 2011\u201312 season with a 38\u201336\u20138 record. With only 84 points, they fell short of reaching the playoffs by eight points in the standings and ending the season third in the Southeast Division and tenth in the Eastern Conference. Individually, Steven Stamkos scored a franchise-record 60 goals. He won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy for the second time in his career. Stamkos was also second in the NHL in points with 97, and was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy for the first time and the Ted Lindsay Award for the second consecutive season which both awards eventually going to Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nAs with the 1994\u201395 NHL lockout, the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout resulted in a 48-game season. Nearing the end of an 18\u201326\u20134 season for 40 points, in which the Lightning ended fourth in the division and 14th in the conference, general manager Steve Yzerman looked to their highly-successful American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. On March 25, 2013, head coach Guy Boucher was dismissed for following a 7\u201316\u20131 record. The Lightning announced Jon Cooper would become the eighth head coach in franchise history. Martin St. Louis won his second Art Ross Trophy with 60 points in the shortened season, as Stamkos finished runner-up 57.\nOn June 27, 2013, the team announced that they would exercise one of their two \"compliance buyouts\" on captain Vincent Lecavalier, as permitted by the collective agreement. This move made Lecavalier an unrestricted free agent beginning July 5 of that year. The team stated the move was made not because of Lecavalier's play on the ice, but because of how his contract affected the team's salary cap, which would have been more than $7\u00a0million per year until its expiration after the 2019\u201320 season.\nReturn to playoff contention (2013\u20132014).\nAfter acquiring goaltender Ben Bishop from the Ottawa Senators in a trade the previous season, the Lightning started the 2013\u201314 season with an above-average performance. On November 11, 2013, going into the day tied for most goals during the regular season, Steven Stamkos suffered a broken right tibia after crashing into one of the goalposts during play against the Boston Bruins. He would miss 45 games and was not cleared to play again until March 5, 2014.\nIn January 2014, general manager Steve Yzerman, who also served as the general manager for Canada's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, elected not to name Lightning captain Martin St. Louis to Canada's roster, instead choosing the still-injured Stamkos. After Stamkos was not medically cleared to play in Sochi in early February, Yzerman ultimately named St. Louis to Team Canada as an injury replacement. In late February, it was reported St. Louis had requested a trade from Yzerman the month prior. St. Louis, who had a no-move clause in his contract with Tampa Bay, reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers. On March 5, 2014, St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second-round pick in exchange for New York captain Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first-round draft pick, a conditional 2014 second-round pick and a 2015 conditional seventh-round pick. The deal came subsequently after Stamkos had been cleared to return to the Lightning's active roster. St. Louis cited his decision based on his family and thanked Lightning fans for their support during his tenure with the franchise, but would not specify any further about the reasons leading to his request. On March 6, Steven Stamkos was named Tampa Bay's 10th captain in his first game back after recovering from a tibia injury. On April 7, the team announced it had signed general manager Steve Yzerman to a four-year contract extension.\nFinishing the season with 101 points, the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2011. However, Tampa Bay was eliminated in the first round, losing to the Montreal Canadiens in a four-game sweep.\nContention for the Stanley Cup and one playoff absence (2014\u20132018).\nOn June 25, 2014, the Lightning agreed to terms with Ryan Callahan, signing him to a six-year, $34.8 million contract extension. The same day, the Lightning used its remaining compliance buyout on forward Ryan Malone after his on-ice performance had declined from injuries seasons prior in addition to his off-ice troubles that included a DUI arrest before the end of the season.\nFinishing the 2014\u201315 season with 108 points, the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division and qualified for the playoffs for the second-straight season, scoring the most goals out of any team in the NHL. Tampa Bay eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the playoffs before facing the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. The Lightning won the first three games of the series and had a chance to sweep the Canadiens; however, Montreal responded with wins in games 4 and 5 to extend the series to a sixth game. Tampa Bay won the sixth game of the series to eliminate the Canadiens and advance to the conference finals for the first time since 2011, facing the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers. In the conference finals, the Lightning and the Rangers split the first two games of the series in New York, with the Lightning winning game 2 of the series thanks to a Tyler Johnson hat-trick. The series then shifted to Tampa, where the Lightning had a come-from-behind overtime victory in game 3, but lost game 4 to even the series at two games apiece. During game 5 in New York, goaltender Ben Bishop recorded his second shutout of the playoffs in a 2\u20130 victory, but the Rangers responded in game 6 by scoring seven goals to tie the series at three games apiece. In game 7, Bishop recorded his third shutout of the playoffs in another 2\u20130 victory against the Rangers to lead the Lightning to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Final since 2004. The Lightning not only became the first team to defeat the Rangers in a game 7 at Madison Square Garden, but they also became the first team to successfully defeat three Original Six teams in the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Lightning would face the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Final, making it the first time a finalist faced four Original Six teams in the playoffs since the four-round format was introduced in 1980. After losing game 1 at home, the Lightning built a two games to one series lead, though the Blackhawks would win the following three games to win the Stanley Cup in six games at the United Center in Chicago. This made Tampa Bay the first team to beat three of the Original Six teams in the playoffs since the Pittsburgh Penguins completed the feat in 1992. However, they became the first team to lose the Stanley Cup Final despite beating three Original Six teams in the previous three rounds.\nThe Lightning had a slow start to the 2015\u201316 season. The season was filled with controversy for the team, starting off with the contractual questions regarding captain Steven Stamkos and with the former third overall pick Jonathan Drouin publicly requesting a trade and being suspended from the organization. The Lightning picked up their play at the beginning of 2016 and set the franchise record to nine consecutive wins on March 5, 2016, when Alex Killorn scored with 42.5 seconds remaining in overtime to propel the Lightning to a 4\u20133 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes at the then Amalie Arena. On March 26, 2016, the Lightning announced cornerstone defenseman Anton Stralman had suffered a fractured leg in their game against the New York Islanders at home. Stamkos was out of the lineup for the team's game on April 2 against the New Jersey Devils in Tampa; general manager Steve Yzerman announced after the game that the captain would miss one-to-three months due to a blood clot in his arm. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the team had no other option but to bring Drouin back to the team. The Lightning ended up finishing second in the Atlantic Division and would once again face the third-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs. The Lightning played the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the 2016 playoffs for the second consecutive year and defeated them in five games after winning game five 1\u20130 at the then Amalie Arena. Next up, the New York Islanders (who had recently defeated the Panthers to win their first playoff series since the 1992\u201393 season) would face the Lightning. In game 1, the Islanders defeated the Bolts 5\u20133. The Lightning would eventually answer back by winning four consecutive games in the series to defeat the Isles in five games to move on to the conference finals for the second consecutive year, in large part due to back-to-back road overtime victories with goals scored by Brian Boyle and Jason Garrison. The Lightning were set to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference finals. In game 1 at Consol Energy Center, star goaltender Ben Bishop would be added to the list of devastating injuries for the team as he left on a stretcher and did not return for the remainder of the series. Stralman would eventually return in game 2. A back-and-forth series would eventually lead to a game 7 showdown in Pittsburgh. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos surprisingly took warmups and was in the Lightning lineup after a long absence from blood clot surgery. However, it was not enough as the Lightning would fall in the game 2\u20131 against the Penguins for a 4\u20133 series defeat, who went on to defeat the San Jose Sharks and win the Stanley Cup while the Lightning came one win short from a second consecutive appearance in the Stanley Cup Final.\nWith the Lightning under the spotlight in the 2016 off-season, Drouin rescinded his trade request. Steve Yzerman would then announce on June 29 the team re-signed Stamkos to an eight-year, cap-friendly deal. He would then sign star defenseman Victor Hedman to an eight-year contract on July 1, along with a seven-year deal for Alex Killorn and three-year deals to star winger Nikita Kucherov and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy.\nThe Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs in the 2016\u201317 season. Finishing with 94 points, they were beaten to the second wildcard by the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 95 points. The 2016\u201317 season for the Lightning was a host of injuries, mainly their captain, Steven Stamkos. Stamkos went down in the 17th game, against the Detroit Red Wings on November 15, 2016. It was revealed he suffered from a torn left meniscus, which put him out for the rest of the season. Ryan Callahan would also play in only 18 games due to multiple surgeries to his back and hip. Towards the end of the season, they traded goaltender Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings, center Brian Boyle to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and forward Valtteri Filppula to the Philadelphia Flyers. However, there were positive signs as winger Nikita Kucherov emerged with 40 goals for the first time in his career and the Lightning also showcased their young talent with rookie Brayden Point and promising AHL call-ups Yanni Gourde and Jake Dotchin. The Lightning bounced back with this talent in the last third of the season, but it was not enough as they missed the 2017 playoffs by one point.\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Lightning made a deal with the Montreal Canadiens to send Jonathan Drouin to their franchise in exchange for defensive prospect Mikhail Sergachev and a second-round pick in the 2018 NHL entry draft. They also signed defenseman Daniel Girardi for two years and winger Chris Kunitz to a one-year deal.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, Steven Stamkos returned from injury, scoring 20 points in the first 10 games and assisting on nine of Nikita Kucherov's 11 goals. The Lightning finished the 2017\u201318 season with a record of 54\u201323\u20135, finishing with 113 points. The Lightning won their first Atlantic Division title and first division title since the 2003\u201304 season, as well as securing the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. Andrei Vasilevskiy was nominated for the Vezina Trophy for the first time. Nikita Kucherov scored 100 points during the regular season, finishing third overall in the league. Steve Yzerman was once again nominated for the NHL General Manager of the Year Award. During the 2018 playoffs, the Lightning eliminated the New Jersey Devils in the first round and the Boston Bruins in the second round, both in five games. However, they were defeated in the conference finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, in seven games, one win short from clinching a spot in the Stanley Cup Final once more.\nJulien BriseBois era (2018\u2013present).\nFirst Presidents' Trophy winner swept in the first round (2018\u20132019).\nOn September 11, 2018, it was announced that Steve Yzerman would be resigning from his position as general manager, and longtime assistant general manager Julien BriseBois would be taking his place as the new general manager. During the 2018\u201319 season, the Lightning clinched their first Presidents' Trophy and second consecutive division title after a 4\u20131 win over the Arizona Coyotes on March 18, 2019. Winning their final regular season game against the Boston Bruins on April 6, the Lightning finished with 62 wins, tying the NHL record set by the 1995\u201396 Detroit Red Wings for most wins in a season. Nikita Kucherov became the second player in Lightning franchise history (after Martin St. Louis) to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player and the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading point scorer, setting a new franchise record of 128 points. Andrei Vasilevskiy became the first player in franchise history to win the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender. However, in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, they were swept in four games by the eighth seeded Columbus Blue Jackets in that team's first-ever playoff series victory, becoming the first Presidents' Trophy winner to be swept in the first round of the playoffs. The series is widely regarded as one of the biggest upsets in league history. Former NHL player and NBC Sports analyst Jeremy Roenick described Tampa's elimination as \"one of the biggest letdowns in history\", while the \"Tampa Bay Times\" described it as \"the disappointment that all others are measured against\".\nBack-to-back Stanley Cups and three straight Final appearances (2019\u20132022).\nFollowing their earlier than expected exit from the 2019 playoffs, several players left the Lightning. Left winger J. T. Miller was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Backup goaltender Louis Domingue was dealt to the New Jersey Devils for a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2021. Defenseman Anton Stralman left the team in free agency after five seasons and signed a three-year contract with the inner-state rival Florida Panthers. Right winger Ryan Callahan's career was effectively ended when he was diagnosed with a degenerative back disease. Defenseman Daniel Girardi went unsigned over the summer and eventually announced his retirement from playing hockey effective immediately after his two-year contract he signed in 2017 expired. To make up for these losses, the Lightning signed defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to a one-year contract, after his contract with the New York Rangers was bought out. Left winger Patrick Maroon, who was coming off a Stanley Cup championship with his hometown team, the St. Louis Blues, was also signed to a one-year deal. The Lightning re-signed centers Brayden Point and Cedric Paquette to two and three-year contracts, respectively. Starting goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy's contract was also extended by eight years.\nThe Lightning began the season with a 17\u201313\u20134 record after 34 games. After this point, they won 23 of their next 26 games, including two separate win streaks of at least ten games, the second of which eventually set a new franchise record of eleven consecutive wins. They lost captain Steven Stamkos to injury once again, as he underwent surgery to repair a core muscle in late February. He was expected to miss 6\u20138 weeks as a result, which at the time was expected to keep him out for the remainder of the regular season and the start of the playoffs.\nBefore the 2020 trade deadline the Lightning made two significant trades that would go on to be instrumental to their future success. On February 16, 2020, the Lightning acquired forward Blake Coleman from the New Jersey Devils for prospect Nolan Foote and a 2020 first-round pick. Then on the last day before the deadline, the Lightning acquired forward Barclay Goodrow and a 2020 third-round pick from the San Jose Sharks for Tampa's 2020 first-round pick and Anthony Greco.\nTampa Bay had only played 70 games when the NHL suspended the season on March 12, 2020, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not until late May that the league decided to cancel the remaining three weeks of the regular season. At the time, the Lightning had a record of 43\u201321\u20136 and were second in their conference. To finish the season, the league expanded the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs to include 24 teams rather than 16. In July, it was announced that the playoffs would begin August 1, and would take place in the Canadian cities of Toronto as the Eastern Conference hub, and Edmonton for the Western Conference. By virtue of having one of the top four highest point percentages at the time the season was suspended, the Lightning not only qualified for the playoffs, but would first compete in a single round-robin opening round group with the Boston Bruins, Washington Capitals, and Philadelphia Flyers to determine seeding. Winning two out of three games, the Lightning earned the second seed in the East.\nFollowing the round-robin, the Lightning drew the Columbus Blue Jackets again in the first round. The first game of the series ultimately became the fourth-longest NHL game in history, as the game-winning goal was scored by Brayden Point at the 10:27 mark of the fifth overtime period. Point also scored in overtime for a second time in game five, eliminating Columbus and avenging their playoff defeat from the previous year. In the second round, the Lightning faced the Presidents' Trophy-winning Boston Bruins. After losing the first game of this series, the Lightning rallied to win the next four, with Victor Hedman's double-overtime goal in game 5 sealing the series victory for Tampa Bay. After advancing, the remainder of the Lightning's playoff run took place in Edmonton, which had been planned as the site of both of the conference finals and the Stanley Cup Final series. In the conference finals, the Lightning took on the New York Islanders. The Islanders extended the Lightning to six games, but Tampa Bay would once again prevail in overtime to win the series, with the game-winning goal this time being scored by Anthony Cirelli. The win earned the Lightning the Prince of Wales Trophy for the third time in their history, and their first trip to the Stanley Cup Final since 2015. In the 2020 Stanley Cup Final, the Lightning met the Dallas Stars. The teams split the first two games of the series. In game three, Steven Stamkos returned to the lineup, having missed the entire playoff run to that point after suffering an injury prior to the start of the playoffs, unrelated to an injury he sustained during the regular season. He scored a goal on what was his only shot on goal of the series, as he did not take to the ice again following the end of the first period. Tampa Bay did, however, win both game three and four to take a 3\u20131 series lead. Dallas stayed alive in the series by winning game five 3\u20132 in double-overtime to force a game six, but the Lightning closed them out with a 2\u20130 win in game six to win their second Stanley Cup championship, and first since 2004. Victor Hedman was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the MVP of the playoffs, having recorded 22 points on 10 goals and 12 assists. Nikita Kucherov set a new franchise record for points in a single playoff season with 34, and also became the franchise leader for playoff goals, assists, and points. The team set a league record with over 221 minutes played in overtime periods alone. They also became the first team in league history to have three series-winning goals in overtime. Andrei Vasilevskiy surpassed both former Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop and Nikolai Khabibulin to become the franchise leader in playoff games played and playoff games won. The victory led to a new tradition for Tampa Bay sports teams: boat parades. The 2020 Lightning held a parade of boats on the Hillsborough River rather than a traditional victory parade through the streets of the city, mainly to comply with COVID-19 regulations, but subsequent championship teams in Tampa have held similar parades even with those restrictions lifted.\nDue to COVID-19, the league moved the Lightning to the Central Division, where they would compete with the Blackhawks, Blue Jackets, Hurricanes, Panthers, Predators, Red Wings, and Stars for the 2020\u201321 season. The Lightning would only play against teams in the Central Division, with limited attendance to start the season. The team once again played in a shortened season, playing 56 games in total. Nikita Kucherov would miss the entire regular season with a hip surgery he had in December 2020. During the season, the Lightning acquired defenseman David Savard through a multi-team trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings. The Lightning would also acquire defenseman Fredrik Claesson in another trade with the San Jose Sharks. The Lightning finished the season with a 36\u201317\u20133 record, and would finish third in the Central Division.\nEntering the 2021 playoffs, the Lightning would face against the Florida Panthers in the first round, making this the first time the state rivals would meet each other in the playoffs. The Lightning would win the series 4\u20132, with the last game continuing a playoff series clinching shutout streak that had carried over from the 2020 Stanley Cup Final against Dallas. In the second round, the Lightning would face the Carolina Hurricanes. In the third game of the series, Brayden Point would score the first goal in a playoff goal-scoring streak that would last for 9 games, coming in second to Reggie Leach with 10 games in a single playoff year. The Hurricanes would win game 3 in overtime, however the Lightning would win the next two games to win the series 4\u20131. For the second consecutive year, the Lightning would again face the New York Islanders before heading to the 2021 Stanley Cup Final. Due to the lack of conferences for this season, this series would not be called the conference finals, but instead it would be known as the Stanley Cup semifinals. The Islanders would once again take the Lightning to an extended series, having won game 6 in overtime to force the series to seven games. However, the Lightning would clinch the series in game 7 with a single shorthanded goal scored by Yanni Gourde. The win would earn the Lightning their second consecutive Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final. In the Stanley Cup Final, the Lightning went up against the Montreal Canadiens. In the first three games, the Lightning would prevail, a notable highlight being the diving goal Blake Coleman would score with 1.1 seconds left in the second period in the second game in the series. The Canadiens however would force a game 5 and prevent a sweep, winning game 4 in overtime. The Lightning however would win the Stanley Cup in game 5, with a single goal scored by Ross Colton in the second period. The game would also see the Lightning win in their own arena, the second time in team history, and the first time since the Chicago Blackhawks won the Cup in 2015, which coincidentally was against the Lightning. Starting goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP with five shutouts during the playoffs, four of which were series-clinching shutouts. Patrick Maroon would win his third consecutive Stanley Cup, one with his hometown team, the St. Louis Blues in 2019 and two with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021. Maroon later slipped and dropped the Stanley Cup and severely dented the trophy's bowl during a celebration at Julian B. Lane Park following the team's victory parade on July 12. Maroon cited the strong thunderstorm during the outdoor celebration as the reason, and the Cup was quickly repaired with no further issues whatsoever.\nOn February 26, 2022, the Lightning played their first outdoor game in franchise history against the host Nashville Predators in the 2022 NHL Stadium Series at Nissan Stadium. The Lightning would win the game against the Predators with a score of 3\u20132, with Steven Stamkos receiving first star. On April 14, 2022, the Lightning clinched a playoff berth after a 4\u20133 overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks. In the 2022 playoffs, the Lightning defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games in the first round and swept their in-state rivals, the Presidents' Trophy\u2013winning Florida Panthers, in the second round. On June 11, the Lightning clinched their third straight Stanley Cup Final berth after a 2\u20131 win against the New York Rangers in game six of the conference finals. However, in the 2022 Stanley Cup Final, they came up two wins short for a third consecutive Stanley Cup title by losing the series in game 6 against the Colorado Avalanche on June 26.\nEarly playoff exits and Stamkos departure (2022\u2013present).\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Lightning finished in third place in the Atlantic Division and sixth in the Eastern Conference, and once again played the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round of the 2023 playoffs. However, this time, the Maple Leafs would avenge their loss the previous year and eliminated the Lightning 4\u20132. After a 7\u20133 game one win, Tampa lost 7\u20132 in game two. The Lightning then became the first team in Stanley Cup playoffs history to lose three overtime games at home, including a 2\u20131 loss in the deciding game six. It was the first time since 2019 that the Lightning failed to advance to the Stanley Cup Final.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Lightning finished in fourth place in the Atlantic Division and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the 2024 playoffs as the first wild card, but were eliminated by their in\u2013state rivals and eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Florida Panthers, in five games in the first round.\nIn the 2024 off-season, longtime captain Steven Stamkos signed with the Nashville Predators on the first day of free agency after Stamkos and the team were unable to come up with a contract extension agreement prior to start of free agency. They would subsequently name Victor Hedman as the next captain.\nIn the 2024\u201325 season, the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division and the third seeding in the Eastern Conference. They played the Florida Panthers in the first round of the playoffs and lost 4\u20131. During the series Brandon Hagel was concussed by Aaron Ekblad in the second period of game 4, missing the rest of game 4 and also missed game 5.\nTeam colors and mascot.\nSince 2010, the Lightning colors have been blue, black and white. Their logo has been a stylized lightning bolt. This is the origin of one nickname for the team\u2014the \"Bolts\".\nLogo and jerseys.\nThe original Lightning jerseys featured simple stripes on the sleeves and tail, and contrasting shoulders\u2014black shoulders over a white jersey, and white shoulders over the black\u2014with the alternate logo (a lightning bolt over the outline of the state of Florida). The underarm gussets included a feature referred to as \"victory stripes\"\u2014a group of thin stripes, alternating in the team's colors (black-silver-blue on white, or white-blue-silver on black). For the 1996\u201397 season, the Lightning added a third jersey, primarily blue with a sublimated wave and rain design on the front and back, lightning bolts down the sleeves, a silver-gray shoulder yoke, and black gussets. The third jersey was retired after the 1998\u201399 season.\nIn their first two seasons, the Lightning used a stylized block font for player names, with gaps in the upper loops of letters such as A, B, D, and R. The numbers were standard block numbers with drop shadows. The fonts were vertical in 1992\u201393, and italicized in 1993\u201394. The following season, the name font changed to a block font, vertically arched, while the number font changed to a painted style resembling the letters \"Tampa Bay\" in the logo. This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998\u201399, replacing an \"electrified\" number font used from 1996 to 1998. In 2001\u201302, the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers, which have been used ever since. They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed (Indy) blue.\nAs with all NHL teams for the 2007\u201308 season, the Lightning debuted in new Reebok \"Rbk Edge\" jerseys. Also, like several other NHL teams, the Lightning updated their team logo.\nThe Lightning unveiled their new logo on August 25, 2007. The logo was similar to the inaugural one, but with a more modern look. The new logo also kept the same theme as the previous one, but with the words \"Tampa Bay\" across the top now appearing with tall capital initials, and the word \"Lightning\" no longer appearing on the bottom of the logo.\nThe Edge jerseys use the same template adopted by the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins. Unlike those teams, the Lightning's elbow panels remain the base color of the jersey, and an additional blue panel is added near the cuff of the sleeve. The Edge uniforms retain the underarm gusset \"victory stripes\" of their predecessors.\nThe Lightning then debuted a new \"alternate\" or \"third\" jersey in the 2008\u201309 season. The jersey features a dominant \"electric blue\" color, with black and silver accents at the end of the sleeves. The logo is removed, and in its place emblazoned across the front of the jersey descending to the lower left of the jersey is the word \"BOLTS\" (utilizing a layout similar to that of the Ottawa Senators' third jersey). The numbers are featured on the back and sleeves only, using white lettering.\nIt was reported on January 23, 2011, that the Lightning had filed paperwork with the NHL to change their logo and colors, beginning with the 2011\u201312 season. The new logo, as well as the new home and away jerseys, were unveiled by the team at a press conference at the St. Pete Times Forum on January 31, 2011. The Lightning began to integrate the new logo onto center ice, and even distributed free T-shirts with the simplified logo on February 4, 2011, while still using the old Lightning logo and uniforms.\nThe current uniforms are made in a traditional hockey sweater design. Initially, the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was later added as a trim color on the numbers. The victory stripes were also eliminated. Despite the introduction of the new uniforms, the previous third jersey was retained, with the new simplified logo replacing the old logo in the shoulders prior to the 2012\u201313 season. Nevertheless, the Lightning's new blue-based uniforms received criticism for its perceived similarity to the Toronto Maple Leafs' uniforms, with its shade of blue being too close to the Maple Leafs' palette.\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Lightning announced that a new black third sweater will replace the existing \"BOLTS\" sweaters. The new sweaters were unveiled on September 27, 2014. It retained the \"BOLTS\" wordmark, while adding white accents in a similar manner as the Los Angeles Kings' sweaters. The secondary roundel logo also replaced the primary logo on the sleeves, while the metro name was enscripted on the collar.\nThe Lightning made some minor tweaks to their current uniform set following the NHL's move to Adidas as its uniform provider in the 2017\u201318 season. The most notable change is the removal of the \"TAMPA BAY\" wordmark on the white away sweaters.\nA third sweater was not used during all of 2017\u201318 and much of the 2018\u201319 season. On February 7, 2019, the Lightning unveiled a new black uniform, lacking any blue and white elements and featuring sublimated black and grey patterns on the sleeves, socks and back numbers.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Lightning released a \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, using the design they wore from 2001 to 2007. Unlike the originals, blue served as the base color while black was relegated to trim color. Their 2022\u201323 \"Reverse Retro\" uniform used the design of the third jersey from 1996 to 1999, but with a white base.\nFor the 2022 NHL Stadium Series, the Lightning unveiled a white uniform with a stylized blue stripe shaped like a thunderbolt at the bottom. An updated rendition of the \"BOLTS\" wordmark was stitched in front, and numbers featured pointed accents.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Lightning unveiled a new black alternate uniform, putting the roundel logo as the main crest and bringing back the \"victory stripes\" on the sleeves. The white numbers with black trim and blue drop shadows were heavily inspired by the team's first uniforms.\nIn-game personalities.\nGreg Wolf has been the Lightning's in-game host since the 2006\u201307 season.\nRetired United States Air Force Technical Sergeant Sonya Bryson-Kirksey sings the Canadian and American national anthems at most home games. She started singing the US national anthem for the team in 2013, and the Canadian anthem in 2020 and is accompanied by organist, Krystof Srebrakowski.\nThunderBug.\nThe Lightning mascot is a lightning bug named ThunderBug, who performs at games and makes appearances in the community.\nLightning Girls.\nUntil the 2019\u201320 season, an official dance team known as the Lightning Girls performed at all home games and community events. The Tampa Bay Lightning Girls were a group of dancers who performed in the stands.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Lightning.

Dave Mishkin serves as play-by-play announcer, joined by Phil Esposito as color commentator for home games. Greg Lenelli is the pregame and intermission host. From 1995 to 2020, the television play-by-play announcer was Rick Peckham. He announced that he would be retiring following the 2019\u201320 season. His final game for the Lightning was game five of their first round series during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, in which the Lightning won in overtime to win the series. Dave Randorf was named as his replacement prior to the 2020\u201321 season. The color commentator is Brian Engblom. The studio host is Paul Kennedy. Caley Chelios, daughter of Hall of Fame defenseman Chris Chelios, was the in-arena host and Lightning reporter for 5 seasons. Former Lightning player Dave Andreychuk and former color commentator Bobby \"The Chief\" Taylor assist with the television pregame and postgame broadcasts.\nOn December 10, 2014, long-time color commentator Bobby \"The Chief\" Taylor announced he would be retiring from the broadcast booth at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. Taylor had served as the team's color commentator since the 1993\u201394 season, which was the team's second year of existence. Taylor cited that he desired to be home with his wife Jan more. Taylor said, \"The road was starting to get a little stale,\" and \"I've been traveling since I was 15, and that's a long time.\" However, Taylor announced that he was not completely stepping away from the team broadcasts. He has continued to serve as a studio analyst.\nOn August 11, 2015, Fox Sports Sun, the regional television home of the Lightning, announced Brian Engblom as Taylor's replacement on color commentary for the 2015\u201316 season.\nThe team was previously broadcast by FanDuel Sports Network Sun. On May 14, 2025, after Main Street Sports Group invoked an exit clause in its contract, it was announced that Scripps Sports had acquired the regional rights to the Lightning, with games to be carried over the air on WXPX. A subscription streaming platform will also be available.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "73125", "revid": "50165420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73125", "title": "Washington Capitals", "text": "National Hockey League team in Washington, D.C.\nThe Washington Capitals (colloquially known as the Caps) are a professional ice hockey team based in Washington, D.C. The Capitals compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team is owned by Ted Leonsis, through Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, and initially played its home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, before moving to Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., in 1997.\nThe franchise was founded in 1974 as an expansion team, alongside the Kansas City Scouts, and struggled throughout its first eight years of existence. Beginning in 1982, with a core of players such as Mike Gartner, Rod Langway, Larry Murphy, and Scott Stevens, they became a regular playoff contender for the next 14 seasons. After purchasing the team in 1999, Leonsis revitalized the franchise by drafting star players such as Alexander Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, John Carlson, Braden Holtby, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Tom Wilson. In the 2009\u201310 season, the Capitals won the franchise's first Presidents' Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. They won it a second time in 2015\u201316, and for a third time the following season in 2016\u201317. In addition to 14 division titles and three Presidents' Trophies, the Capitals have reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1998 and 2018, winning the latter in five games against the Vegas Golden Knights.\nThe Capitals have retired the use of four numbers in honor of four players. In addition, the team holds an association with a number of individuals inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Capitals are affiliated with two minor league teams: the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League and the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1974\u20131982).\nThe NHL awarded an expansion franchise to the city of Washington on June 8, 1972, and the Capitals joined the NHL as an expansion team for the 1974\u201375 season along with the Kansas City Scouts. The Capitals were owned by Abe Pollin (also owner of the National Basketball Association's Washington Bullets/Wizards). Pollin had built the Capital Centre in suburban Landover, Maryland, to house both the Bullets (who formerly played in Baltimore) and the Capitals. His first act as owner was to hire Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt as general manager. The team name was decided via a contest in which 12,000 entries were given to Pollin. Other names included the Comets, Cyclones, Streaks, and Domes. Jim Anderson was hired as head coach prior to the inaugural season.\nWith a combined 30 teams between the NHL and the World Hockey Association (WHA), the available talent was stretched thin. The Capitals had few players with professional experience and were at a disadvantage against the long-standing teams that were stocked with veteran players.\nThe Capitals' inaugural season in 1974\u201375 set records for the NHL. They finished with the worst record in the league at 8\u201367\u20135; their 21 points were half that of their expansion brethren, the Scouts. The eight wins are the fewest for an NHL team playing at least 70 games, and the .131 winning percentage is still the worst in NHL history. They also set records for most road losses (39 out of 40), most consecutive road losses (37), and most consecutive losses (17). Head coach Jim Anderson said, \"I'd rather find out my wife was cheating on me than keep losing like this. At least I could tell my wife to cut it out.\" Anderson was fired 54 games into the season and replaced by head scout Red Sullivan. Sullivan, after a 14-game losing streak, resigned citing stomach issues. Schmidt had to take over the coaching reins for the remainder of the season.\nIn 1975\u201376, Washington went 25 straight games without a win and allowed 394 goals en route to another horrendous record: 11\u201359\u201310 (32 points). In the middle of the season, Schmidt resigned and was replaced as general manager by Max McNab and as head coach by Tom McVie. After the season, along with the Scouts, both teams would travel to Tokyo and Sapporo, Japan for four exhibition games for the NHL's first games in an Asian country. For the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Capitals alternated between dreadful seasons and finishing only a few points out of the Stanley Cup playoffs; in 1980, for instance, they were in playoff contention until the last day of the season. In 1978, the Capitals made a trade to acquire Dennis Maruk who would score 50 goals during the 1980\u201381 season and 60 goals in the 1981\u201382 season. Thanks to the subpar seasons, the Capitals were able to draft players Mike Gartner and Bobby Carpenter. However, McNab and coach Gary Green were fired in November 1981. Roger Crozier took over as GM for the remainder of the season, but he too was fired in August 1982. One of Crozier's decisions included the hiring of Bryan Murray.\nBy the summer of 1982, there was serious talk of the team moving out of the U.S. capital due to an amusement tax that affected their rink. The fans started the \"Save the Caps\" campaign and on November 4, 1982, the tax measure was defeated.\nPostseason inconsistencies (1982\u20131996).\nIn August 1982, the team hired David Poile as general manager. As his first move, Poile pulled off one of the largest trades in franchise history on September 9, 1982, when he dealt captain Ryan Walter and Rick Green to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Rod Langway (named captain only a few weeks later), Brian Engblom, Doug Jarvis and Craig Laughlin. Another significant move was the drafting of defenseman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL entry draft (the pick was made by Crozier, prior to Poile's hiring). The result of both acquisitions helped the team get a third-place finish in the Patrick Division, which resulted in their first playoff appearance. Although they were eliminated by the three-time defending (and eventual) Stanley Cup champion Islanders three games to one, the Caps' dramatic turnaround ended any talk of the club leaving Washington.\nIn the 1983\u201384 offseason, the Capitals traded a first round draft pick for Dave Christian. They also traded Dennis Maruk to the Minnesota North Stars for a second round draft pick. The regular season had the Capitals gain over 100 points for the first time in their history. The Capitals also made a trade with the Los Angeles Kings sending Engblom and Ken Houston for Larry Murphy. They also made it to the second round of the playoffs, after defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in a three-game sweep. However, they were defeated by the Islanders in the second round. The Capitals matched their point total the following season, but had a two-game series lead in the first round disappear against the Islanders as Washington lost the next three games to lose the series. In 1985\u201386, the team had their best record yet, winning 50 games and earning 107 points. After defeating the Islanders in a three-game sweep, the Capitals were defeated by the New York Rangers in six games.\nThe 1986\u201387 season saw the team trade Bobby Carpenter and a second round draft pick for Bob Crawford, Kelly Miller, and Mike Ridley. However, the season ended with a loss to the Islanders in the division semifinals. The Capitals had a 3\u20131 series lead, but the Islanders came back to force game seven which would be known as the Easter Epic. In the fourth overtime, at 1:56 am on Easter Sunday 1987, Pat LaFontaine scored, giving the Islanders a 2\u20131 victory, ending the Capitals season.\nAt the 1987 NHL entry draft, the Capitals traded Gaetan Duchesne, Alan Haworth, and first round pick (who would become Joe Sakic) for Dale Hunter and Clint Malarchuk. The Capitals were unable to move past the second round for another season in 1988, losing the division finals against the New Jersey Devils. For the 1989 playoffs push, Gartner and Murphy were traded to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Dino Ciccarelli and defenseman Bob Rouse. However, they were eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia Flyers.\nIn the 1989\u201390 season, Bryan Murray was fired and replaced by his brother, the assistant coach, Terry Murray. As they approached the deadline, the Capitals acquired goaltender Mike Liut who assisted in their playoff push. The Capitals finally made the conference finals in 1990, but went down in a four-game sweep at the hands of the first-place Boston Bruins. The next two seasons were undone by the Pittsburgh Penguins who defeated Washington both seasons in the playoffs. It included a series where the Capitals had a 3\u20131 series lead in 1992 only to lose the next three games and the series. Their final season with Langway did not end well for himself nor the Capitals. He was limited to 21 games in the 1992\u201393 season due to a torn cartilage injury. In the playoffs, they lost in six games to the Islanders in the division semifinals. In game six of the series, Dale Hunter hit Pierre Turgeon after Turgeon scored the 6\u20131 goal for the Islanders. Hunter was given a 21-game suspension as a result.\nAt the 1993 draft, Craig Berube was acquired from the Calgary Flames in return for a fifth round draft pick. In 1993\u201394, the Capitals struggled throughout the first half of the season which culminated in Terry Murray's dismissal as head coach and Jim Schoenfeld announced as his replacement. Approaching the trade deadline, the Capitals acquired Joe Juneau. Although the Capitals defeated the Penguins in the conference quarterfinals, they were defeated in five games by the Rangers in the conference semifinals. At the 1994 NHL entry draft, Mike Ridley was traded along with a first round pick for Rob Pearson and the tenth overall pick, which was used to select Nolan Baumgartner. However, their rival, the Penguins, would defeat them in the first round of both the 1995 and 1996 playoffs. Both series had the Capitals leading the series, including a 3\u20131 series lead in 1995\u2014the 1996 series ended with a game six fourth overtime goal by Pittsburgh forward Petr Nedved. In the 1996\u201397 season, David Poile completed a blockbuster trade with the Bruins to acquire forwards Adam Oates and Rick Tocchet along with goaltender Bill Ranford for Jason Allison, Jim Carey, Anson Carter, and two draft picks. However, the team was unable to make the 1997 playoffs, and as a result, Poile was fired along with Schoenfeld.\nStanley Cup Final appearance and rebuild (1997\u20132005).\nIn 1997\u201398, the Capitals hired general manager George McPhee as well as Ron Wilson as the next head coach. Midway through the season, they moved to MCI Center, now Capital One Arena, their current home arena. Peter Bondra led the team with 52 goals in the regular season. In the 1998, the Caps got past the Boston Bruins, Ottawa Senators, and Buffalo Sabres en route to the team's first Stanley Cup Final appearance. However, the team was outmatched by the defending champions, the Detroit Red Wings, who won in a four-game sweep. During the game two of the series, Esa Tikkanen forced Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood out of position but slid the puck past the open net, which led to the Red Wings' comeback in the game. That same season, Oates, Phil Housley, and Hunter all scored their 1,000th career point, the only time in NHL history that one team had three players reach that same milestone in a single season.\nAfter their 1998 Stanley Cup run, the Capitals finished the 1998\u201399 season with a record of 31\u201345\u20136 and failed to qualify for the playoffs. They also traded out Ranford, Berube, Juneau, and captain Dale Hunter. During the season, the team was sold to a group headed by America Online (AOL) executive Ted Leonsis.\nThe Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, yet both years lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Penguins. The 2000\u201301 season also saw the Capitals acquire Trevor Linden and Dainius Zubrus from the Montreal Canadiens. However, after the playoffs, Adam Oates demanded a trade, feeling he was no longer an important part of the team with Linden playing. Management refused to trade Oates and stripped him of his team captaincy.\nIn the summer of 2001, the Capitals landed five-time Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromir Jagr through a trade with the Penguins. Jagr was then signed to the largest contract ever in NHL history \u2014 $77 million over seven years at an average salary of $11 million per year (over $134,000 per game) with an option for an eighth year. During the 2001\u201302 season, Linden was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks. Oates finally received his trade request, going to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for a prospect and three draft picks. The Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in 2002 despite a winning record. Jagr's point total also dropped from 121 the season prior to 79. Ron Wilson was fired as head coach.\nBefore the 2002\u201303 season, the Caps made more roster changes, including the signing of Robert Lang as a free agent, a linemate of Jagr's from Pittsburgh. The Capitals also hired Grand Rapids Griffins coach Bruce Cassidy as head coach. Washington returned to the playoffs in 2003, but lost in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning after starting off with a two-game lead.\nIn the 2003\u201304 season, the Caps unloaded much of their high-priced talent. It started with Jagr moving to the New York Rangers for Anson Carter. As a stipulation of the trade, agreement Washington agreed to pay $20\u00a0million of Jagr's contract. This was quickly followed by Peter Bondra departing for the Ottawa Senators. Not long after, Robert Lang was sent to the Detroit Red Wings, as well as Sergei Gonchar to the Boston Bruins. The Capitals fired Cassidy and replaced him with Glen Hanlon; Washington ended the year 23\u201346\u201310\u20133.\nIn the 2004 NHL entry draft, the Capitals won the draft lottery, moving ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who held the NHL's worst record, and selected Alexander Ovechkin first overall. During the NHL labor dispute of 2004\u201305, which cost the NHL its entire season, Ovechkin stayed in Russia, playing for Dynamo Moscow. The Capitals' 2005 off-season consisted of making D.C.-area native Halpern the team's captain.\nOvechkin\u2013Backstrom era (2005\u2013present).\nReturning to the playoffs (2005\u20132015).\nThe Capitals finished the 2005\u201306 season with a 29\u201341\u201312 campaign. In his rookie season, Ovechkin led all 2005\u201306 rookies in goals with 52 and points with 106. Ovechkin became the first player since Teemu Selanne to score at least 50 goals in his rookie season. His efforts won him the Calder Memorial Trophy. Despite missing the playoffs, the Capitals had an 11-point improvement over the prior season.\nIn the 2006 off-season, Halpern left the Capitals to join the Dallas Stars; Chris Clark subsequently became the Capitals' new captain. Richard Zednik returned to the Capitals in 2006\u201307, but was later dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders after an injury-plagued season. Despite the transactions, the Capitals finished with the same point total (70) in 2006\u201307 as they did the year before, although they won one fewer game. Ovechkin was the Capitals' lone representative in the season's All-Star Game. Washington's campaign also saw the breakout of Alexander Semin, who notched 38 goals in only his second NHL season.\nIn the 2007\u201308 offseason, the Capitals signed Swedish forward Nicklas Backstrom, the fourth overall pick in the 2006 NHL entry draft, to a three-year entry-level contract. They also signed 19-year-old goaltender Semyon Varlamov to a three-year entry-level contract. After starting the season 6\u201314\u20131, the Capitals fired head coach Glen Hanlon and replaced him with Hershey Bears head coach Bruce Boudreau. On January 10, 2008, the Capitals signed Ovechkin to an NHL-record $124 million contract extension at 13 years, the second-longest term of any contract in the NHL after New York Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro's 15-year contract. Aided by key acquisitions at the trade deadline (Matt Cooke, Sergei Fedorov, and Cristobal Huet), Ovechkin's NHL-leading 65 goals, and Mike Green's league defensemen-leading 18 goals, the Capitals won the Southeast Division title for the first time since the 2000\u201301 season, edging out the Carolina Hurricanes for the division title on the final game of the season. Washington's remarkable end-of-season run included winning 11 of the final 12 regular season games. The Capitals became the first team in NHL history to make the playoffs after being ranked 14th or lower in their conference standings at the season's midpoint. For the postseason, the Capitals played against the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round and managed to force a game seven after being down three games to one in the series. However, they ultimately lost to the Flyers 3\u20132 in overtime. The accolades for the team continued to grow after the end of the season. Ovechkin won the Art Ross Trophy, the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, the Hart Memorial Trophy, and the Lester B. Pearson Award, becoming the first player in NHL history to win all four awards in the same season. Nicklas Backstrom was a finalist for the Calder Trophy, but ended up second to the Chicago Blackhawks' Patrick Kane. In addition to player awards, head coach Bruce Boudreau won the Jack Adams Award for the NHL's coach of the year. However, at free agency, the leading Capitals goaltender in games played, wins, save percentage, and shutouts, Olaf Kolzig left the team to join the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe 2008\u201309 season was highlighted by the play of Mike Green and Ovechkin. Green led all NHL defensemen in goals and points, also setting the record for the longest consecutive goal-scoring streak by a defenseman with eight games. Ovechkin won his second Hart Trophy, his second Lester B. Pearson Award, and his second Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy. The Capitals finished the regular season with a record of 50\u201324\u20138 and a team-record 108 points, and they won their second consecutive Southeast Division title. They then overcame a 3\u20131 series deficit against the New York Rangers in the first round of the 2009 playoffs. The Capitals were then defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, in the conference semifinals in seven games.\nThe Capitals finished the 2009\u201310 season first in the NHL with 121 points, thereby winning the Presidents' Trophy. Ovechkin led the team in points with 109. Backstrom finished with 101 points, fourth-most in the NHL. Once again, Mike Green led all defensemen in points, finishing with 76. Defenseman John Carlson made his NHL debut this season as well. Despite having a top-ranked regular season, the Capitals were defeated by the eighth-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs, giving up a 3\u20131 series lead in the process. Backstrom was given a ten-year contract extension after the season.\nThe 2010\u201311 season saw the Capitals repeat as the Southeast Division champions and as the top team in the Eastern Conference with 107 points. The season was highlighted by their participation in the 2011 Winter Classic, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3\u20131 at Heinz Field. However, in the playoffs, after defeating the New York Rangers in five games in the conference quarterfinals, they were swept by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the conference semifinals.\nThe Capitals started the 2011\u201312 season with a record of 7\u20130, but they only won five of their next 15 games. As a result, general manager George McPhee fired head coach Boudreau, hiring Capitals legend Dale Hunter as his replacement. By the end of the 2011\u201312 season, the team's top two goaltenders, Michal Neuvirth and Tomas Vokoun, were injured and the Capitals were required to lean on their goaltending prospect Braden Holtby to help the team into the 2012 playoffs. The Capitals finished with the seventh overall seed in East, drawing the defending champion Boston Bruins in the first round. The Capitals defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion and second-seeded Boston Bruins in seven games on an overtime goal by Joel Ward. Every game in the series was decided by a one-goal margin; previously, no single series in the Stanley Cup playoffs had ever gone as far as six or seven games while neither team ever held more than a one-goal lead. The Capitals then advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded New York Rangers. The series went seven games, ending with a 2\u20131 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden. Following the season's end, head coach Dale Hunter announced he would step down. Adam Oates was later named head coach of the team.\nThe lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season saw the Capitals off to a rocky start, as they managed just two wins in their first ten games. The team rebounded to win the Southeast Division, earning the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2013 playoffs. However, in the playoffs, the Capitals' fell to the Rangers in seven games for the second consecutive season.\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, the Capitals struggled to stay in a playoff spot and ultimately missed the playoffs by just three points in the standings, resulting in them missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006\u201307. Evgeny Kuznetsov made his NHL debut during the season. On April 26, 2014, 15 days after the regular season ended, the Capitals announced they would not renew general manager George McPhee's contract and that they had fired head coach Adam Oates.\nOn May 26, 2014, the Capitals announced the promotion of Brian MacLellan from director of player personnel to general manager and the hiring of Barry Trotz as the new head coach. In Ovechkin's 691st NHL game on November 4, 2014, he became the Capitals' all-time points leader during a game against the Calgary Flames, surpassing Peter Bondra. On January 1, 2015, the Washington Capitals defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3\u20132 in the 2015 Winter Classic at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. In the 2015 playoffs, the Capitals defeated the Islanders in seven games in the first round. In the second round, the Capitals held a 3\u20131 series lead over the New York Rangers. However, for the fifth time in their history, they gave up the series lead, as the Rangers defeated the Capitals in game seven.\nBack-to-back Presidents' Trophies and first Stanley Cup championship (2015\u20132018).\nDuring the offseason of the 2015\u201316 season, Mike Green left in free agency and Justin Williams was acquired in free agency. The Capitals also traded Pheonix Copley and Troy Brouwer for T. J. Oshie with the St. Louis Blues. the Capitals finished in first place in the league with a record of 56\u201318\u20138 and 120 points. After defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round, they faced their rival, the Pittsburgh Penguins, for the first time since 2009. The Penguins would win the series in six games.\nOvechkin reached the 1,000-point milestone on January 11, 2017, with a goal against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ovechkin was the 84th NHL player to reach the 1,000-point milestone, the fourth Russian-born player and the 37th player to reach the milestone while playing for one team throughout their NHL career. The Capitals won their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy, becoming just the seventh team in NHL history and the first time since the Vancouver Canucks in 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 to win back-to-back Presidents' Trophies. Ovechkin finished the 2016\u201317 season with 33 goals, leading the Capitals in goals for the twelfth straight season. Nearing the trade deadline, the Capitals traded with the Blues to acquire former Washington goaltender Pheonix Copley and defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk. In the 2017 playoffs, the Capitals defeated the eighth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs in six games in the first round to set up a second consecutive showdown with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round. After falling behind 3\u20131 in the series, they battled back to force a game seven at home, where they were eliminated 2\u20130, and lost their series 4\u20133.\nAfter the 2017 playoffs, the Capitals were unable to retain a number of players, losing Kevin Shattenkirk and Justin Williams to free agency, and defenseman Nate Schmidt to the 2017 NHL expansion draft. In addition, after signing Kuznetsov to long-term contract, the Capitals shipped Marcus Johansson to the New Jersey Devils to assist with the salary cap restrictions.\nDespite a slow 5\u20136\u20131 start to the 2017\u201318 season, which extended out to 10\u20139\u20131, the Capitals went on a 10\u20132\u20132 run in December, and were able to clinch the Metropolitan Division for a third consecutive season on April 1. In the 2018 playoffs, the Capitals battled back from a 2\u20130 series deficit against the seventh-seeded Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round of the playoffs, winning four straight and beating the Blue Jackets in six games. They faced the Penguins again in the second round, and this time, they defeated the Penguins with an overtime goal by Evgeny Kuznetsov in game six. It marked the first time in 20 seasons that the Capitals made the conference finals and the first time in 24 seasons that they had defeated the Penguins in playoff series. The Capitals advanced to the 2018 Stanley Cup Final on May 23, after beating the top-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games. They then faced the expansion Vegas Golden Knights and overcame them in five games, including a 4\u20133 win in the decisive game five. Not only was it the Capitals' first Stanley Cup victory, but it was also the first championship for a Washington, D.C. team in one of the four major North American sports leagues since the Washington Redskins defeated the Buffalo Bills 26 years beforehand in Super Bowl XXVI. Shortly after the Stanley Cup Final, Barry Trotz resigned as the head coach of the Capitals, after negotiations for a contract extension fell through. Assistant coach Todd Reirden was named as Trotz's replacement on June 29.\nPlayoff struggles (2018\u2013present).\nDuring the 2018\u201319 season, the Capitals clinched their fourth straight Metropolitan Division title. In the 2019 playoffs, the Capitals efforts to repeat as champions ultimately fell short, as they were eliminated in the first round by the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games.\nIn the 2019\u201320 season, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic pausing the season, Ovechkin led the league in goals with 48 and scored his 700th goal on February 22, 2020. The Capitals clinched the division title at the time of the pause, but lost to the New York Islanders in the first round of the 2020 playoffs. Following the loss, Reirden was fired and replaced by Peter Laviolette. The Capitals also lost Braden Holtby to free agency, but gained veterans Henrik Lundqvist and Zdeno Chara. Lundqvist would not play a game with the Capitals due to a heart condition.\nDuring the regular season of the 2020\u201321 season, the team made a trade with the Detroit Red Wings to acquire Anthony Mantha, trading out Richard Panik, Jakub Vrana, and two draft picks. However, in the 2021 playoffs, they lost to the Boston Bruins in five games of the first round. In the 2021\u201322 season, the Capitals reacquired Marcus Johansson, trading Daniel Sprong and two draft picks. In the playoffs, they matched against the Presidents' Trophy-winning Florida Panthers in the first round, but fell to them in six games. The 2022\u201323 season saw the Capitals play against the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2023 NHL Stadium Series at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Hurricanes defated the Capitals 4\u20131. Washington would also miss the playoffs for the first time since 2014. Following the season, the team and Laviolette agreed to mutually part ways. The Capitals hired 41-year-old Spencer Carbery to be their new head coach on May 30, 2023.\nIn December 2023, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment founder and team owner Ted Leonsis engaged in a non-binding partnership with Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin to move the Capitals and Washington Wizards to a planned arena in Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia, by 2028. The structure would be part of an arts and entertainment district at the site, which would include a practice facility, restaurants, an esports venue, concert hall, and a new headquarters for Monumental. In March 2024, after officials in Alexandria announced that the $2 billion entertainment and sports complex plans were scrapped, Washington mayor Muriel Bowser announced she had signed a deal with Leonsis, to keep the Capitals and Wizards in the District \"at least until 2050.\" The Capitals clinched the 2024 playoffs by beating the Philadelphia Flyers on April 16, finishing with a 40\u201331\u201311 record and the second wild card spot. They were swept by the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers in the first round. On July 8, 2024, the Capitals announced that Chris Patrick would be promoted to general manager, with MacLellan retaining his position as president of hockey operations.\nDuring the 2024\u201325 season, Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky's regular season goal record of 894, with his 895th career goal in a 4\u20131 loss to the New York Islanders on April 6, 2025. The Capitals also clinched their sixth Metropolitan Division title and the first seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they were triumphant over the Montreal Canadiens before being defeated by the Hurricanes in the second round. Following the season, Nicklas Backstrom left the team to rejoin Brynas IF of the Swedish Hockey League.\nTeam information.\nLogos and jerseys.\nThe Capitals took to the ice in red, white and blue jerseys featuring contrast-colored shoulders and stars on the chest and sleeves based on the flag of the United States. The original logo crest underwent a few modifications throughout the jersey's history.\nPrior to the start of the 1995\u201396 season, the team abandoned its traditional red, white and blue color scheme in favor of a blue, black, and copper palette with an American bald eagle with five stars as its logo. The alternate logo depicted the Capitol building with crossed hockey sticks behind. For the 1997\u201398 season, the team unveiled a black alternate jersey, devoid of blue with copper stripes on the ends of sleeves and at the waist. The crest on the white and blue jerseys were the bald eagle logo, while the crest on the black jersey was the Capitol logo. Initially, the team name was placed along the bottom black stripe, but was removed on the white jersey in 1997, while it remained on the blue jersey until its retirement. Prior to the 2000\u201301 season, the team retired its blue road jersey in favor of the black alternate jersey, but still kept the white jersey for home games.\nThe Capitals unveiled new uniforms on June 22, 2007, which coincided with the 2007 NHL entry draft and the new league-wide adaptation of the Reebok-designed uniform system for 2007\u201308. The change marked a return to the red, white and blue color scheme originally used from 1974 to 1995. The new primary logo is reminiscent of the original Capitals' logo, complete with a hockey stick formed by the letter \"t\"; it also includes a new feature not present in the original logo in the form of three stars representing DC, Maryland and Virginia. The stars are a reference to the flag of Washington, D.C., which is in turn based on the shield of George Washington's family coat of arms. The new alternate logo used an eagle in the shape of a \"W\" with the silhouette of the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol building in the negative space within and below.\nFor the 2011 Winter Classic, the Capitals wore a white jersey honoring the franchise's past with the original logo. The jersey resembled the one the franchise wore from 1974 to 1995. Instead of wearing the combination of blue pants and white helmets the team used when it played at the Capital Centre, the Capitals chose red pants and helmets for the New Year's Day game. The Capitals wore the same jersey, minus the NHL Winter Classic patch, on February 1, 2011, to honor Hockey Hall of Fame winger Dino Ciccarelli.\nThe Capitals announced on September 16, 2011, that they would wear a third jersey modeled after the Winter Classic jersey for 16 road games during the 2011\u201312 season.\nFor the 2015 Winter Classic, which took place on New Year's Day at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., the Capitals wore a newly designed jersey intended to pay homage to hockey's outdoor roots. The primary color of the jersey was a vintage deep red. The addition of stripes on the shoulders, waist and legs brought in elements of Washington's professional hockey jerseys from the 1930s, predating the Capitals franchise's formation in the 1970s. A large \"W\" on the front of the jersey, topped with the common three stars, offset in blue to contrast the white \"Capitals\" wordmark.\nStarting with the 2015\u201316 season, the Capitals wore their throwback red third jerseys, replacing the white Winter Classic thirds.\nPrior to the 2017\u201318 season, the NHL announced a new partnership with Adidas, and the Capitals unveiled new uniforms with minor changes. There were no third jerseys during that season, but the return of the program in the 2018\u201319 season saw the return of the Capitals' red throwback uniforms as their alternates.\nFor the 2018 Stadium Series, the Capitals used newly designed navy uniforms, honoring the fact that the game was held at the U.S. Naval Academy. The chest logo was based on the regular stylized \"Capitals\" logo, but shortened to \"Caps\", the nickname commonly used for the team. There were also features honoring various aspects of D.C., as well as the presence of a slightly altered W logo from the 2015 Winter Classic on the pants.\nIn 2021, as part of Adidas' \"Reverse Retro\" uniform series, the Capital unveiled a recolored version of their blue \"screaming eagle\" uniform used from 1995 to 2000. The base color is red with dark blue accents. The Capitals also replaced their throwback red alternates with a dark blue third jersey; this design featured three red stars and a uniquely-designed white \"W\" with the Washington Monument triangle in the middle. The uniform also features white/red/white stripes on the waist and sleeves and a white shoulder yoke.\nIn 2022, a second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released, this time featuring a black version of the \"screaming eagle\" uniform with blue and copper accents. This uniform was restored as the team's alternate ahead of the 2024\u201325 season, updated to the Fanatics template.\nFor the 2023 Stadium Series, the Capitals unveiled a white uniform centered around the alternate \"Weagle\" logo, with its navy wings extending towards the sleeves with white numbers.\nPrior to the 2025\u201326 season, the Capitals redesigned the \"screaming eagle\" alternate, now recolored to a red base with dark blue and silver accents. The white shoulder yoke and dark blue and white stripes were a visual nod to the original red uniforms.\nPractice facility.\nSince 2006, the Capitals have practiced in the Ballston neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. The practice facility is known as the MedStar Capitals Iceplex.\nMascot.\nSince 1995, the Capitals' mascot has been Slapshot, a bald eagle that wears the number 00. He was named by a fifth grader who won the naming contest.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Capitals.

{"id": "73126", "revid": "50929639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73126", "title": "Chicago Blackhawks", "text": "National Hockey League team in the Chicagoland area\nThe Chicago Blackhawks (spelled Black Hawks until 1986, and known colloquially as the Hawks) are a professional ice hockey team based in Chicago. The Blackhawks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cup championships since their founding in 1926. They are one of the \"Original Six\" NHL teams, along with the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. Since the 1994-95 season, the team has played its home games at the United Center, which they share with the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls; both teams previously played at the now-demolished Chicago Stadium.\nThe Blackhawks' original owner was Frederic McLaughlin, a \"hands-on\" owner who fired many coaches during his ownership and led the team to win two Stanley Cup titles in 1934 and 1938. After McLaughlin's death in 1944, the team came under the ownership of the Norris family, who acted as their landlord as owners of the Chicago Stadium, and also owned stakes in several of the NHL teams. At first, the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by longtime executive Bill Tobin, and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red Wings. After the senior James E. Norris died in 1952, the Norris assets were spread among family members, and James D. Norris became the owner of the Blackhawks. The younger Norris took an active interest in the team, which won another Stanley Cup title under his ownership in 1961. After James D. Norris died in 1966, the Wirtz family became owners of the franchise. In 2007, the team came under the control of Rocky Wirtz, who is credited with turning around the organization, which had lost fan interest and competitiveness; under Wirtz, the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times, in 2010, 2013 and 2015. Rocky died in July 2023, and his son, Danny Wirtz, was named chairman of the Blackhawks.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nOn May 15, 1926, the NHL owners met in Montreal and awarded an expansion franchise for Chicago to a syndicate headed by former football star Huntington Hardwick of Boston.\nAt the same meeting, Hardwick arranged the purchase of the players of the Portland Rosebuds of the Western Hockey League for $100,000 from WHL president Frank Patrick in a deal brokered by Boston Bruins' owner Charles Adams. However, only a month later, Hardwick's group sold out to Chicago coffee tycoon Frederic McLaughlin.\nMcLaughlin had been a commander with the 333rd Machine Gun Battalion of the 86th Infantry Division during World War I. This division was nicknamed the \"Blackhawk Division\" after Black Hawk, a Native American of the Sauk nation who was a prominent figure in the history of Illinois. McLaughlin named the new hockey team in honor of the military unit, making it one of many sports team names using Native Americans as icons. However, unlike the military division, the team's name was spelled in two words as \"Black Hawks\" until 1986, when the club officially became the \"Blackhawks\", based on the spelling found in the original franchise documents.\nThe Black Hawks began play in the 1926\u201327 season, along with its fellow expansion franchises, the Detroit Cougars (now the Detroit Red Wings) and New York Rangers. The team had to face immediate competition in Chicago from Eddie Livingstone's rival, the Chicago Cardinals, who played in the same building. McLaughlin took a very active role in running the team despite having no background in the sport. He hired Bill Tobin, a former goaltender who had played in the Western League, as his assistant, but directed the team himself. He was also very interested in promoting American players, then very rare in professional hockey. Several of them, including Doc Romnes, Taffy Abel, Alex Levinsky, Mike Karakas, and Cully Dahlstrom, become staples with the team, and under McLaughlin, the Black Hawks were the first NHL team with an all-American-born lineup.\nMcLaughlin era (1926\u20131944).\nThe Black Hawks played their first game on November 17, 1926, against the Toronto St. Patricks at the Chicago Coliseum. They won their first game 4\u20131, in front of a crowd of over 7,000. The Hawks' first season was a moderate success, as they finished the season in third place with a record of 19\u201322\u20133. However, they lost the 1927 first-round playoff series to the Boston Bruins.\nFollowing the series, McLaughlin fired head coach Pete Muldoon. According to Jim Coleman, sportswriter for the Toronto-based \"Globe and Mail\", McLaughlin felt that the Hawks were good enough to finish first. Muldoon disagreed, and in a fit of pique, McLaughlin fired him. According to Coleman, Muldoon responded by yelling, \"Fire me, Major, and you'll never finish first. I'll put a curse on this team that will hoodoo it until the end of time.\" The Curse of Muldoon was born \u2013 although Coleman admitted years after the fact that he had fabricated the whole incident \u2013 and became one of the first widely known sports \"curses.\" While the team would go on to win three Stanley Cups in its first 39 years of existence, it did so without ever having finished in first place, either in a single- or multi-division format. The Black Hawks proceeded to have the worst record in the league in 1927\u201328, winning only seven of 44 games.\nFor the 1928\u201329 season, the Black Hawks were originally slated to play in the newly built Chicago Stadium, but due to construction delays and a dispute between McLaughlin and arena president Paddy Harmon, they instead divided their time between the Coliseum, the Detroit Olympia, and the Peace Bridge Arena in Fort Erie, Ontario, before moving to Chicago Stadium the following season.\nBy 1930\u201331, with goal-scorer Johnny Gottselig, Cy Wentworth on defense, and Charlie Gardiner in goal, the Hawks reached their first Stanley Cup Final, but lost in the final two games against the Montreal Canadiens. They had another stellar season in 1931\u201332, but that did not translate into playoff success. However, two years later, Gardiner led his team to victory by shutting out the Detroit Red Wings in the final game of the Stanley Cup Final; Mush March scored the winning goal in double-overtime as the Hawks beat Detroit 1\u20130.\nIn 1937\u201338, the Black Hawks had a record of 14\u201325\u20139, almost missing the playoffs. They stunned the Canadiens and New York Americans on overtime goals in the deciding games of both semi-final series, advancing to the 1938 Stanley Cup Final against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Black Hawks goaltender Mike Karakas was injured and could not play, forcing a desperate Chicago team to pull minor-leaguer Alfie Moore out of a Toronto bar and onto the ice. Moore played one game and won it. Toronto refused to let Moore play the next, so Chicago used Paul Goodman in game 2 and lost. However, for the third and fourth games, Karakas was fitted with a special skate to protect his injured toe, and the team won both games. It was too late for Toronto, as the Hawks won their second championship. As of 2019[ [update]], the 1937\u201338 Black Hawks possess the poorest regular season record of any Stanley Cup champion.\nThe Black Hawks next returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1944 behind Doug Bentley's 38 goals, with Bentley's linemate Clint Smith leading the team in assists. After upsetting the Red Wings in the semifinals, they were promptly dispatched by the dominant Canadiens in four games.\nNorris era (1944\u20131966).\nAfter McLaughlin died in December 1944, his estate sold the team to a syndicate headed by longtime team president Bill Tobin. However, Tobin was only a puppet for James E. Norris, who owned the rival Red Wings. Norris had also been the Black Hawks' landlord since his 1936 purchase of the Chicago Stadium. For the next eight years, the Norris-Tobin ownership, as a rule, paid almost no attention to the Black Hawks. Nearly every trade made between Detroit and Chicago ended up being Red Wing heists. As a result, for the next several years, the Black Hawks were the model of futility in the NHL. Between 1945 and 1958, they only made the playoffs twice.\nIn 1950, Norris' eldest son, James D. Norris, and Red Wings minority owner Arthur Wirtz (the senior Norris' original partner in buying the Red Wings 23 years earlier) took over the floundering club. They guided it through financial reversals, and rebuilt the team from there. One of their first moves was to hire former Detroit coach and general manager Tommy Ivan as general manager.\nIn the late 1950s, the Hawks struck gold, acquiring three young prospects (forwards Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita and defenseman Pierre Pilote), and obtaining both star goaltender Glenn Hall and veteran forward Ted Lindsay (who had just had a career season with 30 goals and 55 assists) from Detroit. Hull, Mikita, Pilote, and Hall became preeminent stars of the team, and all four would eventually be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nAfter two first-round exits at the hands of the eventual champions from Montreal in 1959 and 1960, it was expected the Canadiens would once again defeat the Hawks when they met in the semifinals in 1961. A defensive plan that completely wore down Montreal's superstars worked, however, as Chicago won the series in six games. They then bested the Wings to win their third Stanley Cup championship.\nThe Hawks made the Cup Final twice more in the 1960s, losing to the Leafs in 1962 and the Canadiens in 1965. They remained a force to be reckoned with throughout the decade, with Hull enjoying four 50-goal seasons, Mikita winning back-to-back scoring titles and MVP accolades, Pilote winning three consecutive Norris Trophies, and Hall being named the First or Second All-Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons. Hull and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared one-two punch in the league. However, despite a strong supporting cast which included Bill Hay, Ken Wharram, Phil Esposito, Moose Vasko, Doug Mohns, and Pat Stapleton, the Hawks never quite put it all together.\nIn 1966\u201367, the last season of the six-team NHL, the Black Hawks finished first, breaking the supposed \"Curse of Muldoon\", 23 years after the death of Frederic McLaughlin. However, they lost in the semifinals to Toronto, who went on to win their last Stanley Cup of the era. Afterward, Coleman, who first printed the story of the curse in 1943, admitted that he made the story up to break a writer's block he had as a column deadline approached.\nArthur Wirtz era (1966\u20131983).\nBefore his death in 1966, one of James D. Norris' last moves in the NHL was to arrange an expansion franchise in St. Louis, where he owned the St. Louis Arena. Tobin died in 1963, a vice president of the team until his death. Ownership now passed to Norris' longtime partner Arthur Wirtz and his son Bill Wirtz. The Wirtz\u2013Norris partnership dated over three decades; Arthur Wirtz had been a minority partner in the syndicate the senior Norris put together to buy the Red Wings in 1932.\nGoaltender Glenn Hall was drafted by the St. Louis Blues expansion team for the 1967\u201368 season, while Pierre Pilote was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Jim Pappin in 1968. In the 1968\u201369 season, despite Bobby Hull breaking his own previous record of 54 goals in a season with 58, the Black Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since 1958, and the last time before 1997\u201398.\nIn 1967, the Black Hawks made a trade with the Boston Bruins that turned out to be one of the most one-sided in the history of the sport. Chicago sent young forwards Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield to Boston in exchange for Pit Martin, Jack Norris and Gilles Marotte. While Martin would star for the Hawks for many seasons, Esposito, Hodge and Stanfield would lead the Bruins to the top of the NHL for several years and capture two Stanley Cups. In Boston, Esposito set numerous scoring records en route to a career as one of the NHL's all-time greats.\nNonetheless, in the 1970\u201371 season, life was made easier for the Black Hawks, as in an attempt to better balance the divisions, the expansion Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks were both placed in the East Division while the Hawks moved into the West Division. The Hawks became the class of the West overnight, rampaging to a 46\u201317\u201315 record and an easy first-place finish. With second-year goaltender Tony Esposito (Phil's younger brother and winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year the previous season), Hull, his younger brother Dennis, Mikita, and defensemen Stapleton, Keith Magnuson and Bill White, the Hawks reached the Stanley Cup Final, losing to the Canadiens.\nA critical blow to the franchise came in 1972\u201373 with the start of the World Hockey Association (WHA). Long dissatisfied with how little he was paid as the NHL's marquee star, Hull jumped to the upstart Winnipeg Jets for a million-dollar contract. Former Philadelphia Flyers star Andre Lacroix joined him, having received very little ice time during his single season with Chicago, and the pair became two of the WHA's great stars. However, the Black Hawks repeated their appearance in the Stanley Cup Final that year, again losing to Montreal. Stapleton also left for the WHA after that year, depleting the team further.\nWhile the team led or was second in the West Division for four straight seasons, for the rest of the 1970s, the Black Hawks made the playoffs each year\u2014winning seven division championships in the decade in all\u2014but were never a successful Stanley Cup contender, losing 16-straight playoff games at one point. The team acquired legendary blueliner Bobby Orr from the Boston Bruins in 1976, but ill health forced him to sit out for most of the season, and he eventually retired in 1979, having played only 26 games for the Hawks. Stan Mikita did the same the following year after playing for Chicago for 22 years, the third-longest career for a single team in league history.\nBy 1982, the Black Hawks squeaked into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Norris Division (at the time the top four teams in each division automatically made the playoffs), and were one of the NHL's Cinderella teams that year. Led by second-year Denis Savard's 32 goals and 119 points and Doug Wilson's 39 goals, the Hawks stunned the Minnesota North Stars and St. Louis Blues in the playoffs before losing to another surprise team, the Vancouver Canucks, who made the Stanley Cup Final. Chicago proved they were no fluke the next season, also making the third round before losing to the eventual runner-up Edmonton Oilers. After an off-year in 1984, the Hawks again faced a now fresh-off-a-ring Edmonton offensive juggernaut of a team and lost in the third round in 1985.\nBill Wirtz era (1983\u20132007).\nIn 1983, Arthur Wirtz died and the club came under the sole control of his son Bill Wirtz. Although the Black Hawks continued to make the playoffs each season, the club began a slow decline, punctuated with an appearance in the 1992 Stanley Cup Final.\nDuring the 1985 playoff series against Edmonton, the Black Hawks and their fans started a tradition of cheering during the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nPrior to the 1985\u201386 season, the team's original NHL contract was found to have their name printed as a compound word (\"Blackhawks\") as opposed to two separate words (\"Black Hawks\"). Official sources, including team and league records, had been using the latter for 60 years; the two-word moniker was also embraced by the public and media without question, especially since it lent itself to the shorthand \"Hawks\" as a nickname. The team began transitioning to \"Chicago Blackhawks\" during the season before the league officially followed suit ahead of the 1986\u201387 campaign.\nIn the late 1980s, Chicago still made the playoffs on an annual basis but made early-round exits each time. In 1988\u201389, after three-straight first-round defeats and despite a fourth-place finish in their division in the regular season, Chicago made it to the conference finals in the rookie seasons of both goaltender Ed Belfour and center Jeremy Roenick. However, they failed to make the 1989 Stanley Cup Final, losing to the eventual champions, the Calgary Flames.\nThe following season, the Hawks did prove they were late-round playoff material, running away with the Norris Division title, but, yet again, the third round continued to stymie them, this time against the eventual champion Oilers, despite 1970s Soviet star goaltender Vladislav Tretiak coming to Chicago to become the Blackhawks' goaltender coach.\nIn 1990\u201391, Chicago was poised to fare even better in the playoffs, winning the Presidents' Trophy for best regular season record, but the Minnesota North Stars stunned them in six games in the first round en route to an improbable Stanley Cup Final appearance. In 1991\u201392, the Blackhawks \u2013 with Roenick scoring 53 goals, Steve Larmer scoring 29 goals, Chris Chelios (acquired from Montreal two years earlier) on defense, and Belfour in goal \u2013 finally reached the Stanley Cup Final after 19 years out of such status, winning 11 consecutive playoff games that year, setting an NHL record in the process. However, they were swept four games to none by the Mario Lemieux-led defending Stanley Cup champion, the Pittsburgh Penguins. In sweeping the Blackhawks, the Penguins tied the record Chicago had set only days before. Although the 4\u20130 sweep indicated Pittsburgh's dominance in games won, the individual games were contested closely. Game 1 saw the Blackhawks squander leads of 3\u20130 and 4\u20131, and would eventually be beaten 5\u20134 after a Lemieux power-play goal with nine seconds remaining in regulation. The Blackhawks' most lackluster match was game two, losing 3\u20131. A frustrating loss of 1\u20130 followed in game three, and a natural hat trick from Dirk Graham and stellar play from Dominik Hasek (who showed indications of the goaltender he would later become) could not secure a win in game 4, which ended in a 6\u20135 final in favor of Pittsburgh. The defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls were in their finals in 1992, but won their championship in six. This was the only year the city of Chicago would host the NBA and NHL finals concurrently in the same year; Blackhawks head coach Mike Keenan would see this again in New York, when he coached the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years in 1994.\nBelfour posted a 40-win season in 1992\u201393 as the Hawks looked to go deep yet again, and Chris Chelios accumulated career-high penalty time with 282 minutes in the box, but St. Louis stunned Chicago with a first-round sweep to continue Chicago's playoff losing streak.\nAlthough they finished near .500 in 1993\u201394, the Blackhawks again qualified for the playoffs. They were eliminated by eventual Western Conference finalist Toronto, but broke their playoff losing streak at 10 games with a game three win. It was not enough, however, and the Blackhawks fell in six games. The 1993\u201394 season was also the Blackhawks' last at the Chicago Stadium, as the team moved into the newly built United Center across the street for the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season. Bernie Nicholls and Joe Murphy both scored 20 goals over 48 games, and Chicago once again made it to the conference finals, losing to the rival Detroit Red Wings. Also in 1994, management fired Wayne Messmer, popular singer of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nJeremy Roenick, Ed Belfour and Chris Chelios were all traded away as the Blackhawks faltered through the late 1990s, until they missed the playoffs by five points in 1997\u201398 for the first time in 29 years, one season short of tying the Boston Bruins' record for the longest such streak in North American professional sport history. Chicago would also miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season in 1998\u201399, and missed the playoffs again in 1999\u20132000 and 2000\u201301 seasons.\nThe new millennium started with disappointment for the Blackhawks. \u00c9ric Daze, Alexei Zhamnov and Tony Amonte emerged as some of the team's leading stars by this time. However, aside from a quick first-round exit in 2002 (where they lost to the St. Louis Blues in five games after winning game 1 of the series), the Blackhawks were consistently out of the playoffs from the 1997\u201398 season until the 2008\u201309 season, in most years finishing well out of contention, despite finishing in third place in the Central Division six times. Amonte left for the Phoenix Coyotes in the summer of 2002. During the 2002\u201303 season, the Blackhawks finished third in the Central Division with 79 points, but would finish ninth in the Western Conference, which would make them miss the playoffs by 13 points.\nA somber note was struck in February 2004, when ESPN named the Blackhawks the worst franchise in professional sports. Indeed, the Blackhawks were viewed with much indifference by Chicagoans for much of the 1990s and early 2000s due to anger over several policies instituted by then-owner Bill Wirtz, who was derisively known as \"Dollar Bill\". For example, Wirtz did not allow home games to be televised in the Chicago area, claiming it was unfair to the team's season ticket holders. He also raised ticket prices to an average of $50, making them among the most expensive in the NHL. The Chicago Wolves, an American Hockey League (AHL) team based in Rosemont, Illinois, mocked the Blackhawks' struggle by using the marketing slogan, \"We Play Hockey the Old-Fashioned Way: We Actually Win.\"\nFollowing the lockout of the 2004\u201305 season, new general manager Dale Tallon set about restructuring the team in the hopes of making a playoff run. Tallon made several moves in the summer of 2005, most notably the signing of the Tampa Bay Lightning's Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin and All-Star defenseman Adrian Aucoin. However, injuries plagued Khabibulin and Aucoin among others, and the Blackhawks again finished well out of the playoffs with a 26\u201343\u201313 record, next-to-last in the Western Conference and second-worst in the NHL. The Blackhawks reached another low point on May 16, 2006, when they announced that popular TV/radio play-by-play announcer Pat Foley would not be brought back after 25 years with the team, a move unpopular amongst most fans; Foley then became the television/radio voice for the Chicago Wolves.\nWith the third overall pick in the 2006 NHL entry draft, the team selected Jonathan Toews, who led the University of North Dakota's Fighting Sioux team to the 2006 Frozen Four. The Blackhawks were eager to make a splash in the free agent market, and offered big money to many of the top free agents. However, they were denied, only being able to acquire two backup goaltenders in Patrick Lalime and Sebastien Caron. Chicago was one of the biggest buyers in the trade market, acquiring a future franchise player in Martin Havlat, as well as Bryan Smolinski from the Ottawa Senators in a three-way trade that also involved the San Jose Sharks. The Hawks dealt forward Mark Bell to the Sharks, Michal Barinka and a 2008 second-round draft pick to the Senators, while Ottawa also received defenseman Tom Preissing and center Josh Hennessy from San Jose. Havlat gave the Blackhawks the talented first-line caliber game breaker they desperately needed. The Havlat trade was soon followed by another major trade: winger and key Blackhawk player Kyle Calder was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for grinding defensive center Michal Handzus. The move caused a stir in Chicago, as Calder had won an increase in his contract through arbitration, which was accepted by the Hawks, but rather than ink their leading scorer, the team decided to address their need for a proven center by acquiring Handzus. Injuries to both Havlat and Handzus hurt the Blackhawks, and Smolinski was eventually traded at the trade deadline to the Vancouver Canucks. On November 26, 2006, Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon fired head coach Trent Yawney and appointed assistant coach Denis Savard as the head coach. Savard had been the assistant coach of the team since 1997, a year after he retired as one of the most popular and successful Blackhawks players of all time. The Blackhawks continued to struggle, and finished last in the Central Division, 12 points out of the playoffs. They finished with the fourth-worst record in the NHL, and in the draft lottery, won the opportunity to select first overall in the draft. The team had never had a draft pick higher than third overall before, and used the pick to draft right wing Patrick Kane from the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).\nRocky Wirtz era (2007\u20132023).\n2007\u20132009: Rebuilding.\nOn September 26, 2007, longtime Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz died after a brief battle with cancer. He was succeeded by his son Rocky, who drastically altered his father's long-standing policies.\nMidway into the 2007\u201308 season, the franchise experimented with a partnership with Comcast SportsNet Chicago and WGN-TV by airing selected Blackhawks home games on television. During the next season, Comcast and WGN began airing all of the team's regular season games. Rocky also named John McDonough, former president of Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs, as the Blackhawks' new president. After taking over the position, McDonough was an instrumental figure in the Blackhawks' current marketing success. Wirtz was also able to bring back former Blackhawks greats Tony Esposito, Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull as the franchise's \"hockey ambassadors\".\nIn addition to the changes in the team's policies and front office, the younger Wirtz also made a concerted effort to rebuild the team. The Blackhawks roster was bolstered by the addition of Patrick Kane, the first overall selection in the 2007 NHL entry draft, who led all rookies in points. Kane and Jonathan Toews were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's best rookie. Kane ultimately beat his teammate for the award. Kane finished the 2007\u201308 season with 21 goals and 51 assists in 82 games. The Blackhawks finished with a record of 40\u201334\u20138, missing the playoffs by three points. The 2007\u201308 season marked the first time in six years that the team finished above .500.\nPrior to the 2008\u201309 season opener, the Blackhawks named 20-year-old Toews as the new captain, succeeding Adrian Aucoin (who was traded to the Calgary Flames, after the 2006\u201307 season) and making him the third-youngest captain at the time of appointment. In addition to a new captain, the Blackhawks made several major roster changes before the season, trading Tuomo Ruutu, their longest-tenured player, to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for forward Andrew Ladd on February 26, 2008. Later that day, the Blackhawks traded captain Martin Lapointe to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in the 2008 NHL entry draft. On July 1, the first day of free agency, the team signed goaltender Cristobal Huet to a four-year, US$22.5\u00a0million contract, and later signed defenseman Brian Campbell to an eight-year, $56.8\u00a0million contract. They also added former coaches Joel Quenneville and Scotty Bowman to their organization.\nOn February 13, 2008, the Blackhawks announced they would hold their first fan convention. On July 16, 2008, the team announced that they would host the 2009 Winter Classic on a temporary ice rink at the Chicago Cubs' home park Wrigley Field on New Year's Day against fellow \"Original Six\" members, the Detroit Red Wings; the Red Wings defeated Chicago 6\u20134. On June 16, Pat Foley returned as the Blackhawks' TV play-by-play man, replacing Dan Kelly; Foley called Blackhawks games from 1981 to 2006, and spent the next two years broadcasting for the AHL's Chicago Wolves. Foley was partnered with Ed Olczyk to broadcast all of the Blackhawks' games. On October 16, 2008, the Blackhawks relieved Denis Savard of his head coaching duties and replaced him with Joel Quenneville. Savard has since been brought back to the organization as an ambassador.\nThe Blackhawks finished the 2008\u201309 regular season in second place in their division with a record of 46\u201324\u201312, putting them in fourth place in the Western Conference with 104 points. The Blackhawks clinched a playoff berth for the first time since the 2001\u201302 season with a 3\u20131 win over the Nashville Predators on April 3. On April 8, with a shootout loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Blackhawks clinched their first 100-point season in 17 years. The Blackhawks defeated the fifth-seeded Calgary Flames in six games to advance to the conference semifinals for the first time since 1996. The team proceeded to defeat the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks in six games,&lt;ref name=\"www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2008030246\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and then played the then-Stanley Cup champion, the Detroit Red Wings, for the Western Conference Championship, losing the series in five games.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, the team led the NHL in home attendance, with a total of 912,155 spectators, averaging 22,247 per game. This figure includes the 40,818 fans from the Winter Classic at Wrigley Field. Therefore, the total attendance for games hosted at the United Center is 871,337, good for an average of 21,783, which still led the NHL over Montreal's 21,273 average. The Blackhawks welcomed their one millionth fan of the season at the United Center before game 6 of the conference semifinals on May 11, 2009.\n2009\u20132010: The Stanley Cup returns to Chicago.\nPrior to the 2009\u201310 season, the Blackhawks made another major free agent purchase, signing Marian Hossa to a 12-year, US$62.8\u00a0million contract. The team also acquired Tomas Kopecky, John Madden and Richard Petiot. In early July, general manager Dale Tallon and the Blackhawks management came under fire when the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) claimed that the team did not submit offers to their restricted free agents before the deadline. In the worst-case scenario, the team's unsigned restricted free agents at the time, including Calder Memorial Trophy finalist Kris Versteeg, would have become unrestricted free agents. Despite the ordeal, the Blackhawks were able to sign Versteeg and all of their restricted free agents before the NHLPA could take further action. On July 14, 2009, the Blackhawks demoted Dale Tallon to the position of senior adviser. Stan Bowman, son of Scotty Bowman, was promoted to general manager. The Blackhawks continued to sell-out games, with the best average attendance of 21,356 over the Montreal Canadiens' 21,273 in the NHL, and had a total of 854,267, excluding the playoffs. The Blackhawks reached the one million mark in game 3 of the conference finals against the San Jose Sharks.\nThe Blackhawks re-signed Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews to contract extensions worth $31.5\u00a0million over five years, and Duncan Keith to a 13-year extension worth $72\u00a0million on December 1, 2009. On April 6, 2010, the Hawks won their 50th game of the 2009\u201310 season against the Dallas Stars, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season. The next night, the Blackhawks notched their 109th point of the season in a game against the St. Louis Blues, setting another franchise record.\nThe Blackhawks made the playoffs for the second consecutive season with a regular season record of 52\u201322\u20138, finishing second in the Western Conference. They defeated the seventh-seeded Nashville Predators in six games in the first round before defeating the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks for the second straight year, again in six games. The Blackhawks then swept the top-seeded San Jose Sharks in the conference finals, advancing to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1992, where they played the Philadelphia Flyers. The Blackhawks prevailed in six games against the seventh-seeded Flyers to secure their fourth Stanley Cup in franchise history, and their first since 1961, ending the team's 49-year championship drought.\n2010\u20132012: Building up for more consistency.\nThe Blackhawks immediately faced salary cap constraints prior to the 2010\u201311 season. The team was forced to trade several players who played an integral role to their 2009\u201310 Stanley Cup victory, including Dustin Byfuglien, Andrew Ladd, Kris Versteeg, Brent Sopel, Ben Eager and Colin Fraser. The team was also unable to agree to terms with starting goaltender Antti Niemi, who left as restricted free agent to the San Jose Sharks. The Blackhawks signed former Dallas Stars starting goalie Marty Turco as his replacement, but eventually turned to rookie Corey Crawford to become their full-time starting goaltender. The Blackhawks also acquired Viktor Stalberg from the Toronto Maple Leafs and signed rookies Nick Leddy and Marcus Kruger to three-year entry-level contracts. The Blackhawks also made a mid-season trade to acquire winger Michael Frolik from the Florida Panthers in exchange for Jack Skille, Hugh Jessiman and David Pacan. Amidst the roster turnaround, the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks finished the season with a 44\u201329\u20139 record, and placed third in the Central Division and eighth in the Western Conference. The team's playoff fate was determined on the final day of the regular season on April 10, 2011. The Blackhawks lost their regular season finale to the Detroit Red Wings 4\u20133 but still received the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference after the Minnesota Wild defeated the Dallas Stars later that same day 5\u20133. Had the Stars won their finale against the Wild, the Stars would\u2019ve overtaken the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks to the last playoff spot, which would\u2019ve resulted in the Blackhawks dropping to ninth place in the West and missing the playoffs entirely by one point in the standings. In the first round of the 2011 playoffs, the Blackhawks faced the Presidents' Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks, marking the third consecutive playoffs that the two teams faced each other, this time in the first round in contrast to the second round the previous two years prior. The Canucks built a three-game lead in the series before the Blackhawks were able to win the next three games in a row. Alex Burrows won game 7 for the Canucks in overtime, 2\u20131 to win the series 4\u20133.\nBefore the 2011\u201312 season, the Blackhawks continued to make roster moves to optimize their salary cap situation while also trying to stay in Stanley Cup contention. The team traded winger Troy Brouwer to the Washington Capitals in exchange for the 26th overall pick in the 2011 NHL entry draft (used to select Phillip Danault), and traded veteran defenseman Brian Campbell, who had one of the richest contracts in the franchise's history, to the Florida Panthers. The Blackhawks also traded veteran forward Tomas Kopecky to the Panthers and forward Jake Dowell signed with the Dallas Stars in free agency in the 2011 off-season. The team bolstered their forward depth by signing veteran forwards Daniel Carcillo, Jamal Mayers and Andrew Brunette in free agency, while also acquiring goaltender Ray Emery in free agency to back-up Corey Crawford after Marty Turco left the team as a free agent. The Blackhawks also signed Andrew Shaw to a three-year, entry-level contract. The Blackhawks placed fourth in the Central Division and sixth in the Western Conference with a 45\u201326\u201311 record, and qualified for the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. They faced the third-seeded Phoenix Coyotes in the opening round, who eliminated the Blackhawks in six games. The series saw five of the six games going to overtime, with Bryan Bickell (game 2) and Jonathan Toews (game 5) scoring the only Blackhawk overtime winners of the series.\n2012\u20132013: Presidents' Trophy and fifth Stanley Cup.\nThe Blackhawks started the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season with much success by establishing several new records. On January 27, 2013, they set a new franchise record for starting the season 6\u20130\u20130 after a win against the Detroit Red Wings. On February 19, the Blackhawks tied the NHL record previously set by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006\u201307 season for earning points in the first 16 consecutive games of a season, and defeated the Ducks' record (28 points) by one point. On March 6, the Blackhawks extended the NHL record to 24 games with a record of 21\u20130\u20133, and the franchise record for most consecutive wins to 11 games. However, they lost 6\u20132 to the Colorado Avalanche on March 8, their first loss in regulation, which ended their 24-game streak in which they earned at least one point, an NHL record to start a season and the third-longest in NHL history.\nThe United Center also recorded its 200th consecutive combined regular season and playoff Blackhawks sell-out on March 1 against the Columbus Blue Jackets, which began during the 2007\u201308 season with the game against the Blue Jackets on March 30, 2008. The Blackhawks won the Presidents' Trophy for the best regular season record in the NHL, and clinched home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs. After dispatching the eighth-seeded Minnesota Wild in the first round, the Blackhawks faced the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the conference semifinals. The Blackhawks won the series opener but lost the next three games and faced elimination. However, the Blackhawks clawed back into the series, eventually winning the series on a goal by Brent Seabrook in overtime of game 7. The team then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion and fifth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in five games to secure a second Stanley Cup Final appearance in four seasons.\nThe Blackhawks faced the Boston Bruins in the 2013 Stanley Cup Final. It was the first time since 1979 that two Original Six teams had made the Stanley Cup Final and the first time since 1945 that the last four teams to win the Stanley Cup were in the conference finals. The Bruins made their second appearance in the Stanley Cup Final in three years (winning in 2011 in seven games against the Vancouver Canucks) and were making a similar resurgence as the Blackhawks. On June 24, the Blackhawks defeated the Bruins in the sixth game of the series to win the Stanley Cup, having overcome a 2\u20131 deficit with just over a minute remaining in the game. Bryan Bickell and Dave Bolland scored goals with 1:16 and 0:58.3 remaining in the game, just 17 seconds apart, to win 3\u20132.\n2013\u20132016: Sixth Stanley Cup and continued contention.\nThe Blackhawks began the 2013\u201314 season in hopes of becoming the first team to win consecutive Stanley Cups since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 and 1998. The team was slightly altered in the off-season to remain under the salary cap. The team traded veteran forwards Dave Bolland, Daniel Carcillo and Michael Frolik in exchange for future draft picks, while parting ways with veteran goaltender Ray Emery and veteran winger Viktor Stalberg by having them leave in free agency. Despite these changes, the Blackhawks tallied a 28\u20137\u20137 record going into January 2014. The team played their second outdoor game in franchise history, against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Soldier Field, as part of the 2014 Stadium Series. The Blackhawks defeated the Penguins 5\u20131 in front of 62,921 fans. The franchise recorded its 2,500th regular season win, while head coach Joel Quenneville won 693 wins as a coach, the third most in the history of the NHL. The Blackhawks finished the season with a 46\u201321\u201315 record, good for third in the Central Division. They opened the playoffs by losing two games to the St. Louis Blues. The Blackhawks surged back with four straight wins to take the series. The team then defeated the Minnesota Wild for the second consecutive year. However, the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Blackhawks in seven games and ultimately went on to win the Stanley Cup. After the season's conclusion, Duncan Keith won the James Norris Memorial Trophy for the second time in his career, and captain Jonathan Toews was named a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy for the second consecutive season and third time altogether. \nThe Blackhawks' roster from the previous three seasons remained largely intact going into the 2014\u201315 season. In the 2014 off-season prior to the beginning of the 2014\u201315 season, the team signed veteran center Brad Richards and rookie goaltender Scott Darling to one-year contracts, and traded veteran defenseman Nick Leddy to the New York Islanders in exchange for three minor-league prospects. For the first half of the season, Patrick Kane led the team in scoring and points. The Blackhawks mustered a 30\u201315\u20132 record going into the All-Star break. The Blackhawks sent six players to the All-Star Game, including Kane, Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook and Corey Crawford. The team also played in the 2015 Winter Classic at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., where they lost 3\u20132 to the Washington Capitals. However, in late February, Kane suffered a shoulder injury that was expected to sideline him for the remainder of the regular season and much of the playoffs. The team called up rookie Teuvo Teravainen from the AHL, and traded their first-round pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft to acquire center Antoine Vermette from the Arizona Coyotes. The Blackhawks also acquired veteran defenseman Kimmo Timonen from the Philadelphia Flyers for second-round picks in 2015 and 2016, and Andrew Desjardins from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Ben Smith. The Blackhawks finished the season with a 48\u201328\u20136 record, placing third in their division, and allowed the fewest goals in the NHL. Kane recovered quicker than expected, and was ready for the start of the playoffs. The Blackhawks dispatched the Nashville Predators in six games and swept the Minnesota Wild to advance to the conference finals for the fifth time in seven years. The top-seeded Anaheim Ducks held a 3\u20132 lead in the series, but the Blackhawks rallied back in the series to win games six and seven. The team then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2015 Stanley Cup Final to secure their third Stanley Cup in six seasons to solidify themselves as a modern day NHL dynasty.\nThe Blackhawks' roster experienced another dramatic reconstruction before the 2015\u201316 season. The team was unable to come to terms with pending free agent Brandon Saad, who had played a pivotal role in the 2013 and 2015 Stanley Cup championships. The Blackhawks traded Saad's negotiation rights (along with prospects Alex Broadhurst and Michael Paliotta) to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Artem Anisimov, Marko Dano, Corey Tropp, Jeremy Morin and fourth-round draft pick Anatoly Golyshev in the 2016 NHL entry draft. The Blackhawks were unable to re-sign unrestricted free agents veterans Brad Richards, Antoine Vermette and Johnny Oduya due to salary cap constraints. The team then traded longtime veteran and fan-favorite Patrick Sharp (along with Stephen Johns) to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Trevor Daley and forward Ryan Garbutt in order to stay under the salary cap. Amidst the roster turnover, the Blackhawks signed free agent Artemi Panarin from the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) to an entry-level contract. The Blackhawks' offense was led by Patrick Kane, who scored an NHL-best 106 points (46 goals, 60 assists) in all 82 games in 2015\u201316 capturing the Art Ross Trophy as his 46 goals saw him finish as the runner-up for the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy only behind Washington Capitals forward and captain Alexander Ovechkin who scored 50 goals as the league leader. Kane also won the season's Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP, the Ted Lindsay Award as the most outstanding player voted by the Players association. Panarin, who skated on Kane's line, won the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's best first-year player. Midway through the season, the Blackhawks attempted to supplement their roster by making several trades. The Blackhawks dealt Jeremy Morin to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Richard Panik. The team then reacquired Andrew Ladd from the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for their first round selection in the 2016 NHL entry draft and Marko Dano. The team then traded Phillip Danault and their 2018 second-round pick to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for forwards Dale Weise and Tomas Fleischmann. The team finished with a 46\u201326\u20139 record, good for 103 points and third place in their division. The defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks were defeated by the St. Louis Blues in a seven-game series in the first round of the 2016 playoffs. The loss marked the Blackhawks' earliest playoff exit since 2012.\n2016\u20132020: Post-Cup years and retooling.\nSalary cap constraints forced the Blackhawks to make additional trades before the 2016\u201317 season. The team traded pending free agent Andrew Shaw to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for two second-round 2016 draft picks. The Blackhawks also traded Bryan Bickell and Teuvo Teravainen to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for another 2016 second-round pick along with letting Andrew Ladd walk in free agency in order to free additional salary cap space. The Blackhawks brought back veteran defenseman Brian Campbell and signed KHL stand-out Michal Kempny during free agency. The team then turned to their farm system to replenish their depth. The Blackhawks promoted rookies Ryan Hartman, Gustav Forsling, John Hayden, Tyler Motte, Nick Schmaltz and Vinnie Hinostroza to their starting line-up to fill the vacancies left by Ladd, Bickell, Shaw and Teravainen. During the season, Patrick Kane continued to spearhead the Blackhawks offense as he finished with 34 goals and 55 assists for 89 points in all 82 contests played, tying for second in scoring during the regular season among all skaters. He was aided by his linemate, Artemi Panarin, who scored 31 goals and 43 assists for 74 points in all 82 games. In addition to Kane and Panarin, Jonathan Toews, Marian Hossa, Artem Anisimov and Richard Panik all scored at least 20 goals. Toews, Kane, Duncan Keith and Corey Crawford were also selected to play in the All-Star Game. \nAt the trade deadline, the Blackhawks re-acquired Johnny Oduya in a trade with the Dallas Stars in exchange for Mark McNeill and a conditional fourth-round draft pick on 28 February 2017. The Blackhawks finished the season with 109 points, placing first in the Central Division and earning the top-seed in the Western Conference for the 2017 playoffs. However, they were swept in the first round by the eighth-seeded Nashville Predators in one of the biggest upsets in NHL playoff history; this was the first time that an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top team in the conference. Goaltender Pekka Rinne and the Predators' defense marginalized the Blackhawks' offense, limiting the team to only three total goals in the series, including a pair of shutouts in game 1 (1\u20130) and game 2 (5\u20130) at United Center to begin the series.\nPrior to the 2017\u201318 season, the Blackhawks revealed Marian Hossa would miss the entire 2017\u201318 season due to a progressive skin disorder. The team made two major trades before the 2017 NHL entry draft; veteran defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson was dealt to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Connor Murphy and Laurent Dauphin, while Artemi Panarin was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets to reacquire Brandon Saad in a four-player deal. Both Hjalmarsson and Hossa were core members of the Blackhawks roster that won three Stanley Cups in 2010, 2013 and 2015. The team also traded goaltender Scott Darling to the Carolina Hurricanes and center Marcus Kruger to the Vegas Golden Knights, while also lost defensemen Trevor van Riemsdyk to the Golden Knights in the 2017 NHL expansion draft and Brian Campbell, who retired. The Blackhawks also let Andrew Desjardins and Johnny Oduya in free agency. The Blackhawks re-acquired winger Patrick Sharp in free agency while also adding Tommy Wingels and Lance Bouma in free agency. The Blackhawks opened the 2017\u201318 season with a resounding 10\u20131 victory over the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. The Blackhawks were four games above .500 with an 18\u201314\u20136 record at the end of December 2017, and only four points out of a playoff spot. However, goaltender Corey Crawford would sustain an undisclosed upper-body injury (which was later revealed to be a concussion) right before Christmas break, sidelining him for the remainder of the year. Inconsistent defense and goaltending, coupled with limited offense, resulted in the team falling to the bottom of the Central Division. The Blackhawks were eliminated from playoff contention on March 20, 2018, marking the first time in nine years that the team failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team finished the season with a 33\u201339\u201310 record and 76 points in the standings, 19 points out of a playoff spot.\nThe Blackhawks made modest acquisitions during the opening day of free agency in 2018 by acquiring veterans Cam Ward, Chris Kunitz and Brandon Manning. The team made their biggest move of the off-season by offloading Hossa's contract onto the Arizona Coyotes by trading Vinnie Hinostroza, Jordan Oesterle and third-round draft pick in the 2019 draft in exchange for Marcus Kruger, MacKenzie Entwistle, Jordan Maletta, Andrew Campbell and a fifth-round draft pick in the 2019 NHL Draft. Quenneville named Ward the team's starting goaltender as Crawford missed the first five games of the 2018\u201319 season with concussion-like symptoms. The Blackhawks opened the season with a promising 6\u20132\u20132 start despite Crawford's initial absence. However, after losing their next five games, head coach Joel Quenneville (as well as assistant coaches Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson) were fired on November 6, 2018. Jeremy Colliton, previously the head coach of the Blackhawks' AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, was named the 38th head coach in franchise history. The team adjusted their roster by trading Nick Schmaltz to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Dylan Strome and Brendan Perlini. The Blackhawks then dealt Brandon Manning to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Drake Caggiula. The team struggled despite these changes and plummeted to the bottom of the NHL's standings by the All-Star break, but then rebounded with an 18\u201310\u20133 record during the second half of the season, and missed playoffs by six points, while finishing in sixth place in the Central Division. After missing the playoffs for the second straight season, the Blackhawks won the third-overall pick in the 2019 NHL entry draft at the draft lottery, which they used to select Kirby Dach.\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Blackhawks signed center Ryan Carpenter and goaltender Robin Lehner on the opening day of free agency. The team made three separate trades to acquire Olli Maatta, Calvin de Haan and Alex Nylander. The team reacquired fan-favorite Andrew Shaw in a trade with the Montreal Canadiens. The Blackhawks also inserted rookie Dominik Kubalik into their roster, whom they acquired from the Los Angeles Kings in the previous season. Chris Kunitz and Cam Ward retired while the Blackhawks also traded veteran center Artem Anisimov to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Zack Smith and let veteran center Marcus Kr\u00fcger walk in free agency. The Blackhawks posted a 32\u201330\u20138 record and finished last in their division before the remainder of the regular season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team fired John McDonough, who served as the Blackhawks' president for 13 years. The Blackhawks obtained a spot in the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, which used a 24-team playoff format among the top 12 teams in each conference. The 12th-seeded Blackhawks defeated the Edmonton Oilers in the qualifying round of the playoffs to advance to the Western Conference first round, where they lost to the Vegas Golden Knights in five games.\n2020\u20132023: The Toews and Kane era ends.\nThe 2020\u201321 season would be delayed to January 2021 and condensed to 56 games due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Blackhawks signed forwards Mattias Janmark, Lucas Wallmark and Carl Soderberg during free agency to one-year deals. Veteran forward Brandon Saad was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for defensemen Nikita Zadorov and Anton Lindholm. The team's captain, Jonathan Toews, announced he would forgo the season due to an undisclosed medical illness. The Blackhawks parted with longtime goaltender Corey Crawford, who signed with the New Jersey Devils but ultimately retired before the season's start without playing any games for the Devils. Brent Seabrook, the team's veteran defenseman, announced his retirement midway through the season due a lingering hip injury sustained the previous season. Andrew Shaw, who previously rejoined the Blackhawks in 2019, also announced he would retire from playing due to concussions suffered throughout his career. The Blackhawks relied heavily on their rookies during the season to replenish their depth, including forwards Brandon Hagel, Philipp Kurashev and Pius Suter, defensemen Ian Mitchell and Wyatt Kalynuk and goaltender Kevin Lankinen. Despite the roster turnaround, the Blackhawks completed the first half of the season with a 14\u20139\u20135 record and sat in fourth place in their division. The team struggled from mid-March through April, going 8\u201315\u20131, and subsequently traded away Janmark, Wallmark and Soderberg at the trade deadline. The Blackhawks failed to qualify for the playoffs once more and finished in sixth place with a 24\u201325\u20137 record. The Blackhawks named Danny Wirtz, the son of Rocky Wirtz, as their new chief executive officer on December 16, 2020. The team made some significant changes in their front office, promoting the general manager, Stan Bowman, to the role of president of hockey operations, and appointing Jaime Faulkner as the new president of business operations.\nPrior to the 2021\u201322 season, former Blackhawks prospect Kyle Beach alleged he was sexually assaulted by Brad Aldrich, the team's former video coach, during the 2009\u201310 season. Beach filed a lawsuit against the Blackhawks for failing to adequately address Aldrich's wrongdoings or file formal police reports. A separate party, a former high school student whom Aldrich sexually assaulted during his tenure at Houghton High School also filed a lawsuit against the Blackhawks, alleging the team gave a positive reference on behalf of Aldrich and failed to disclose any details about his sexual assault in 2010. The Blackhawks retained law firm Jenner &amp; Block to conduct an internal investigation that spanned 139 interviews over four months. It revealed that the team's brain trust, including team president John McDonough, executive vice president Jay Blunk, general manager Stan Bowman, assistant general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff and head coach Joel Quenneville, met just days before the start of the 2010 Stanley Cup Final and deferred any action on Aldrich until after the Cup Final series. Aldrich was subsequently allowed to quietly resign after taking part in the Stanley Cup victory celebration.\nWithin hours of the report's release on October 26, 2021, Bowman and senior director of hockey operations Al MacIsaac, the only participants in the 2010 meeting still with the Blackhawks, resigned. Assistant general manager Kyle Davidson took over as interim general manager. The NHL also imposed a $2 million fine on the Blackhawks for \"inadequate internal procedures and insufficient and untimely response in the handling of matters related to former video coach Brad Aldrich's employment\". It also stated that most of the participants in the meeting, including McDonough, Bowman, Blunk, and MacIssac, will not be allowed to work in the NHL again without permission from the league office. Quenneville, by then head coach of the Florida Panthers, resigned after meeting with Bettman on October 28, and will also have to meet with Bettman if he wants to work in the league again. Bettman subsequently met with Cheveldayoff, by now the general manager of the Winnipeg Jets, but cleared him of wrongdoing. Bettman stated that he could not \"assign to [Cheveldayoff] responsibility for the Club's actions, or inactions\" because Cheveldayoff was not a member of the Blackhawks' senior leadership team at the time. Aldrich's name was removed from the Stanley Cup, as requested by the team. Beach and the Blackhawks reached an undisclosed settlement on December 15. However, the second lawsuit filed against the Blackhawks by a former high school student was dismissed.\nBefore his resignation, Bowman intended on building a competitive team that could make the playoffs immediately rather than focusing on rebuilding for the future. The team traded veteran defenseman Duncan Keith to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a draft pick and Caleb Jones. The Blackhawks traded Brent Seabrook's contract to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for center Tyler Johnson. The team then acquired Seth Jones from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for two draft picks and prospect Adam Boqvist. The Blackhawks leveraged their open salary cap to acquire reigning Vezina Trophy-winner Marc-Andre Fleury from the Vegas Golden Knights, who were in desperate need of cap relief. The team signed defensemen Jake McCabe and winger Jujhar Khaira in free agency. Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, who had missed the entirety of the previous season due to chronic immune response syndrome, also announced he would return for the 2021\u201322 season.\nOn November 6, Colliton was fired after leading the team to a 1\u20139\u20132 record to start the season, the second-worst in the NHL at the time. Derek King, former Rockford IceHogs head coach, was named his interim replacement. Davidson was formally named the team's general manager on March 1, 2022. The Blackhawks were unable to recover from their poor start and fell out of playoff contention by the trade deadline. The team traded Brandon Hagel to Tampa Bay in exchange for two first-round picks, Boris Katchouk and Taylor Raddysh, while also trading Fleury to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for a second-round pick. The team finished sixth place in Central Division with a 28\u201342\u201312 record. The 2021\u201322 season also marked announcer Pat Foley's final season with the Blackhawks, who had been with the team for 39 years.\nOn June 27, 2022, the Blackhawks named Luke Richardson as their 40th head coach in franchise history. General manager Davidson announced the Blackhawks would commit to rebuilding their roster and acquiring draft capital. The team traded Alex DeBrincat to the Ottawa Senators and Kirby Dach to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for the 7th and 13th picks in the 2022 NHL entry draft. Chicago also acquired the 25th overall pick in the draft from the Toronto Maple Leafs by taking on goaltender Petr Mrazek's contract. The Blackhawks made modest acquisitions in free agency, signing veteran forwards Andreas Athanasiou, Colin Blackwell and Max Domi. The team fell to the bottom of the Central Division and again emerged as sellers at the 2022\u201323 trade deadline. Patrick Kane was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Vili Saarijarvi and Kane was then later sent to the New York Rangers as part of a three-team trade. The Blackhawks received Andy Welinski, a conditional second-round pick in 2023 and a fourth-round pick in 2025 from the Rangers to complete the trade. The Blackhawks also dealt Jake McCabe, Sam Lafferty and Max Domi, while also taking on Nikita Zaitsev's contract from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for additional draft capital. Captain Jonathan Toews missed 29 games while recovering from Long COVID. Before their final regular season game, the team also announced that they would not re-sign Toews. The Blackhawks finished last in their division with the third-worst record in the NHL.\nDanny Wirtz era (2023\u2013present).\n2023\u2013present: Rebuilding and beginning of the Connor Bedard era.\nThe Blackhawks won the 2023 draft lottery and received the first overall pick in the 2023 NHL entry draft. The team drafted Connor Bedard first overall. The Blackhawks subsequently made trades to acquire veteran forwards Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. The team leveraged their excess salary cap space to acquire Josh Bailey and 2026 second-round draft pick from the cap-strapped New York Islanders. Bailey's contract was immediately bought out and he was placed on unconditional waivers. The Blackhawks signed forward Ryan Donato to a two-year, $4 million contact on the opening day of free agency.\nRocky Wirtz unexpectedly died on July 25, 2023, at age 70. Danny Wirtz, his son, was named the chairman and president of Wirtz Corporation, the company that owns the Blackhawks, on July 30. Amidst the transitions in ownership, the Blackhawks continued to struggle on the ice by finishing the 2023\u201324 NHL season with a 23\u201353\u20136 record, marking the second-worst in the NHL and the worst in franchise history since 1974. The team was devastated by injuries to several skaters throughout the season, including Bedard, Hall, Andreas Athanasiou, and Colin Blackwell. The Blackhawks also terminated the contract of Corey Perry, who violated the team's code of conduct policy. Bedard was recipient of Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's top first-year player.\nOn December 5, 2024, the Blackhawks fired Luke Richardson after tallying a league-worst 18 points through the first 26 games of the 2024\u201325 season, naming Anders Sorensen interim head coach.\nTeam information.\nJerseys.\nThe Blackhawks wear predominantly red jerseys featuring three sets of black and white stripes along the sleeves and waist, and white jerseys featuring three sets of alternating black, white and red stripes along the sleeves and waist. The team's logo is displayed on the front of each jersey, along with a \"C\", representing \"Chicago\", on each shoulder with two crossed tomahawks. The Blackhawks debuted this design in 1955, and have since only made minor modifications to the jersey. In 2007, the Blackhawks along with all other NHL teams, made minute changes to their uniforms by adding larger logo, a new collar with the NHL logo and a \"baseball-style cut\" along the bottom. The team previously donned alternate third jersey that was primarily black with red and white stripes between 1996 and 2007. The Blackhawks brought this design back in 2008, before making their 2009 Winter Classic jerseys their alternates between 2009 and 2011. After the 2019 Winter Classic, the Blackhawks made their jersey from the game their alternate, wearing it for three more games in 2019 and in three games during the 2019\u201320 season.\nThe Blackhawks' uniform was voted 1 of the 25 best in professional sports by Paul Lukas of \"GQ\" in November 2004. \"The Hockey News\" voted the team's jersey as the best in the NHL. Greg Wyshynski of Yahoo! Sports listed the Blackhawks home jerseys as the second best NHL jersey in the history of the NHL in 2017. The Blackhawks were voted to have the best uniform in the history of the NHL in a fan-vote conducted by the NHL in 2017.\nSince 2009, the Blackhawks have worn special camouflage jerseys on Veterans Day during their pregame warm-ups. The jerseys are later sold in auctions to raise money for the USO of Illinois.\nThe Blackhawks wore jerseys based on the design worn in the 1936\u201337 season for the 2009 Winter Classic. The jersey is predominantly black with a large beige stripe across the chest (also on the sleeves), with a red border, and an old-style circular Black Hawks logo. The Blackhawks used this Winter Classic design as their third jersey for the 2009\u201310 season until they retired it after the 2010\u201311 season, with the only change in the design being the addition of the familiar \"C\" with crossed tomahawks on the shoulders.\nFor the 2014 Stadium Series, the Blackhawks wore a black uniform similar to the alternates they wore from 1996 to 2009, but the stripes around the waist are no longer straight, they are jagged around the sides in order to follow the shape of the bottom of the jersey. Keeping with stripes, the ones on the arms simply stop halfway round; angled numbers are above these sleeve half-stripes. On one shoulder is the familiar \"C\" with crossed tomahawks logo and the Chicago 2014 Stadium Series logo on the other. Each 2014 Stadium Series jerseys features chrome-treated logo designs inspired by the NHL shield. The chrome crest was developed using new technology that fuses print and embroidery and allows logos to be displayed as a high-resolution image incorporated into the crest. As a result, the design reduces the weight of the crest, creating in a lighter jersey. Numbering on the back of the jersey is enlarged and sleeve numbers are angled to improve visibility in outdoor venues.\nThe team wore a uniform which was inspired by their 1957\u201358 jersey for the 2015 Winter Classic. This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. The main differences between this design and the current road design come in the form of the lace-up collar, the name/number block font (which is serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white (with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black and white.\nFor the 2016 Stadium Series, the Blackhawks wore a unique uniform for their game against the Minnesota Wild. This uniform is primarily white with black/red/black stripes on the sleeves and socks. The current logo is on the chest. Framed between the two black stripes and over the red stripe on the sleeve is the familiar \"C\" with crossed tomahawks. The collar of the uniform features two different colors. The four, six-pointed red stars from the Flag of Chicago is featured on the white portion of the collar, while the other side of the collar is black. Sleeve numbers have been shifted to the shoulders and enlarged. With the shoulders being black, the numbering is white. But, the numbering and lettering on the back is also enlarged and black in color.\nFor the 2017 Winter Classic, the Blackhawks wore uniforms very similar to what they wore at the 2015 Winter Classic. These new uniforms however feature a few modifications that were made to them. The most notable changes are to the logo and the cross tomahawks. The logo this time is the appropriate logo that the franchise used in 1957\u20131965, but they removed the roundel and the lettering so that just the logo itself stands out. The placement of the familiar \"C\" with crossed tomahawks is featured in the same position with the same striping pattern on the sleeve as the 2015 Winter Classic uniform had. The only differences between the tomahawks from the 2015 Winter Classic uniform and the 2017 Winter Classic uniform are where the colors are placed for the tomahawk. The 2017 Winter Classic patch is featured on the right shoulder.\nTo honor the NHL's centennial year, a special anniversary logo was designed for the remainder of the 2016\u201317 season, which started on January 1, 2017, for all thirty teams, featuring a banner wrapped around the number 100 with the current NHL shield in the foreground. Both the banner and the number 100 are in same silver color as the NHL shield. The Blackhawks wore this logo patch underneath the numbering on the right-sleeve on both the home and away jerseys. The Blackhawks debuted this patch on their home jerseys on January 5, 2017, and then they debuted the patch on the away jerseys on January 13, 2017. All home and away jerseys for all 30 teams will continue to have patches of the NHL's centennial emblem for the 2017\u201318 season, located above or below the numbers on their right sleeves, for at least up to the playing of the NHL 100 Classic on December 16, 2017.\nAdidas signed an agreement with the NHL to be the official outfitter of uniforms and licensed apparel for all teams, starting with the 2017\u201318 season, replacing Reebok. The Reebok \"Edge\" template was retired in favor of the Adidas' \"ADIZERO\" template. The home and away uniforms that were debuted in the 2007\u201308 season remain nearly identical with the exception of the new Adidas ADIZERO template and the new collar. With the new collar, the NHL shield remains but is no longer placed on a lower layer with flaps nearby, as it's now front and center on a pentagon with a new \"Chrome Flex\" style. The waist stripes are now curved instead of being straight across. The Adidas logo replaces the Reebok logo on the back collar.\nFor the entire 2018\u201319 season, on both the home and away uniforms, the Blackhawks wore memorial patches in remembrance of Stan Mikita, who died on August 7, 2018. The memorial patch featured 21 in white on a black circle that is placed on the upper left corner on the front side of the uniform.\nFor the 2019 Winter Classic, the Blackhawks wore uniforms similar to what they wore from the 1926\u201327 season to the 1934\u201335 season. The black and white uniform features the black and white Native American head logo on a black and white roundel with the wording \"Blackhawks\" arched on top and \"Chicago\" arched below. The Native American head logo inside the roundel features the 1999\u20132000 native American head logo that they currently wear. The uniform has four white stripes on each of the shoulders, and five white stripes of varying thickness on each sleeve and around the waist. Inside the collar, we see several diagonal white lines, which is a nod to the end zone design used at Notre Dame Stadium. Mixed in between these white lines are the six years written in red, the six years the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, 2013 and 2015. After the 2019 Winter Classic, the team announced that uniforms from the game would be worn in three home games of the 2018\u201319 season.\nFor the 2019\u201320 season, the home and away uniforms that were unveiled for the 2017\u201318 season remain nearly identical with the exception of the new collar designs. The new collar on the home uniform transitions from white to a solid red on the front as it comes over the shoulder, leading into the NHL logo with a red background in the center. The new collar on the away uniform transitions from red to a solid white on the front as it comes over the shoulder, leading into the NHL logo with a white background in the center.\nBeginning with the 2020\u201321 season, the NHL allowed for advertising on its gameday uniforms for the first time, starting with helmet ads. The Blackhawks' first helmet ad sponsor was United Airlines.\nFor the 2020\u201321 NHL season, the Blackhawks would wear \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniforms. The design was largely inspired from the team's 1940s uniforms save for the \"barber-pole\" elements. A second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, based on their 1938 uniform. Across the chest is \"CHICAGO\" in white with red trim, inspired by the 2019 Winter Classic crest and the current Blackhawks primary logo is added as a shoulder patch on the left side.\nStarting with the 2021\u201322 NHL regular season, Adidas introduced new environmentally-friendly uniforms for all teams with its Adidas ADIZERO Primegreen Authentic template. The template is made with a minimum of 50% recycled content while still retaining their high-performance materials. Each team uniform will maintain its classic stripping and logo, while boasting dimensional embroidery that draws attention to their sustainable materials, and a two-layer twill that underscores the product's authenticity. For the Blackhawks, the logo on their uniforms now feature raised markings on the face of their logo, the forehead lines, the eyebrow and eye, as well as the facepaint are all now raised rather than flat as it had been before.\nFor the entire 2021\u201322 season, on both the home and away uniforms, the Blackhawks wore memorial patches in remembrance of Tony Esposito, who died on August 10, 2021. The memorial patch features 35 in white on a black circle that is placed on the upper left corner on the front side of the uniform.\nFor the entire 2023\u201324 season, on both the home and away uniforms, the Blackhawks are wearing memorial patches in remembrance of Rocky Wirtz, who died on July 25, 2023. The memorial patch features \"ROCKY\" in white on a black circle that is placed on the upper left corner on the front side of the uniform.\nStarting with the 2024\u201325 season, Fanatics debuted the Authentic Pro NHL on-ice uniforms that replaces Adidas. As part of the new uniform design, there will be an additional layer of fabric inside the lower sleeve to reduce wear caused by friction against the boards. The NHL Shield has a new special hologram finish on the front collar, and Fanatics branding is embroidered on the back neck of the uniform. The Blackhawks announced a multi-year partnership with Circa Sports in June 2024, making them the official jersey patch sponsor for the team's home red uniforms.\nThe Blackhawks wore retro-inspired red uniforms for the 2025 Winter Classic, which incorporated a lace-up collar. The crest featured the current Blackhawks logo inside a black roundel, which contained two red six-point stars on each side (a nod to the flag of Chicago), the team name on top and the city name at the bottom. The alternating black and white chest and sleeve striping is based on the current red uniform's tail striping, and the back cream numbers featured subtle pinstripes as homage to Wrigley Field's main tenants, the Chicago Cubs.\nFor the team's 2025\u201326 centennial season, the Blackhawks modified their current red home uniforms, adding lace-up collars and gold trim around the crest and back numbers. The 100th anniversary patch replaced the \"crossing tomahawks\" patch on the right shoulder. This uniform will only be worn on every home game for that particular season. Also during the season, the alternate black uniform they previously wore from 1996 to 2007 and in the 2008\u201309 season was brought back.\nLogo.\nIrene Castle, McLaughlin's wife, designed the original version of the team's logo, which featured a crudely drawn black and white Native head in a circle. Castle, the original designer, was white. This design went through several significant changes between 1926 and 1955. During this period, seven distinct versions of the primary logo were worn on the team's uniforms. At the beginning of the 1955\u201356 season, the outer circle was removed and the head began to resemble the team's current primary logo. This crest and uniform went through subtle changes until the 1964\u201365 season; the basic logo and jersey design have remained constant ever since. In 2008, \"The Hockey News\"' staff voted the team's main logo to be the best in the NHL. In 2010, sports columnist Damien Cox called on the franchise to retire the \"racially insensitive\" logo, saying that, \"Clearly, no right-thinking person would name a team after an aboriginal figure these days any more than they would use Muslims or Africans or Chinese or any ethnic group to depict a specific sporting notion.\" Furthermore, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) believes that all Native-themed logos, including that of the Blackhawks, \"continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were common place.\"\nIn 2019, the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate \"with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of 'Indian' mascots.\" The AIC noted in its statement that they \"previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship\" and stated that \"going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\"\nOn July 7, 2020, the Blackhawks issued a press release to defend their team's name and logo. The team stated, \"The Chicago Blackhawks name and logo symbolizes an important and historic person, Black Hawk of Illinois' Sac &amp; Fox Nation, whose leadership and life has inspired generations of Native Americans, veterans and the public.\" The Blackhawks further stated they would \"expand awareness\" of Black Hawk and all Indigenous American contributions. The press release came after other American professional sports teams, including the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians, changed their names and logos.\nThe National Congress of American Indians, The American Indian Center of Chicago, The Chi-Nations Youth Council and over 1,500 Native organizations and advocates from over 150 federally recognized tribes across the country, including members of the Sac and Fox Nation, support changing the team name and logo. Members of Black Hawk's family, including April Holder (Sauk and Fox, Wichita, Tonkawa), a direct descendant of Black Hawk, have also spoken out calling on the team to change its name and logo and to stop profiting off Black Hawk's name, image, and legacy.\nThe Chi-Nations Youth Council (CNYC), an Indigenous youth organization in Chicago, has said \"The Chicago Blackhawks name and logo symbolizes a legacy of imperialism and genocide.\" \"As statutes (sic) of invaders, slave holders, and white supremacists fall across the nation so too should the images and language of the savage and dead 'Indians'.\" CNYC also noted \"As social consciousness has grown over the past decades so has the Blackhawks performative gestures of buying their reprieve from those willing to sell out the health and humanity of our future generations.\"\nMascot.\nThe Blackhawks mascot is Tommy Hawk, an anthropomorphic black hawk who wears the Blackhawks' four feathers on his head, along with a Blackhawks jersey and hockey pants. Tommy Hawk often participates in the T-shirt toss and puck chuck at the United Center. He walks around the concourse greeting fans before and during the game. The team introduced Tommy Hawk in the 2001\u201302 season. Tommy Hawk was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2019.\nPractice facilities.\nThe Blackhawks practice facility, the Fifth Third Arena (previously named MB Ice Arena prior to May 2019), is located in Chicago's Near West Side. The facility opened in 2017 and cost $65 million to construct. The Fifth Third Arena also serves as a community center and hosts youth, high school, and adult hockey and ice skating programs, and in 2026, will serve as the home of the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League following an expansion of the arena.\nThe Blackhawks had previously used Johnny's Ice House West and The Edge Ice Arena in suburban Bensenville (the latter also previously used by the Steel) as their practice facility.\nCircus trip.\nThe Blackhawks and their arena mates, the Chicago Bulls, embarked on an annual two-week road trip in mid-November dating back to when both teams inhabited Chicago Stadium. The Wirtz Family, who at one point owned the Blackhawks, Bulls, and Chicago Stadium, would lease the venue to circus acts and ice skating troupes. The Blackhawks played between six and seven games in western Canada and California during this time. In November 2016, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus announced they would not return to the United Center in 2017. As a result, Disney on Ice performed its last two week show in 2017 before being condensed to one week in 2018.\nMedia and announcers.\nFor the first time in team history, all 82 games plus playoffs were broadcast on television during the 2008\u201309 season. At least 20 of them aired on WGN-TV (Channel 9), the first time the Blackhawks had been seen on local over-the-air television in 30 years. Games produced by WGN-TV through its WGN Sports department are not available in its superstation feed WGN America due to league broadcast rights restrictions. Other games not broadcast by WGN-TV are aired on NBC Sports Chicago, the first time in at least 35 years that non-nationally broadcast home games were seen locally, either over-the-air or on cable. On February 15, 2011, it was announced that the team had renewed their broadcast contract with WGN-TV for the next five years, starting in the 2011\u201312 NHL season. The deal was further extended for three more years on May 15, 2014, keeping the team on Channel 9 until the end of the 2018\u201319 season. On January 2, 2019, the Blackhawks (along with the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox) agreed to an exclusive multi-year deal with NBC Sports Chicago beginning with the 2019\u201320 season, ending the team's broadcasts on WGN-TV. On June 5, 2024, the Blackhawks, Bulls, and White Sox announced they would join the newly established Chicago Sports Network.\nRadio broadcasts since the 1970s and into the mid-2000s varied between WBBM (780) and WMAQ/WSCR (670). Both frequencies are 50,000-watt clear channel stations that allowed the Blackhawks to be heard across the country at night, but Blackhawks games often came into conflict with White Sox baseball by the start of April. On April 30, 2008, the team signed a three-year deal with WGN Radio (720 AM), another 50,000-watt station, with games airing alternately instead on WIND (560 AM) in scheduling conflict situations during the baseball season due to the Cubs having contractual preference to air on WGN; these moved to WGWG-LP (Channel 6/87.7 FM, an analog television station carrying an audio-only sports talk format using a quirk in the FM band) in mid-2014 when Tribune began a local marketing agreement with that station's owner. During the 2010 Stanley Cup Final, the Cubs agreed to allow the Blackhawks games to be broadcast on WGN and have the Cubs revert to WIND when there was a conflict. This allowed the Cup Final's games to be heard over a larger area due to WGN's clear-channel signal. All Blackhawk games are also streamed live on wgnradio.com, regardless of whether the games are on WGN or WGWG-LP. WLUP-FM (97.9 FM) was also utilized as an alternate station.\nAs of the 2024\u201325 season, Rick Ball and John Wiedeman call play-by-play on television and radio, respectively. Darren Pang and Troy Murray serve as the TV and radio color commentator respectively, with Caley Chelios providing occasional game analysis and other content on various media.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Blackhawks.

In addition to players and builders, the team recognizes an affiliation with three broadcasters who were awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Lloyd Pettit, a sportscaster, was the first Blackhawks broadcaster to receive the award, in 1986. Other Blackhawks broadcasters awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award include Pat Foley (awarded in 2014).

{"id": "73128", "revid": "19992876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73128", "title": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "text": "National Hockey League team in Ohio, United States\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets (colloquially known as the Jackets) are a professional ice hockey team based in Columbus, Ohio. The Blue Jackets compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The franchise began play as an expansion team in 2000.\nThe franchise struggled in their initial years, failing to win 30 games in a season until 2005\u201306. The team qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 2009, but were swept by the Detroit Red Wings in the first round. Columbus did not win a playoff game until the 2014 playoffs, and won their first (and only) playoff series in 2019 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the first team in NHL history to sweep a Presidents' Trophy winner in the first round. Along with the Seattle Kraken (started play in 2021) and Utah Mammoth (2024), the Blue Jackets are one of only three teams in the league who have yet to appear in the conference finals.\nThe Blue Jackets' name and logos are inspired by Ohio's Civil War history. The Blue Jackets play their home games at Nationwide Arena in downtown Columbus, which opened in 2000. They are affiliated with the Cleveland Monsters of the AHL.\nHistory.\nBuilding a new franchise (1997\u20132000).\nPrior to the establishment of the Blue Jackets, the last NHL team in the state of Ohio was the Cleveland Barons, who played from 1976 to 1978. In Columbus, the Blue Jackets replaced the Columbus Chill of the ECHL, who played in the city from 1991 to 1999. The Chill played at the Ohio Expo Center Coliseum, where they set a minor league hockey record by selling out 83 consecutive games.\nIn November 1996, five investors formed a partnership called Columbus Hockey Limited, who then submitted an application and a $100,000 fee to the NHL office. The voters of Columbus were considering a referendum to build a publicly financed arena, a major step toward approval of their NHL bid. When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus to meet with the community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern that the voters might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman that they would not be willing to foot the bill for the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.\nColumbus' hopes for the bid dimmed when the May referendum failed. However, Nationwide announced on May 31, 1997, that it would finance the $150-million arena. Subsequently, on June 25, 1997, the NHL announced that Columbus would receive a new franchise. Afterwards a \"Name the Team\" contest was held with the help of Wendy's throughout central Ohio during the month of August 1997. The franchise received 14,000 entries and, with help from the NHL, narrowed the list down to 10 names. Then, with the information received from owner McConnell regarding Columbus' history, the league and the franchise narrowed the list of potential names down to two \u2013 Blue Jackets and Justice. The former, which referenced Ohio's contributions to the American Civil War, was eventually announced as the team name in November.\nOn June 23, 2000, the NHL's two newest teams, the Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild, took part in the 2000 NHL expansion draft in Calgary. Under the draft's rules, 26 of the NHL's active 28 teams were allowed to protect one goaltender, five defensemen, and nine forwards, or two goaltenders, three defensemen, and seven forwards. The Atlanta Thrashers and Nashville Predators both had their full rosters protected because they were the two newest teams, only being in existence for one and two years, respectively. Both the Blue Jackets and Wild had to use their first 24 selections on three goaltenders, eight defensemen, and thirteen forwards. Their final two picks could be players of any position.\nWith the first-overall choice, the Blue Jackets selected goaltender Rick Tabaracci from the Colorado Avalanche. Over the course of the draft, Columbus picked up goaltender Dwayne Roloson, defensemen Lyle Odelein and Mathieu Schneider, and forwards Geoff Sanderson, Turner Stevenson and Dallas Drake, among others. Instead of joining Columbus, Roloson signed with the American Hockey League's Worcester IceCats, Schneider left for the Los Angeles Kings, and the St. Louis Blues signed Drake. Columbus also traded Stevenson to the New Jersey Devils to complete an earlier transaction.\nThe Blue Jackets and Wild were granted concessions by some franchises who could not protect their full rosters. The San Jose Sharks traded Jan Caloun, a ninth-round pick in the 2000 NHL entry draft, and a 2001 conditional pick to Columbus; in return, the Blue Jackets agreed not to select the Sharks' unprotected goaltender Evgeni Nabokov. On June 24, at the 2000 NHL entry draft, Columbus selected Rostislav Klesla fourth overall.\nEarly years (2000\u20132005).\nThe Blue Jackets played their first regular season game on October 7, 2000, a 5\u20133 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. Bruce Gardiner scored the franchise's first goal. Columbus finished with a 28\u201339\u20139\u20136 record for 71 points, last in the Central Division, and failed to qualify for the playoffs. Geoff Sanderson became the first player in team history to score 30 goals. Ron Tugnutt, who was signed in the summer of 2000, supplied solid goaltending with 22 wins, which tied the 74-year-old NHL record for wins by an expansion-team goaltender (New York Rangers' Lorne Chabot also had 22 wins in 1926\u201327).\nThe Blue Jackets finished next-to-last in the NHL in the following season, with only 57 points. Ray Whitney, acquired from the Florida Panthers the previous season, led the team in scoring with 61 points, setting a franchise record. Tragedy struck the Blue Jackets organization in March 2002 when 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil was killed after a deflected puck shot by Espen Knutsen struck her in the head while she was in the stands at Nationwide Arena. As a result of her death, large nylon mesh nets were installed behind the goals in all NHL arenas to shield spectators from pucks going over the glass. The team also wore small red hearts with the initials \"BNC\" on their helmets.\nDuring the off-season, the Blue Jackets traded a second-round draft pick (32nd overall) and Ron Tugnutt to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Dallas' first-round pick (20th overall) in the 2002 NHL entry draft. On the morning of the draft, Columbus traded the third-overall pick and the option to flip draft spots in 2003 to the Florida Panthers; in return, Columbus received the first-overall pick, which they used to select Rick Nash.\nThe 2002\u201303 season started with Columbus putting up a 7\u20135\u20131\u20131 record after the first 14 games. However, as expectations from their fans grew higher, the team came back to mediocrity, finishing last in the Central Division for the third consecutive season with 69 points and missing the playoffs once again. Dave King, who had been the team's head coach since their debut in 2000, was fired mid-season and replaced by general manager Doug MacLean. Marc Denis was named starting goaltender; he played a franchise-record 77 games that season and set a league record with 4,511 minutes played in 2002\u201303. He tied for second all-time for games played in a season by a goaltender, just two shy of the league record held by St. Louis Blues' Grant Fuhr in the 1995\u201396 season.\nThe 2003\u201304 season was another losing season for the Blue Jackets despite key additions in the off-season. Checking center Todd Marchant was signed to a five-year contract in July from the Edmonton Oilers. Defenseman Darryl Sydor, known to play strong offense as well, was acquired from the Dallas Stars for Mike Sillinger and a draft pick. MacLean stepped aside as head coach midway through the season, giving way to Gerard Gallant. The Blue Jackets finished with just 62 points (the second-lowest total in their short history), but it was enough to help them break out of last place in the Central Division for the first time, finishing ahead of the Chicago Blackhawks. Nash was one of the few bright spots for the team; his 41 goals tied Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk for the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy (as League leader in goals scored).\nIn the 2004 off-season, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) and NHL administration failed to renew their collective bargaining agreement. September 14, 2004, marked the beginning of the lockout of the 2004\u201305 season. No games were played and the Stanley Cup was not awarded for the first time since the flu epidemic of 1919. An agreement was made on July 13, 2005, and the lockout officially ended nine days later on July 22, 2005.\nNash era and rebuilding (2005\u20132012).\nIn the summer of 2005, rugged Colorado Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote agreed to a three-year deal with the team. Heading into the 2005\u201306 season, it appeared the Blue Jackets would finally take the next step and make the playoffs. Instead, injuries to Rick Nash, Rostislav Klesla and Gilbert Brule, the team's 2005 first-round pick, led to the team putting up a dismal 9\u201325\u20131 record through its first 35 games. Superstar Sergei Fedorov was acquired from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim; Anaheim received Tyler Wright and Francois Beauchemin, and later claimed Todd Marchant off waivers. While again failing to make the playoffs, Columbus did manage to improve. They had the best overtime record in the NHL (14\u20134) and finished the season with franchise records for wins (35) and points (74). For the first time ever, they earned a third-place finish in the Central Division, behind Detroit and Nashville.\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw several changes made to the team. In the off-season, Marc Denis was dealt to the Tampa Bay Lightning for forward Fredrik Modin and goaltender Fredrik Norrena, making way for Pascal Leclaire to take the starting job. The Blue Jackets also signed Anson Carter when it looked as if Nikolay Zherdev would be playing the season in Russia; in late September, however, Zherdev and general manager Doug MacLean were able to reach a compromise. Partway through the season, on November 13, 2006, Gerard Gallant was relieved of his duties as head coach. The next day, Gary Agnew was named his interim replacement. On November 22, Ken Hitchcock, former coach of the Dallas Stars and Philadelphia Flyers, was named the new head coach, effective the following day. Under Hitchcock's first year, two milestones were set: on December 10, 2006, the Blue Jackets scored a team-record five power-play goals in a 6\u20132 win over the Ottawa Senators, and on April 3, 2007, the Blue Jackets broke the modern-day record for most times being shut-out in a season (16) with a 3\u20130 loss to the Detroit Red Wings.\nOn April 18, 2007, Doug MacLean, the team's first general manager and president, was fired after nine years and six seasons at the helm without a playoff berth. Mike Priest, president of Blue Jackets parent company JMAC, Inc., was named president of the club, while Assistant general manager Jim Clark served as general manager until the Blue Jackets named Edmonton Oilers Assistant general manager Scott Howson as the new general manager on June 15, 2007. On October 4, 2007, the Blue Jackets announced their affiliation with the Elmira Jackals, which replaced their former affiliation with the Dayton Bombers as the club's ECHL affiliate.\nThe 2007\u201308 season, the club's first full season under Hitchcock, started off well as the Jackets got off to their best start in franchise history, starting with a 4\u20130 shutout of the defending Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks. At the trade deadline on February 26, 2008, however, apparently unable to agree on a new contract and amid some controversy, Blue Jackets captain Adam Foote requested a trade to the Colorado Avalanche, which was granted. The Blue Jackets received a pair of conditional picks in return. A few weeks later, on March 12, 2008, former Blue Jackets number-one draft pick Rick Nash was named the new team captain. Despite this, Columbus managed its best season record to date, staying above a .500 game wins average until the final game of the season and finishing fourth in the Central Division with 80 points. After the season, Nash was announced as the cover player for the \"NHL 2K9\" video game by Take-Two Interactive.\nAt the 2008 NHL entry draft, the Blue Jackets selected Nikita Filatov with the sixth overall pick. They also traded away the 19th overall pick (acquired from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Adam Foote) for R. J. Umberger. The Blue Jackets made many trades in the 2008 off-season. Gilbert Brule was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for Raffi Torres. Enigmatic forward Nikolay Zherdev and Dan Fritsche were traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for defensemen Fedor Tyutin and Christian Backman. The Blue Jackets also signed free agents Kristian Huselius and Mike Commodore to multi-year contracts. On July 9, 2008, the Blue Jackets announced they signed Hitchcock to a three-year extension to remain as head coach.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, the Blue Jackets made two trades which greatly played to their benefit. Forward Jason Williams was acquired from the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for defenseman Clay Wilson and a sixth-round draft pick. The Blue Jackets were also involved with the first major deal of the 2009 NHL trade deadline, by trading goaltender Pascal Leclaire and a second-round draft pick to the Ottawa Senators for skilled center Antoine Vermette. The changes in scenery benefited both players and the Jackets; Williams scored 28 points in his first 36 games as a Jacket, while Vermette scored 11 points in his first 14 games with the team. Rick Nash scored 79 points throughout the season, setting a franchise record.\nOn April 8, 2009, the Columbus Blue Jackets secured the first Stanley Cup playoff berth in the franchise's eight-year history with a 4\u20133 shootout win over the Chicago Blackhawks. However, they were swept in the first round by the Detroit Red Wings in four games, and would not qualify for the playoffs for the next four seasons. With 21 games remaining and sitting four points out of eighth in the Western Conference, the Blue Jackets dealt long time defenseman Rostislav Klesla and Dane Byers to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Scottie Upshall and Sami Lepisto at the trade deadline on February 28, 2011.\nIn the 2011 off-season, in an attempt to make a serious playoff run, the Blue Jackets traded 2007 first-round pick Jakub Voracek, their 2011 first-round pick (Sean Couturier) and a third-round pick (Nick Cousins) to the Philadelphia Flyers for All-Star center Jeff Carter. They also signed several free agents: James Wisniewski, Vaclav Prospal and Radek Martinek. However, after a disastrous start to the 2011\u201312 season that saw the firing of head coach Scott Arniel, Carter was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for Jack Johnson and a conditional first-round pick after playing just 39 games with the Blue Jackets. The Blue Jackets also traded veteran centers Antoine Vermette and Samuel Pahlsson for goaltender Curtis McElhinney and several draft picks at the trade deadline. There was also heavy speculation that captain Rick Nash would be traded at the deadline. Although Nash was not traded, general manager Scott Howson publicly announced that he had privately requested a trade, a move that has stirred up much controversy. Nash was eventually traded to the New York Rangers on July 23, 2012, for Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, prospect Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick. At the 2012 NHL entry draft, the Blue Jackets traded their second and fourth round picks to the Philadelphia Flyers for the eventual winner of the Vezina Trophy, goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky (2012\u201313).\nThe 2012\u201313 lockout and season saw changes to the executive and front office of the organization. John Davidson was named as president of hockey operations for the Blue Jackets on October 24. On February 12, Scott Howson was relieved of his duties as general manager. Jarmo Kekalainen, who had previously worked with Davidson in St. Louis, was hired away from Jokerit of the Finnish SM-liiga to be the new general manager becoming the first European born general manager in the NHL. The Blue Jackets then traded for All-Star forward Marian Gaborik. The Blue Jackets just missed the playoffs via a tiebreaker against the Minnesota Wild, who had more regulation and overtime wins (ROW).\nThe Kekalainen years (2013\u20132024).\nMove into the Eastern Conference.\nThe Blue Jackets moved into the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference in the 2013\u201314 season after spending its first 13 seasons in the Central Division of the Western Conference. The other teams in the Metropolitan Division consist of the Carolina Hurricanes, New Jersey Devils, New York Islanders, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals, the latter six of which once composed the old Patrick Division. On April 9, 2014, the Blue Jackets clinched their second playoff spot in franchise history by winning a 3\u20131 game against the Dallas Stars. This game was also noted for being a game resumed after being postponed on March 10, 2014, due to Rich Peverley's cardiac event in which the Blue Jackets led 1\u20130. The NHL decided to keep the goal scored by Nathan Horton and resumed the game with a full 60 minutes. Nathan Horton made history by being credited for scoring a goal while not suiting up for the game.\nThe Blue Jackets faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs. This series had a trend that was noted for making 3\u20131 leads end up as 4\u20133 loss. Games 1 and 2 were at the Consol Energy Center in downtown Pittsburgh. The Blue Jackets made a large jump in history when Jack Johnson scored the first goal of the game. This was the first time in franchise history that Columbus ever led a postseason game. The Jackets lead the game 3\u20131 at one point from goals by Mark Letestu and Derek MacKenzie. However, the Penguins rallied to win it 4\u20133. Game 2 was the opposite. Pittsburgh led 3\u20131 at one point, but Columbus rallied to win game 2 4\u20133 by an overtime goal from Matt Calvert. This was the first playoff victory in franchise history. Pittsburgh won game 3 by a score of 4\u20133. Game 4 was a memorable night at Nationwide Arena. Columbus was down 3\u20130, and 3\u20131 by the end of the first period. Boone Jenner and Ryan Johansen scored to make it 3\u20132 by the end of the second period. Brandon Dubinsky scored the game-tying goal with 22.5 seconds left in regulation, after a miss-play with the puck by Marc-Andre Fleury. Nick Foligno went on to score the game-winning goal in overtime. In the locker room during intermission, he supposedly told the team that he will score the game-winner. Pittsburgh, however, went on to win the next two games and took the best-of-seven series in six games.\nThe 2014\u201315 season was most notable for the number of injuries the Jackets incurred. The Jackets lead the league in man-games lost with 502. At one point, the injured reserve list consisted of 15 players, including stars Sergei Bobrovsky, Brandon Dubinsky, Jack Johnson, and Ryan Murray. When the team's injured players began to return in late February, they were able to accumulate wins the way they had the previous two seasons and in the process, set a franchise record earning nine consecutive wins. However, the Blue Jackets still finished fifth in the Metropolitan Division and missed the playoffs by nine points despite a 42\u201335\u20135 record. On May 20, 2015, Nick Foligno was named the sixth captain in team history. The position had been vacant since Rick Nash was traded to the New York Rangers in July 2012. On June 30, 2015, the Jackets traded centers Marko Dano and Artem Anisimov, along with wingers Jeremy Morin and Corey Tropp, to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Brandon Saad. This move was the subject of much controversy in Chicago since Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman had publicly said that Saad was going to be a part of the organization for many years to come. The Jackets also acquired Michael Paliotta and Alex Broadhurst in the trade. The Jackets signed center Gregory Campbell from the Boston Bruins a few days later.\nTortorella era (2015\u20132021).\nThe Blue Jackets initially went into the 2015\u201316 season with high expectations. However, the team got off to an inauspicious start by losing their first eight regular season games in regulation, the second longest losing streak to start a season in NHL history. This prompted the Jackets to fire head coach Todd Richards and hire John Tortorella in his place. On January 6, 2016, the Blue Jackets traded Ryan Johansen to the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenseman Seth Jones. The Blue Jackets record at the end of the season was 34\u201340\u20138, and were ranked 27th overall in the NHL. They closed out the season on a high note, however, as they won the season finale against the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, overcoming a 3\u20130 deficit after the first period to win 5\u20134 in overtime.\nThe Blue Jackets set three franchise records during the 2016\u201317 season. On November 4, 2016, the Blue Jackets scored a franchise-record ten goals in a 10\u20130 shutout win against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the first team to do so since 2011 (when the St. Louis Blues beat the Detroit Red Wings 10\u20133). In mid-November, the Blue Jackets got a franchise record seventh consecutive win at home. During a franchise-record 16-game win streak that started in late November, Tortorella recorded his 500th career win in a 4\u20133 Blue Jackets overtime win on the road against the Vancouver Canucks, becoming the first American-born head coach to reach 500 wins. The team had a record of 14\u20130\u20130 in December. The team's win streak ended in early January when they lost 5\u20130 to the Washington Capitals. The win streak was the second longest in NHL history behind the 1992\u201393 Pittsburgh Penguins' 17 consecutive games. The team finished with a record of 50\u201324\u20138 and 108 points, setting a franchise record.\nDuring the first round of the 2017 playoffs, the Blue Jackets were placed in a matchup against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team lost three straight games to begin the series, but won the fourth game to save themselves from elimination. This game in which they won 5\u20134 marked the Blue Jackets' first regulation win in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Despite this, they would ultimately lose the series in five games. In the following off-season, on June 23, 2017, the Jackets made another deal with the Blackhawks sending Brandon Saad back to Chicago for Artemi Panarin and Tyler Motte.\nThe Blue Jackets returned to the playoffs in 2018 as a wild card qualifier, going in back-to-back years for the first time. There they faced the Metropolitan Division champion Washington Capitals in the first round, winning the first two games in overtime and their first series lead. However, they lost the next four games and the series in six games.\nIn 2019, the Blue Jackets, with expiring contracts, went all-in at the trade deadline, acquiring Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel, along with several other players. They qualified for the 2019 playoffs as the second wild card, where they swept the Presidents' Trophy winner Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round to win their first ever playoff series, but lost their second round series in six games to the Boston Bruins. The Blue Jackets would then lose long-time starting goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, Matt Duchene, and the team's leader in points, Artemi Panarin, in free agency during the 2019 off-season.\nOn March 12, 2020, the 2019\u201320 season was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the remainder of the regular season being officially canceled on May 26. On August 1, the season would resume and follow a 24-team playoff format. The Blue Jackets advanced to the playoffs after defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games in the qualifying round. The Blue Jackets then faced the Tampa Bay Lightning in a first round rematch of last season. They lost game 1 in the fifth overtime period, and went on to lose the series in five games.\nDuring the 2020 off-season, star forward Pierre-Luc Dubois signed a two-year extension with the Blue Jackets but would later request a trade from the team. The shortened 56-game 2020\u201321 season saw the Blue Jackets placed and struggle in the Central Division, under the NHL's realigned divisions. After being benched for the second and third periods in what would be his last game with the team on January 21, 2021, Dubois, along with a 2022 third-round pick, was traded to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for wingers Patrik Laine and Jack Roslovic on January 23. Veteran players David Savard and captain Nick Foligno would also be traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. The team finished last in their division, with a dismal 18\u201326\u201312 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2016. Tortorella and the Blue Jackets would then part ways after six seasons.\nRebuilding and the Gaudreau era (2021\u20132024).\nThe departures of Tortorella and several key players in the past few seasons threw the Blue Jackets into another rebuild, starting with the promotion of assistant coach Brad Larsen to head coach on June 10, 2021. Seth Jones would then be traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for defenseman Adam Boqvist and a 2021 first-round pick (Cole Sillinger), and Cam Atkinson to the Philadelphia Flyers for former first-round pick Jakub Voracek.\nThe 2021\u201322 season saw the Blue Jackets return to the Metropolitan Division as the NHL reverted to its 82-game regular season. In their season-opening game against the Arizona Coyotes, the team honored backup goaltender Matiss Kivlenieks, who had tragically died in a fireworks accident during the off-season, on July 4, 2021. They raised his number to hang inside Nationwide Arena for the duration of the season. His family also performed a ceremonial puck drop and goaltender Elvis Merzlikins was allowed to wear #80 during said game. They had also established the Matiss Kivlenieks Memorial Fund in his memory in order to promote the growth of hockey in Columbus and his homeland of Latvia.\nOn October 12, 2021, Boone Jenner was named the seventh captain in franchise history. Under his captaincy, the Blue Jackets started their season with a strong 7\u20133\u20130 record in their first ten games, even defeating the eventual Stanley Cup champions Colorado Avalanche in back-to-back games. Despite an improved offense and scoring capabilities, issues with defense and special teams caught up with the team as the season progressed, finishing among the top 10 teams with the highest goals against average. On April 16, 2022, they were officially eliminated from playoff contention when the Washington Capitals defeated the Montreal Canadiens. They finished sixth in their division, with a 37\u201338\u20137 record and 81 points.\nDuring the 2022 free agency, the Blue Jackets shocked the hockey world by signing Calgary Flames superstar Johnny Gaudreau to a seven-year contract, following the signing of his teammate, defenseman Erik Gudbranson, to a four-year contract on July 13, 2022. The Gaudreau signing stunned hockey fans and media alike as the franchise had gained a reputation of being unable to sign or retain star players. Gaudreau, who had reportedly been linked to other Metro teams like the New Jersey Devils, New York Islanders, and Philadelphia Flyers for weeks, decided to play for less compensation for Columbus, citing their potential as a young team and that he came there \"to win hockey games.\" Subsequently, in order to re-sign Laine to what would be a four-year contract after the blockbuster signings, the Blue Jackets traded winger Oliver Bjorkstrand to the Seattle Kraken for 2023 late-round picks.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, amid expectations of being a competitive team, the Blue Jackets could not overcome their defensive issues and man games lost due to injuries, especially that of top defenseman Zach Werenski, consistently placing them at the bottom of their division and of the league. The \"lost\" season would see the Blue Jackets trade forwards Gustav Nyquist to the Minnesota Wild and Jakub Voracek to the Arizona Coyotes; and backup goaltender Joonas Korpisalo and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov to the Los Angeles Kings for draft picks and prospects. Two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Jonathan Quick, also acquired from the Kings, would be traded to the Vegas Golden Knights in less than two days. On March 17, 2023, the Blue Jackets were eliminated from playoff contention in their 68th game, after a 7\u20134 loss to the Anaheim Ducks. They finished eighth in their division, with a dismal 25\u201348\u20139 record and 59 points, and were 31st in the league. On April 15, 2023, they relieved Brad Larsen of his duties as head coach.\nFor the 2023\u201324 season, the Blue Jackets made several changes in the off-season. They looked to improve their blue line by trading for Ivan Provorov from the Philadelphia Flyers on June 6, 2023, and then for Damon Severson from the New Jersey Devils three days later. On July 1, they hired Mike Babcock as their new head coach amid much controversy, as he had a reputation of mistreating players. In the 2023 NHL entry draft, they used their third overall pick to draft center Adam Fantilli from the University of Michigan. Babcock resigned on September 17, after allegations of improper behavior via the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast led to an NHLPA investigation into his conduct. He announced his resignation as head coach before the start of the preseason, with Pascal Vincent being named his successor. On February 15, 2024, the Blue Jackets fired general manager Jarmo Kekalainen, ending an 11-year tenure that included the team\u2019s first playoff series win in 2019. On May 28, Don Waddell was hired as president of hockey operations and general manager, while John Davidson transitioned to a senior advisor role within the organization. The team struggled once again, finishing with a 27\u201343\u201312 record and last in the Metropolitan Division.\nOn June 17, 2024, the Blue Jackets fired Vincent, with former Minnesota Wild coach Dean Evason named his successor on July 22. On August 29, ahead of the 2024\u201325 season, Gaudreau and his younger brother Matthew were both killed by a driver suspected of drunk driving while cycling in Oldmans Township, New Jersey. The tragedy was met with tributes from around the NHL and wider sports world, as well as an impromptu memorial established by fans at Nationwide Arena.\nTeam information.\nTeam name.\nThe name \"Blue Jackets\" was chosen to celebrate \"patriotism, pride, and the rich Civil War history in the state of Ohio and city of Columbus.\" When President Abraham Lincoln requested that Ohio raise ten regiments at the outbreak of the Civil War, the state responded by raising a total of 23 volunteer infantry regiments for three months of service. Ohio also produced a number of great Civil War figures, including William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, Philip Sheridan and George Custer; Sherman himself being a native of Lancaster, Ohio, about a drive from Columbus along U.S. Route 33 and is home to his childhood home and museum. Columbus itself was host to large military bases, Camp Chase and Camp Thomas, which saw hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers and thousands of Confederate prisoners during the Civil War.\nLogos and jerseys.\nThe team logo is a stylized version of the flag of Ohio, which is a \"burgee\" (i.e., swallowtail pennant), in the form of a \"C\" wrapped around a star, representing both patriotism and Columbus's status as state capital. Previously used as an alternate logo starting in 2003, it became the primary logo as part of a Reebok-sponsored redesign for the 2007\u201308 season. The original logo had a red ribbon with 13 stars representing the Thirteen Colonies, unfurled in the shape of the team's initials, CBJ, with an electric gold hockey stick cutting through the center to represent the \"J.\" An additional star atop the stick represented Columbus's status as state capital.\nSince their inception, the Blue Jackets have worn navy and white jerseys with red pants.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Blue Jackets would wear \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniforms designed by Adidas. The uniform resembled the original white \"Stinger\" uniforms from 2000 to 2007 but with a red base and white sleeve stripes.\nStarting with the 2022\u201323 season, the Blue Jackets' road white uniform would be paired with blue pants, a combination the team previously wore on May 1, 2021, against the Carolina Hurricanes. The blue pants were also used with the \"Reverse Retro\" uniform during that season. Also during the season, the Blue Jackets unveiled their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, using the 2003\u20132007 alternate uniform but with a black base and light blue stripes taken from their current alternates.\nFor the team's 2025 Stadium Series game, they wore dark blue uniforms and pants with white, silver and red trim. The main crest featured the \"cannon\" logo in front, and the shoulders featured a new \"CBJ\" patch with two crossed hockey sticks as a nod to the unit designation pins found in front of a soldier's slouch caps. An outline of Ohio surrounds the captain and alternate captain patches, along with a star on the right leg. Enlarged numbers and letters were used for the uniform.\n\"The Cannon\".\nPrior to the start of the 2007\u201308 season, the Blue Jackets organization brought a hand-made replica 1857 Napoleon cannon into Nationwide Arena. The cannon is \"fired\" at home games whenever:\nWhen the Blue Jackets score a goal, the title line of \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" by AC/DC is played when the cannon is fired followed by the chorus of \"The Whip\" by Locksley.\nBroadcast.\nOn FanDuel Sports Network Ohio, Steve Mears serves as the television play-by-play announcer alongside former Blue Jacket Jody Shelley providing color analysis. Brian Giesenschlag is the host of \"Blue Jackets Live\", the televised pre-game, intermission and post-game shows, with former Blue Jacket Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre.\nOn radio stations WBNS-FM (flagship), WBNS (flagship), WXZX (alternative flagship that airs games that conflict with WBNS's and WBNS-FM's coverage of Ohio State football or men's basketball), and 34 other affiliates in Ohio and West Virginia, Bob McElligott provides play-by-play coverage. McElligott joined the Blue Jackets radio broadcast in July 2009 as a color analyst and became the play-by-play analyst for the 2013\u201314 season, taking over for George Matthews who had been calling Blue Jackets games since the team's inception in 2000. McElligott, along with Dylan Tyrer, hosts the pre-game and post-game radio shows. Fans can interact by e-mail and Twitter with McElligott and Tyrer \nduring and after the game.\nMascot.\nStinger is the official mascot of the Blue Jackets. Stinger is a 6-foot 9-inch Yellow Jacket that walks amongst the crowd during the games and skates on the ice between periods while wearing a Blue Jackets jersey and a blue hat. Stingers eyebrows are black hockey sticks. Stinger was originally yellow, but was changed to green, eventually mixing with the team's blue. The image of Stinger was on the original Blue Jackets jerseys, eventually being removed in 2003. The team also had another mascot, an anthropomorphic cannon named Boomer, for half of the 2010\u201311 season.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Blue Jackets.

{"id": "73129", "revid": "19992876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73129", "title": "Edmonton Oilers", "text": "National Hockey League team based in Alberta, Canada\nThe Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton. The Oilers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. They play their home games at Rogers Place, which opened in 2016. Kris Knoblauch has been the head coach of the team since November 11, 2023, and Stan Bowman has served as general manager since July 24, 2024. The Oilers are one of two NHL franchises based in Alberta, the other being the Calgary Flames. Their proximity has led to a fierce rivalry known as the \"Battle of Alberta\".\nThe Oilers were founded in 1971 by W. D. \"Wild Bill\" Hunter and Dr. Chuck Allard and played its first season in 1972\u201373 as one of the 12 founding franchises of the major professional World Hockey Association (WHA). They were intended to be one of two WHA Alberta teams along with the Calgary Broncos. However, when the Broncos relocated and became the Cleveland Crusaders before the WHA's first season began, the team was named the Alberta Oilers. They were renamed the Edmonton Oilers the following year and subsequently joined the NHL in 1979 as one of four franchises absorbed through the NHL\u2013WHA merger.\nAfter joining the NHL, the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions: 1983\u201384, 1984\u201385, 1986\u201387, 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390. Along with the Pittsburgh Penguins, they are tied for the most championships won by any team since the NHL\u2013WHA merger, as well as the most won by any team that joined the league in or after 1967. Among all NHL teams, only the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the league's 1967 expansion. The Oilers also won six straight division titles from 1981\u201382 through 1986\u201387. Notably, however, the Oilers have not won a division title since 1987, a drought that includes their most recent two Stanley Cup wins and is the longest division title drought in all of the North American major professional sports. For their overall success in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Oilers team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nThe Oilers began to struggle after coming up short in the 2006 Stanley Cup Final, missing the playoffs for the subsequent 10 seasons. The Oilers made 16 first-round selections in the NHL entry draft from 2007 to 2019: 11 within the first 10 picks overall, six within the first four picks, and four of the first overall selections. With those first overall picks, Edmonton selected Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Nail Yakupov and Connor McDavid; of these, Nugent-Hopkins and McDavid remained with the team, helping them reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2024 and 2025, where they lost to the Florida Panthers on both occasions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nWHA years (1972\u20131979).\nOn November 1, 1971, the Edmonton Oilers became one of the 12 founding WHA franchises. The original owners were \"Wild Bill\" Hunter (1920\u20132002) and partner, Dr. Charles A. \"Chuck\" Allard (1919\u20131991) (father of Vancouver lawyer Peter Allard) who, a decade later, also brought the \"SCTV\" sketch comedy TV series to Edmonton. Hunter also owned the Edmonton Oil Kings, a junior hockey franchise, and founded the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (now known as the Western Hockey League (WHL)). Hunter's efforts to bring major professional hockey to Edmonton via an expansion NHL franchise had been rebuffed by the NHL, and Hunter looked to the upstart WHA instead. It was announced in early 1972 that the team would be known as the \"Edmonton Oil Kings\", which referred to the previous Oil Kings teams in the 1950s and 1960s. However, this soon changed to where Hunter chose to name the team the \"Oilers\". Hunter also served as head coach during 1972\u201373, 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376 seasons.\nAfter the newly founded Calgary Broncos folded before the commencement of the inaugural WHA season, the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers as it was planned to split their home games between Edmonton and Calgary. Possibly for financial reasons or to allow for a less complicated return of the WHA to Calgary, though, the team ultimately played all of its home games in the Edmonton Gardens and changed its name back to the Edmonton Oilers the following year. They won the first game in WHA history 7\u20134 over the Ottawa Nationals.\nThe Oilers drew fans with players such as defenceman and team captain Al Hamilton, goaltender Dave Dryden and forwards Blair MacDonald and Bill Flett. However, a relatively little-noticed move in 1976 had an important impact on the history of the franchise. That year, journeyman forward Glen Sather was acquired by the Oilers. It turned out to be his final season as a player and he was named player-coach late in the season, moving to the bench full-time after the season. Sather was the coach or general manager of the Oilers for the next 23 years.\nAlthough the Oilers' on-ice performance for most of the WHA's history was mediocre, they remained well-supported and financially stable by WHA standards. In 1976, Hunter and Allard sold the franchise to Vancouver real estate tycoon Nelson Skalbania, who later became notorious for flipping property, both real and franchised. Skalbania soon made local businessman Peter Pocklington a full partner, then sold his shares to him the following year. The team's fortunes improved dramatically in 1978 when Pocklington acquired underage player Wayne Gretzky, as well as goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll, for cash, from Skalbania's recently folded Indianapolis Racers.\nHis first year of WHA experience prevented Gretzky from being an official 1979\u201380 NHL rookie; his first and only WHA season, 1978\u201379, saw the Oilers finish first in the WHA standings, posting a league-best 48\u201330\u20132 record. However, Edmonton failed to win the championship, as they fell to the Winnipeg Jets in the Avco World Trophy finals. Dave Semenko of the Oilers scored the last goal in WHA history in the third period of the final game, which they lost 7\u20133.\nThe Oilers joined the NHL for 1979\u201380, along with fellow WHA teams Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and the Jets following a merger agreement between the two leagues. Of these four teams, only Edmonton has avoided relocation and renaming; the Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, the Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and the Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997.\nEntry into the NHL (1979\u20131983).\nThe Oilers lost most of the players from 1978\u201379 when the NHL held a reclamation draft of players who had bolted to the upstart league as they were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters. Originally, Gretzky was not eligible to be protected; under the rules of the time, he normally would have been placed in the 1979 NHL entry draft pool. However, Pocklington had signed him to a 21-year personal services contract in 1979 and Pocklington used the contract to force the NHL to admit the Oilers and allow the Oilers to keep Gretzky.\nUpon joining the NHL, the Oilers were placed in the Campbell Conference's Smythe Division. They were mediocre during the regular season in their first two seasons, finishing 16th and 14th respectively. However, because 16 of the 21 NHL teams made the playoffs at the time, the Oilers were still able to get their young players experience in the playoffs (they made the playoffs for their first 13 years in the NHL). They won only one playoff series in their first three NHL seasons, though, upsetting the Montreal Canadiens in 1980\u201381. Gretzky set new NHL records in 1980\u201381 for assists (109) and points (164). Also, they still had great draft positions. This allowed the Oilers to put together a young, talented, experienced team quickly. Within three years, Sather and chief scout Barry Fraser had drafted several players who would have an important role in the team's success, including Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, Kevin Lowe, Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog.\nThe Oilers improved in 1981\u201382, finishing second overall. Grant Fuhr emerged as the starting goaltender and he set a rookie record by going undefeated in 23 straight games. However, Gretzky stole the show by setting the single-season record for goals with 92 and becoming the first player in NHL history to score 200 points (with 212). Gretzky's accomplishments helped the Oilers become the first team to score 400 goals in a season, a feat they accomplished for five straight years. However, they were upset by the Los Angeles Kings in five games (game 3 of this series, the Miracle on Manchester, saw the Oilers take a 5\u20130 lead into the third period, only to lose 6\u20135 in overtime).\nIn 1982\u201383, the Oilers finished third overall in the NHL. They advanced all the way to the Stanley Cup Final (losing only once in the process) before getting swept by defending Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders. During this season, Gretzky, Messier, Anderson and Kurri all topped 100 points, with Coffey not far behind at 96. After the season, Lee Fogolin resigned as captain of the Oilers, picking Gretzky as his successor.\nDynasty years (1983\u20131990).\nIn 1983\u201384, the Oilers finished first overall in the NHL, winning a franchise record 57 games and earning 119 points (15 points ahead of the second-place Islanders). They were the first team to feature three players with 50 goals (Gretzky, Kurri, and Anderson). Gretzky started strong by scoring at least a point in the first 51 games of the season. Paul Coffey became the second defenceman ever to score at least 40 goals in a season. The team scored a total of 446 goals as a team, an NHL record. The Oilers were so determined to win the Stanley Cup that they hired Roger Neilson as a video analyst. They started the playoffs strongly by sweeping the Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division semifinals. They faced a tougher test in the Calgary Flames, but they defeated them in seven games in the division finals. They then swept the Minnesota North Stars in the conference finals to earn a rematch with the Islanders in the Stanley Cup Final. The Oilers split the first two games in Long Island but then won three in a row in Edmonton to become the first former WHA team to win the Stanley Cup. After the series, Mark Messier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.\nThe following season, the Oilers finished second overall in the NHL with 49 wins and 109 points. Gretzky led the NHL in goals with 73, and Kurri was close behind with a career-high 71. Gretzky also became the youngest player in NHL history to score one thousand points. In the playoffs, the Oilers swept the Kings in the opening round and Jets in round two. They won the first two games of the conference finals against the Chicago Black Hawks but lost the next two before winning the final two and returning to the Stanley Cup Final. Edmonton lost the first game to Philadelphia but won the next four to win the Stanley Cup for the second year in a row. Paul Coffey had a playoff performance to remember, setting records for most goals (12), assists (25), and points (37) ever by a defenceman in a playoff year. In addition, Jari Kurri tied Reggie Leach's record for most goals in a playoff year, with 19. However, Gretzky won the Conn Smythe Trophy after setting the record for most points in a playoff year (47). The 1984\u201385 Oilers were voted as the greatest NHL team of all-time during the league's centennial celebrations in 2017.\nDespite off-season legal issues, the Oilers were again the top team in the NHL during the 1985\u201386 season, with 56 wins and 119 points. They won the inaugural Presidents' Trophy, the trophy given to the team with the best regular season record. Gretzky, Kurri, and Anderson each scored 50 goals again. Kurri led the NHL in goals with 68, finishing with 131 points. Paul Coffey set a new record for most goals in a season by a defenceman (48) and just missed setting a new record for points by a defenceman with 138 (Bobby Orr scored 139 in 1970\u201371). Gretzky also set records for assists (163) and points (215). However, the Oilers failed to win their third-straight Stanley Cup, as the Calgary Flames defeated them in seven games in the second round. In the third period of a 2\u20132 tie during game 7, Steve Smith, a rookie for the Oilers, accidentally sent the puck into his own net on his birthday. This goal stood as the series-winning goal.\nThe 1986\u201387 season saw the Oilers capture their second straight Presidents' Trophy with 50 wins and 106 points. Gretzky and Kurri were first and second in the NHL point-scoring race, while Messier was fourth. Edmonton returned to the Stanley Cup Final and faced the same opponent as they had in 1985, the Philadelphia Flyers. The Oilers took a three-games-to-one lead in the series. However, strong goaltending by Flyers' rookie Ron Hextall forced a game 7, which the Oilers won, 3\u20131. In the post-game celebration, Gretzky immediately passed the Stanley Cup to Steve Smith, vindicated after his costly blunder the previous season. Hextall won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nIn 1987, the team were the subject of Bob McKeown's documentary film \"The Boys on the Bus\".\nThe Oilers began losing star players in 1987\u201388. Paul Coffey sat out the first 21 games of the season before getting traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Andy Moog also failed to report; he was tired of being the backup goaltender. Moog played for the Canadian Olympic team in the 1988 Winter Olympics before getting traded to the Boston Bruins for Bill Ranford. Despite the changes, the Oilers placed third overall in the NHL. Grant Fuhr started a league-record 75 games (which has now been broken) and posted a team-record 40 wins. In the first round of the playoffs, the Oilers dispatched the third-place Winnipeg Jets in five games. The Oilers then defeated first-overall Calgary in a sweep. In the conference finals against the Detroit Red Wings, the Oilers prevailed in five games. The Oilers then swept the Boston Bruins in four games. The fourth game had to be re-played because of a cancellation. With the score tied 3\u20133 with 3:23 to play in the second period, a power outage hit the Boston Garden, forcing cancellation of the entire game. The Oilers won the next game (originally scheduled as game five) back in Edmonton 6\u20133 to complete the series sweep. However, all player statistics for the aborted game four in Boston are counted in the NHL record books. Gretzky won the Conn Smythe Trophy after leading the playoffs in scoring with 43 points. After the Cup-clinching game, Gretzky implored his teammates, coaches, trainers, and others from the Oilers organization to join at centre ice for an impromptu team photo with the Stanley Cup. This started a tradition since continued by every subsequent Stanley Cup champion. After the season, Fuhr was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender.\nAfter Gretzky (1988\u20131990).\nIn a surprising and shocking trade, Gretzky, along with enforcer Marty McSorley and centre Mike Krushelnyski, were traded to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988. In exchange, the Oilers received US$15\u00a0million, young star Jimmy Carson, 1988 first-round draft choice Martin Gelinas, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989, 1991, and 1993. The trade occurred because Pocklington did not want to risk Gretzky leaving Edmonton without getting anything in return. Gretzky had converted his chance at free agency and refused, which ultimately led to the trade. None of this was public knowledge at the time. However, the Oilers and their fans were still upset. Nelson Riis, the New Democratic Party leader in Canada's House of Commons, went so far as to ask the government to block the trade. Several of the Oilers considered launching a team-wide strike and even considered demanding that Pocklington sell the team.\nThe loss of Gretzky had an immediate impact in 1988\u201389, as the Oilers were only able to finish in third place in their division. Mark Messier was chosen to succeed Gretzky as captain. Coincidentally, the Oilers' first-round playoff opponent was Gretzky's Los Angeles Kings. Edmonton took a commanding 3\u20131 series lead, but Gretzky and the Kings fought back to win the series, winning game 7 6\u20133 in Los Angeles. It was the first time since 1982 that the Oilers had been eliminated from the playoffs in the first round.\nThe Oilers underwent more changes during the 1989\u201390 season. John Muckler replaced Sather, who remained general manager and became the Oilers' president, as head coach of the team. During training camp, Grant Fuhr came down with a severe case of appendicitis. He missed the first 10 games of the season and when he returned he suffered a shoulder injury that eventually sidelined him for the remainder of the season. This marked the emergence of Bill Ranford as a starter. Four games into the season, Jimmy Carson decided the pressure of playing in Edmonton was too intense and he was traded to Detroit with Kevin McClelland in exchange for Petr Klima, Adam Graves, Joe Murphy and Jeff Sharples. The Oilers improved on their previous season, finishing with 38 wins and 90 points, good for fifth place overall in the NHL. Messier had 45 goals and 84 assists for 129 points, good for second in the NHL scoring race (behind only Gretzky).\nIn the first round, the Oilers faced the Winnipeg Jets. Trailing the series 3\u20131 and trailing game 5 by an identical score, the Oilers rallied to win the next three and take the series. In the division final, the Oilers met Los Angeles for the second straight season. Edmonton swept the series 4\u20130, outscoring the Kings 22\u201310. The Oilers then met the Chicago Blackhawks in the conference finals and fell behind 2\u20131 in the series. However, the Oilers won the next three games to earn a rematch of the 1988 Stanley Cup Final with Boston. The series is remembered for game 1, still the longest Stanley Cup Final game played in the modern NHL. Despite being soundly outshot by the Bruins, the Oilers won the game 3\u20132 when Klima\u2014benched for much of the game and thus the only player on either team who was not exhausted\u2014scored at 15:13 of the third overtime. The Oilers defeated the Bruins in five games and won their first Cup without Gretzky. For his superlative goaltending, Bill Ranford won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nDecline in success (1990\u20131996).\nThe Oilers lost another important player before the 1990\u201391 season, as Jari Kurri chose to play the entire season with Devils Milano. Grant Fuhr was suspended for 60 games for drug abuse. The season itself was not great for the Oilers, who finished with 37 wins and 80 points, in third place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Oilers met the Flames in the opening round, winning a thrilling series in seven games, led by seven goals by Esa Tikkanen. Despite injuries suffered in the series with Calgary, they next defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games. However, their success did not continue into the conference finals, as they lost in five games to the Minnesota North Stars.\nThe final star players from the Oilers left before the 1991\u201392 season. Fuhr and Glenn Anderson were traded to Toronto, Steve Smith was traded to Chicago, and Kurri was traded to Philadelphia. Charlie Huddy was claimed by Minnesota in the expansion draft, and Mark Messier was traded to the New York Rangers a day after the season began. The Oilers even lost their head coach, as John Muckler left to become head coach and general manager of the Buffalo Sabres. Ted Green replaced Muckler as head coach, and Kevin Lowe succeeded Messier as captain.\nDespite the number of changes, the Oilers produced a comparable season to 1990\u201391, finishing third in the Smythe Division with 36 wins and 82 points. In the first round of the playoffs, the Oilers again met the Los Angeles Kings. Again, for the third time since the Gretzky trade, the Oilers defeated the Kings. In the next round, the Oilers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in six games to return to the conference finals for the third straight season, this time facing the Chicago Blackhawks. However, the Oilers' unexpected run in the playoffs came to a crashing halt, as the Blackhawks dominated every game and swept the series.\nThe departures of the stars from the 1980s exposed serious deficiencies in the Oilers' development system. They had done a poor job of drafting during the dynasty years, and the younger players had not had enough time to develop before the core of the 1980s dynasty left the team. This did not become apparent for a few years; as noted above, the Oilers still had enough heft to make the conference finals two years in a row. However, it was obvious that they were nowhere near being the powerhouse that had dominated the league in the previous half-decade. In 1992\u201393, they missed the playoffs for the first time as an NHL team. They did not return to the postseason for four years, despite the emergence of young centremen Doug Weight and Jason Arnott. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Oilers were placed into the Western Conference's Pacific Division.\nReturn to the playoffs and seventh Cup Final appearance (1996\u20132006).\nIn 1996\u201397, the Oilers made the playoffs for the first time in five years, thanks to stellar goaltending by Curtis Joseph. In the first round, they upset the Dallas Stars, who had compiled the league's second-best record, in a seven-game series. The Oilers won game seven on a goal by Todd Marchant in overtime. However, the Oilers' surprise playoff run failed to continue, as the Colorado Avalanche defeated them in the next round. In 1997\u201398, Joseph led the Oilers to another first-round upset. After Colorado took a 3\u20131 series lead, the Oilers held them scoreless for eight straight periods en route to winning the series in seven games. Dallas and Edmonton met again in the second round, but this time, the Stars were the victors. The Oilers made the playoffs in four of the next six years, but they were defeated after the first round every time.\nDespite their success over the past two seasons, the Oilers were in trouble off the ice. Owner Peter Pocklington had explored moving the Oilers to Minnesota during the 1990s. In 1998, Pocklington almost made a deal to sell the team to Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), who would have moved the team to Houston. On March 14, 1998, hours before the deadline to keep the team in Edmonton, the Edmonton Investors Group agreed to pay $70\u00a0million to buy the club. The EIG were spearheaded by Cal Nichols, who committed to retaining NHL hockey in Edmonton. The deal was finalized on May 5, and thus prevented them from being the third Canadian team to move in the 1990s and the fourth former WHA team to move in successive years (Quebec had moved in 1995, Winnipeg in 1996 and Hartford in 1997). The Oilers received support from the NHL for this very reason. In the 1998\u201399 season, the Oilers joined the Western Conference's Northwest Division.\nOn November 22, 2003, the Oilers hosted the 2003 Heritage Classic, the first regular season outdoor hockey game in the NHL's history and part of the celebrations of the Oilers' 25th season in the NHL. They were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens 4\u20133 in front of more than 55,000 fans, an NHL attendance record, at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. The Oilers failed to make the playoffs in the 2003\u201304 season.\nThe Oilers struggled with their small-market status for several years, but after the wiped-out 2004\u201305 season, they were aided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL owners and players. This included a league-wide salary cap that essentially forced all teams to conform to a budget, as the Oilers had been doing for years. A more reasonable conversion rate of Canadian dollar revenues to US dollar payroll in the new millennium also helped the Oilers to return to profitability. Because of this, Edmonton was able to acquire Chris Pronger (former winner of the Hart and Norris Trophies) and Michael Peca (two-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner) before the 2005\u201306 season.\nThe team suffered from inconsistency during the first few months of the regular season, especially in goal and offence. Goaltenders Ty Conklin and Jussi Markkanen were unreliable in net and Peca also struggled with offence. However, in-season acquisitions, such as defencemen Jaroslav Spacek and Dick Tarnstrom, goaltender Dwayne Roloson and left winger Sergei Samsonov, helped Edmonton finish the season with 95 points and clinch the final playoff spot in the Western Conference over Vancouver.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Oilers played the Detroit Red Wings (winners of the Presidents' Trophy). Despite Detroit's much better regular season record, the Oilers pulled off a six-game upset for their first playoff series win since 1998. Edmonton then met the San Jose Sharks in the conference semifinals. After trailing the series two games to none, the team won the next four and became the first eighth-seeded team to reach a conference final since the NHL changed the playoff format in 1994. There, the Oilers beat the sixth-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in five games, claiming the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl for a seventh time.\nIn the 2006 Stanley Cup Final, Edmonton met the Carolina Hurricanes. During game 1, the Oilers blew a 3\u20130 lead, lost Dwayne Roloson for the series after he suffered a knee injury, and ultimately lost 5\u20134 when Carolina's captain Rod Brind'Amour scored the winning goal in the final minute after backup goaltender Ty Conklin misplayed the puck. From that game forward, the Oilers used Jussi Markkanen in net. Despite trailing the series 2\u20130 and 3\u20131, the Oilers forced a game 7 with a 2\u20131 win in game 3, a Fernando Pisani short-handed overtime winner in game 5 and a 4\u20130 shutout for Markkanen in game 6. However, the Oilers could not complete the comeback as the Hurricanes won game 7 3\u20131 to capture their first-ever Stanley Cup.\nCollapse and 10-year playoff drought (2006\u20132015).\nIn the 2006 off-season, many Oilers left the team. Four days after their loss to the Hurricanes, Chris Pronger surprisingly issued a trade request for personal reasons. Pronger was subsequently traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Joffrey Lupul, Ladislav Smid, and three draft picks. Several Oilers left via free agency and during the season, long-time Oiler Ryan Smyth was traded to the New York Islanders for Ryan O'Marra, Robert Nilsson and a first-round pick in the 2007 NHL entry draft (used to select Alex Plante). However, the Oilers were able to re-sign Dwayne Roloson and Fernando Pisani. Having lost so many players, the Oilers posted a 32\u201343\u20137 record in 2006\u201307, their worst record since the 1995\u201396 season, and eventually finished in 11th place in the Western Conference. Throughout the season, the Oilers lost various players to injury and illness; at one point, they had 11 players out of the lineup and had to rely on emergency call-ups to fill their roster.\nIn 2007\u201308, the Oilers had a 16\u201321\u20134 record after the first half of the season. They improved in the second half of the year, however, going 25\u201314\u20132 in 41 games for a final record of 41\u201335\u20136. Nonetheless, this was not enough to qualify for the playoffs, as the Oilers finished three points out in ninth place. During the season, Daryl Katz, owner of the Rexall pharmaceutical company, purchased the team from the Edmonton Investors Group. The Oilers announced a restructuring of their hockey operations on July 30, 2008, which saw the promotion of Kevin Lowe to the role of president of hockey operations and was replaced by Steve Tambellini.\nThe 2008\u201309 season saw the Oilers finish with a record of 38\u201335\u20139, but that was only good enough for 11th in the West. However, one bright spot during the season was Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson, as he became the oldest goaltender to play 60 NHL games in one season. After the season, the Oilers fired head coach Craig MacTavish and hired Pat Quinn as his replacement.\nRoloson left via free agency at the end of the season, and the Oilers replaced him in goal with Nikolai Khabibulin. The Oilers also worked out a trade with the Ottawa Senators for star right wing Dany Heatley, which would have seen Dustin Penner, Ladislav Smid and Andrew Cogliano go the other way, but Heatley refused a trade to Edmonton and was later acquired by San Jose. \nFollowing the season, Tom Renney replaced Quinn as the Oilers head coach. The one advantage to such a bad season was that the Oilers were able to make the first pick in the 2010 NHL entry draft. The Oilers selected two-time Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy winner Taylor Hall from the Windsor Spitfires with their pick. They used the off-season to begin the rebuild of the club around their young talent. Patrick O'Sullivan was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Jim Vandermeer, Robert Nilsson was bought out of his contract and Oilers captain Ethan Moreau was placed on waivers and claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Along with these players, several others were allowed to enter free agency, including Mike Comrie, Marc-Antoine Pouliot and Ryan Potulny. Also during the off-season, radio announcer Rod Phillips announced his retirement. Phillips had been the Oilers' play-by-play announcer since 1973\u201374. Phillips called 10 specific games in 2010\u201311 before calling it quits. The 2010\u201311 Edmonton Oilers season is documented in the series \"Oil Change\".\nThe 2010\u201311 season brought a new look to the Edmonton Oilers line-up, when Shawn Horcoff was selected to succeed Ethan Moreau as team captain. Horcoff had become the Oilers' longest-serving player by this point. Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle and Magnus Paajarvi-Svensson all made their NHL debuts for the team. Despite the influx of their young talent, Edmonton still found themselves at the bottom of the standings. In an attempt to gain valuable prospects and draft picks, Dustin Penner was traded from the Oilers to Los Angeles on February 28, 2011, in exchange for Colten Teubert, a first-round draft pick in 2011 (used to select Oscar Klefbom) and a conditional third-round pick in 2012. At the end of the season, the Oilers were at the bottom of the standings and received the right to choose first overall in the upcoming 2011 NHL entry draft. The Oilers selected Ryan Nugent-Hopkins with the first overall selection, along with several other \"blue chip\" prospects. During the 2011 off-season, the team again made several moves to bolster the offence and defence, re-acquiring fan favourite Ryan Smyth from Los Angeles for Colin Fraser and a seventh-round draft pick. The team also traded with the Anaheim Ducks to acquire Andy Sutton for Kurtis Foster. Sheldon Souray, who played the entire 2010\u201311 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Hershey Bears, was bought out of the last year of his contract. These moves, coupled with the signings of Eric Belanger, Cam Barker, Ben Eager and Darcy Hordichuk, changed the complexion of the team, to add \"grit and toughness\". However, the Oilers were again unable to qualify for the playoffs for the sixth-straight season, as they finished 14th in the Western Conference.\nOn May 17, 2012, a month after the ending of the 2011\u201312 season, the Oilers announced they would not renew the contract of head coach Tom Renney. The following month, Edmonton selected Nail Yakupov as the first overall pick at the 2012 NHL entry draft. A week later, Ralph Krueger was named as the Oilers' new head coach on June 27, being promoted from his role as associate coach the season previous. Three days later, Edmonton announced they had agreed to terms with sought-after free agent defenceman Justin Schultz.\nThe 2012\u201313 season start was delayed from its original date of October 11, 2012, due to a labour lock-out imposed by the NHL franchise owners after the expiration of the NHL's CBA. After a new labour agreement was reached between the owners and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA), training camps opened on January 13, 2013, and a 48-game season (reduced from 82 games) commenced on January 19. The Oilers played their first game of the shortened season a day later, on January 20.\nOn January 23, to ensure the health of the Edmonton Oilers in Edmonton and for the planned revitalization of downtown Edmonton, the City of Edmonton council voted 10\u20133 to approval a deal that saw a new $480\u00a0million arena built in Edmonton's downtown core for the start of the 2016\u201317 season. Rogers Communications announced it had the naming rights to the new arena on December 3, 2013; the new 18,641-seat arena was called Rogers Place.\nAfter 41 games into the shortened season and with the Oilers mathematically eliminated from the playoffs for a seventh successive time, Edmonton terminated Steve Tambellini's contract as general manager, where he was replaced with former head coach Craig MacTavish. Following the end of the season, on June 8, MacTavish fired Ralph Krueger after just one season as head coach. Two days later, it was announced Krueger was to be replaced by former Toronto Marlies head coach Dallas Eakins. One of MacTavish's first player moves as Oilers' general manager came at the 2013 NHL entry draft, as Edmonton used their seventh overall selection to draft defenceman Darnell Nurse. More moves came on July 5, during free agency, which saw MacTavish trade captain Shawn Horcoff to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Philip Larsen. MacTavish also signed Andrew Ference, Boyd Gordon, Jason LaBarbera, Will Acton, Ryan Hamilton and Jesse Joensuu. Ference was later announced as the 14th captain in Oilers NHL franchise history on September 29. Ales Hemsky and Ryan Smyth, who after the Horcoff trade became the last remaining members of the Oilers' 2006 Stanley Cup finalists still with the team, departed the Oilers franchise, as Hemsky was traded to the Ottawa Senators on March 5, 2014. Smyth (who had previously left the Oilers in 2007, but had returned in 2011) announced his retirement on April 11, playing his final NHL game on April 13, where he was ceremoniously named team captain.\nOn December 15, 2014, after 31 games of the 2014\u201315 season, MacTavish announced Dallas Eakins had been terminated as head coach. MacTavish assumed the role of interim coach while Todd Nelson transitioned into the role for the remainder of the season. Nelson was previously serving as the head coach of the Oklahoma City Barons, the Oilers' then-AHL affiliate. Three days later, the Oilers released a statement that their affiliation with the Barons would cease at the end of the season.\nFollowing Edmonton's decision not to renew affiliation with the Barons, the Oilers relocated their AHL franchise from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Bakersfield, California. This move was announced on January 29, 2015, as part of the AHL's new Pacific Division, which included the Oilers' affiliation in Bakersfield. The following month, on February 25, the team was given its new identity, the Bakersfield Condors. On April 2, the Condors released their new logo. Off-season moves failed to help the Oilers in the 2014\u201315 season, as the team earned only 62 points in one of their worst seasons as an NHL team.\nMcDavid\u2013Draisaitl era (2015\u2013present).\nThe Oilers won the 2015 draft lottery on April 18, moving them from the third-overall pick to first, marking their fourth lottery win in six seasons. The Oilers selected Connor McDavid first overall in the 2015 NHL entry draft held in Sunrise, Florida, on June 26.\nOn April 24, Craig MacTavish was removed from his position as general manager and was replaced by former Boston Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli, who was also appointed president of hockey operations as part of other related changes. In Chiarelli's first transactions as Oilers general manager, he traded a first and a second-round pick during the first day of the 2015 NHL entry draft to the New York Islanders, in exchange for defenceman Griffin Reinhart. Chiarelli again made trades the following day and traded another second-, a third- and a seventh-round draft pick to the New York Rangers, to acquire goaltender Cam Talbot and the Rangers' seventh-round draft pick. On May 19, Todd McLellan was named the new head coach of the Oilers. He and his former team, the San Jose Sharks, mutually agreed to part ways on April 20 after the Sharks failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs. More coaching changes came on June 4 when Keith Acton and Craig Ramsay were relieved of their duties.\nIn addition to these coaching changes, the Oilers also made some changes to their scouting staff on June 22, which saw both head amateur and professional scouts Stu MacGregor and Morey Gare relieved of their duties. Amateur scouts Brad Davis and Kent Hawley, and professional scouts Dave Semenko and Billy Moores, who served as director of coaching and special projects, were also relieved of their duties. Further changes came on October 7, when the Oilers elected to begin the 2015\u201316 season without a team captain; this marked the first time they had done so since entering the NHL, in 1979. Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, and Andrew Ference, who had served as team captain the previous two seasons, were all named as alternate captains.\nOn February 27, 2016, mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, the Oilers traded defenceman Justin Schultz to the Pittsburgh Penguins, in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2016 NHL entry draft. Before his trade, Schultz endured the worst season of his professional career, with just 10 points in 45 games.\nAfter the 2015\u201316 season, the Oilers prepared to move from Rexall Place, their home since 1974, to the newly built Rogers Place. On April 6, in their final home game at Rexall, the Oilers defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6\u20132. Before the game, the Oilers held a ceremony honouring the history of the arena. Oilers' alumni, including Mark Messier and Wayne Gretzky, skated around the rink one more time.\nIn a one-for-one trade on June 29, Edmonton dealt all-star winger Taylor Hall to the New Jersey Devils, in exchange for defenceman Adam Larsson. Following the Hall trade, Chiarelli also pursued impending free agent Milan Lucic, signing him to a seven-year contract, in a bid to make the playoffs for the first time since 2006. Chiarelli and Lucic were already familiar with each other, during their time together with the Boston Bruins. On October 5, 19-year-old Connor McDavid was named the 15th captain of the Oilers; McDavid was the youngest team captain in NHL history, having broken the record previously held by Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog. The Oilers made further moves to their roster a few days later, when they traded Nail Yakupov to the St. Louis Blues, and signed free-agent defenceman Kris Russell.\nThe 2016\u201317 season was a great success for the team. After defeating the Los Angeles Kings 2\u20131 on March 28, 2017, the Oilers qualified for the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, ending their 11-year drought. The Oilers finished with a 47\u201326\u20139 record, thanks largely to a 100-point season from McDavid and breakout performances from fellow forwards Leon Draisaitl and Patrick Maroon, whilst backstopped with strong play from netminder Cam Talbot. McDavid led the entire league with 70 assists and 100 points, earning himself both the Art Ross Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy, as his team's most valuable player. Talbot also set a new franchise record, with a total of 42 games won by a goaltender, surpassing the 40 games won by Grant Fuhr, during the 1987\u201388 season.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Oilers eliminated the San Jose Sharks, following a 3\u20131 win in game 6, to secure their first playoff series win since 2006. Their playoff run was stopped on May 10, as they lost 2\u20131 to the Anaheim Ducks in game 7, ending the second-round series.\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Oilers traded Jordan Eberle to the New York Islanders in exchange for forward Ryan Strome to gain salary relief. The Oilers signed both McDavid and Draisaitl to eight-year contracts worth $100 million and $68 million, respectively, carrying annual cap hits of $12.5 million and $8.5 million. The Oilers had high expectations coming into the 2017\u201318 season, as many expected to make progress off of their surprising year in 2016\u201317. However, the Oilers regressed, posting a 36\u201340\u20136 record and missing the playoffs for the 11th time in 12 seasons.\nOn January 22, 2019, the Oilers terminated Chiarelli's employment as president and general manager. Keith Gretzky was appointed interim general manager the following day. The Oilers again missed the playoffs, posting a 35\u201338\u20139 record and having only qualified for the playoffs once in 13 seasons.\nAfter COVID and consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances (2020\u2013present).\nOn May 7, 2019, the Oilers announced the appointment of Ken Holland as general manager. Three weeks later, the Oilers named Dave Tippett as the team's new head coach, on May 28. In the 2019\u201320 season, the Oilers showed some hope; the team had a record of 37\u201325\u20139 on March 12, 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the season. Edmonton was chosen as one of the two host cities of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and qualified for the playoffs as the fifth seed in the Western Conference; however, the team was upset by the Chicago Blackhawks in four games in the preliminary round.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Oilers finished second in the North Division with a 35\u201319\u20132 record, largely due to a 105-point season from Connor McDavid, only the ninth player to reach the mark in 53 games. Additionally, Leon Draisaitl had an excellent season, as the runner-up in NHL league scoring, with 84 points. McDavid's 105-point season earned him a unanimous second Hart Trophy win as the most valuable player in the NHL, becoming the second unanimous winner in league history (along with Wayne Gretzky in 1981\u201382). The Oilers faced the third-place team in the North Division, the Winnipeg Jets, in the first round of the playoffs. The Oilers were swept in four games by the Jets, and three of the Oilers' losses came in overtime, including the final game, which went to triple overtime. Darnell Nurse logged 62 minutes and 7 seconds of ice time in the final game, third-most in NHL history.\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Oilers finished with a 49\u201327\u20136 record, their first 40-win season since 2017. McDavid had a career-high 123 points, as the Oilers clinched second place in the Pacific Division. The Oilers faced the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. After struggling at first, the Oilers managed to cling on and win an extremely close series with a shutout in game 7 to advance to the second round. There, they faced their provincial rival, the Calgary Flames for the first time since 1991. The series was a tight battle, leading to the Oilers triumphing over the Flames in five games. The series was a part of the iconic Battle of Alberta, which is known for its excessive amount of high-scoring games and brutality. The Oilers advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 2006 where they were swept in four games by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Oilers had three players, Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins each reach the 100-point milestone. This milestone from the trio marks the first NHL season since 1995\u201396, when one team had three players score 100 points. The Oilers finished 50\u201323\u20139 with their first 50-win season since the 1986\u201387 season, recording 109 points and clinched the second seed in the Pacific Division, earning an opening round playoff matchup with the Los Angeles Kings for the second consecutive year. Connor McDavid had a career-high scoring 153 points, recording the highest single season point total in the salary cap era. After defeating the Kings in six games, they were eliminated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights, also in six games.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Oilers started with a disappointing 3\u20139\u20131 record, which led to the dismissals of head coach Jay Woodcroft and assistant coach Dave Manson on November 12, 2023. But by the end of the season, the Oilers finished with a 49\u201327\u20136 record, being 46\u201318\u20135 under new head coach Kris Knoblauch and clinched the second seed in the Pacific Division, earning an opening round playoff matchup with the Los Angeles Kings for the third consecutive year. During the season, the Oilers went on a 16-game win streak, which began on December 21, 2023, against the New Jersey Devils and ended on February 6, 2024, against the Vegas Golden Knights. Zach Hyman scored a personal high 54 goals to finish as the team leader in goals scored and Connor McDavid became the fourth player since 1990\u201391 to record 100 assists in a single NHL season, joining former Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky and Hockey Hall of Famers, Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr. After beating the Los Angeles Kings for the third consecutive year in the first round, the Vancouver Canucks in the second round, and the Dallas Stars in the conference finals, the Oilers won their eighth Clarence S. Campbell Bowl and made it to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2006. They faced the Florida Panthers losing in seven games after trailing 3\u20130 in the Stanley Cup Final. Connor McDavid, however, won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nIn the 2024 off-season on June 27, 2024, three days after the Oilers' loss in the Final, and with his contract expiring, the Oilers and general manager Holland announced that they had mutually decided to part ways. Jeff Jackson, CEO of hockey operations, subsequently assumed the role of interim general manager. On July 24, 2024, the Oilers hired former Chicago Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman as their new general manager, three weeks after being reinstated from his suspension relating to the Blackhawks sexual abuse scandal. On September 2, the Oilers signed Draisaitl to an eight-year contract extension worth $112 million, carrying annual cap hit of $14 million.\nIn the 2024\u201325 season, the Oilers started the season slow with a 5\u20135\u20131 record by the end of October, and reached a 29\u201311\u20133 record before the 4 Nations Face-Off break. They then stumbled to a 1\u20136\u20130 record from late February into early March, before closing the regular season with a 13\u20137\u20131 record and a final record of 48\u201329\u20135, clinching the third seed in the Pacific Division. In the 2025 playoffs, Edmonton for the fourth consecutive year in the first round played against the Los Angeles Kings. After initially trailing the series 0\u20132, the Oilers would then win four straight games to eliminate the Kings for the fourth consecutive year. In the second round, the Oilers eliminated the Vegas Golden Knights in five games avenging their 2023 second round elimination. In the conference finals, Edmonton met the Dallas Stars for the second consecutive year, this time eliminating the Stars in five games, to return to the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive year. In the Stanley Cup Final, the Oilers met the Florida Panthers for the second consecutive year, and lost in six games.\nOn October 6, 2025, McDavid was signed to a two-year extension.\nTeam information.\nJerseys.\nThe original 1972 logo was designed by James Harvey, a graphic designer working for an Albertan public relations firm called Francis, Williams, Johnson and Payne LTD. The design featured the now-traditional colours of blue and orange, but reversed from their more familiar appearance in later seasons, orange being the dominant colour and blue used for the trimming. For the first few games of the 1972 season, player names were not displayed on the uniform; rather the word \"ALBERTA\" was written in that space. About halfway through the season, though, the player names made their appearance, since the Oilers had played exclusively in Edmonton. These jerseys also featured the player numbers high on the shoulders, rather than on the upper sleeve as is standard.\nIn the 1974\u201375 season, the jersey was changed to a blue base with orange trim. The logo that appeared on programs and promotional material remained the same. However, the logo that appeared on the home jersey had a white oil drop, on a dark orange field, with the team name written in deep blue. The away jersey featured an orange-printed logo with a blue oil drop.\nWhen the team joined the NHL in 1979, the alternate logos were discarded, giving the jersey its most famous form. However, the logo appeared slightly differently on a few vintages of the jersey. Minor changes were also made to the numbering, lettering, and collar in their first few NHL campaigns. From 1982 to 1989, Nike provided the Oilers' sweaters.\nThe essential design remained untouched until 1996 when the team colours were changed to midnight blue and copper with red trim. Other changes made to the jersey at that point were the removal of the shoulder bar and cuffs from the away jersey and the addition of the \"Rigger\" alternate logo to the jersey's shoulders. A year later, the shoulder bars were removed from the home jersey as well and the Oilers' sweater design then remained stable until 2007.\nIn 2001, the Oilers introduced their first alternate third sweater. Designed by then-minority owner Todd McFarlane and his production studio, the new uniforms were a radical departure from previous Oilers designs. The original Oilers logo was completely absent, along with copper and red; midnight blue was complemented with two shades of silver/grey and the primary logo was a flying set of gears with an oil drop on top. Elements of the logo paid tribute to the five Stanley Cup titles and 10 team captains to that point. A silver shield bearing \"OILERS\" above a variation of the oil-drop gear adorned the shoulders. The jersey's sleeve numbers are located inside the white sleeve stripe.\nDuring the 2003 Heritage Classic, the Oilers donned their 1980s white uniform, albeit paired with the then-current navy pants.\nIn 2007, with the NHL's switch to jerseys, the Oilers kept their team colours but changed the style of their jerseys. Most notable about the Edge jerseys were the removal of the waistline stripes in favour of vertical piping and the sleeve stripes only appearing on the inside of the elbow panels. The \"Rigger\" was retired, along with the McFarlane third jersey and its associated logos. In 2008, the Oilers introduced a new alternate jersey that closely resembled the blue-and-orange away jersey of the dynasty era. For the 2009\u201310 season, this jersey became the Oilers' main home jersey as blue and orange became the primary team colours once again. The old midnight blue-and-copper jersey became their alternate. On June 24, 2011, the Oilers presented their new white road jerseys at the 2011 NHL entry draft, when they selected Ryan Nugent-Hopkins first overall. The midnight blue jersey remained as the third jersey before being dropped altogether in 2012.\nFor the 2015\u201316 season, the team introduced a new alternate jersey inspired by their original WHA design, with orange as a primary colour. This design immediately became popular with the fanbase and Oilers home games were soon flooded with fans wearing the orange jerseys, calling it the \"Surge of Orange\" in response to the Calgary Flames' \"C of Red\" and Winnipeg Jets' \"Whiteout\" traditions. The Oilers also wore the alternate orange jerseys in the 2016 Heritage Classic.\nWith the switch to Adidas jerseys in the 2017\u201318 season, the orange jersey became the Oilers' home design, but with a few alterations: the 1980s-era template was retained while midnight blue returned as an accent colour.\nTo commemorate the franchise's 40th anniversary in the NHL, the Oilers wore their classic 1980s blue jerseys for four home games in 2018\u201319 against original Smythe Division rivals Los Angeles Kings, Calgary Flames, Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks. Before the 2019\u201320 season, the Oilers unveiled a new midnight blue alternate jersey with minimal striping and lack of white elements. The Oilers wore their midnight blue alternates at home playoff games during the 2021 and 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Oilers released a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform, reviving the 1980s white jersey but with the orange and blue switching places, save for the team's crest.\nBeginning with the 2022\u201323 season, the Oilers brought back the 1980s blue and white jerseys, while retaining the alternate midnight blue jerseys. The Oilers also unveiled a second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform during the season, using the 2001\u20132007 alternate but with orange replacing silver in the trim, as well as making the oil drop orange to match the drop in the standard logo.\nFor the team's appearance in the 2023 Heritage Classic, the Oilers wore specially designed uniforms. The blue-based design featured an enlarged oil drop surrounding a blue number, the full team name in blue letters at the bottom in a white ribbon, and orange and cream stripes. The back of the uniform featured cream letters with orange accents. Brown pants and gloves were worn to evoke hockey equipment of the early 20th century. The design was inspired by Team Canada's 1952 Winter Olympics gold medal-winning team represented by the Edmonton Mercurys.\nIn the 2025\u201326 season, the Oilers unveiled a new alternate uniform, featuring a tan base with blue and orange stripes across the shoulders, sleeves and waist. The crest features the \"Oilers\" script in blue between two orange lines, and a right shoulder roundel patch containing an oil rig, Edmonton's nickname of \"Oil Country\", and the year of the franchise's move to the NHL (1979).\nAnthem singer.\nFrom 1981 to 2011, Paul Lorieau was the Oilers anthem singer. Since 2013, the Oilers' anthem singer has been Robert Clark, an opera singer from Sherwood Park. When the Oilers compete in the playoffs and the Stanley Cup Final, Clark has sung the anthems from within the crowd. Before singing the anthems, public address announcer Al Stafford introduces him as \"The singing voice of your Edmonton Oilers\".\nMascot.\nThe Oilers mascot is a Canadian lynx named Hunter who was unveiled on September 26, 2016. The choice of the Canadian lynx was because their largest place of habitat, in terms of population, is Alberta. It was also because it was the largest vote overall. The name gives tribute to the original Oilers owner, William \"Wild Bill\" Hunter. Hunter wears the number 72 on his jersey, referencing the year the Oilers were established, which was in 1972. Hunter has a portable drum, in which he uses to entertain the crowds and make them chant \"Let's Go Oilers!\", along with a rhythmic beat.\nOilers Octane.\nThe Oilers Octane was the cheerleading team for the Edmonton Oilers. The team was the first cheer squad for a Canadian NHL franchise. The debut of the cheer-leading team received a mixed reaction from the Edmonton community, including petitions to keep cheerleading out of the sport of hockey in Canada.\nThe Octane performed for the first time on December 14, 2010, at a home game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The first team had 19 cheerleaders, women aged 18 to 29, dressed in uniforms that resembled the original Edmonton Oilers jerseys, albeit with skirts and knee-high boots.\nIn August 2016 the Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG), which owns the Oilers, announced it was discontinuing the Octane, saying the franchise was \"looking for a new direction related to the fan experience\" as the team prepared to move from Rexall Place to Rogers Place for the 2016\u201317 season. The Group also announced auditions for a newly formed, co-ed group of \"brand ambassadors\" named the Oilers Orange and Blue Ice Crew for the upcoming season.\nRivalries.\nThe Oilers have two well-known rivalries in the NHL, which are against the Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings.\nCalgary Flames.\nThe Oilers' rivalry with the Flames, also dubbed the Battle of Alberta, stems from several playoff matchups between the two franchises during the 1980s, which coincidentally was the dynasty era of the Oilers; Edmonton usually won these matchups. However, the Flames did defeat the Oilers in the 1986 division round.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nThe Oilers had a vicious rivalry with the Kings from the early 1980s to the early 1990s, which stemmed from numerous playoff duels, though the rivalry saw new life in the early 2020s. The rivalry notably included the Wayne Gretzky and Marty McSorley trade in which both players were traded from Edmonton to Los Angeles.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Oilers.

Inductees are selected based on their contributions or services to the team since its founding in 1972. The inaugural Class of 2022 members included Al Hamilton, Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Kevin Lowe, Glen Sather and Rod Phillips, all of whom had already seen their respective banners raised to the rafters. In addition, it was revealed that there would be another two further members seeing induction. On September 20, it was revealed that Lee Fogolin and Ryan Smyth would also join the enshrined banner honourees. On November 3, Fogolin and Smyth officially took their places in the 2022 Hall of Fame, during a pre-game ceremony before the Oilers played the New Jersey Devils at Rogers Place.\nBeginning in 2023, Oilers fans will be able to participate in the selection process for nominees into future Oilers Hall of Fame Classes. The 2023 Oilers of Fame Class had their induction ceremony during the 2023 Heritage Classic weekend event, which took place on October 26\u201329. On September 20, 2023, the Oilers announced that Charlie Huddy and former team captain Doug Weight would be the two members of the 2023 Hall of Fame class. Both Huddy and Weight were officially inducted before the Oilers game against the visiting New York Rangers, on October 26.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Oilers announced Craig MacTavish and Randy Gregg would be inducted into the Oilers Hall of Fame, ahead of their home game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 25.\nHockey Hall of Fame honourees.\nThe Oilers are affiliated with several inductees in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nTwelve Oilers players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Jacques Plante, who briefly played for the Oilers in the WHA was inducted in 1978. Regarded as one of the greatest goalies of all time, Plante led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cups through the 1950s and early 1960s. Norm Ullman, who played for the Oilers in the WHA was inducted in 1982. Ullman played 20 years for the Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs putting up 1,229 points. Ullman is among the top scoring forwards ever to play in the NHL. Wayne Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1999, after retiring the same year. Gretzky played 10 seasons with the Oilers and captained them to their first four Stanley Cup championships. Known as \"The Great One\", Gretzky is considered the greatest hockey player ever and holds the NHL record with most assists and points. In 2001, Jari Kurri became the first Finnish player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. An Oilers selection from the 1980 NHL entry draft, Kurri played 10 seasons with the Oilers, winning all five of their Stanley Cups. Goaltender Grant Fuhr, who was present during the \"dynasty era\" was inducted in 2003. In 2004, Paul Coffey was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Mark Messier was inducted in 2007, also in his first year of eligibility. Messier is often considered the Greatest Leader in professional sports and is to date, the only person in NHL history to ever captain two different Stanley Cup championship-winning teams, as a member of both the 1990 Edmonton Oilers and the 1994 New York Rangers. In 2008, Glenn Anderson became the final Oilers player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame during the 2000s. Adam Oates was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2012. Oates played 60 games with the Oilers after signing a one-year contract in 2003. Considered an elite playmaker, Oates totaled 1,079 assists which at the time of his retirement made him the fifth most assisted player in NHL history. Chris Pronger, who played defence for the Oilers was inducted in 2015. Pronger helped lead the Oilers to their 2006 Stanley Cup run. Kevin Lowe was inducted in 2020. Lowe played with the Oilers from 1979 to 1992 and from 1996 to 1998. After retiring, Lowe became head coach of the Oilers and soon after became their general manager. The most recent inductee who played for the Oilers is Duncan Keith in 2025, who played defence during the 2021\u201322 season.\nSix Oilers builders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The first was Glen Sather, who was inducted in 1997. Sather was a head coach for the Oilers from 1976 to 2000, leading them to four Stanley Cups. Roger Neilson who was inducted in 2002, briefly worked for the Oilers as a video analyst during the 1984 Stanley Cup playoffs. Broadcaster Rod Phillips was awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003. Pat Quinn, who coached the Oilers for one year in 2009 was posthumously inducted in 2016.

{"id": "73132", "revid": "19992876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73132", "title": "Minnesota Wild", "text": "National Hockey League team in St. Paul, Minnesota\nThe Minnesota Wild are a professional ice hockey team based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The Wild compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at the Grand Casino Arena, and is owned by Craig Leipold. The Wild are affiliated with the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Iowa Heartlanders of the ECHL.\nThe Wild were founded on June 25, 1997, and began play in the 2000\u201301 season. The team was founded following the departure of the Minnesota North Stars, who were based in Minnesota from 1967 to 1993, when they relocated to Dallas, Texas, and became the Dallas Stars. The Wild made their first Stanley Cup playoffs appearance in 2003, making a surprise run to the Western Conference finals, but ultimately losing to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The team have appeared in the playoffs a total of 14 times, and have won one division championship, in 2008.\nHistory.\nPreparations of a new franchise.\nFollowing the departure of the Minnesota North Stars after the 1992\u201393 season, the state of Minnesota was without an NHL team for seven seasons. Saint Paul mayor (and future U.S. Senator) Norm Coleman began a campaign to either recruit an existing franchise to the city or an expansion franchise to a Minnesota-based ownership group. These efforts came close to success in the mid-1990s when Minnesota interests purchased the original Winnipeg Jets intending to relocate the franchise to Minnesota; however, arena negotiations at the Target Center fell through, and the Jets instead relocated to Phoenix, Arizona.\nFollowing the failed attempt to relocate the Jets, the NHL announced its intention to expand from 26 to 30 teams. Businessman and Minnetonka native Bob Naegele, Jr. became the lead investor for an application to the NHL for an expansion franchise and, ultimately, the first majority owner. On June 25, 1997, the National Hockey League (NHL) announced that Minnesota had been awarded an expansion franchise, to begin play in the 2000\u201301 season. The six finalist team names for the new NHL franchise (Blue Ox, Freeze, Northern Lights, Voyageurs, White Bears, and Wild), were announced on November 20, 1997. Jac Sperling was named chief executive officer of the Minnesota team, Doug Risebrough was named general manager, Tod Leiweke was named president, and Martha Fuller was named chief financial officer.\nThe team was officially named the Wild at an unveiling at the Aldrich Arena on January 22, 1998, with the song \"Born to Be Wild\" by Steppenwolf playing over the arena's speaker system. The Minnesota Wild announced its first major sponsorship agreement with MasterCard from First USA. It was the earliest that First USA had ever signed an agreement before a team began play (31 months). The State of Minnesota adopted legislation in April 1998 to loan $65\u00a0million to the City of Saint Paul to fund 50% of the estimated $130\u00a0million project costs for the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. The legislation also provided that only $48\u00a0million of the loan needed to be repaid if the team met the requirements to have an agreement in place during the lease term with the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission. The City of Saint Paul issued an additional $65\u00a0million in bonds, with roughly 90% of the debt service on the bonds and the repayment of the state loan coming from scheduled rent and payment instead of taxes from the Minnesota Wild. Deconstruction of the Saint Paul Civic Center began soon after. Designs were announced for the Xcel Energy Center and a groundbreaking ceremony for the Xcel Energy Center was hosted in Saint Paul.\nThe Minnesota Wild announced a 26-year partnership agreement with the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission (MASC). The Minnesota Wild-MASC partnership is the first partnership of its kind between a private professional sports team and a public amateur sports organization. Doug Risebrough was named executive vice president/general manager of Minnesota Wild and the Grand Casino Arena was completed and ready for use.\nEarly years (2000\u20132009).\nMarian Gaborik era.\nThe Wild named Jacques Lemaire their first head coach and the team picked Marian Gaborik third overall in the first round of the 2000 NHL entry draft. Gaborik scored the first-ever goal for the Wild in their franchise debut on October 6 at Anaheim. The Wild played their first-ever home game on October 11 against the Philadelphia Flyers and skated to a 3\u20133 tie. Minnesota native Darby Hendrickson scored the first-ever home goal for the Wild. Before the game, it was announced the team would retire the number 1 jersey, their first number retirement, with no Wild player ever wearing it, to honor all Minnesota fans, who the team claimed were the \"true\" \"number one\" to them. The most notable game of the year was the first visit of the Dallas Stars, who had formerly played in Minnesota as the Minnesota North Stars. The Wild rode an emotional sellout crowd of over 18,000 to a 6\u20130 shutout in Dallas' first regular season game in Minnesota since a neutral-site game in 1993. The season ended with Scott Pellerin as the leading scorer with 39 points while Wes Walz, Darby Hendrickson and Gaborik paced the team with 18 goals each.\nThe Wild got off to a strong start in the 2001\u201302 season by earning at least one point in their first seven games. However, the Wild finished in last place again with a record of 26\u201335\u201312\u20136. En route, there were signs the Wild were improving, as second-year speedster Gaborik had a solid sophomore season with 30 goals, including an invite to the NHL YoungStars Game, and Andrew Brunette led the team in scoring with 69 points.\nGaborik spent much of the 2002\u201303 season vying for the league scoring crown before slumping in the second half, and the Wild, in their first-ever playoff appearance, made it to the conference finals before being swept 4\u20130 by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Previously, the Wild had beaten the favored and third-seeded Colorado Avalanche in the first round in seven games, coming back from a 3\u20131 series deficit and winning both game 6 and 7 in overtime. Brunette scored the series-clinching goal, the last on Patrick Roy. In the conference semifinals, the Wild beat the fourth-seeded Vancouver Canucks, again in seven games, and again after being down 3\u20131 in a series. In the process, the Wild became the first team in playoff history to capture a seven-game series twice after facing elimination during game 5.\nWhen the 2003\u201304 season started, the Wild were short-handed with both Pascal Dupuis and Gaborik holding out. After struggling in the first month, the Wild finally got their two young star left-wingers signed, but both struggled to get back into game shape as the Wild struggled through much of November. In a deep hole, the Wild did not make it to the playoffs, despite finishing the season strong, with wins in five of their last six games as they finished last in the competitive Northwest Division with a record of 30\u201329\u201320\u20133. Along the way, the Wild began to gear up for the future, trading away several of their older players who were a part of the franchise from the beginning, including Brad Bombardir and Jim Dowd.\nThe 2004\u201305 season was canceled due to an NHL lockout. Former Wild player Sergei Zholtok died from a heart condition during a game in Europe. Zholtok died in the arms of Minnesotan and former Wild player Darby Hendrickson.\nAfter the lockout.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the first season after the lockout, Minnesota finished in fifth and last place in the Northwest Division, eight points behind fourth-placed Vancouver Canucks. En route, Marian Gaborik set a new franchise record for goals in a season at 38, and Brian Rolston set a new highest point total by a Wild player in a season at 79. The goaltender controversy between Manny Fernandez and Dwayne Roloson ended when Roloson was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for a first-round pick in the 2006 NHL entry draft.\nThe Wild signed veteran free agents Kim Johnsson, Mark Parrish, Branko Radivojevic and Keith Carney. On the day of the NHL entry draft, it traded the 17th overall pick and prospect Patrick O'Sullivan to the Los Angeles Kings for veteran Slovak Pavol Demitra. Niklas Backstrom was the starting goalie for the Wild after previous starter Manny Fernandez sprained his knee on January 20. Fernandez played for the first time since the sprain on March 6 and was removed after allowing three goals in two periods in the Wild's 3\u20130 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Josh Harding was brought up from the Wild's AHL affiliate, the Houston Aeros, when Fernandez was hurt and remained on Minnesota's roster for the rest of the season as the backup goalie. All-Star winger Marian Gaborik returned from a groin injury in January 2007 and made an immediate impact, bringing a new spark to a lacking offense. The Wild made the playoffs in 2007 for the second time in team history, but were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions Anaheim Ducks in the conference quarterfinals.\nThe Wild broke numerous franchise records during the 2007\u201308 season, including most goals and points (Marian Gaborik \u2013 42 goals and 83 points). Also, Jacques Lemaire recorded his 500th career coaching win as the Wild clinched their first-ever Northwest Division title in a 3\u20131 victory over the Calgary Flames on April 3, 2008. They again faced the Colorado Avalanche in the conference quarterfinals, and the Wild held home-ice advantage. However, Minnesota came up short, being eliminated in six games by the Avalanche.\nDuring the 2008 off-season, the Wild re-acquired Andrew Brunette from Colorado and traded for defenseman Marek Zidlicky. The Wild also signed free agents Antti Miettinen and Owen Nolan to multi-year deals. There seemed to be a stigma about Jacques Lemaire's defensive system that caused a number of top free agents to avoid the Wild.\nDespite winning the Northwest Division the previous season, the Wild fell to ninth place in the Western Conference in 2008\u201309, missing the playoffs. Much of this was in part due to a lack of scoring and overall team offense, and the injuries to star forward Marian Gaborik, who only played 17 games. Jacques Lemaire, head coach of the Wild since the team's inception in the 2000\u201301 season, resigned at season's end. General manager Doug Risebrough was later fired, leading to a nearly complete turnover in the Wild's coaching and hockey management staff.\nChuck Fletcher era (2009\u20132018).\nMikko Koivu years.\nIn the 2009 off-season, Marian Gaborik signed with the New York Rangers during the summer as a free agent. Team owner Craig Leipold hired former Pittsburgh Penguins assistant general manager Chuck Fletcher as general manager. Later that summer, Fletcher selected Todd Richards as head coach. Martin Havlat was signed via free agency after playing the previous three seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks in order to lessen the blow of Gaborik's departure. During the first month of the 2009\u201310 season, the team announced their first-ever full-time captain, Mikko Koivu. In 2009, Leipold named Matt Majka as chief operating officer of the team.\nThe 2009\u201310 and the 2010\u201311 seasons ended in disappointment for the Wild as they missed the playoffs in both seasons. In the 2010 NHL entry draft, the Wild held the ninth overall pick and used it to select Finnish forward Mikael Granlund. The Wild opened the 2010\u201311 season with two games at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki against the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the 2010\u201311 season, the team fired head coach Todd Richards due to the team failing to reach the playoffs in his two seasons as head coach with a 77\u201371\u201316 record. Mike Yeo, who coached the Wild's AHL affiliate Houston Aeros to a Western Conference title in 2011, was named the new head coach.\nDuring the 2011 NHL entry draft (which the team hosted), the Wild used their tenth overall pick to select Jonas Brodin. The club also created a stir when they traded star defenseman Brent Burns and a second-round pick in 2012 to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Devin Setoguchi, Charlie Coyle and the 28th overall pick in the 2011 draft, which they used to select Zack Phillips. Later in the off-season, the Wild traded Martin Havlat for Dany Heatley in another blockbuster trade with the Sharks. In November, the team set a franchise record for most wins in one month with 11. Despite a hot start to the season that saw them sitting atop the NHL standings in early December, multiple injuries to key players for extended periods effectively eliminated the team from playoff contention for the fourth consecutive year.\nParise\u2013Suter era.\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the team was able to sign top prospect Mikael Granlund to a three-year, entry-level contract. During the 2012 NHL entry draft, the team selected Matt Dumba with the seventh overall pick. In the same off-season, the Wild also signed unrestricted free agent winger Zach Parise, a Twin Cities native, and defenseman Ryan Suter to identical 13-year, US$98\u00a0million contracts. However, the team's busy off-season was overshadowed by the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout, which ended in January 2013.\nPrior to the 2013 trade deadline, the Wild acquired Jason Pominville from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for prospects Johan Larsson and Matt Hackett, as well as draft picks. The team reached the postseason for the fourth time in franchise history after a 3\u20131 win over the Colorado Avalanche on April 27, 2013. After finishing in eighth place in the Western Conference, the Wild lost in five games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the 2013 playoffs.\nThe relocation and rebranding of the Atlanta Thrashers as the \"new\" Winnipeg Jets in 2011 meant Winnipeg was once again Minnesota's second-closest geographical rival after Chicago, and led the NHL to reconsider its divisional alignment. Even before the NHL's return to Winnipeg, Wild management had lobbied repeatedly for a move out of the Northwest Division, where they were the only Central Time Zone team. Among the alignments considered was having the Jets replace the Avalanche in the Northwest, but Wild management strongly objected to this alignment as it would have left them as the only American team in their division. Following protracted negotiations both amongst the owners and with the National Hockey League Players' Association, in 2013, the NHL collapsed its six divisions into four and dissolved the Northwest Division. Consequently, the Wild moved into the Central Division along with the Jets and Avalanche; the Canadian teams from the Northwest moved back to the Pacific Division. The Wild now share their division with not only the Blackhawks but also the Dallas Stars, the Wild's predecessors in Minnesota, and the St. Louis Blues, another major rival of the North Stars during the Norris Division era. Thus, the 2013 Blackhawks\u2013Wild playoff series was seen as the rebirth of the old Chicago\u2013Minnesota rivalry in the NHL.\nThe 2013\u201314 regular season for the Wild was the best the team had since the 2007\u201308 season, good enough to claim the first Wild Card position. Jason Pominville became the Wild's third player in franchise history to reach the 30-goal mark, with Mikko Koivu surpassing Marian Gaborik in all-time points for the club. The Wild battled goaltender problems throughout the entire season. It began with Josh Harding leading the NHL in save percentage, and goals-against average, before being placed on injured reserve for complications with his multiple sclerosis (MS). Backstrom also suffered a season-ending injury with abdominal issues. The Wild started five different goalies during the year and dressed seven. At the trade deadline, general manager Chuck Fletcher acquired Ilya Bryzgalov from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a fourth-round pick, as well as Matt Moulson and Cody McCormick from Buffalo in exchange for Torrey Mitchell and two second-round picks in 2014 and 2016. In the playoffs, the team would face Colorado, who won the Central Division. The Wild won the series four games to three with an overtime goal in game 7 by Nino Niederreiter. The team would then face the defending Stanley Cup champions Chicago, where they were eliminated in six games.\nDuring the 2014 off-season, the Wild signed forward Thomas Vanek as a free agent. In 2014\u201315, the Wild clinched the first wild card spot in the West by defeating the Chicago Blackhawks. They then defeated the Central Division champions, the St. Louis Blues, in the first round of the playoffs in six games. In the second round, the Wild were eliminated in a four-game series sweep by Chicago. Following the loss, forward Matt Cooke said, \"Our expectations inside this room were a lot higher than [a] second-round series.\"\nIn 2016, the Wild set a franchise record with the best win record in the first 41 games of the season. Immediately afterward, they went into a skid, losing the next 13 of 14 games, culminating in the firing of head coach Mike Yeo. Under new interim head coach John Torchetti, the team snapped the losing streak but remained streaky throughout the rest of the season, managing to barely make the playoffs with a total of 87 points, the worst record of any playoff team in the shootout era (since 2005\u201306). In the first round, the Wild fell to the Central Division champion Dallas Stars in six games. During the 2016 off-season, the Wild signed free agent Eric Staal to a three-year contract. The Wild also hired Bruce Boudreau as their new head coach, replacing interim head coach John Torchetti.\nIn 2017, the Wild set their new franchise record for points (106), wins (49) and goals for (266). The Wild set a franchise-record 12-game win streak that was snapped on New Year's Eve 2016 by the Columbus Blue Jackets, a team also on a franchise-record win streak at the time. Nevertheless, Minnesota failed to win more than a game in the playoffs, losing in five games to St. Louis. Mikael Granlund led the team in points with 69, while new addition Eric Staal led the team in goals with 28. Mikko Koivu was a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy for best defensive forward, while Granlund was a finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy.\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Wild experienced significant roster turnover. Erik Haula was lost to the Vegas Golden Knights in the expansion draft (along with prospect Alex Tuch). Winger Jason Pominville and defenseman Marco Scandella were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for forwards Tyler Ennis and Marcus Foligno. Minnesota native Matt Cullen was signed as a free agent and returned to the Wild to shore up the fourth line (Cullen had previously played in Minnesota from 2010 to 2013). Captain Mikko Koivu signed a two-year extension, ensuring he would remain with the Wild through the 2019\u201320 season.\nFollowing another 100-point regular season, the Wild matched up with Central Division rival, the Winnipeg Jets, in the first round of the 2018 playoffs. The Jets defeated the Wild in five games, making it three straight seasons in which the Wild failed to advance past the first round. On April 23, 2018, shortly following the Wild's exit from the playoffs, owner Leipold announced he had fired general manager Fletcher after nine seasons with the team. Under Fletcher's leadership, the Wild qualified for the playoffs six consecutive years, but failed to advance beyond the second round.\nRebuilding and the Kirill Kaprizov era (2018\u2013present).\nOn May 21, 2018, Paul Fenton was hired as the third general manager in franchise history. During the 2018\u201319 season, the Wild struggled to keep up in the ultra-competitive Central Division as they had in previous seasons. Despite a renaissance year from Parise, many key players like Eric Staal and Jason Zucker regressed offensively from the season prior. Many reported that there was dysfunction in the organization, caused by a rift between Fenton, Boudreau and various players, ultimately leading the trading of several core players, such as Mikael Granlund, Charlie Coyle and Nino Niederreiter. The Wild finished the season with 83-points, finishing last in the division and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012.\nIn the 2019 off-season, the Wild signed free agent Mats Zuccarello to a five-year contract. On July 30, 2019, Fenton was fired as general manager, just 14 months after being hired to that position. On August 21, 2019, the Wild hired Bill Guerin as the fourth general manager in franchise history. On February 14, 2020, the Wild fired head coach Bruce Boudreau and named Dean Evason as interim head coach. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wild participated in the best-of-five qualifying round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, but were eliminated in four games at the hands of the Vancouver Canucks.\nKirill Kaprizov played his first NHL game with the Wild in January 2021, scoring the overtime winner against the Los Angeles Kings during his debut.\nOn September 21, 2021, Kirill Kaprizov signed a five-year, $45 million contract with the Wild. As a result of the contract, Kaprizov became the highest-paid sophomore player in NHL history.\nIn 2022, the team set franchise season highs in points (113) and wins (53). Kirill Kaprizov set franchise records in points (108), goals (47), and assists (61). They faced the division rival St. Louis Blues in the first round, but despite having home ice advantage and the services of recently acquired goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, were eliminated in six games. In the following off-season, forward Kevin Fiala was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for the draft rights to defenseman Brock Faber, while other notable players such as Nick Bjugstad and Nicolas Deslauriers were lost in free agency.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Wild traded goaltender Cam Talbot to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Filip Gustavsson, five days after signing Fleury to a new two-year contract. Despite a second consecutive 40-goal season from Kaprizov, the Wild struggled defensively in the early parts of the season before shifting entirely to lackluster offense and low-scoring games at the end. However, thanks to a stellar season from Gustavsson, the team finished with 103 points, earning third place in the Central Division and setting them up for a playoff matchup against the division rival Dallas Stars. The Wild signed Brock Faber to his entry-level contract shortly before the playoffs began and immediately following the loss of the Minnesota Golden Gophers to the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the 2023 Frozen Four championship game. The Wild were eliminated in six games, marking their eighth consecutive playoff series loss.\nThe Wild re-signed Gustavsson in the 2023 off-season but did not make any notable trades or acquisitions, opting instead to \"run it back\" with the previous year's squad. However, despite breakout performances from Faber and the 2020 ninth overall pick Marco Rossi, as well as Kaprizov's third consecutive 40-goal season, injuries to nearly every player in the starting lineup hindered the team, with key players such as Kaprizov, Joel Eriksson Ek, captain Jared Spurgeon, Marcus Foligno, Mats Zuccarello, and Jonas Brodin all missing substantial time. The Wild finished the season with 87 points, their lowest total since the 2018\u201319 season, and missed the playoffs for the first time since that year.\nTeam information.\nJerseys.\n2000\u20132007.\nFor its first seven years in the NHL, the Wild wore a uniform of either a green or white jersey with red and gold stripes and the primary logo on the front of the jersey. The shoulder patch was a circle with \"Minnesota Wild\" read in distinctive lettering from both words. The name and numbering on the green jersey would be gold with red outlining while on the white jersey it was red with gold outlining. In 2003\u201304, with the NHL reversing the convention regarding the home and road jersey colors, the green jersey became the home jersey while the white one became the road jersey.\n2007\u20132017.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, when all jerseys were converted to the new Reebok Edge uniform system, the white jersey was retained and the home jersey replaced with a new one that has a small imprint of the team's primary logo inside a white circle, which is surrounded by the words \"Minnesota Wild\" in a larger ring against a green background. The rest of the jersey is predominantly red, with additional swatches of green on the sleeves outlined with wheat. The away jersey uses a larger version of the primary logo without the concentric circles on a predominantly white jersey; in 2013, the lettering was updated to match the home and alternate sweaters, at the same time updating the sweater's look to a more traditional design. On August 30, 2009, the team unveiled another third/alternate jersey, which is predominantly green with wheat accents. It says \"Minnesota Wild\" in script writing across the chest.\nOn April 4, 2017, the Wild honored the Minnesota North Stars by wearing North Stars jerseys for warm-ups, despite the North Stars history belonging to the Dallas Stars. Martin Hanzal warmed up with number 91, as the North Stars retired number 19 in honor of Bill Masterton.\n2017\u2013present.\nOn June 20, 2017, the Wild introduced a new home uniform, as the NHL switched from Reebok to Adidas \u2013 a green jersey with their main logo, and a wheat-colored stripe through the center of the jersey. On the arms is a wheat-colored stripe with a smaller red stripe near the top of it. The Wild kept its away jersey design the same. The Wild, along with the rest of the NHL, did not have an alternate jersey for the 2017\u201318 season.\nOn September 23, 2023, the Wild unveiled an alternate green jersey based on the \"Reverse Retro\" look they wore the previous season (see below). This set added a right shoulder patch featuring a recolored \"State of Hockey\" alternate logo and captaincy patches shaped after the Minnesota state outline. This was the first time that Wild had an official alternate jersey since 2017.\nReverse Retro jersey.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Wild unveiled a \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in collaboration with Adidas. The uniform was a callback to the late 1970s Minnesota North Stars white uniform, with the Wild logo recolored to match the team's green and gold scheme. This design was reused again in the 2022\u201323 season, but with green now the base color.\nWinter Classic jersey.\nFor the 2022 Winter Classic, the Wild unveiled a special edition jersey inspired by various early Minnesota hockey teams. The jersey is primarily green with red shoulder yoke and red and wheat stripes. The front of the uniforms featured the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul (MPLS.\u2013ST. PAUL) identifier around three symbols: a red Minnesota state silhouette with \"MN\" inside, and two wheat stars referencing Gemini, the twin constellation. Brown gloves and pants were used to reflect early 20th century hockey gear.\n25th Anniversary jersey.\nDuring the 2025\u201326 season, the Wild brought back their original 2000\u20132013 white jersey for four games to commemorate the franchise's 25th anniversary in the NHL.\nGoal horn and songs.\nThe team has had a goal horn each season since its inception. The Wild are one of the few teams to not blast their goal horn whenever they score in a shootout.\nThe team's first goal songs were \"Born to Be Wild\" and \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" that was used in its inaugural season of 2000\u201301. The following season, the team removed \"Born to Be Wild\" but kept \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" through 2004, before the lockout. After the lockout in 2005, the Wild used a cover of \"Rock and Roll Part 1\" for the 2005\u201306 season. For the 2006\u201307 season, the team changed its goal song to \"Crowd Chant\" by Joe Satriani shortly after its release. After pop legend and Minneapolis native Prince died in April 2016, the team held a tribute to him at game 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs game against the Dallas Stars, and adopted \"Let's Go Crazy\" as their goal song. After a fan poll, the team permanently used \"Let's Go Crazy\" with the goal horn starting in the 2016\u201317 season. The Wild kept \"Crowd Chant\" as their win song. For the 2018\u201319 season, the team brought back \"Crowd Chant\" as its goal song and \"Let's Go Crazy\" became the win song, followed by the singing of the team fight song \"The State of Hockey\". For the pandemic-shortened season, the team used \"Jump Around\" by House of Pain as their goal song. In the 2021-22 Season, the Wild used \"Shout\" by The Isley Brothers as their goal song. \"Let's Go Crazy\" remains the win song.\nLogo.\nThe logo depicts both a forest landscape and the silhouette of a wild animal. The \"eye\" of the \"wild animal\" is the north star, in tribute to the departed Minnesota North Stars as well as the state's motto \"L'\u00c9toile du Nord\", meaning \"The Star of the North\". The mouth of the animal represents the Mississippi River, which starts in Minnesota. According to \"The Good Point\", questions surrounding the identity of the animal depicted have sparked debate amongst logo enthusiasts, earning accolades for its unique complexity in North American professional sports.\nIn 2008, \"Nordy\" was introduced as the official mascot of the team.\nOwnership.\nThe franchise was originally owned by a limited partnership formed by former majority owner Bob Naegele, Jr. of \"Naegele Sports, LLC\" in 1997. On January 10, 2008, it was announced the franchise was being sold to former Nashville Predators owner Craig Leipold. The NHL's Board of Governors officially approved Leipold's purchase of Minnesota Sports &amp; Entertainment (MSE) on April 10, 2008. Leipold, a resident of Racine, Wisconsin, completed the sale of the Nashville Predators to a local ownership group on December 7, 2007, a team he owned since the expansion franchise was awarded to Nashville in 1997.\nLeipold is the majority owner and principal investor in MSE, a regional sports and entertainment leader that includes the NHL's Minnesota Wild, its AHL affiliate the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League, Wildside Caterers, 317 on Rice Park and the facility management of Grand Casino Arena and the Saint Paul RiverCentre. He also serves as the team's Governor at NHL Board of Governors' meetings. After purchase of MSE, Mr. Leipold sold the Swarm to John Arlotta. Along with the Wild, the group has year-round management rights of the Grand Casino Arena, and currently has a management contract to manage the adjoining Saint Paul RiverCentre and Roy Wilkins Auditorium; in addition the partnership also owns and operates 317 on Rice Park, which is the former historic Minnesota club.\nCommunity involvement.\nThe Minnesota Wild stay involved in the community through the philanthropic activities of the Minnesota Wild Foundation and its operations to support the game of hockey with events such as Hockey Day Minnesota. It has been celebrated every year since 2007. The Wild are 13-2-1 on Hockey Day Minnesota. Started in 2017, the Wild unveiled a new tradition called This Is Our Ice which encourages Wild fans to bring water from local ponds, lakes and rinks and add it to the Grand Casino Arena ice. Fans can bring water to any regular season home game and add it to the collection station which will then be added to the ice for the season.\nMinor league affiliates.\nMinnesota currently has two minor league affiliates: the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Iowa Heartlanders of the ECHL. The Iowa Wild is owned by the parent club, who relocated the franchise from Houston in 2013.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Wild.

{"id": "73133", "revid": "144202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73133", "title": "Vancouver Canucks", "text": "National Hockey League team in Canada\nThe Vancouver Canucks are a professional ice hockey team based in Vancouver. The Canucks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Rogers Arena. Adam Foote is the head coach, Jim Rutherford serves as the president of hockey operations and Patrik Allvin serves as the general manager.\nThe Canucks joined the league in 1970 as an expansion team along with the Buffalo Sabres. The team has advanced to the Stanley Cup Final three times, losing to the New York Islanders in 1982, the New York Rangers in 1994 and the Boston Bruins in 2011. They have won the Presidents' Trophy in back-to-back seasons as the team with the league's best regular season record in both the 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 seasons. The Canucks have won three division titles as a member of the Smythe Division from 1974 to 1993, seven titles as a member of the Northwest Division from 1998 to 2013, and one title as a member of the Pacific Division in 2024. The Canucks, along with the Sabres, are the two oldest teams in the NHL to have never won the Stanley Cup.\nThe Canucks have retired six players' jerseys in their history\u2014Pavel Bure (10), Stan Smyl (12), Trevor Linden (16), Markus Naslund (19), Daniel Sedin (22) and Henrik Sedin (33); all but Bure and Daniel Sedin have served as team captain, and all but Naslund were on one of the three Stanley Cup Final rosters. Smyl has the distinction of being the only Canuck to have his jersey number retired at their former arena, Pacific Coliseum.\nHistory.\nBackground and establishment.\nThe first professional ice hockey team based in Vancouver was the Vancouver Millionaires, formed by Frank and Lester Patrick. Established in 1911, the Millionaires were one of three teams in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association. To accommodate the Millionaires, the Patrick brothers directed the building of the Denman Arena, which was known at the time as the world's largest artificial ice rink. The arena was later destroyed in a fire in 1936. The Millionaires played for the Stanley Cup five times, winning over the Ottawa Senators in 1915 on home ice. It marked the first time the Stanley Cup was won by a West Coast team in the trophy's history. Absorbed by the Western Canada Hockey League in 1924, the team continued operations until folding at the end of the 1925\u201326 WHL season.\nFrom 1926 to 1970, Vancouver was home to only minor league teams. Most notably the present-day Canucks' minor league predecessor (also known as the Vancouver Canucks) played from 1945 to 1970 in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Hockey League.\nNHL application.\nWith the intention of attracting an NHL franchise, Vancouver began the construction of a new modern arena, the Pacific Coliseum, in 1966 (with the arena opening in January 1968). The WHL's Canucks were playing in a small arena at the time, the Vancouver Forum, situated on the same Pacific National Exhibition grounds as the Coliseum. Meanwhile, a Vancouver group led by WHL Canucks owner and former Vancouver mayor Fred Hume made a bid to be one of the six teams due to join the league in 1967, but the NHL rejected their application. Bid leader Cyrus McLean called the denial a \"cooked-up deal\", referring to several biases that factored against them. Speculation long abounded afterwards that the bid was hindered by Toronto Maple Leafs president Stafford Smythe; after a failed Vancouver-based business deal, he was quoted as saying that the city would not get an NHL franchise in his lifetime. Additionally, along with the Montreal Canadiens, Smythe purportedly did not wish to split Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) hockey revenues three ways rather than two.\nLess than a year later, the Oakland Seals were in financial difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL did not want to see one of their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and vetoed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion round. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6 million (three times the cost in 1967). The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the 1970\u201371 season.\nIn preparation for joining the NHL, the WHL Canucks had brought in players with prior NHL experience. Six of these players (John Arbour, George Gardner, Len Lunde, Marc Reaume, Ted Taylor and Murray Hall) would remain with the club for its inaugural NHL season. The rest of the roster was built through an expansion draft.\nEarly years (1970\u20131982).\nTo fill the Canucks' roster for their inaugural season, the league held an expansion draft in the preceding summer. A draft lottery was held on June 9, 1970, determining who between the Canucks and Sabres would get the first selection in the expansion draft, as well as the 1970 NHL amateur draft; the Sabres won both spins. With his first selection in the expansion draft, Canucks general manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak. Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach, who was named the Canucks' first captain, as well as defenceman Pat Quinn, who later became the team's general manager and coach in the 1990s. Two days later, on June 11, 1970, the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first-ever Amateur Draft selection. Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks. By comparison, the Sabres chose centre Gilbert Perreault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery; Perreault went on to become a nine-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nWith the Canucks' roster set, the team played its inaugural game against the Los Angeles Kings on October 9, 1970. They lost the contest 3\u20131; defenceman Barry Wilkins scored the Canucks' lone goal in the game and first in franchise history, a backhander against goaltender Denis DeJordy. Two days later, the squad recorded the first win in franchise history, a 5\u20133 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Canucks struggled in their early years, failing to make the playoffs in their first four seasons. Placed in the competitive East Division, Poile assembled a core of players during this period led by Kurtenbach that included defencemen Tallon and Jocelyn Guevremont, as well as wingers Andre Boudrias and Dennis Ververgaert. Boudrias emerged as the team's leading point-scorer in four of their first five seasons.\nPrior to the 1974\u201375 season, Scallen and his ownership group from Minnesota sold the team to local media mogul Frank Griffiths for $9\u00a0million. Also in the summer of 1974, the Canucks were re-aligned within the league and placed in the new Smythe Division. They responded with their first winning record (38 wins, 32 losses and 10 ties), backstopped by goaltender Gary \"Suitcase\" Smith finishing first in the Division with 86 points. Making their debut in the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks lost the opening series of the 1975 playoffs in five games to the Montreal Canadiens. Head coach and general manager Phil Maloney (the third general manager in team history after Poile and Hal Laycoe) recalled the importance of a successful season for the Canucks in that year specifically, as the rival league World Hockey Association (WHA) had established another major professional team in the city, the Vancouver Blazers. Competing for the same hockey market, the Canucks emerged over the Blazers as the latter relocated to Calgary, Alberta, the following season. The Canucks posted a second consecutive winning record and made the playoffs in 1975\u201376, but lost to the New York Islanders in a two-game preliminary series. It would be another 16 years until the team would have another winning record though they made the playoffs nine times in that span.\nKurtenbach retired and assumed a coaching position with Vancouver. His departure as a player marked the beginning of a seven-year period in which the Canucks had four different captains\u2014Boudrias, Chris Oddleifson, Don Lever and Kevin McCarthy. Following the 1976\u201377 season, Maloney was replaced as general manager by Jake Milford, who acquired such players as Stan Smyl, Thomas Gradin, Darcy Rota, Ivan Boldirev and Richard Brodeur, a core that would lead the team throughout the 1980s.\n1982 Stanley Cup run.\nThe Canucks made their first significant playoff impact in the 1982 playoffs. In their previous five playoff appearances, the team had failed to win a single series. Though the Canucks finished three games under a .500 win percentage in the 1981\u201382 regular season, they began gaining momentum by finishing the campaign on a nine-game unbeaten streak. Meanwhile, Smyl emerged as the club's leader, replacing McCarthy as the captain after the latter was sidelined with an injury late in the season (he would retain that position for a team-record eight years). Continuing their success in the playoffs, the Canucks made the Stanley Cup Final with a combined 11\u20132 record in series against the Calgary Flames, Los Angeles Kings, and Chicago Black Hawks. Despite having a losing regular season record, Vancouver had a home-ice advantage in the first series, having finished second in the Smythe Division to the Edmonton Oilers. The Canucks also had a home-ice advantage during the second-round series against the Kings, who upset the Oilers in the first round.\nLate in game 2 of the conference finals in Chicago, Vancouver's interim head coach Roger Neilson, frustrated with what he felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white towel on the end of a hockey stick and held it up in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag). The players on the Canucks' bench followed suit. When the series shifted to Vancouver for the next two games, the team's fans cheered them on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports, known as \"Towel Power.\" The Canucks proceeded to win the series in five games, making it to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in their history.\nEntering the Stanley Cup Final against the New York Islanders, the Canucks were the first team from Western Canada to play for the Stanley Cup in 56 years, when the Victoria Cougars reached the 1926 Stanley Cup Final. It also marked the first-ever coast-to-coast Stanley Cup Final. Competing against the Islanders\u2014the Stanley Cup champions of the previous two years, who had finished with 41 points more than Vancouver in the regular season standings\u2014Vancouver took the first game to overtime. In the final minute of the extra period, Canucks defenceman and fan favourite Harold Snepsts gave the puck away with an errant pass from behind his net, leading to a Mike Bossy goal. Like the first game, the Canucks held a 3\u20132 lead after the first two periods in the second game, but were not able to keep their lead, and lost 6\u20134. The Canucks were unable to complete their Cinderella run and were swept, losing their next two games by 3\u20130 and 3\u20131 scores. The 1982 playoffs proved to be the last year in which Vancouver won a playoff series until 1992.\nDecline (1982\u20131987).\nAfter their improbable Stanley Cup run, the Canucks slipped back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, making the playoffs only four times for the rest of the decade. Notable players that joined the Canucks' core following the 1982 playoffs included offensively skilled forwards Patrik Sundstrom and Tony Tanti. Beginning in 1983\u201384, the Canucks' scoring title was held by either Sundstrom or Tanti for four of the next five seasons, the only season in which neither won the team scoring title was in 1985\u201386, when it was won by Petri Skriko. For most of the second half of the 1980s, the Canucks competed with the Los Angeles Kings for the final playoff spot in the Smythe Division. In the years in which they qualified for the playoffs, the team was eliminated in the first round by either the Edmonton Oilers (in 1986) or the Calgary Flames (in 1983, 1984 and the Flames' championship season in 1989, which was decided in game 7), both division rivals.\nFollowing Milford's tenure as general manager from 1977 to 1982, the position was held by Harry Neale for three years, then Jack Gordon for two. The latter was responsible for trading away power forward Cam Neely to the Boston Bruins in 1986. In addition to Neely, the Canucks gave up their 1987 first-round draft pick, with which the Bruins chose Glen Wesley, and in return acquired centre Barry Pederson. While Pederson collected back-to-back 70-point seasons with the Canucks in his first two seasons after the trade, he was traded away to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1989 as his performance quickly declined. Neely went on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Bruins, recording three 50-goal seasons, and Wesley had a solid 20-year career.\nPat Quinn era (1987\u20131998).\nAfter the installation of former Canucks defenceman Pat Quinn as general manager in the summer of 1987, the team underwent an immediate rebuilding process, trading away core veterans for younger prospects and players. Among the more key transactions was a deal with the New Jersey Devils, in which Sundstrom was traded away in exchange for winger Greg Adams and goaltender Kirk McLean. In addition to Quinn's trades, the team improved through the draft route with two selections, in particular. With the second overall selection in the 1988 NHL entry draft, the Canucks chose winger Trevor Linden from the Western Hockey League (WHL). The following year, the team made a controversial selection by choosing Russian winger Pavel Bure 113th overall. Bure was believed by most teams to be ineligible for selection that year. Consequently, his draft by the Canucks took a year to be verified by the league as team management went about procuring documents to prove his eligibility.\nAs the decade turned, a shift in the Canucks' leadership occurred as Stan Smyl resigned his captaincy prior to the 1990\u201391 season due to a reduced on-ice role with the team. In his place, the Canucks implemented a rotating captaincy of Linden, Dan Quinn and Doug Lidster; of the three, Linden retained the captaincy thereafter, becoming the youngest permanent captain in team history at 21 years of age. At the end of the season, Smyl retired as the team's all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Led by Linden and in large part to Quinn's dealings, the Canucks rose to prominence in the early 1990s. This increased success came roughly around the time the Oilers and Flames began to sink in the standings. As a result, Vancouver won their first division title in 17 years with 42 wins, 26 losses and 12 ties during the 1991\u201392 season (it was also the team's first winning season since the 1975\u201376 season). During the campaign, the Canucks honoured Smyl, who had remained on the team as an assistant coach, by making him the first player in team history to have his jersey (number 12) retired. In the 1992 playoffs, the Canucks won their first series since 1982 before being eliminated by the Oilers in the second round. Quinn and Bure became the first Canucks recipients of major NHL awards in the off-season, being awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach (Quinn assumed a dual coaching and general managerial role starting that year) and the top rookie in the league, respectively. The following year, the Canucks repeated as regular season division champions, while Bure emerged as arguably the team's first superstar with his first of back-to-back 60-goal seasons, totals which remain the highest recorded in Canucks history. As the team struggled to score in the second half of the 1993\u201394 season, Bure recorded 49 goals in the club's final 51 games and contributed to 46.45% of his team's goals in the final 47 games of the season to carry the Canucks into the 1994 postseason. Jim Matheson of the \"Edmonton Journal\" called Bure \"the NHL's best forward the last 40 games, scoring almost a goal a game.\"\n1994 Stanley Cup run.\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, the Canucks made their second trip to the Stanley Cup Final, entering the 1994 playoffs as the seventh seed in the renamed Western Conference. Despite underachieving in the regular season (their points total decreased by 16 from the previous year, although they finished second in the newly renamed Pacific Division), the Canucks played well in the playoffs and embarked on another unexpected run.\nOpening the playoffs with a close first-round series against the Calgary Flames, Vancouver rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit to win the series in seven contests. Games 5 through 7 were all won in overtime with goals from Geoff Courtnall, Trevor Linden, and Pavel Bure, respectively. The deciding seventh game featured two of the most recognizable and celebrated plays in Canucks history. With the game tied 3\u20133 in the first overtime, goaltender Kirk McLean made what became known thereafter as \"The Save\", sliding across the crease feet-first and stacking his pads on the goal line to stop Robert Reichel on a one-timer pass from Theoren Fleury. The following period, Pavel Bure received a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown before deking Calgary goaltender Mike Vernon to score and win the series. Fifteen years later, Bure's goal and McLean's save were ranked first and second in a \"Vancouver Sun\" article listing the \"40 most memorable moments in team history.\"\nFollowing their victory over the Flames, the Canucks then upset both the Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs (both in five games) en route to the franchise's second Stanley Cup Final appearance. Forward Greg Adams sent the Canucks into the Stanley Cup Final with a double-overtime goal against Maple Leafs goaltender Felix Potvin in game 5. Staging the second coast-to-coast Final in league history, the Canucks were matched against the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers. Vancouver achieved victory in game 1 by a score of 3\u20132 in overtime, largely due to a 52-save performance by goaltender McLean. After losing the next 3 games, the Canucks won the next two to force a seventh game at Madison Square Garden on June 14, 1994. Despite a two-goal effort (one on a shorthanded breakaway) from Linden (who was playing with cracked ribs), Vancouver lost the game by a 3\u20132 score. The Canucks' efforts to tie the game included a post hit by forward Nathan LaFayette with just over a minute remaining in regulation. The loss was followed by a riot in Downtown Vancouver, which resulted in property damage, injuries and arrests. Two days after the riots, the team held a rally at BC Place attended by 45,000 fans, who congratulated the team for their effort.\nWith a young core that included Linden, Bure and McLean still in their 20s after the 1994 playoffs, the Canucks appeared poised to remain contenders in the league. However, the team failed to record a winning season in the six years following their Stanley Cup Final appearance. Prior to the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, Quinn stepped down as head coach to focus on his managerial duties and was replaced by Rick Ley; Vancouver finished with a .500 record that year. Their elimination from the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs in game 4 of the second round marked the Canucks' last game played at the Pacific Coliseum, as the team moved into the new General Motors Place (since renamed Rogers Arena), a new $160\u00a0million arena situated in Downtown Vancouver, the following season.\nThe Canucks made another significant move in the off-season by acquiring high-scoring Russian forward Alexander Mogilny from the Buffalo Sabres, reuniting Bure with his former CSKA Moscow and national team linemate. While Mogilny became the second player in team history to record 50 goals and 100 points in a season, chiefly playing with centre Cliff Ronning, the expected chemistry between Mogilny and Bure never materialized, with the latter suffering a season-ending knee injury early in the campaign. Vancouver finished 1995\u201396 two games below .500 and were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Colorado Avalanche. The season also marked the arrival of another future Canucks superstar, as Markus Naslund was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Alek Stojanov. The deal is regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history, as Stojanov soon became a minor-leaguer, while Naslund became the team's all-time leading goal- and point-scorer years later. Despite a late season swoon, Ley was fired and replaced by Quinn down the stretch. The team limped into the playoffs, losing to the Colorado Avalanche in the first round.\nIn the 1996 off-season, Quinn hired Tom Renney whose tenure as the team's head coach lasted less than two seasons. Despite strong performances from Mogilny and team-leading point-scorer Martin Gelinas in Bure and Linden's absence (both of whom were injured for long periods of time during the season), the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first of four consecutive seasons that year. Making another high-profile acquisition on July 27, 1997, the Canucks signed free agent Mark Messier to a three-year deal. They had come close to signing Wayne Gretzky the previous summer, but were reportedly spurned away when they refused to continue negotiations and gave Gretzky an ultimatum to sign.\nKeenan and Messier (1997\u20131998).\nHeading into the 1997\u201398 season, Linden resigned his captaincy for Messier, who had developed a strong reputation as a leader, having captained the New York Rangers over the Canucks in 1994 (he also captained the Oilers to a Stanley Cup in 1990). Linden later recalled regretting the decision, feeling that Messier generated hostility and tension in the dressing room. Messier later said if he could change one thing about his time in Vancouver, he would not have accepted the captaincy.\nThe Canucks began the campaign overseas in a two-game series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo, Japan. It marked the first time in NHL history that a regular season game was held outside of North America\u2014an effort from the league to attract attention to the sport in anticipation of the 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, Japan. As the team's performance continued to worsen, starting the 1997\u201398 season with three wins in the first 16 games, Quinn was fired as general manager after ten years with the team. Soon thereafter, Renney was fired and replaced as coach by Mike Keenan, reuniting him with Messier, another central figure from the Rangers' 1994 team. Keenan's hiring reportedly exacerbated tensions between groups of Canucks players and his negative relationship with Linden was given ample media attention. Two months into his tenure with the team, his role was expanded and he was made de facto general manager. With control of player personnel, Keenan overhauled the roster, making ten trades within two months, most notably dealing Linden to the New York Islanders. Although the trade was unpopular with fans, the Canucks received winger Todd Bertuzzi in return, who would later become an integral part of the team's return to success in the next decade. Defenceman Bryan McCabe was also part of the deal, who would eventually be involved in a key transaction in the 1999 NHL entry draft.\nBrian Burke era (1998\u20132004).\nWest Coast Express years and the early years of the Sedins (1998\u20132006).\nAfter the Canucks finished the 1997\u201398 season last in the Western Conference, former NHL vice president Brian Burke was named general manager in the summer. Suffering their worst season since 1977\u201378 the subsequent year, Keenan was fired midway through and replaced with Marc Crawford (who had won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 1996). Meanwhile, Pavel Bure, unhappy in Vancouver, had withheld himself from the team and requested a trade at the beginning of the campaign. By January 1999, he was dealt to the Florida Panthers in a seven-player trade, which saw eventual five-time NHL All-Star Ed Jovanovski heading west. The trade also involved two draft picks. Finishing last in the Western Conference for a second straight year, Vancouver possessed the third overall pick in the 1999 NHL entry draft. Set on drafting highly touted Swedish forwards Daniel and Henrik Sedin, Burke orchestrated several transactions to move up to the second and third overall picks, with which he chose both players.\nThe Canucks began to show improvement in the 1999\u20132000 season, finishing four points out of a playoff spot. During the campaign, Mogilny was traded to the New Jersey Devils for forwards Denis Pederson and Brendan Morrison. With Bure gone and Messier in the last year of his contract, several previously under-achieving players began developing into key contributors for the team, most notably Markus Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi. In the off-season, Messier left the team and returned to the Rangers; during the team's September 2000 training camp, held in Sweden, Naslund was selected to replace Messier as captain, a position he held for seven seasons. As part of the team's stay in Sweden, they played exhibition games against Swedish and Finnish teams as part of the NHL Challenge.\nUnder the leadership of general manager Brian Burke and head coach Marc Crawford, the Canucks once again became a playoff team. After qualifying for the postseason in 2001 and 2002 as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference (losing to the eventual Stanley Cup winners Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings, respectively), the Canucks became regular contenders for the Northwest Division title.\nCoinciding with the team's success in the early 2000s was the rise of power forward Todd Bertuzzi and captain Markus Naslund into high-scoring wingers and NHL All-Stars. Joined by centre Brendan Morrison during the 2001\u201302 season, the trio were nicknamed the \"West Coast Express\" (after the Vancouver rail service of the same name) among Canucks fans and media. Over the next three years, Naslund ranked in the top five among league scorers and was a Lester B. Pearson Award winner and Hart Memorial Trophy finalist in 2003. Bertuzzi was also a top-five scorer in the league in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303. During this span, Burke made a trade with the Washington Capitals to facilitate the return of Trevor Linden. The ex-captain returned to a markedly different Canucks team with a young core consisting of the aforementioned trio, defencemen Ed Jovanovski and Mattias Ohlund, as well as goaltender Dan Cloutier.\nIn 2002\u201303, the Canucks set a franchise record with a 10-game win streak but lost the division title to the Colorado Avalanche on the last day of the regular season. Individually, Naslund was surpassed the same night by Avalanche forwards Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk for the Art Ross Trophy and Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, respectively. Entering the 2003 playoffs with the fourth seed in the Western Conference, the Canucks won their first playoff series in eight years, defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games before losing to the Minnesota Wild in the second round. In both series, they were 3\u20131 comebacks; the Canucks rallied to beat the Blues, but lost their own 3\u20131 lead to the Wild, who had also come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the first round, against the Avalanche.\nAmidst a run for the team's first Northwest Division title the following season, the Canucks received significant media attention for their involvement in a violent on-ice attack during a game against the Avalanche. On March 8, 2004, Bertuzzi grabbed Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind and punched him in the head. As Moore fell to the ice, Bertuzzi landed on top of him; Moore suffered three fractured neck vertebrae, facial cuts and a concussion. The incident was in retaliation of a hit that Moore landed on Naslund during a previous game between the two teams. For his actions, Bertuzzi was suspended by the NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) through to the start of the 2005\u201306 season. He also faced legal action in British Columbia court, while Moore filed lawsuits against him and the Canucks organization in Colorado and Ontario courts.\nThe Canucks went on to win their first Northwest Division title that season, but lost in the first round of the 2004 playoffs to the Calgary Flames. After their elimination, Burke's contract as general manager was not renewed and he was replaced by assistant general manager and director of hockey operations Dave Nonis. At 37 years old, he became the youngest general manager in team history. Due to the NHL lockout, the 2004\u201305 season was not played. Several Canucks players went overseas to Europe to play professionally, including Naslund and the Sedin twins, who all returned to their former Swedish team, Modo Hockey.\nDave Nonis era (2004\u20132008).\nUpon the resolution of the labour dispute between NHL players and owners, new gameplay rules were set in place for the 2005\u201306 season that were intended to benefit skilled players and generate more goal-scoring. As the Canucks' basis of success in previous seasons was built on playing a fast-paced, high-scoring style of play, expectations for the team were high going into the season. However, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs, completing the regular season ninth place in the conference. The first line of Naslund, Bertuzzi and Morrison suffered offensively, as all three players recorded decreased points totals. Head coach Marc Crawford later recalled the campaign as a turning point for the team's offensive leadership as the Sedin twins began their rise to stardom, matching the top line's production. Crawford was fired in the off-season and replaced with Alain Vigneault, who had been coach of the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Three days after Vigneault's hiring, Nonis dealt Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, ending the \"West Coast Express\" era. In return, the Canucks received All-Star goaltender Roberto Luongo as part of a six-player trade. With the acquisition of Luongo, Cloutier was traded away to the Los Angeles Kings.\nWith widespread changes to team personnel in 2006\u201307, the Canucks won the Northwest Division title for the second time in three seasons. In his first season with the Canucks, Luongo was nominated for the Hart Memorial and Vezina Trophies. He also tied Bernie Parent for the second-most wins in a single-season by an NHL goaltender, with 47. The Canucks opened the 2007 playoffs with a quadruple-overtime win against the Dallas Stars. Ending at the 138-minute mark, the game was the longest in club history and the sixth-longest in NHL history. The Canucks also set a league record for shots against in one game, allowing 76. Vancouver won the series in seven games despite a lack of goal-scoring; Stars goaltender Marty Turco recorded three shutouts in the series and equalled the league record for most shutouts in a playoff series. Advancing to the second round, the team was defeated in five games by the Anaheim Ducks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup that year. Following the playoffs, head coach Vigneault received the Jack Adams Award.\nSuffering numerous injuries to players in the 2007\u201308 season, the Canucks struggled and finished three points out of a playoff spot. The final game of the season, a 7\u20131 loss to the Calgary Flames, marked Trevor Linden's last NHL game, as the former Canucks' all-time leading scorer retired. Having missed the playoffs for the second time in three years, the team underwent numerous personnel changes in the off-season.\nMike Gillis era (2008\u20132014).\nReturn to the playoffs (2008\u20132010).\nAfter Nonis was fired and replaced with former player agent Mike Gillis in April 2008, longtime Canucks captain Markus Naslund, as well as Brendan Morrison, were let go via free agency. Also in the off-season, on May 29, 2008, the Canucks lost defensive prospect Luc Bourdon to a fatal motorcycle crash near his hometown of Shippagan, New Brunswick.\nWith Naslund's departure, Gillis announced on September 30, 2008, that Roberto Luongo had been named team captain, marking the first time since Bill Durnan of the Montreal Canadiens in 1947\u201348 that a goaltender had been named the captain of an NHL team. During the ensuing season, the Canucks retired their second jersey number in team history, hanging Linden's number 16 beside Smyl's number 12 in a pre-game ceremony on December 17, 2008. Later that month, the Canucks acquired unrestricted free agent Mats Sundin. The arrival of the former Toronto Maple Leafs captain and 500-goal scorer in the NHL came with high expectations. However, Sundin scored below his usual pace and retired in the subsequent off-season. The team finished the regular season with another Northwest Division title and the third seed in the Western Conference. In the 2009 playoffs, the Canucks swept their first round series against the sixth-seeded St. Louis Blues (the first four-game sweep in franchise history), but were defeated in six games by the fourth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks in the second round.\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, the Canucks faced the longest road trip in NHL history, playing 14 games over six weeks, from January 27 to March 13, 2010. The schedule was a result of Vancouver hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, which shut down the NHL for two weeks, facilitating General Motors Place's use for ice hockey during the games. It marked the first time that an NHL market hosted an Olympics since the league allowed its players to compete in the games, beginning with the 1998 Games in Nagano. Among the several Canucks players named to their respective national teams, centre Ryan Kesler of the United States and goaltender Roberto Luongo of Canada played against each other in the gold medal game; Luongo and Team Canada emerged with the win.\nAs the NHL season resumed, Henrik Sedin went on to become the first Canucks player to win the Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophies as the league's leading scorer and most valuable player, respectively. He achieved the feat with a franchise-record 112 points, surpassing Pavel Bure's mark of 110 set in 1991\u201392. Vancouver won the Northwest Division title and finished third in the Western Conference for the second-straight year. They opened the playoffs by defeating the sixth-place Los Angeles Kings in six games, but were once again eliminated by Chicago in six games, who went on to win the Stanley Cup that year, the following round in six games.\nThird Stanley Cup Final run and back-to-back Presidents' Trophies (2010\u20132012).\nThe 2010\u201311 season began on October 9, 2010, with a pre-game ceremony to commemorate the team's 40-year anniversary. Henrik Sedin was named in the ceremony as the team's new captain, replacing Roberto Luongo, who had relinquished his captaincy in the off-season. The Canucks played the Los Angeles Kings, their first opponent in their inaugural season in 1970; both teams wore their original uniforms used in the Canucks' inaugural game. Throughout the season, the Canucks continued to celebrate their 40th anniversary with the creation of the \"Ring of Honour\", a permanent in-arena display commemorating their most significant players from past years. Four players were inducted during the campaign\u2014Orland Kurtenbach, Kirk McLean, Thomas Gradin and Harold Snepsts. In December 2010, the Canucks also honoured Markus Naslund by retiring his number 19 jersey. Naslund had retired two years after leaving the Canucks in 2008. The team finished the season first overall in the league for the first time, winning the Presidents' Trophy. Finishing with 54 wins and 117 points, the Canucks broke the previous team records in both categories by significant margins. Individually, numerous players had career years. Daniel Sedin won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's top scorer with 104 points, marking the first time in NHL history that two brothers won the award in back-to-back years. Meanwhile, Ryan Kesler tied Daniel Sedin for the team goal-scoring lead, with 41 goals. In goal, Roberto Luongo and backup Cory Schneider captured the William M. Jennings Trophy for allowing the fewest goals against.\nEntering the opening round of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks played the defending Stanley Cup champions and eighth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks, who had eliminated Vancouver in the previous two years in six games in the second round. While Vancouver initially took a 3\u20130 lead in the series, Chicago came back to win three straight games 7\u20132, 5\u20130 and 4\u20133, respectively to force a seventh game in the series. Forced into overtime in game seven, winger Alexandre Burrows scored his second goal of the game in overtime on Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford following a failed clearing attempt by Chicago defenceman Chris Campoli to win the game 2\u20131 and the series 4\u20133. The Canucks played the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators in the second round, defeating the Predators in six games to clinch a spot in the conference finals for the first time since 1994. Facing the second-seeded San Jose Sharks in the conference finals, Vancouver won in five games against the second-seeded Sharks with Kevin Bieksa scoring the winning goal in overtime against Sharks' goaltender Antti Niemi. Advancing to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1994, the Canucks won the first two games of the series on home ice against the third-seeded Boston Bruins 1\u20130 and 3\u20132, respectively, with Boston winning the next two in Boston 8\u20131 and 4\u20130, respectively. Vancouver won game 5 at home 1\u20130, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to capture the Stanley Cup in game 6 in Boston. The Bruins, however, won game 6 in Boston 5\u20132 to force a game 7 and then the deciding game 7 in Vancouver 4\u20130 to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1972. After the game, riots and looting broke out in downtown Vancouver, repeating the events of 17 years earlier.\nDuring the season-opening game on October 6, 2011 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, a ceremony was held to honour Rick Rypien, who died by suicide during the 2011 off-season. For the rest of the season, the players wore decals on their helmets saying \"37 RYP.\" The Canucks were strong contenders for much of the 2011\u201312 season, and clinched Presidents' Trophy, for the second consecutive year and second time in franchise history altogether. Despite projections for another Stanley Cup run at the outset of the 2012 playoffs, the Canucks were eliminated in five games by the eighth-seeded and eventual Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.\nEnd of the Gillis era (2012\u20132014).\nPrior to the start of the 2012\u201313 season, the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired. Unable to agree on a new CBA, the NHL enacted a lockout on September 15, 2012. The lockout continued on for days, which resulted a 48-game shortened season. The Canucks wore Vancouver Millionaires replica jerseys on March 16, 2013, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the Millionaires.\nVancouver finished the year winning their fifth consecutive Northwest Division title and the third seed in the West, but were swept in the first round of the 2013 playoffs by the sixth-seeded San Jose Sharks. Vigneault and his coaching staff were fired at the end of the season, and replaced by John Tortorella.\nThe Canucks participated in their first outdoor NHL game on March 2, 2014, a match against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. The event was titled the 2014 Heritage Classic. Luongo was traded back to the Florida Panthers late in the season, while the team failed to make the playoffs for the first time in six years. This saw Gillis fired and Linden named president of hockey operations; Tortorella was also relieved as coach after his one season.\nJim Benning era (2014\u20132021).\nLater years of the Sedins (2014\u20132018).\nOn May 21, 2014, Jim Benning was announced as general manager, having previously served as assistant general manager of the 2010\u201311 Boston Bruins championship team that had beaten the Canucks three years prior. On June 23, Willie Desjardins was named the 18th head coach of the Canucks. The team underwent a series of changes under the new management \u2013 veteran forward Ryan Kesler was traded to the Anaheim Ducks, veteran defenceman Jason Garrison was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning and veteran forward David Booth was let go in free agency, while Ryan Miller and Radim Vrbata were signed as free agents. This season saw the team honour former general manager and head coach Pat Quinn, following his death, by renaming a city street after him (Pat Quinn Way) as well as having his family participate in a pregame ceremonial puck drop. The Canucks finished second in the Pacific Division in the 2014\u201315 season, reaching the 100-point plateau for the ninth time in franchise history. They faced the Calgary Flames in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, losing in six games.\nAs the team fared poorly throughout the 2016\u201317 season, more veteran players were traded \u2013 Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen were dealt in an effort to rebuild. On March 25, 2017, the Canucks' 2015 first-round pick Brock Boeser made his NHL debut in his home state of Minnesota. Desjardins and his coaching staff, with the exception of assistant coach Doug Jarvis, were let go at the end of the season, replaced by Travis Green who coached their AHL affiliate in Utica. They also added Nolan Baumgartner, Newell Brown, and Manny Malhotra as assistant coaches.\nThe 2017\u201318 season was another poor year for the Canucks, but rookie Boeser was a bright spot for the team. Despite an injury late in the season, Boeser's 29 goals and 55 points in 62 games were enough to place him second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for rookie of the year. Longtime Canucks Daniel and Henrik Sedin played their final game on April 7, 2018, against the Edmonton Oilers. On June 5, 2018, longtime Canucks' public address announcer John Ashbridge died, having worked in his capacity with the franchise since 1987. During the off-season, Linden stepped down as president of hockey operations.\nRebuilding (2018\u20132021).\nThe 2018\u201319 season saw the debut of the Canucks' 2017 first-round draft pick, Elias Pettersson. Pettersson broke the Canucks' record for points by a rookie, set by Ivan Hlinka (1981\u201382) and matched by Pavel Bure (1991\u201392), and finished with 66 points to lead all NHL rookies, winning the Calder Trophy.\nThe franchise celebrated its 50th season in the NHL, the 2019\u201320 season, with a ceremony at the home opener on October 9, 2019. Bo Horvat was named the 14th captain in team history, following a one-year hiatus without a captain with the retirement of long-time captain Henrik Sedin. The 2019\u201320 season also saw the rookie campaign of Quinn Hughes, who finished the regular season with 8 goals and 45 assists for 53 points in 68 games, finishing as runner-up in Calder Memorial Trophy votes. The Canucks became the first team to have a top two Calder Trophy finalist three years in a row since the Toronto Maple Leafs, who did so when the league only had six teams from 1957 to 1959. On February 12, 2020, Daniel and Henrik Sedin's numbers 22 and 33 were retired before a game against the Chicago Blackhawks. On March 12, 2020, the Canucks and the NHL's season was suspended due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the league resumed play, the Canucks won their first postseason series in nine years in the 2020 qualifying round by defeating the Minnesota Wild. They then beat the defending Stanley Cup champions St. Louis Blues in six games in the first round before being eliminated by the Vegas Golden Knights in seven games in the second round.\nGeneral manager Jim Benning, head coach Travis Green, assistant coach Nolan Baumgartner, and assistant general manager John Weisbrod were fired on December 5, 2021, after an 8\u201315\u20132 start to the 2021\u201322 season. On the same day, Bruce Boudreau was named the 20th head coach of the Canucks.\nPatrik Allvin/Jim Rutherford era (2021\u2013present).\nOn December 9, 2021, Jim Rutherford was named president of hockey operations and interim general manager. He hired Patrik Allvin as general manager on January 26, 2022. On January 22, 2023, after weeks of speculation, the Canucks fired head coach Bruce Boudreau and hired Rick Tocchet as the franchise's 21st head coach. As the news broke that Boudreau would be fired weeks before while he was still coaching, the Canucks organization faced widespread criticism by fans and journalists mainly directed towards owner Francesco Aquilini, head of hockey operations Jim Rutherford and general manager Patrik Allvin, for their public mishandling of the coaching switch. Following Horvat's trade to the New York Islanders in exchange for Anthony Beauvillier and Aatu Raty, Quinn Hughes was named the 15th captain in franchise history during the 2023 off-season, making him the youngest captain in the NHL and first American captain of the Canucks.\nThe 2023\u201324 season was the first season with Hughes as captain and the first full season with Tocchet as head coach. With low expectations from fans and media at the start of the season, the team started 9\u20132\u20131 in their first twelve regular season games, and finished third in the Western Conference en route to winning their first-ever Pacific Division title (and their first franchise division title since 2013). The Canucks qualified for the playoffs for the first time since the expanded playoffs in 2020 and played their first playoff games in Vancouver since 2015. The Canucks defeated their first round opponent, the wild card Nashville Predators in six games, but lost their second round series in seven games to the Edmonton Oilers. Following the season, Tocchet was announced as the winner of the Jack Adams Award and Hughes won the James Norris Memorial Trophy; Allvin was voted as a finalist for the Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award.\nTeam information.\nHome arenas.\nThe Canucks play their home games at Rogers Arena in downtown Vancouver. The venue opened in 1995 as General Motors Place, and seats up to 18,890 for Canucks games. Rogers Arena was also the venue for ice hockey games during the 2010 Winter Olympics, where it was temporarily named Canada Hockey Place. The arena is owned and operated by Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment. Before moving to Rogers Arena, the Canucks played their home games at Pacific Coliseum in Hastings Park for 25 years. The arena holds 16,281 for ice hockey games, though capacity at its opening was 15,713. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the venue for figure skating and short-track speed skating. The Pacific Coliseum was also the home of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Vancouver Giants from 2001 to 2016.\nLogos and jerseys.\nThe team has gone through four primary logos and six major uniform designs over the years, with numerous minor changes to each, in addition to several alternate logos and jerseys.\nThe team's first NHL jerseys, worn from the inaugural season of 1970\u201371 (modified for the 1972\u201373 season) until the end of the 1977\u201378 season, featured a hockey stick in the shape of a shallow \"V\" superimposed on a blue rink-shaped rectangle forming the letter \"C\", designed by North Vancouver artist Joe Borovich. During this era, the Canucks wore blue and white jerseys with green stripes, though for the first two seasons, a white \"V\" adorned the sleeve stripes. A modified version of this logo is still in use, as a shoulder patch on the team's current jerseys and as the primary logo of their alternate jerseys.\nIn 1978, aiming for a more aggressive image, the organization asked San Francisco-based design agency Beyl &amp; Boyd to design new uniforms. These consisted of a huge, yellow, red-orange and black striped \"V\" coming down from the shoulders (suggesting \"victory\", according to its designers). Hockey writer Stephen Cole described it as looking like \"a punch in the eye\". The colour of the home jerseys changed from white to yellow with the logo and uniform change.\nThe \"Flying V\" theme, which included several slight modifications over the years, was abandoned in 1985, to feature the team's emblem on the front rather than the \"V\" (the emblem had previously been worn only on the sleeves; the V's would appear on the shoulders from 1985 to 1989). The logo consisted of the word \"Canucks\" in a diagonal slant as part the blade of a skate and was designed by San Francisco graphic artist Mike Bull. The logo, with its laser-like design, was sometimes referred to as the \"Star Wars\" logo, the \"waffle iron\", the \"plate of spaghetti\", and most commonly as the \"Flying Skate.\"\nThe yellow home jerseys were scrapped in 1989 in favour of more conventional white ones, and the triangular shoulder stripes which adorned the post-\"V\" jerseys were discarded as well. The new incarnation was worn from 1989 to 1992, when a subtle change was made\u2014and went largely unnoticed for the rest of the jersey's lifespan. The orange was changed to red, and the deep \"gold\" colour was changed to a much brighter yellow, reportedly because jersey-maker CCM no longer produced the required hues. In 1996, an alternate jersey was introduced, retaining the \"Flying Skate\" logo, but using a salmon colour graduating to black near the bottom.\nIn 1997 the Canucks unveiled a new logo, in which a Haida-style orca breaking out of a patch of ice forms a stylized \"C.\" The logo has been much-maligned, accused of being a blatant reference to their parent company, Orca Bay (now Canucks Sports and Entertainment). At the time, general manager Pat Quinn discussed wanting to have a West Coast colour scheme, and overall West Coast themes in the logo; the colour scheme included blue, red and silver. Beginning in 2001, an alternate jersey was utilized, with contrasting shoulder patches and a blue-to-maroon graduated colour in the body. In 2006, these gradient-coloured alternate jerseys were officially replaced with the popular, royal blue \"Stick-in-Rink\" uniforms from the 1970s.\nLittle more than halfway through the 2006\u201307 season, the Canucks announced that they would be changing their jerseys once again. The new uniform was unveiled prior to training camp, on August 29, 2007. It featured the same orca design present on their previous jerseys, but the colour scheme was changed to their \"retro\" colours of royal blue and kelly green. Additionally, the word \"Vancouver\" was added to the chest area above the orca. The actual jerseys themselves were changed to the Rbk Edge design, along with all other teams in the NHL. \"The Vancouver Sun\" described the new look as \"decidedly unpopular.\"\nOn November 14, 2008, prior to their Sport Celebrities Festival, the Canucks released their new RBK Edge Third Jersey. While staying with the colours of Vancouver, and combining the old with the new, the jersey looks very similar to their home jersey. The modernized \"Stick-in-Rink\" logo unveiled the previous year on the shoulder of the main jerseys is used as the main crest. On the shoulder, a \"V\" with the head of Johnny Canuck on top is used. This is the first time in team history since joining the NHL that Johnny Canuck has appeared on a Vancouver uniform. \"Sports Illustrated\" rated it 13th overall out of the 19 third jerseys released for the 2008 season.\nOn opening night October 9, 2010, the Canucks revealed jerseys they would wear for select games during their 40th-anniversary season. They look exactly like the jerseys the team wore in their early years, only with the addition of Reebok manufacturing the jerseys. The jerseys sport a '40th Anniversary' patch on the upper-right chest commemorating their 40th season. Just like the early years, they also bear no player names, only numbers, with permission from the NHL.\nOn August 13, 2015, the Canucks announced that they would be wearing their 1990s Flying Skate jerseys for a February 13, 2016, game against the Toronto Maple Leafs to honour the 20th Anniversary of Rogers Arena. They attempted to do this in the previous season to honour Pat Quinn, but were unsuccessful. The 1990s jerseys were used again for select games in the 2019\u201320 season (the design was chosen via an online fan vote over two other throwback jerseys) to coincide with the team's 50th anniversary.\nOn June 14, 2019, the Canucks updated their primary uniforms. The \"Vancouver\" script was removed while the modern \"stick-in-rink\" logo was modified with white as the main colour. A new \"Heritage\" uniform was also released, featuring design elements inspired from their inaugural season uniforms.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the NHL introduced \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniforms. The Canucks' design used was similar to the alternates they wore from 2001 to 2006, but with green replacing maroon. A second \"Reverse Retro\" design was released in the 2022\u201323 season, featuring the \"Johnny Canuck\" logo in front with a blue base and green and beige stripes. The design harkened back to the Canucks uniforms worn during the 1960s.\nOn January 18, 2023, the Canucks debuted a new version of the black Flying Skate jerseys as their alternate uniform. The design featured a modernized version of the Flying Skate logo minus the white elements, and features thick red and yellow stripes with subtle \"V\" patterns in homage to the infamous \"Flying V\" uniforms of 1978\u20131985. The silhouette of the North Shore Mountains in black and yellow was added on the inside collar. The current Canucks jersey lettering is used in lieu of standard block lettering of the 1990s Flying Skate uniforms. The uniform was first worn on the night the Canucks honoured former player Gino Odjick, who died January 15.\nMascot.\nThe Vancouver Canucks' mascot is an anthropomorphic killer whale (orca) named Fin the Orca. He is often seen banging a First Nations drum or skating around during intermissions firing t-shirts out of a compressed air cannon. On occasion, \"smoke\" also comes out of the blowhole on his head. Fin is known for his \"chomping\" where he bites the heads of fans.\nTwo fans of the Canucks became unofficial mascots of the team at the end of the 2009\u20132010 season, donning zentai-style, skin-tight green bodysuits in slightly different shades of green as The Green Men, and have been known to accompany the team on road games, as they did in the 2011 Stanley Cup Final to the TD Garden against the Boston Bruins. On September 5, 2012, as an acknowledgement of their rising popularity, ESPN inducted The Green Men into the \"Hall of Fans\", a semi-satirical take on a Hall of Fame. In November 2014, the Green Men announced that 2014\u201315 would be their final season. After an 8-season absence, the Green Men made two surprise appearances during the 2023\u201324 season, on February 24, 2024, during a game against the Bruins, and on May 8, 2024, during the Canucks' first game of the conference semifinals against the Edmonton Oilers in the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nMedia.\nAfter a relationship with CKNW stretching since the Canucks joined the NHL in 1970, the Canucks entered into a new radio broadcast deal in 2006 with CKST\u2014an AM sports/talk station. John Shorthouse continues to call the play-by-play, as he has since 1999, though with his role on the Canucks' television broadcasts becoming more prominent in recent years. As of 2023, Shorthouse now works the Canucks' TV broadcasts on a full-time basis alongside analysts Dave Tomlinson (primary) and Ray Ferraro (select games). Brendan Batchelor and Randip Janda call Canucks games on radio. The games aired on 14 stations across British Columbia. On March 9, 2017, it was announced that Rogers Media had acquired radio rights to the Canucks under a 5-year deal to begin in the 2017\u201318 season. On April 25, 2017, Rogers announced that it would acquire CISL from Newcap Radio and convert it to a sports radio format to serve as team flagship.\nSportsnet and Rogers hold a monopoly on all television broadcasts of the Canucks; regional games are aired by Sportsnet Pacific, and occasionally on the overflow channel Sportsnet Canucks. Sportsnet had held the television rights to the team since 1998. Since 2014, Sportsnet also held the NHL national TV rights in Canada, allowing Canucks broadcasts (including the now sublicensed Hockey Night in Canada from CBC) to be televised nationally on a number of occasions.\nOwnership.\nThe initial owners were Tom Scallen's Medicor group. In 1972, hints of impropriety were circulating about Scallen. He was charged with stock fraud and spent the last two years of his Canuck ownership in prison. In 1974, Scallen and Medicor sold the team to media executive Frank Griffiths.\nFrom 1988 to 1997, the Vancouver Canucks were owned by local businessman and philanthropist Arthur Griffiths, who had inherited ownership from his father, Frank. However, he was forced to sell his majority interest in the Canucks after overextending his resources trying to build a new arena, General Motors Place (now known as Rogers Arena). As a result, he sold his majority share to an American billionaire, John McCaw Jr.\nOn November 17, 2004, the Aquilini Investment Group, headed by Francesco Aquilini, purchased a 50% share in Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment (the owners of both the Canucks franchise and Rogers Arena) from John McCaw Jr. Prior to the sale, Aquilini and two business partners, Tom Gaglardi and Ryan Beedie, had negotiated with Orca Bay for several months without concluding an agreement. In January 2005, Gaglardi and Beedie filed a lawsuit against Aquilini and Orca Bay, alleging that Aquilini and Orca Bay had acted in bad faith in concluding a deal using information obtained from their joint offer.\nOn November 8, 2006, Aquilini, along with his brothers Roberto and Paolo, purchased the remaining 50% of the Vancouver Canucks and Rogers Arena from McCaw.\nIn May 2007, Gaglardi and Beedie's civil lawsuit over Aquilini's purchase reached the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The court ruled for Aquilini, on January 10, 2008. The court held that there was no legal partnership between Aquilini, Beedie, and Gaglardi, and that McCaw was free to sell the team to anyone he wished.\nOn January 29, 2008, the company responsible for operating the Vancouver Canucks and Rogers Arena, changed its name from Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment to Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment.\nMinor league affiliates.\nTop affiliates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSecondary affiliates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Canucks.

Nine former players have been inducted, and six builders (executives, general managers, head coaches, and owners).\nPlayers\nBuilders\nRing of Honour inductees.\nThe Vancouver Canucks Ring of Honour is a collection of permanent in-arena displays, that commemorates individuals that made an impact with the franchise. Inductees to the Ring of Honour include:\nTeam captains.\nThere have been 15 Canucks players who have served as the captain. The franchise's first captain was Orland Kurtenbach, who captained the team until his retirement in 1974. The longest-tenured Canucks captains have been Stan Smyl and Henrik Sedin, who each served as captain for eight seasons; each were also the only captains to have spent their entire NHL career with the Canucks. Swedish winger Markus Naslund, who captained for seven seasons, was the first non-Canadian to have captained the Canucks.\nThough goaltenders are not permitted to act as captains during games, Roberto Luongo served as the captain from 2008 to 2010, but because of the NHL rule against goaltender captains, the league did not allow Luongo to serve as on-ice captain. In his place, the three alternate captains were responsible for dealing with officials during games. They also handled ceremonial face-offs. Luongo was not permitted to wear the \"C\" on his jersey. Instead, he incorporated it into the artwork on the front of one of his masks, which he occasionally wore for the early months of the 2008\u201309 season.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDraft picks.\nThe Canucks selected Dale Tallon, a defenceman from the Toronto Marlboros with their first pick, second overall in the 1970 NHL amateur draft. In 1978, they drafted Stan Smyl from the New Westminster Bruins. Ten years later, the Canucks also drafted Trevor Linden from the Medicine Hat Tigers in 1988. The Canucks have had 13 top-five draft picks in franchise history, but have never had the first overall pick. The Canucks are one of the two franchises in the NHL to have drafted two twin brothers in the same year. They drafted Daniel Sedin second overall and Henrik Sedin third overall in 1999. Two players from British Columbia have been selected by the Canucks in the first round of an NHL entry draft: Cam Neely in 1983 and Jake Virtanen, taken sixth overall in 2014.\nHead coaches.\nThere have been 22 head coaches for the Canucks. The franchise's first head coach was Hal Laycoe, who coached the Canucks for two seasons. Alain Vigneault coached the most games of any Canucks head coach with 540 games, and has the most points all-time with the Canucks with 683, from the 2006\u201307 season through the 2012\u201313 season. He is followed by Marc Crawford, who has 586 points all-time with the Canucks. Vigneault also has the most points in a season of any Canucks coach, with 117 in the 2010\u201311 season. Roger Neilson and Pat Quinn are the only Hockey Hall of Fame inductees to coach the Canucks. Quinn, Vigneault, and Rick Tocchet are the only three Canucks head coaches to win a Jack Adams Award with the team. Bill LaForge, who coached the start of the 1984 season, has the fewest points with the Canucks, with 10. Harry Neale served the most terms as head coach of the Canucks with three while Pat Quinn served two. The current head coach, Adam Foote, was hired on May 14, 2025.\nAwards and trophies.\nNHL.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClarence S.

{"id": "73134", "revid": "543434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73134", "title": "Anaheim Ducks", "text": "National Hockey League team in Anaheim, California\nThe Anaheim Ducks are a professional ice hockey team based in Anaheim, California. The Ducks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Honda Center, and is owned by Conor Bedard . The Ducks are affiliated with the San Diego Gulls of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL. \nThe Ducks were founded as an expansion team for the 1993\u201394 season by the Walt Disney Company, and were known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a name based on the 1992 film \"The Mighty Ducks\". In 2005, Disney sold the franchise to the Samuelis, who, along with then-general manager Brian Burke, changed the name of the team to the Anaheim Ducks before the 2006\u201307 season. The Ducks have won six Pacific Division championships, and have advanced to the Stanley Cup Final twice, losing to the New Jersey Devils in 2003, and winning the Stanley Cup in 2007 over the Ottawa Senators, becoming the first of the three California-based teams to win the Stanley Cup. The Ducks have produced two Conn Smythe Trophy winners as the most valuable player of the playoffs \u2013 Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003 and Scott Niedermayer in 2007.\nHistory.\nStart of a franchise (1993\u20131994).\nThe Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were founded in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company. The franchise was awarded by the NHL in December 1992, alongside the rights to a Miami team founded by Wayne Huizenga that would become the Florida Panthers. An entrance fee of $50\u00a0million was required, half of which Disney would pay directly to the Los Angeles Kings in order to \"share\" the Los Angeles media market. On March 1, 1993, at the brand-new Anaheim Arena, the team's name was announced. The name was inspired by \"The Mighty Ducks\", a 1992 Disney film about a struggling youth hockey team that, with the help of their new coach, become champions. Philadelphia arena management specialist Tony Tavares was chosen to be team president, and Jack Ferreira, who previously helped create the San Jose Sharks, became the Ducks' general manager. The Ducks selected Ron Wilson to be the first head coach in team history. The Ducks and Florida Panthers filled out their rosters in the 1993 NHL expansion draft and the 1993 NHL entry draft. In the former, a focus on defense led to goaltenders Guy Hebert and Glenn Healy being the first picks, followed by Alexei Kasatonov and Steven King. In the latter, the Ducks selected Paul Kariya with the fourth overall pick, who began playing in 1994 and would turn out to be the face of the franchise for many years. The resulting roster had the lowest payroll of the NHL at only $7.9\u00a0million.\nLed by captain Troy Loney, the Ducks finished the 1993\u201394 season 33\u201346\u20135, a record-breaking number of wins for an expansion team, which the Florida Panthers also achieved. The Ducks sold out 27 of 41 home games, including the last 25, and filled the Arrowhead Pond to 98.9% of its season capacity. The Ducks licensed merchandise shot to number one in sales among NHL clubs, helped by their presence from Disney's theme parks and Disney Stores.\nPaul Kariya era (1994\u20132003).\nThe lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season saw the debut of Kariya, who would play 47 games that year, scoring 18 goals and 21 assists for 39 points. For his efforts, he was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy for the top rookie of the year. The Ducks went 16\u201327\u20135, missing the playoffs.\nDuring the 1995\u201396 season, Kariya was chosen to play for the Western Conference in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative, playing in place of Pavel Bure, who was out with a knee injury. Following the All-Star Game, the Mighty Ducks completed a mid-season blockbuster deal with the Winnipeg Jets. The Ducks sent Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky, and a third-round pick to the Jets in return for forward Marc Chouinard, a fourth-round draft pick, and right winger Teemu Selanne. Following the trade, Ducks center Steve Rucchin commented, \"Paul [Kariya] had a lot of pressure on him... He single-handedly won some games for us this year... Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just key on Paul.\" These three players formed one of the most potent lines of their time. However, the Mighty Ducks lost the eighth spot in the Western Conference to the Winnipeg Jets based on the number of wins.\nDuring the 1996\u201397 season, Kariya became team captain following Randy Ladouceur's retirement in the off-season. The Ducks qualified for the postseason after recording the franchise's first winning record of 36\u201333\u201313, good enough for home ice in the first round as the fourth seed against the Phoenix Coyotes. The Ducks trailed 3\u20132 in the series going into Phoenix for game six. Kariya scored in overtime to force the franchise's first game seven, which they won. However, in the second round, they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings, in a four-game sweep. After the season, Ron Wilson was fired for philosophical differences. Pierre Page succeeded him. The Ducks started out slowly in 1997\u201398, in part because Kariya missed the first 32 games of the season in a contract dispute. He came back in December, but on February 1, he suffered a season-ending concussion when Gary Suter of the Chicago Blackhawks cross-checked him in the face. With Kariya playing only a total of 22 games that season, the Ducks missed the playoffs and fired Page. The Ducks followed that season up by finishing sixth in the Western Conference in 1998\u201399 with new head coach Craig Hartsburg. However, they were swept by Detroit again, this time in the first round.\nAt training camp prior to the 1999\u20132000 season, the Ducks made a motto, \"Take the next step,\" going into the season. However, due to a much more competitive Western Conference, they missed the playoffs by four points behind rival San Jose Sharks. In the following season, 2000\u201301, the Ducks ended up performing worse, as Kariya and Selanne's point production significantly declined from the previous season \u2013 Kariya went from 86 points to 67 points and Selanne went from 85 points to 57 points. Selanne was subsequently dealt to San Jose at the trade deadline for Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields and a second-round draft pick, while head coach Craig Hartsburg was fired during the season. The team ended up with a losing record and last place in the Western Conference that season. Without Selanne, Kariya's numbers continued to drop in the 2001\u201302 season with new coach Bryan Murray. The Mighty Ducks finished in 13th place in the Western Conference.\nWestern Conference champions (2002\u20132003).\nPrior to the 2002\u201303 season, Bryan Murray was promoted to general manager. He hired Mike Babcock to be the head coach. The Mighty Ducks made the postseason as the seventh seed with a 40\u201327\u20139\u20136 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the defending Stanley Cup champions. They swept the Red Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime in game four. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game one turned out to be the one of the longest games in NHL history, with Petr Sykora scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. The Ducks would finish off the Stars in game six at home. In the team's first trip to the Western Conference finals, they were matched up against the sixth-seeded, three-year-old Minnesota Wild. Jean-Sebastien Giguere strung together three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one total goal in the series in an eventual sweep.\nThe 2003 Stanley Cup Final was played against the New Jersey Devils. The series began with the home team winning the first five games. In game six at home, Kariya was knocked unconscious from a hit by Devils captain Scott Stevens. However, Kariya would return in the second period and score the fourth goal of the game. The Mighty Ducks defeated the Devils 5\u20132 to send the series back to New Jersey for game seven. Anaheim was unable to win on the road in New Jersey, as they lost game seven to the Devils 3\u20130. For his play during the postseason, Giguere was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player in NHL history to win the trophy as a member of the losing team.\nNew ownership, Selanne's return and franchise rebrand (2003\u20132008).\nAfter the 2002\u201303 season, Kariya promised to bring the Mighty Ducks back to the Stanley Cup Final the following year. However, Kariya left the Ducks in the summer and joined former teammate Teemu Selanne on the Colorado Avalanche. During the 2003\u201304 season, the team regressed to a 29\u201335\u201310\u20138 record, finishing fourth in the division.\nDuring the 2004 off-season, Bryan Murray, who had wished to coach again, left the Ducks to join the Ottawa Senators. As the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a long lockout, Disney tried to sell the team but received a low offer of US$50\u00a0million, less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, Broadcom Corporation co-founder Henry Samueli of Irvine, California, and his wife Susan bought the Mighty Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75\u00a0million. Henry Samuelis, whose family was already managing Arrowhead Pond said of the sale, \"Since we manage the Pond ... it seemed natural to purchase the team since Disney had it up for sale for quite a while.\" Brian Burke, former Vancouver Canucks general manager and president, was appointed general manager and executive vice-president of the Mighty Ducks on June 20, 2005. Shortly after, Babcock rejected an extension to stay with the Ducks, signing with Detroit instead. Thanks to a weighted draft lottery in which the Ducks had a 4.16% chance at first overall, they were able to get the second pick, which they used to select Bobby Ryan.\nOn August 1, 2005, former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Randy Carlyle was hired as the seventh head coach in team history. Burke was familiar with Carlyle's coaching ability, as the latter had coached the Manitoba Moose from 1996 to 2001 (International Hockey League) and 2004\u201305 (American Hockey League); the Moose had been the Canucks' farm club since 2001. On August 4, 2005, free-agent defenseman Scott Niedermayer signed with the Mighty Ducks to play with his brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost immediately named team captain. On August 22, Selanne returned to Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006. The 2005\u201306 season also saw the emergence of rookies Ryan Getzlaf, and Corey Perry. On November 15, 2005, Anaheim traded Sergei Fedorov and a fifth-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for defenseman Francois Beauchemin and forward Tyler Wright.\nThe Ducks finished the season with a 43\u201327\u201312 record, good enough for 98 points. The Ducks faced the Calgary Flames in the conference quarterfinals and forced a seventh game in Calgary, shutting out the Flames to reach the conference semifinals. In the conference semifinals, the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games;, during which Ilya Bryzgalov broke Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the franchise's second conference finals appearance, they faced the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers, a series the Ducks would ultimately lose in five games.\nIn January 2006, Samueli announced the team would be renamed as simply the \"Anaheim Ducks\" as of the following season.\nStanley Cup champions (2006\u20132007).\nPrior to the 2006\u201307 season, the Ducks adopted a completely new look to go along with their new name; their team colors became black, gold and orange, and the logo of a duck-shaped goalie mask was dropped in favor of the word \"Ducks\", with a webbed foot in place of the \"D\".\nThe Ducks traded Joffrey Lupul, Ladislav Smid and a first-round draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for defenseman Chris Pronger. On November 9, 2006, the Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6\u20130 at General Motors Place in Vancouver to improve their season record to 12\u20130\u20134. The win set an NHL record by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983\u201384 Edmonton Oilers. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48\u201320\u201314 record and 110 points. Although they had three fewer wins than the Nashville Predators, the Ducks won the second seed in the West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title; the Predators finished second in the Central Division behind the Detroit Red Wings (the top seed in the West).\nIn the 2007 playoffs, the Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild in the conference quarterfinals and the Canucks in the semifinals, both in five games. The Ducks faced the Detroit Red Wings in the franchise's third trip to the conference finals. In game three, Pronger elbowed Tomas Holmstrom and subsequently received a one-game suspension for the illegal check. However, the Ducks won game four without Pronger and game five in Detroit, with Selanne scoring the latter game's overtime winner. The Ducks then finished off the Red Wings in game six for their second Stanley Cup Final appearance.\nIn the Final, the Ducks won the first two games at home against the Ottawa Senators. However, the Ducks lost game three and Pronger received his second one-game suspension, this time for elbowing Dean McAmmond. The Ducks were again able to win without Pronger, defeating the Senators in game four for an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on home ice in game five. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6\u20132 at Honda Center to claim their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Moen was credited with the Cup game-winning goal after Senators defenseman Chris Phillips put the puck in off of goaltender Ray Emery into their own net. Scott Niedermayer was awarded the second Conn Smythe Trophy in Ducks history. The Ducks became the first California team and the first NHL West Coast team to win the Stanley Cup.\nPost-Stanley Cup (2007\u20132008).\nThe Ducks began their title defense in the 2007\u201308 season without Scott Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne, who were both contemplating retirement. To offset those losses, Burke signed forward Todd Bertuzzi and defenseman Mathieu Schneider. Chris Pronger was also named captain with Niedermayer's absence. The team began the season in London for the 2007 NHL Premiere and split their two games with the Los Angeles Kings. The team began slow out of the gate, going 4\u20137\u20132 to begin the season. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov on waivers, where he was picked up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free-agent signee Jonas Hiller then became the back-up to starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Both Selanne and Niedermayer would return mid-season and the team finished with a 47\u201327\u20138 record, good enough to earn home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in six games by the Dallas Stars. In the off-season, Burke bought out the remaining year on Bertuzzi's contract and traded Schneider to the Atlanta Thrashers.\nBob Murray era (2008\u20132021).\nThe Ducks began the 2008\u201309 season with another slow start, going 1\u20135\u20130. On November 12, 2008, Burke resigned to take the same position for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bob Murray replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled to make the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Ryan Whitney, Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for defenseman James Wisniewski, and Travis Moen, who was traded to the San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The Ducks defeated the first-seeded, Presidents' Trophy-winning San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference semifinals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings in seven games. Before the 2009\u201310 season, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the Philadelphia Flyers for Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and two first-round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils, respectively. The Ducks then signed free agent center and former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu to a one-year deal.\nThe Ducks would have another slow start, beginning 6\u201310\u20133 to the 2009\u201310 season. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a contract extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, as well as the acquisitions of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39\u201332\u201311 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks re-signed Saku Koivu and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler via the draft, and 35-year-old defenseman Andy Sutton signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year deal.\nOn October 4, 2010, Ryan Getzlaf was named team captain. The 2010\u201311 season did not begin well for the Ducks, who would lose their first three games and go 4\u20137\u20131 throughout October. They maintained a .500 throughout record through the first half of the season, but got better and finished 47\u201330\u20135, good for 99 points and second place in the Pacific Division. Corey Perry and Jonas Hiller represented the Ducks at the 2011 All-Star Game, and Perry went on to have a 50-goal, 98-point season, which won him the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy. He became the first-ever Duck to win the Hart, as well as the first Richard winner as a Duck since Teemu Selanne won the award in 1999. However, Hiller was injured at the All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season. In the 2011 playoffs, they lost in the first round to the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators.\nBruce Boudreau as head coach.\nBefore the 2011\u201312 season began, former Mighty Duck Ruslan Salei died in a plane crash with several other former NHL players of Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. The team wore a black patch with his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started the season with 2011 NHL Premiere games in Helsinki and Stockholm. This was the second time in franchise history that they started the regular season with games in Europe. They lost 4\u20131 to the Buffalo Sabres in Helsinki but defeated the New York Rangers 2\u20131 after a shootout in Stockholm. After a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle with former Washington Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau. Although the team had a 17\u20133\u20134 run in the second half of the season, the Ducks ultimately failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011\u201312 season.\nThe 2012\u201313 season was shortened to 48 games due to a labor lockout. Due to the shortened season and the compacted game scheduling, all games were to be played against the Ducks' own Western Conference opponents, and no games were played against Eastern Conference teams. The Ducks finished the season with a 30\u201312\u20136 record and would win their second Pacific Division title in franchise history. In the conference quarterfinals, they ended up losing to the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in seven games, despite holding a 3\u20132 series lead after game five.\nEntering the 2013\u201314 season, the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it was announced that Teemu Selanne would be playing in his final NHL season. In the off-season, Bobby Ryan was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and Ottawa's first-round pick in the 2014 NHL entry draft, and the Ducks also signed center Mathieu Perreault, and a returning Dustin Penner. Despite a bad season opener suffering a 6\u20131 rout at the hands of the Colorado Avalanche, the Ducks followed the opener with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record setting ten consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013. A 9\u20131 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 15 saw Anaheim establish a 20\u20130\u20132 record at Honda Center, which matched the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years. They would also play in their first outdoor game on January 25 at Dodger Stadium in the 2014 NHL Stadium Series against the Los Angeles Kings, which they won 3\u20130. The Ducks remained towards the top of the NHL standings for the entire season, ending the regular season with a franchise-best 54\u201320\u20138 record (116 points) and eventually finished one point behind the Boston Bruins in the race for the Presidents' Trophy. The Ducks secured a second consecutive Pacific Division title and the number one seed in the Western Conference. Goalie John Gibson also made his NHL debut, shutting out the Canucks 3\u20130. Anaheim faced the eighth-seeded Dallas Stars in the first round and were victorious in six games, marking the first time since 2009 that the Ducks had won a playoff series. In the Western Conference second round, the Ducks faced their geographic rival and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings for the first time ever in the playoffs. However, the Ducks ultimately went down in seven games to their Southern Californian rivals, losing game seven by a score of 6\u20132 at Honda Center.\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks acquired center Ryan Kesler and a third-round pick in 2015 from the Vancouver Canucks.

Just prior to the 2015 NHL entry draft, the Ducks sent Emerson Etem and a draft pick to the New York Rangers in exchange for left-wing Carl Hagelin. They also traded for Vancouver Canucks defenseman Kevin Bieksa and added veterans Shawn Horcoff, Chris Stewart, and Mike Santorelli. Entering the 2015\u201316 NHL season, many analysts pegged the Ducks as Stanley Cup favorites. However, scoring struggles led to a slow start, with the team still out of a playoff spot in December. The team improved afterwards riding the goaltending of John Gibson. On March 6, 2016, the Ducks set a franchise record with an 11-game winning streak which ended the following night. On March 24, 2016, the Ducks clinched a playoff spot in a 6\u20135 overtime loss to the Maple Leafs.

Ryan Miller retired at the end of the season. In the 2021 draft, the Ducks selected third overall Mason McTavish.\nOn November 9, 2021, Murray was placed on administrative leave by the Ducks pending the results of an ongoing investigation.

The home (later road) jersey has a white and jade base, divided by purple, white and silver diagonal stripes. For most of its history, purple pants were used with this set; from 1993 to 1997, and from 1999 to 2003, the pants featured jade and white stripes. In 1996, an alternate front-facing \"angry duck mask\" logo is added on the shoulders.\nIn 1995, as part of the NHL's third jersey program, the Mighty Ducks wore alternate \"Wild Wing\" jerseys, featuring the current mascot breaking out of a sheet of ice amid a jade base and purple trim.

The road alternate has a jade base with purple, jade and silver stripes along the chest and sleeves, and the home alternate has a white base with jade, purple and silver stripes along the chest and sleeves. During this period, the Mighty Ducks switched to black pants and helmets, but in 1999, returned to wearing purple pants and helmets while retiring the road alternate jerseys.\nIn 2003, the Mighty Ducks released a black alternate jersey with purple and silver trim. This design features the full team name written in a classic script style, and the interlocking \"MD\" on both shoulders.\n2006\u20132014.\nAfter rebranding as the Anaheim Ducks, the uniforms became black and white with metallic gold and orange stripes.

The design brought back the purple and jade look the team originally sported from 1993 to 2006, and debuted a new version of the \"Wild Wing\" mask logo inside a jade circle with the \"Anaheim Ducks\" name and current logo.\n2024\u2013present.\nOn June 24, the Ducks fully unveiled their new logo and their new Fanatics-produced jerseys. The home jersey is fully orange with black, gold, and white striping on the bottom and sleeves of the jersey, while the away jersey is white with orange shoulders and the same colored stripes as the home jersey. Both jerseys feature a revised version of the Duck foot logo of 2006\u20132024 on the shoulders.\nColors and logos.\nThe team's colors were eggplant and jade until the change of ownership in 2006. At this point, they became orange, black and gold, with white in place of black for the away jersey. The only exception is the alternate jersey, which is mostly orange. Orange, which has become one of the team's primary colors, is in reference to Orange County, where Anaheim is located.\nThe original Mighty Ducks logo featured an old-style Jacques Plante-inspired goaltender mask, shaped to form the appearance of a duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting hockey sticks, a black hockey puck, and a triangle; the color of the triangle alternated between green and gray.\nUpon renaming, the Ducks' logo changed into a webbed foot forming a \"D\". The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) with orange and black accents (forming a three-dimensional appearance). The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver. This is shortened from a prior wordmark logo that spelled out the word \"Ducks\" in all capital letters.\nThe current logo of the Ducks is similar to that used in 1993\u20132006. The refreshed current version has orange hockey sticks which are flat and more curved than that of the original. The triangle is gold, along with the shading under the mask. Other new additions include an orange eye and gold shading above the mask\u2019s eye hole. The sticks of the logo still retains the \"W\" tape, and when shown together shows WW as a nod to the mascot Wild Wing. A revised duck foot, dropping the orange stripe, grey and white outlines is featured as a secondary logo on the shoulders.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot for the team is an anthropomorphized duck by the name of Wild Wing. He has been the team's mascot since its inaugural season. He wears a Ducks jersey with the number 93 on the back, referring to the year the Ducks became an NHL team.\nHe regularly descends from the rafters of the arena when making his in-game entrances. In one such descent the rigging that lowered Wild Wing from the rafters malfunctioned leaving the mascot trapped fifty feet above the ice for several minutes. Another well known blunder occurred in October 1995 when Wild Wing, attempting to jump through a \"wall of fire\", accidentally tripped causing the mascot to land on the fire and set his costume ablaze.\nHis physical appearance is similar to the duck mask in the original Mighty Ducks logo. A bronze statue of Wild Wing was located outside the south doors of Honda Center from 1993 to 2012, until construction began on the 'Grand Terrace' addition to the arena. When construction was completed and the Grand Terrace opened, the statue was noticeably absent. The statue was later returned from storage in 2017 and sits at the southeast entrance of the arena.\nThe mascot was the inspiration for the character Wildwing Flashblade in Disney's \"\" cartoon series.\nThe Mighty Ducks also used a secondary \"mascot\", a person (with no particular costume) called the Iceman, during the team's first game in 1993. The Iceman appeared occasionally in the stands, played an electric guitar, and attempted to liven up the crowd. However, the Iceman was poorly received by fans and was quickly eliminated after the Ducks lost to the Red Wings in their inaugural game, 7\u20132.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Ducks.

He spent only one season with the team, scoring 13 goals and providing 22 assists. Adam Oates only played one season with team in 2002\u201303, registering nine goals and 36 assists. Oates was inducted in 2012. Scott Niedermayer, inducted in 2013, spent five seasons with the team, winning the Stanley Cup with the team in 2007, and serving as team captain until his retirement in 2010 (with the exception of the 2008\u201309 season). Niedermayer provided 60 goals and 204 assists with the team. Sergei Fedorov and Chris Pronger were inducted in 2015. Pronger played three seasons with the team and won the Stanley Cup in 2007, providing 36 goals and 114 assists. He also served as team captain for the 2008\u201309 season while Niedermayer sat out for most of the season. In 2017, both Kariya and Selanne were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Kariya was drafted by the Ducks and spent nine seasons with team. He spent seven seasons as captain. Kariya scored 300 goals and provided 369 assists while with the Ducks. Selanne started with the team in 1996 via a trade and returned to the team in 2005 winning a Stanley Cup with the team in 2007. Selanne registered 457 goals and 531 assists along with 34 goals and 35 assists in the playoffs.

{"id": "73135", "revid": "5308300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73135", "title": "Dallas Stars", "text": "National Hockey League team in Texas, United States\nThe Dallas Stars are a professional ice hockey team based in Dallas. The Stars compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The Stars played in Reunion Arena in downtown Dallas from 1993 to 2001, when they moved into the American Airlines Center in Dallas's nearby Victory Park neighborhood, an arena they share with the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nThe Stars were founded during the 1967 NHL expansion as the Minnesota North Stars, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. Before the 1978\u201379 NHL season, the team merged with the Cleveland Barons after the league granted them permission due to each team's respective financial struggles. The franchise relocated to Dallas for the 1993\u201394 NHL season and was renamed the Dallas Stars.\nThe Stars have won nine division titles in Dallas, two Presidents' Trophies as the top regular season team in the league, the Western Conference championship three times, and the Stanley Cup in 1999, when center Joe Nieuwendyk won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. Over the course of the franchise's history in both Minnesota and Dallas, the team has appeared in the Stanley Cup Final five times (1981, 1991, 1999, 2000, and 2020).\nIn 2000, Neal Broten was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2009, Brett Hull became the first Dallas Stars player inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, followed by Ed Belfour and Joe Nieuwendyk in 2011 and Mike Modano in 2014; Modano is the highest-scoring player in franchise history. Five further players and one coach have since been inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\n1967\u20131993: Minnesota North Stars.\nThe Minnesota North Stars began play in 1967 as part of the league's six-team expansion. Home games were played at the newly constructed Metropolitan Sports Center (\"Met Center\") in Bloomington, Minnesota. Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate, the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid-1970s.\nIn 1978, the North Stars merged with the Cleveland Barons (formerly the California Golden Seals), owned by George III and Gordon Gund. With both teams on the verge of folding, the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars, while the Seals/Barons franchise records were retired. However, the Gunds were the merged team's principal owners, and the North Stars assumed the Barons' place in the Adams Division in order to balance out the divisions. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived \u2013 they reached the 1981 Stanley Cup Final, where they lost in five games to the New York Islanders. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1990. The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an expansion franchise, the San Jose Sharks, to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, former Calgary Flames part-owner Norman Green, would eventually gain control of the team. In the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Final, only to lose to the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nAfter the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars suffered through declining profits coupled with distraction and uncertainty caused by relocation attempts. The team's fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers, in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose. In their final two seasons in Minnesota, the team adopted a new logo which omitted any reference to the word \"North\" from \"North Stars\", leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south. Green explored the possibility of moving the team to Anaheim to play at a new arena (which is now the Honda Center) under construction, and intended to call the team the Los Angeles Stars. However, the league had been courted by The Walt Disney Company to play in Anaheim's new arena, and asked Green to let them take the market, creating the expansion franchise eventually known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and in turn Green could relocate the North Stars to anywhere he wanted.\n1993\u20131998: Relocation and early years in Dallas.\nIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas, for the 1993\u201394 season, with the decision announced on March 10, 1993. Green was convinced by former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team. With the team's move to the Southern United States, Green decided to drop the \"North\" adjective but otherwise retained the \"Stars\" nickname, which in its shortened form quickly proved popular as it matched the state of Texas' official nickname as \"The Lone Star State.\" An NHL franchise in Dallas was an experiment for the league, as at that time the Stars would be one of the three southernmost teams in the league along with two recently created expansion teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers as the league's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. The Stars would move into Reunion Arena, built in 1980, the downtown arena already occupied by the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks.\nTo quell the ensuing controversy surrounding the North Stars move to Dallas, the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the near future; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 in the form of the Minnesota Wild.\nWith the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season, the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference, although these were essentially continuations of the Norris Division and Campbell Conference respectively, both of which the North Stars had been part of. The first NHL game in Dallas was played on October 5, 1993, and was a 6\u20134 win against the Detroit Red Wings. Somewhat ironically, Minnesota native Neal Broten scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Though the Stars were relatively still low on the Dallas-Fort Worth sports pecking order upon their arrival, popularity of the team grew rapidly and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as Mike Modano's career-best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in North Texas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Dallas, qualifying for the 1994 playoffs. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Vancouver Canucks in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season along with Modano's spectacular on-ice performances, would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come.\nThe almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor-league hockey in the area. Both incarnations of the Central Hockey League had two teams in the area, the Dallas Black Hawks and the Fort Worth Texans for years before the Stars' arrival. Amateur and youth hockey in North Texas were also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams.\n1994\u20131998: Arrival of Tom Hicks and building for a championship.\nThe 1994\u201395 season was shortened by an owners' lockout. The Stars traded captain Mark Tinordi along with Rick Mrozik to the Washington Capitals before the season began for Kevin Hatcher. Longtime North Stars hold-over Neal Broten was named his replacement, although he was traded too after only 17 games to the New Jersey Devils. Broten was replaced by Kevin's younger brother Derian Hatcher as team captain, a role he would serve in for the next decade. The Stars played only 48 games that season posting a record of 17\u201323\u20138. Despite the shortened season and the losing record, the Stars again made the playoffs, losing in five games to the Red Wings in the first round. Green, who had run into financial problems stemming from his business ventures outside of ice hockey, was forced to sell the team to businessman Tom Hicks in December 1995.\nThe 1995\u201396 season would be the first season under new owner Tom Hicks. In the off-season, the Stars traded for former Montreal Canadiens' captain and three-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner Guy Carbonneau, who was then with the St. Louis Blues. With the Stars struggling to begin the season, general manager and head coach Bob Gainey traded for center Joe Nieuwendyk from the Calgary Flames in exchange for Corey Millen and Jarome Iginla, then a Stars prospect. The Stars recorded only 11 wins in the first half of the season, and Bob Gainey relinquished his coaching duties in January to be the full-time general manager of the team. The Stars soon hired Michigan K-Wings head coach Ken Hitchcock to replace him; it would be his first NHL head coaching position. The Stars then traded for Benoit Hogue from the Toronto Maple Leafs late in the season, but ultimately finished in sixth place in the Central Division, missing the playoffs for the first time since moving to Texas.\nIn the 1996 off-season, the Stars continued to revamp their roster, adding defensemen Darryl Sydor from the Los Angeles Kings followed by Sergei Zubov from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov would serve as the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the league in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season proved to be a good one. The Stars bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark for the first time in franchise history. The Stars won the Central Division, their first division title since 1983\u201384 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the playoffs. Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the Edmonton Oilers in seven games. Defenseman Grant Ledyard tripped in overtime of game 7, allowing Todd Marchant to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender Andy Moog.\nDuring the 1997 off-season, the Stars signed star goaltender Ed Belfour as a free agent after a well-publicized falling-out with the San Jose Sharks, which had traded a number of players to the Chicago Blackhawks to obtain him in January in the previous season. Andy Moog was allowed to leave via free agency, but later returned to the Stars as an assistant coach. The 1997\u201398 season was another banner year for the Stars. The Stars again set franchise records in wins (49) and points (109). Dallas acquired Mike Keane at the deadline from the New York Rangers. The Stars won the franchise's first Presidents' Trophy as the league's best regular season team, as well as the Central Division title for the second season in a row. Belfour set franchise season records for goals against average (1.88), wins (37) and just missed out on the Jennings Trophy by one goal to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. The Stars were the first overall seed for the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs and defeated the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round. Notorious enforcer Bryan Marchment injured Joe Nieuwendyk's right knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the playoffs with torn ligaments. In the second round, they again met the Edmonton Oilers, this time defeating them in five games. However, without Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings in the conference finals and lost in six games. The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n1998\u20132004: Stanley Cup contention and 1999 Stanley Cup championship.\n1999 Stanley Cup title and 2000 Stanley Cup Final run.\nIn the 1998 off-season, after falling just short in the conference finals, the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger Brett Hull. Hull had already had a successful career with the St. Louis Blues, with three consecutive 70-goal seasons and a Hart Memorial Trophy, but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St. Louis via free agency. Additionally, this was the first season for the Stars in the Pacific Division after the 1998 NHL division re-alignment.\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, the Stars won 51 games, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also recorded 114 points, which still stands today as a franchise record. They won their first Pacific Division by 24 points (their third consecutive division title), a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy, the Jennings Trophy as the league's top defensive team, and were awarded home-ice advantage throughout the 1999 playoffs. Winger Jere Lehtinen was also awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Dallas faced the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four close games, winning game 4 in the third overtime on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Blues came back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time in game 6 from Mike Modano. In the conference finals, they faced the Colorado Avalanche for the first time in Stars playoff history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2\u20132 series tie, the Avalanche won game 5 by a score of 7\u20135, taking a 3\u20132 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and game 7 at home, both by 4\u20131 scorelines.\nThis was the Stars' first Stanley Cup Final appearance as the Dallas Stars, although they made the final series twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion Buffalo Sabres, who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4\u20131 in the conference finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning game 5 2\u20130 and game 6 2\u20131 on a triple-overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was allowed to stand only after a lengthy official review. That season, the league still had the \"crease rule\" in effect, which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck entered the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the crease rule, and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup-winning goal, resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between 1995 and 2003 that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.\nThe team added veterans Kirk Muller, Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote in an effort to defend their Stanley Cup championship in the 1999\u20132000 season. On December 31, 1999, Brett Hull scored his 600 and 601st career goals in a 5\u20134 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Stars ultimately won the Pacific Division for the second year in a row, and were seeded second in the Western Conference. Dallas then defeated the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks in the first and second rounds, both 4\u20131 series victories. The Stars, for the second season in a row, defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the conference finals in seven games to reach their second consecutive Stanley Cup Final, where they met the New Jersey Devils. Because the Devils finished the regular season with one more point than Dallas, the Stars had to play their first playoff series without home-ice advantage since 1995. The Stars lost all three games at the Reunion Arena, and lost the series in game 6 on a double-overtime goal by New Jersey forward Jason Arnott.\n2001\u20132004: Continued playoff contention.\nHoping to win back the Stanley Cup, the Stars again captured the Pacific Division, posting a solid 48\u201324\u20138\u20132 record in the 2000\u201301 season. In the playoffs, the Stars and the Edmonton Oilers met in the first round, battling back-and-forth through the first four games, with each game decided by one goal, including three going into overtime. Game 5 would also go to overtime, as the Stars took a 3\u20132 series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller. However, in game 6 in Edmonton, the Stars did not need overtime, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20131 win. Facing the St. Louis Blues, the Stars would run out of gas, being swept in four straight games. Game 2 loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena.\nMoving into the brand new American Airlines Center for the 2001\u201302 season, the Stars had a slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons. Head coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by Rick Wilson. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Randy McKay and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Cup Final against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35\u201328\u201313\u20135. However, it would not be enough for the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in Dave Tippett as his replacement.\nAs in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via free agency to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the 2002\u201303 season, the Stars awarded the starting goaltending position to Marty Turco, who went on to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals-against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the league's top regular season goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference at 46\u201317\u201315\u20134, and along the way, two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the playoffs, the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second-round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3\u20133. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3\u20131 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of game 4. In game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars' dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Final ended in heartbreaking fashion as the Ducks broke a 3\u20133 tie with 1:06 left in game 6 on a goal by defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh.\nComing off their disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the 2003\u201304 season, as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. However, as the calendar turned to 2004, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9\u20134\u20133 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41\u201326\u201313\u20132 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.\n2005\u20132011: Early years of the post-lockout era.\n2005\u20132008: Return from lockout, 2008 Western Conference finals run.\nComing out of the owners' lockout that cancelled the entire 2004\u201305 season, the Stars remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of 2005\u201306, as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October. November would be even better for Dallas, as they won 10 of 13 games and took over first place in the Pacific Division, a position they would hold most of the season, as they went on to finish with a terrific record of 53\u201323\u20136. One reason for the Stars' success was their strong play in shootouts, as forward Jussi Jokinen was nearly automatic, making 10-of-13 shot attempts. Also performing strongly in shootouts was Sergei Zubov, who used a slow-but-steady backhand to go 7-for-12, as the Stars ultimately won 12 of 13 games that were settled by a shootout. As the number two seed in the Western Conference, the Stars faced the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference, and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Stars would stumble right from the start, losing game 1 by a score of 5\u20132 as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising 2\u20130 lead. Game 2 would see the Stars suffer another setback at home, as the Stars lost in overtime 5\u20134 on a goal by Joe Sakic. On the road in game 3, the Stars led 3\u20132 in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by Andrew Brunette, while Alex Tanguay won the game just 69 seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a 3\u20130 hole. The Stars would avoid the sweep with a 4\u20131 win in game 4, but overtime would doom them again in game 5, as Andrew Brunette scored the series winner at 6:05, ending the Stars' playoffs hopes after just five games.\nFollowing the previous season's disappointing first-round playoff loss at the hands of the seventh-seeded Avalanche, the Stars made a number of changes during the 2006 off-season. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to assistant general manager for player development (he kept his job as goaltending coach) and former player Ulf Dahlen was hired as an assistant coach. The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman Willie Mitchell and goaltender Johan Hedberg to leave as free agents. Forward Niko Kapanen was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers and the remaining two years on fan-favorite right winger Bill Guerin's contract were bought out. The Stars also received Patrik Stefan and Jaroslav Modry in the Atlanta trade, and signed Eric Lindros, Jeff Halpern, Matthew Barnaby and Darryl Sydor as free agents. Young goaltender Mike Smith was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup. During the season, key future pieces \u2013 center Mike Ribeiro and defenseman Mattias Norstrom \u2013 were added through separate trades. Young players Joel Lundqvist, Krys Barch, Nicklas Grossmann and Chris Conner all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.\nOn September 29, 2006, Brenden Morrow was announced as new team captain, taking the role over from Mike Modano, who had served as the incumbent since 2003. On March 13, 2007, Modano scored his 500th career NHL goal, making him only the 39th player and second American to ever reach the milestone. On March 17, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd NHL goals, breaking the record for an American-born player, previously held by Joe Mullen.\nOn January 24, 2007, the NHL All-Star Game was held at American Airlines Center. Defenseman Philippe Boucher and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster. The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. Marty Turco delivered three shutout wins in games 2, 5 and 6, but the Stars' offense failed to capitalize and they lost the series in seven games, the third season in a row that they lost in the first round.\nIn the 2007 NHL entry draft, the Stars drafted the relatively unknown Jamie Benn 129th overall. After starting a lackluster 7\u20137\u20133 in the 2007\u201308 season, general manager Doug Armstrong was fired by the team. He was replaced by an unusual \"co-general manager\" arrangement of former assistant GM Les Jackson and former Stars player Brett Hull. On November 8, 2007, Mike Modano became the top American born point scorer of all time, finishing off a shorthanded breakaway opportunity on San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov.\nOn February 26, 2008, just hours before the trade deadline, the Stars traded for All-Star center Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for backup goaltender Mike Smith and forwards Jussi Jokinen and Jeff Halpern. The Stars rallied to a final record of 45\u201330\u20137 and qualified for the playoffs as the fifth seed, matching up with the defending Stanley Cup champion, the Anaheim Ducks, in the first round. After a rough end to the season, only winning two games in March of that year, the Stars shocked everyone by winning the first two games of the series in Anaheim, and then would go on to finish off the Ducks in six games, their first playoff series win since 2003. In the second round, the Stars matched up with the Pacific Division champion San Jose Sharks. Once again, the Stars surprised everyone by winning the first two games of the series on the road. In game 2, Brad Richards tied an NHL record by recording four points in the third period. The Stars would then take a 3\u20130 series lead after a Mattias Norstrom overtime goal in game 3. After the Sharks staved off elimination with back to back wins in games 4 and 5, captain Brenden Morrow finished the Sharks off in game 6 with a powerplay goal nearly halfway into the fourth overtime, a moment nicknamed \"Cinco De Morrow\" by Stars fans as game 6 ended in the early morning hours of the Cinco De Mayo holiday on May 5. The win sent the Stars to their first conference finals since 2000, where they met the powerhouse Detroit Red Wings. After falling behind in the series 3\u20130, the Stars made a series of it winning games 4 and 5 before ultimately being ousted by the Red Wings in six games.\n2008\u20132011: Team difficulties and transition seasons.\nThe 2008\u201309 season saw the early loss for the season of captain Brenden Morrow to an ACL tear. Off-season free agent acquisition Sean Avery caused a media uproar over comments he made to a Canadian reporter about ex-girlfriend Elisha Cuthbert and her relationship with Calgary Flames' defenseman Dion Phaneuf before a game in Calgary. The incident forced the team to suspend Avery for the season; he was later waived by the Stars. That incident, plus injuries to key players Brad Richards and Sergei Zubov, caused the Stars to tailspin to a 12th-place finish and the first missed playoffs for Dallas since 2002.\nIn the wake of the season, the Stars hired a new general manager, former player and alternate captain Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull and Jackson remained with the Stars, but were reassigned to new roles within the organization. Less than a week after he was hired, Nieuwendyk fired six-season head coach Dave Tippett on June 10, 2009, and hired Marc Crawford the next day as his replacement. Other off-season moves included the addition of Charlie Huddy as assistant coach in charge of defense and the promotions of Stu Barnes and Andy Moog to assistant coaches. The Stars' 2009\u201310 season was similar to the previous one. Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45\u00a0million on payroll, over $11\u00a0million beneath the league salary cap. The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37\u201331\u201314 for 88 points, seven points back from the last playoff spot. This was the first time that they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas.\nIn the 2010 off-season, long-time goaltender Marty Turco was let go in favor of Kari Lehtonen to become the team's number one goaltender for the future. In the Star's last game of the season, away against the Minnesota Wild, Mike Modano was named the game's first star and skated around the rink after the game wearing his North Stars uniform, receiving a rousing ovation. The Stars also let Mike Modano walk in free agency, the face of the franchise for the past two decades. Modano subsequently signed with his hometown team, the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the newly defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement. The team also made key acquisitions both in trades or in free agency, such as winger Adam Burish (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender Andrew Raycroft. They also gave Jonathan Cheechoo a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks. To begin the 2010\u201311 season, the Stars won their first three games in a row, going on a three-game win streak for the first time since the 2008\u201309 season by beating the New Jersey Devils 4\u20133 in overtime in the season opener on October 8, 2010, New York Islanders 5\u20134 in a shootout on October 9, and against the Red Wings in the Stars' home opener on October 14, respectively. The home opener against the Red Wings featured an emotional return for Mike Modano, as the Stars crowd gave Modano a standing ovation as he was shown on the American Airlines Center jumbotron during a timeout in the game. After a hot start to the season, the Stars would continue to dominate within the first 50 games of the season, staying in both the Pacific Division lead and within the top three spots of the Western Conference. Through the first 50 games of the season up until the All-Star Break, they compiled a 30\u201315\u20135 record. However, after the All-Star Break the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks which included one-goal losses and blowing late leads in numerous games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline (February 28, 2011), the Stars traded up and comer James Neal and Matt Niskanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for defenseman Alex Goligoski. Despite these late-season struggles, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning their season finale on April 10, as they lost on the road at the Minnesota Wild 5\u20133 and a 42\u201329\u201311 record, costing them the last playoff spot despite the winning record and a vastly improved season overall compared to the previous two seasons, finishing 9th in the Western Conference only two points behind the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks for the eighth and final playoff spot. After missing the playoffs for the third consecutive season, Dallas fired coach Marc Crawford after just one season with the club on April 12.\n2011\u2013present: Arrival of Tom Gaglardi and \"Victory Green\" era.\n2011\u20132013: Continued team struggles.\nTo start the 2011 off-season, according to Darren Dreger of TSN, the team had been \"financially managed\" by the league for over a year. On June 16, 2011, Dallas hired Glen Gulutzan to be head coach, making him the sixth coach since the franchise's move from Minnesota. On September 13, 2011, lenders voted to agree to have the Stars file for bankruptcy and sold at auction. On September 21, 2011, Mike Modano announced his retirement from the league. By October 22, 2011, competing bids to buy the club were due. Vancouver businessman and Kamloops Blazers owner Tom Gaglardi's bid was the only one submitted, clearing the way for him to enter the final stages of taking over ownership of the team. Gaglardi's purchase was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on November 18, 2011. A bankruptcy court judge approved the bid for an enterprise value of $240\u00a0million. First lien creditors got about 75 cents on the dollar. The Stars lost $38\u00a0million during their last fiscal year and $92\u00a0million over the last three seasons.\nAs the new owner, Gaglardi's first move was bringing back former Stars President Jim Lites to once again take the reins as team president and CEO. To begin the 2011\u201312 season, the Stars once again jumped out to a fast start, going 23-17-1 through the first 41 games of the season. However, when the second half of the season began, the Stars slumped through the months of January and February, before getting hot again in late February. Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005\u201306 season. After the Stars lost 5\u20134 in Calgary to the Flames on March 26, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3\u20131. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks the next two games. The Stars were eliminated from playoff contention on April 5 in a 2\u20130 loss to the playoff-bound Nashville Predators. Despite a winning record once again of 42\u201335\u20135 record, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year missing the 2012 playoffs by six points, setting a franchise record for consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance.\nOn July 1, 2012, the team signed free agent veterans Jaromir Jagr, Ray Whitney, and Aaron Rome. The next day, the Stars traded fan-favorite Steve Ott and Adam Pardy to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for center Derek Roy. When the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout ended in January 2013 and a 48-game season began the Stars embarked on an up-and-down season, though staying in the race for one of the eight Western Conference playoff spots most of the shortened season. In mid-season, forward Michael Ryder was traded to his former team, the Montreal Canadiens, for Erik Cole. This shocked many as Ryder has become an almost overnight fan-favorite to Stars fans in his time with Dallas thanks to his stellar 35-goal campaign the previous season in 2011\u201312. Before the trade deadline in early April, the Stars began to falter and team captain Brenden Morrow was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins; Roy was traded to the Vancouver Canucks; Jagr to the Boston Bruins; and Tomas Vincour to the Colorado Avalanche to close out the NHL trade deadline, all in exchange for draft picks and prospects. After all of the trades at the trade deadline, the Stars' remaining young players pulled together to win six of their next eight games, thus propelling the Stars back into the 2013 playoff race. However, the Stars would drop their final five games, losing all of them while gaining only one point, eliminating them from playoff contention. The Stars had now missed the playoffs for the five straight seasons, continuing to set the all-time record for the franchise (dating back to the franchise's history in Minnesota) for most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance.\n2013\u20132020: Return to playoff contention and third appearance in the Stanley Cup Final.\nThe day after their final regular season game of the 2012\u201313 season (a 3\u20130 loss to the Detroit Red Wings), the Stars fired general manager Joe Nieuwendyk. The next day, the Stars introduced their 11th all-time general manager, Jim Nill, the former assistant general manager of the Red Wings. On May 14, 2013, the coaching staff was also fired, and on May 31, 2013, Scott White was re-introduced as the director of hockey operations. The Stars hired Lindy Ruff as their new head coach on June 21, 2013. Nill made his first big trade as general manager when he acquired the former second overall draft pick from the 2010 NHL entry draft in Tyler Seguin, as well as Rich Peverley and Ryan Button from the Boston Bruins in exchange for Loui Eriksson, Reilly Smith, Matt Fraser and Joe Morrow. During the 2013 off-season, the league underwent a major realignment. Dallas' returned to a revamped Central Division, bringing them a much more broadcast-friendly schedule for divisional away games. The Stars had long lobbied for this, as they were unhappy with the large number of games they had to play on the road in the Pacific Time Zone as a member of the Pacific Division since the 1998\u201399 season. Under new head coach Lindy Ruff and led by 84-point and 79-point campaigns from Seguin and newly minted captain Jamie Benn respectively, the Stars narrowly made it to the 2014 playoffs, returning to the Playoffs for the first time since 2008 with a successful 40\u201331\u201311 record, finishing with 91 points, fifth in the Central Division and eighth in the Western Conference during the 2013\u201314 season. They lost in the first round of the playoffs to the top-seeded Anaheim Ducks in six games with a 5\u20134 overtime loss in game 6.\nNill made another big trade as general manager when he acquired Jason Spezza and Ludwig Karlsson from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Alex Chiasson, Nick Paul, Alex Guptill and a second-round pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft. He also signed Senators player Ales Hemsky as a free agent on a three-year, $12\u00a0million contract on July 1, 2014. Despite these moves and a 92-point 41\u201331\u201310 campaign, the Stars finished with the second-lowest goaltender save percentage in the league during the 2014\u201315 season, which resulted in them failing to qualify for the 2015 playoffs due to their sixth-place finish in the Central Division and being seven points behind of the last playoff spot. The lone bright spot of the 2014\u201315 season was captain Jamie Benn winning the Art Ross Trophy. On April 11, 2015, Benn scored four points in the Stars' last regular season game to finish with 87 points on the season and win the Art Ross Trophy. His final point, a secondary assist with 8.5 seconds left in regulation in the game, allowed him to overtake New York Islanders centre and captain John Tavares for the award by one point.\nIn the 2015 off-season the Stars made a couple additions to the team, first trading with the Chicago Blackhawks for three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Sharp as well as defenseman Stephen Johns in exchange for Trevor Daley and Ryan Garbutt. The Stars also signed via free agency Sharp's teammate from the Blackhawks Johnny Oduya to a two-year contract. In the 2015\u201316 season, the Stars won their first Central Division title since 1998 and posted the best regular season record in the Western Conference with a 50\u201323\u20139 record good enough for 109 points and the runner up to the Presidents' Trophy as the regular season champions, only behind the Washington Capitals. In the first round of the 2016 playoffs, they defeated the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the second round, they faced the St. Louis Blues in the playoffs for the first time since 2001, but lost the series in seven games.\nThe Stars finished with a 34\u201337\u201311 record in an injury-plagued 2016\u201317 season, missing the playoffs for the seventh time in the past nine seasons, missing the 2017 playoffs by 15 points. As a result, the team announced that head coach Lindy Ruff's contract would not be renewed.\nIn the 2017 off-season the Stars lost goaltender Antti Niemi and forward Patrick Sharp in free agency.\nKen Hitchcock returned as head coach for the 2017\u201318 season, however once again the Stars missed the playoffs, this time narrowly missing having only missed by just three points in the standings after posting a winning record of 42\u201332\u20138 in the season.\nHitchcock retired after the season and was succeeded at the head coaching spot by Jim Montgomery. Montgomery's first season as the Stars coach saw the team finish with a 43\u201332\u20137 record, good enough to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2016 as the first wild card team and seventh seed in the Western Conference. The Stars defeated the Central Division-champion and second-seeded Nashville Predators in a six-game series the first round, but fell to the sixth-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in seven games, losing game 7 on the road in double-overtime by a score of 2\u20131 despite a 52-save performance by starting goaltender Ben Bishop.\nGoing into the 2019\u201320 season, the Stars added veteran forwards Joe Pavelski from the San Jose Sharks and Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks in free agency on July 1, 2019. To start the 2019\u201320 season, the Stars sputtered to a 1\u20137\u20131 start through their first nine games. However the Stars soon rallied and rattled off a 14\u20131\u20131 record between October 19 and November 25, which catapulted the Stars to an eventual season record of 37\u201324\u20138 through 69 games, as the regular season was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barely two full months into his second season as Stars head coach, on December 10, the Stars fired head coach Jim Montgomery for \"unprofessional conduct inconsistent with the core values and beliefs of the Dallas Stars and the National Hockey League.\" General manager Jim Nill said the situation had come to light the previous weekend, and involved \"a material act of unprofessionalism\" egregious enough to demand Montgomery's immediate firing. He did not offer specifics \"out of respect for everyone involved,\" only saying that it did not involve abuse of players or criminal conduct. Rick Bowness, who joined the team as an assistant coach a month after Montgomery's hiring in May 2018, was named interim coach, while Derek Laxdal (who was the head coach of the Stars' AHL affiliate Texas Stars at the time) would be promoted to the assistant coaching position that was vacated by Bowness. On January 1, 2020, the Stars hosted the Nashville Predators in the 2020 Winter Classic at the Cotton Bowl in a rematch of the previous seasons' first-round playoff series, where the Stars prevailed with a 4\u20132 victory. This was the first NHL outdoor game for both teams and with a sold-out crowd of 85,630 at the Cotton Bowl, it was the second-most attended game in NHL history. The NHL returned from the March 2020 abrupt regular season stoppage three weeks before completion due to the COVID-19 pandemic a little under five months later in August 2020, where the Stars advanced to the playoffs. By virtue of having one of the top four highest point percentages in the Western Conference at the time the season was suspended, the Stars played in a round-robin tournament against three of the other top four teams in the Western Conference (Vegas Golden Knights, Colorado Avalanche, and St. Louis Blues) in order to determine the team's seed for the playoffs; Dallas was ultimately seeded as the no. 3 seed in the Western Conference, entering them into a first-round series against the Calgary Flames. The Stars defeated the Flames in six games in the first round, and then defeated the Colorado Avalanche in a seven-game series that ended with a Joel Kiviranta hat-trick performance in game 7, which included his series-winning overtime goal. The Stars would defeat the Vegas Golden Knights in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2000, as the Stars would end a second consecutive series of the playoffs with a series-winning overtime goal when Denis Gurianov scored 3:36 into the first overtime period of game 5, winning the game 3\u20132 for the Stars. The Stars would go on to face the Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final, the Stars won game 1 of the series by a 4\u20131 score, but would eventually fall to the Lightning in six games.\n2020\u2013present: Runs to the Western Conference finals.\nA month after the Stars' run to the 2020 Stanley Cup Final, interim head coach Rick Bowness was named full-time head coach on October 29, 2020. In the following season, an injury-plagued campaign for the team (most notably with veteran forwards Tyler Seguin and Alexander Radulov along with veteran goaltender Ben Bishop) caused the Stars to finish the COVID-shortened 56-game schedule with a 23\u201319\u201314 record, finishing fifth in the Central Division with 60 points and missing the playoffs by four points marking the first time since 2018 where the team failed to qualify for a playoff spot.\nThe Stars would rebound in the 2021\u201322 season with a 98-point 46\u201330\u20136 record, good enough for the first wild-card spot and seventh seed in the Western Conference playoffs where they played the Pacific Division-champion and second-seeded Calgary Flames in the first round. They were defeated by the Flames in seven games, losing 3\u20132 in overtime of game 7 in Calgary. In game 7 the Stars took the game to overtime despite the Flames making twice as many shots and attempts as the Stars, with the Stars' young starting netminder Jake Oettinger recording 64 saves, the second-highest in playoff history behind only Kelly Hrudey's 73 during the 1987 Easter Epic. The Stars were eliminated when Flames forward Johnny Gaudreau finally scored 15:09 into the first overtime period to end the game 3\u20132. After the team's playoff elimination, head coach Rick Bowness announced that he would be resigning from his coaching duties with the team.\nOn June 21, 2022, the Stars hired Peter DeBoer to replace Bowness as their head coach, the 10th in franchise history since the team moved to Dallas in 1993. In the 2022 off-season the Stars added in free agency both forward Mason Marchment, and defenseman Colin Miller, however lost veteran defenseman John Klingberg to the Anaheim Ducks via free agency after eight seasons with the Stars. Led by their trio of veteran forwards Tyler Seguin, Joe Pavelski, and captain Jamie Benn, as well as the emergence of a young core of players including netminder Jake Oettinger, forwards Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz, and Wyatt Johnston, and defenseman Miro Heiskanen, the Stars completed their first season under Peter DeBoer with a 108-point 47\u201321\u201314 regular season record, just barely being beat out by the Colorado Avalanche by one point for the 2022\u201323 Central Division title. In only his third full season with the Stars and fourth season altogether, Jason Robertson set a new Dallas Stars record for total points in a season with 109 points, surpassing the previous record of 93 points set by Mike Modano in the Stars' first season in Dallas back in 1993\u201394. Robertson accomplished this feat in a game against the Arizona Coyotes on March 31, 2023, when he scored a goal as part of a Stars 5\u20132 win over the Coyotes, his goal was his record-breaking 94th point of the season and 100th goal of his career. Captain Jamie Benn also had a resurgent season, finishing with a 78-point season that included 33 goals and 45 assists recorded in all 82 contests played for a season nicknamed by both Stars fans and pundits alike as the \"Bennaissance\" for his first 75-plus point season since 2017\u201318. Along with trade deadline acquisitions Max Domi, and Evgenii Dadonov, the Stars entered the 2023 playoffs as the number two seed in the Central Division, matching them up in a first round series against the Minnesota Wild for their first playoff series versus one another since 2016. The Stars opened the playoffs at home with a double-overtime loss in game 1, as nearly midway through regulation of game 1 Joe Pavelski was knocked out with a concussion for the remainder of the first round series on a hit by Wild defenseman Matt Dumba. The Stars responded with a win in game 2 fueled by a Roope Hintz hat-trick performance, winning four of the next five games in the series after game 1 to eliminate the Wild in six games. The Stars then faced the Seattle Kraken in the second round of the playoffs. The Kraken, in only their second season of existence, had upset the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round in seven games. Pavelski returned to the Stars for game 1 of the series, scoring all four of the Stars' goals in the game, however the Stars lost by a score of 5\u20134 in overtime. The Stars would go on to win the series, winning game 7 at home by a score of 2\u20131, sending the Stars to the conference finals and setting up a rematch of the 2020 conference finals versus the Vegas Golden Knights. The Stars would immediately go down 3\u20130 in the series versus Vegas after dropping the first two games in overtime on the road and a 4\u20130 loss at home in game 3. In game 3 captain Jamie Benn was suspended for two games for an illegal cross-check on Vegas captain Mark Stone. Though the Stars would win games 4 and 5 without Benn and extend the series, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Golden Knights would ultimately defeat the Stars in six games with a 6\u20130 win in game 6.\nThe next season saw the Stars clinch their fourth Central Division title and finished as the top seed in the Western Conference and placed second in the League overall as the runner up for the Presidents' Trophy, only behind the New York Rangers. They defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion and eighth-seeded Vegas Golden Knights in seven games in the first round of the 2024 playoffs, then defeated the Colorado Avalanche in six games in the second round, and then lost to the Edmonton Oilers in six games in the conference finals.\nTeam information.\nArena.\nWhen the Stars first moved from Minnesota, they played in Reunion Arena, which they shared with the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks. For hockey, Reunion Arena held 17,001 for NHL games. Throughout the hockey history of Reunion Arena, the arena was known for having one of the worst ice surfaces in the league, especially in its final days hosting the Stars. The Stars played at Reunion for eight years, from 1993 to 2001. Before the 2001\u201302 NHL season, both the Stars and the Mavericks moved into the new American Airlines Center, which is in the Victory Park neighborhood of Dallas, just north of Reunion Arena. American Airlines Center holds 18,584 for Stars and NHL games. On January 24, 2007, the AAC hosted the 2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game. The AAC and the Dallas Stars have won several local and NHL awards for the \"Best Fan Experience\".\nBroadcast.\nAll Dallas Stars games are broadcast on radio on KTCK and its FM simulcast under a five-year deal announced in January 2009. KTCK replaced WBAP, which had broadcast games since the beginning of the 1994 season after KLIF has broadcast the first season in Dallas in 1993. Television coverage occurs on Victory+, after terminating their deal with Bally Sports Southwest.\nThe Stars, along with the Buffalo Sabres and Carolina Hurricanes are one of only three NHL teams to simulcast the entirety of their games on TV and radio, which the team has done since their 1993 arrival in Dallas. The original broadcast team from 1993 to 1996 was Mike Fornes (play-by-play) and Ralph Strangis (color). Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995\u201396 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator Daryl \"Razor\" Reaugh was added. Although both the DFW area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of \"Ralph and Razor\" (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like most professional teams, the Stars also transmit the play-by-play on a low-power station inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM to avoid the broadcast delay caused by sending the network's audio to KTCK, then to its AM and FM transmitters, along with the station's AM radio signal being overwhelmed by the arena's overall electronics.\nStrangis retired from the booth after the 2014\u201315 season and was replaced by Dave Strader. In June 2016, Strader was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a fairly rare and aggressive form of cancer of the bile duct. To begin the 2016\u201317 season, Reaugh assumed play-by-play duties while Strader underwent treatment. Studio analyst and former Stars defenseman, Craig Ludwig, took over as color commentator. During a break in Strader's treatment, he returned to the broadcast booth on February 18, 2017, a 4\u20133 overtime home win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. On October 1, 2017, Strader died of cancer at age 62, leaving Reaugh and Ludwig to call the 2017\u201318 season. In July 2018, the Stars announced that Reaugh would return to color commentary for the 2018\u201319 season, with former studio host Josh Bogorad taking over the play-by-play.\nOn July 3, 2024, Diamond Sports Group, the owner of Bally Sports Southwest agreed to terminate their contract with the Stars. 5 days later, the Stars announced a deal with tech company A Parent Media Co, Inc., which would broadcast games on their streaming service \"Victory+\".\nLogo and jersey design.\nWhen they debuted in Dallas for the 1993\u201394 season, they kept the same uniform design from their later Minnesota days, except for the addition of the Texas logo patch on the shoulders. Away uniforms were black and home uniforms were white. With minor trim changes, a darker shade of green, and the word 'Dallas' added in the 1994\u201395 season, they kept this original design until after their 1999 Stanley Cup-winning campaign. During this time the black pants included the word \"Dallas\" in gold run through the sides with green stripes.\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Stars introduced an alternate uniform that partly resembled those worn during the NHL All-Star Game at the time. The uniform was mostly green on top and black at the bottom, in a star-shaped design. For the 1999\u20132000 season, it became the primary away uniform, and was paired with a new home uniform featuring the same basic design, with white on top and green at the bottom. They kept this design until the 2006\u201307 season, during which the league switched color designations on home and away jerseys in the 2003\u201304 season. The striping was also eliminated on the black pants.\nThe Stars introduced an alternate jersey for the 2003\u201304 season that proved both embarrassing and unpopular to critics and fans. The uniform, which introduced a red as a new trim color, was black with a green bottom and featured a modern representation of the constellation Taurus topped by a trailing green star with red trail marks. However, fans and critics derided the uniform crest for its resemblance to a uterus, nicknaming it the \"Mooterus.\" The uniform was used until the 2005\u201306 season.\nWith the switch to the Reebok Edge uniform system, the jerseys underwent a complete redesign. The home black jersey, introduced for the 2007\u201308 season, features the player's number on the chest and an arched 'Dallas' in white with gold trim, with the primary logo on the shoulders. The primary away jerseys, which were used from 2007 to 2010 and was used as an alternate for its final season, had the Stars logo crest in front and the uniform number on the top right, with the Texas alternate logo on the shoulders. An alternate white jersey based on the home black jersey was introduced for the 2008\u201309 season; they became the regular away uniforms for the 2010\u201311 season. The lettering is in green with gold and black trim. Both uniforms were used until the 2012\u201313 season.\nA new logo and uniforms were introduced for the 2013\u201314 season. Silver replaced gold as the tertiary color, while green (in a new shade called \"Victory Green,\" similar to the old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color. The new logo features the letter D centering a star, symbolizing Dallas' nickname as \"The Big D.\" The home uniforms are in green with black and white striping, while the away uniforms are in white with a green shoulder yoke, and black and green striping. The inner collar features the team name on the home uniforms, and the city name on the away uniforms. The secondary logo, with the primary inside a roundel with the team name, is featured in the shoulders. This design was retained once Adidas took over as uniform supplier prior to the 2017\u201318 season, the only exception being \"Victory Green\" replacing both \"Stars\" and \"Dallas\" on the inner collar of the home and away uniforms respectively.\nThe Stars unveiled a special edition uniform for the 2020 Winter Classic, featuring a design inspired from the defunct Dallas Texans of the United States Hockey League (USHL). The uniform features the word \"Stars\" (with the star substituting for the letter A) in the middle of the big letter \"D\". Both are in white with silver trim. A silhouette of the state of Texas in silver and green trim with the letter \"D\" inside adorns the left sleeve.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Stars added a black alternate uniform with neon green accents (presumably in honor of the Bank of America Plaza tower in downtown Dallas) featuring the alternate \"Texas D\" logo in front. A neon green star is added on the left side of the collar, symbolizing Texas' \"Lone Star State\" nickname. Numbers are in 3D-accented black with neon green accents. The Stars also released a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform for the 2020\u201321 season in collaboration with Adidas, bringing back the 1999\u20132007 uniform design but with the current color scheme in place of the original green, gold and black colors. The design also featured white pants. A second \"Reverse Retro\" alternate was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the 1993\u201394 black uniform but with the current Victory Green and silver stripes.\nThe Stars unveiled a new alternate uniform during the 2025\u201326 season. This design was patterned after the All-Star Game-inspired green uniforms they wore from 1997 to 2007, but recolored to a black base with green and silver accents. The set was nicknamed \"The '99\" in homage to the Stars' 1999 Stanley Cup victory in these uniforms; as such, they paired the uniforms with black pants that featured a vertical \"DALLAS\" in silver with green stripes, replicating the set they wore as an alternate that season.\nMinor league affiliates.\nThe Dallas Stars are presently affiliated with two minor league teams. The Texas Stars are the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Dallas Stars, who after becoming unaffiliated with the Iowa Stars in 2008, did not have an AHL affiliate for the 2008\u201309 season. The Texas Stars began play in the AHL in the 2009\u201310 season as an affiliate for Dallas. They are located in Cedar Park, Texas (northwest of Austin).\nIn addition to their AHL affiliate, the Dallas Stars are also affiliated with the Idaho Steelheads of the ECHL. Based in Boise, the Steelheads play home games at the Idaho Central Arena since 2003.\nTraditions.\nSince the 2005\u201306 season, national anthems are performed by Celena Rae, a Fort Worth native and a former semifinalist on \"American Idol\". During \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the fans yell the team name \"stars\" in the lines \"whose broad stripes and bright stars\" and \"O say does that star spangled banner yet wave\". At games, as part of the entertainment, a Kahlenberg KDT-123 fog horn sounds after every Stars goal.\nWhen the Stars take the ice at the beginning of each game, the song \"Puck Off\" (also referred to as the \"Dallas Stars Fight Song\") by Pantera, is played in the arena. Members of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington metropolitan area band had become friends with members of the Stars in the 1990s, especially following the team's Stanley Cup win in 1999. \"Puck Off\" later also became the team's goal celebration song. During the song, fans chant the only lyrics in the song, \"Dallas! Stars! Dallas! Stars!\" while pumping their fists in the air. After a penalty on the opposing team is announced, Stars public address announcer shouts, \"Your Dallas Stars are on...the...\" with the fans finishing \"power play!\", immediately after which a clip of the Muse song \"Knights of Cydonia\" is played. After each Stars win, the Stevie Ray Vaughan (a Dallas native) and Double Trouble song \"The House is a Rockin'\" is played. A song of unknown origin called \"The Darkness Music\" is played after nearly every away goal. In recent years, fans have usually yelled, \"Who cares!?\" after away team goals are announced by the public address announcer.\nThe Stars have hosted a home game on New Year's Eve every year since 1997, except in 2004, 2012, 2019, 2020 and 2021 (the first two being due to lockouts, the third being due to their participation in the 2020 Winter Classic, the fourth being due to the delayed off-season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fifth was postponed to February 13 due to a team-wide COVID-19 outbreak). For a period of time, the game coincided with the \"Big D NYE\" celebration (now on hiatus) on the south side of the arena in AT&amp;T Plaza.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Stars.

{"id": "73136", "revid": "5308300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73136", "title": "Los Angeles Kings", "text": "National Hockey League team in Los Angeles, California\nThe Los Angeles Kings are a professional ice hockey team based in Los Angeles. The Kings compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. The team was founded on June 5, 1967, after Jack Kent Cooke was awarded an NHL expansion franchise for Los Angeles on February 9, 1966, becoming one of the six teams that began play as part of the 1967 NHL expansion. The team plays its home games at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, their home since the start of the 1999\u20132000 season. Prior to that, the Kings played for 32 years at the Forum in Inglewood, California, a suburb of the Greater Los Angeles area.\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the Kings had many years marked by impressive play in the regular season only to be washed out by early playoff exits. Their highlights in those years included the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon, and the \"Triple Crown Line\" of Charlie Simmer, Dave Taylor and Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne, who had a famous upset of the rising Edmonton Oilers in a 1982 playoff game known as the Miracle on Manchester. In 1988, the Kings traded with the Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky, leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey's popularity in Los Angeles, and helped elevate the sport's profile in the American Sun Belt region. Gretzky, fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille, and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise's sole division title in 1990\u201391, and the Kings' first Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1993, where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens.\nAfter the 1993 Stanley Cup Final, the Kings entered financial problems, with a bankruptcy in 1995, which led to the franchise being acquired by Philip Anschutz (the owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group and the operators of Crypto.com Arena) and Ed Roski Jr.. A period of mediocrity ensued, with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six-year playoff drought in the 2009\u201310 season, with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick, defenseman Drew Doughty, and forwards Dustin Brown, Anze Kopitar, and Justin Williams. Under coach Darryl Sutter, who was hired early in the 2011\u201312 season, and with the acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings won two Stanley Cups in three years: 2012 over the New Jersey Devils, and 2014 over the New York Rangers, while Quick and Williams respectively won the Conn Smythe Trophy. The team has had mixed success since then as they have qualified for the playoffs from 2022 to 2025, but have not advanced past the first round \u2013 a feat they have not achieved since winning the Stanley Cup in 2014.\nHistory.\nNHL expansion and the \"Forum Blue and Gold\" years (1967\u20131975).\nWhen the NHL decided to expand for the 1967\u201368 season amid rumblings that the Western Hockey League (WHL) was proposing to turn itself into a major league and compete for the Stanley Cup, Canadian entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke paid the NHL $2 million to place one of the six expansion teams in Los Angeles. Following a fan contest to name the team, Cooke chose the name Kings because he wanted his club to take on \"an air of royalty,\" and picked the original team colors of purple (or \"Forum Blue\", as it was later officially called) and gold because they were colors traditionally associated with royalty. This color scheme, first popularized by the NCAA's LSU Tigers and later on the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL), was then adopted by the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), which Cooke also owned. Cooke wanted his new NHL team to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, home of the Lakers, but the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, which managed the Sports Arena (and still manages the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum today), had already entered into an agreement with the WHL's Los Angeles Blades (whose owners had also tried to land the NHL expansion franchise in Los Angeles) to play their games at the Sports Arena. Frustrated by his dealings with the Coliseum Commission, Cooke said, \"I am going to build my own arena. ... I've had enough of this balderdash.\"\nConstruction on Cooke's new arena, the Forum, was not yet complete when the 1967\u201368 season began, so the Kings opened their first season at the Long Beach Arena in the neighboring city of Long Beach on October 14, 1967, defeating another expansion team, the Philadelphia Flyers, 4\u20132. The \"Fabulous Forum\" finally opened its doors on December 30, 1967, with the Kings being shut out by the Flyers, 2\u20130. While the first two seasons had the Kings qualifying for the playoffs, afterwards poor management led the Kings into hard times. The general managers established a history of trading away first-round draft picks, usually for veteran players, and attendance suffered during this time. Eventually the Kings made a few key acquisitions to resurge as a contender. By acquiring Toronto Maple Leafs winger Bob Pulford, who would later become the Kings' head coach, in 1970, Swedish center Juha Widing in a trade from the New York Rangers, and Montreal Canadiens goaltender Rogie Vachon in 1971, the Kings went from being one of the worst defensive teams in the league to one of the best, and in 1974 they returned to the playoffs.\nMarcel Dionne and the \"Triple Crown Line\" (1975\u20131988).\nAfter being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in both 1973\u201374 and 1974\u201375, the Kings moved to significantly upgrade their offensive firepower when they acquired center Marcel Dionne from the Detroit Red Wings. Behind Dionne's offensive prowess, the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon, and the speed and scoring touch of forward Butch Goring, the Kings played two of their most thrilling seasons yet, with playoff match ups against the then-Atlanta Flames in the first round, and the Boston Bruins in the second round, both times being eliminated by Boston.\nBob Pulford left the Kings after the 1976\u201377 season after constant feuding with then owner Jack Kent Cooke, and General Manager Jake Milford decided to leave as well. This led to struggles in the 1977\u201378 season, where the Kings finished below .500 and were easily swept out of the first round by the Maple Leafs. Afterwards, Vachon became a free agent and sign with the Red Wings. The following season, Kings coach Bob Berry tried juggling line combinations, and Dionne found himself on a new line with two young, mostly unknown players: second-year right winger Dave Taylor and left winger Charlie Simmer, who had been a career minor-leaguer. Each player benefited from each other, with Simmer being the gritty player who battled along the boards, Taylor being the play maker, and Dionne being the natural goal scorer. This line combination, known as the \"Triple Crown Line\", would go on to become one of the highest-scoring line combinations in NHL history. During the first three seasons of the Triple Crown Line, a period where Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Kings, the Lakers, and the Forum for $67.5 million, the Kings were eliminated in the first round. The Kings regressed in 1981\u201382 finishing 17th overall, but this was nevertheless good enough to make the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs under the new format put in place that year as they were still fourth in their division with 63 points, the lowest point total of any playoff team but ahead of the Colorado Rockies, the worst team in the league that season. However, Los Angeles managed to upset the second overall Edmonton Oilers, who finished 48 points ahead of them during the season and were led by the young Wayne Gretzky. With two victories in Edmonton and one at the Forum \u2013 dubbed \"Miracle on Manchester\", where the Kings managed to erase a 5\u20130 deficit in the third period and eventually win in overtime \u2013 the Kings upset the vaunted Oilers, but they wound up eliminated by eventual finalists Vancouver Canucks in five games.\nThe 1982 off-season saw the moribund Rockies move to East Rutherford, New Jersey. To keep the divisions geographically and numerically balanced, the renamed New Jersey Devils were re-aligned to the Patrick Division while the Winnipeg Jets took their place in the Smythe Division. It was immediately apparent that the Kings, now the lone American team in the division, would have a much more difficult time staying out of last place since Winnipeg, after struggling for their first two seasons after moving over from the WHA, had already improved to a .500 record the previous season. Despite Dionne's leadership, the Kings missed the playoffs in the next two seasons.\nThe Kings managed to record a winning record in 1984\u201385 under coach Pat Quinn, although it was still only good enough for fourth place. This time, the Kings were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Oilers on their way to capturing their second-straight Stanley Cup championship. After a losing season in 1985\u201386, the Kings saw two important departures during 1986\u201387, as Quinn signed a contract in December to become coach and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks with just months left on his Kings contract \u2013 eventually being suspended by NHL President John Ziegler for creating a conflict of interest - and Dionne left the franchise in March in a trade to the New York Rangers. Despite these shocks, a young squad that would lead the Kings into the next decade, including star forwards Bernie Nicholls, Jimmy Carson, Luc Robitaille, and defenseman Steve Duchesne, started to flourish under head coach Mike Murphy, who played 13 seasons with the Kings and was their captain for seven years, and his replacement Robbie Ftorek. The Kings made the playoffs for two seasons, but they were unable to get out of the first round given the playoff structuring forced them to play either the Oilers or the equally powerful Calgary Flames en route to the conference finals. In all, the Kings faced either the Oilers or the Flames in the playoffs four times during the 1980s.\nThe Gretzky era (1988\u20131995).\nIn 1987, coin collector Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. After changing the team colors to silver and black, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers on August 9, 1988. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially north of the border, where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. Gretzky's arrival generated much excitement about hockey and the NHL in Southern California, and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited for the arrival of another team in the region (the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, renamed the Anaheim Ducks in 2006), as well as the arrival of a new team in Northern California (the San Jose Sharks) and the NHL's expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix (until 2024), Tampa, Miami, Nashville, and Las Vegas.\nIn Gretzky's first season with the Kings, he led the team in scoring with 168 points on 54 goals and 114 assists and won his ninth Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player. The fourth overall Kings eliminated Gretzky's old team, the Oilers, in the first round of the 1989 playoffs before being swept out in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Flames. Clashes between Gretzky and head coach Robbie Ftorek led to Ftorek's dismissal, and he was replaced by Tom Webster. The next season, where Gretzky became the league's all-time leading scorer, was the inverse of its predecessor, with the Kings eliminating the defending champion Flames before falling to the eventual champion Oilers. Gretzky spearheaded the Kings to their first regular season division title in franchise history in the 1990\u201391 season, but the heavily favored Kings lost a close series against Edmonton in the second round that saw four games go into overtime. After a third straight elimination by the Oilers in 1992, Webster was fired. General manager Rogie Vachon was moved to a different position in the organization and named Nick Beverley as his successor, and Beverley hired Barry Melrose, then with the American Hockey League's Adirondack Red Wings, as head coach.\nMelrose would help the Kings reach new heights in the 1992\u201393 season, even if Gretzky missed 39 games with a career-threatening herniated thoracic disk. Led by Luc Robitaille, who served as captain in Gretzky's absence, the Kings finished with a 39\u201335\u201310 record (88 points), clinching third place in the Smythe Division. Heavily contested series in the 1993 playoffs had the Kings eliminating the Flames, Canucks and Leafs en route to their first berth in the Stanley Cup Final. In the 1993 Stanley Cup Final, the Kings faced the Montreal Canadiens. They won the first game 4\u20131, but late in game 2, with the Kings leading by a score of 2\u20131, Canadiens coach Jacques Demers requested a measurement of Kings defenseman Marty McSorley's stick blade. His suspicions proved to be correct, as the curve of blade was too great, and McSorley was penalized. The Canadiens pulled their goaltender, Patrick Roy, giving them a two-man advantage, and Eric Desjardins scored on the resulting power play to tie the game. Montreal went on to win the game in overtime on another goal by Desjardins, and the Kings never recovered. They dropped the next two games in overtime, and lost game 5, 4\u20131, giving the Canadiens their league-leading 24th Stanley Cup in franchise history.\nBankruptcy, move to the Staples Center, and rebuild (1995\u20132009).\nThe years after the 1993 playoff run were tough for the Kings, as a sluggish start in the 1993\u201394 season cost them a playoff berth, their first absence from the postseason since 1986. However, Gretzky provided a notable highlight during that year on March 23, 1994, when he scored his 802nd career goal to pass Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer. At the same time, McNall defaulted on a loan from Bank of America, who threatened to force the Kings into bankruptcy unless he sold the team. After the federal government launched an investigation into his financial practices, McNall finally sold the club to IDB Communications founder Jeffrey Sudikoff and former Madison Square Garden president Joseph Cohen. It later emerged that McNall's free-spending ways put the Kings in serious financial trouble; at one point, Cohen and Sudikoff were even unable to meet player payroll, and were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in 1995. They were forced to trade many of their stronger players, and the middling results led to Gretzky demanding a trade to a legitimate Stanley Cup contender. He would be dealt to the St. Louis Blues in 1996.\nOn October 6, 1995, one day before the 1995\u201396 season opener, a bankruptcy court approved the purchase of the Kings by Philip Anschutz and Edward P. Roski for $113.5 million. The subsequent rebuild saw the Kings only return to the playoffs in 1998, led by captain Rob Blake and players like Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray, where the highly skilled St. Louis Blues swept the team in four games. The Kings suffered through an injury-plagued season in 1998\u201399 as they finished last in the Pacific Division and missed the playoffs with a 32\u201345\u20135 record, leading to the dismissal of head coach Larry Robinson.\nThe Kings, along with the Los Angeles Lakers, made an even bigger move in 1999, as they left The Forum after 32 seasons and moved to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, which was built by Anschutz and Roski. Staples Center was a state-of-the-art arena, complete with luxury suites and all modern amenities. With a new home, a new coach (Andy Murray), a potential 50-goal scorer in the fold in Zigmund Palffy, and players such as Blake, Robitaille, Murray, Stumpel, Donald Audette, Ian Laperri\u00e8re, and Mattias Norstrom, the Kings improved dramatically, finishing the season the 1999\u20132000 season with a 39\u201331\u201312\u20134 record (94 points), good for second place in the Pacific Division. While Audette would struggle under the Kings' system and was unhappy as the number two right wing, most of the new Kings like Bryan Smolinski and Palffy would find success under Andy Murray. But in the 2000 playoffs, the Kings were once again dispatched in the first round, this time by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep.\nThe 2000\u201301 season was controversial, as fans began to question AEG's commitment to the success of the Kings because they failed to significantly improve the team during the off-season. Adding fuel to the fire was the February 21, 2001, trade of star defenseman and fan favorite Rob Blake to the Colorado Avalanche. Despite this, two players received in the deal, right wing Adam Deadmarsh and defenseman Aaron Miller, became impact players for the Kings, who finished the 2000\u201301 season with a 38\u201328\u201313\u20133 record (92 points), good for a third-place finish in the Pacific Division and another first-round playoff date with the Detroit Red Wings. The heavily favored Red Wings suffered an upset, losing in six games for the Kings' first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round, the Kings forced seven games in their series against the Avalanche, but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions.\nAfterwards, during the off-season, Luc Robitaille turned down a one-year deal with a substantial pay cut and ended up signing with Detroit, as the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup, and like Tomas Sandstrom before him in 1997, Robitaille won the Stanley Cup with Detroit in 2002. The Kings started off the season with a sluggish October and November, and then found their game again to finish with 95 points. They in fact were tied in points with the second-place Phoenix Coyotes, and only finished third in the Pacific Division and seventh in the West due to a head-to-head record \u2014 the Coyotes won the season series, 3\u20130\u20132. In the playoffs they met the Colorado Avalanche once again, this time in the first round. The series would prove to be a carbon copy of their previous meeting, with the Kings behind three games to one and bouncing back to tie the series, only to be dominated in the seventh game and eliminated. The next seasons would be major disappointments as the Kings hit another major decline, missing the postseason up until the 2009\u201310 season.\nDuring those mediocre seasons, there would be a few bright spots in the form of draft picks that would attribute to future success for the team, beginning with the 2003 NHL entry draft. Players such as Dustin Brown (2003), Anze Kopitar, Jonathan Quick (both 2005), and Drew Doughty (2008) were drafted and would help the Kings reach the playoffs once again.\nReturn to the playoffs (2009\u20132011).\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the team had built a consistent roster with goaltender Jonathan Quick, defenseman Drew Doughty, and forwards Dustin Brown, Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams. Finishing sixth overall in the West with 101 points, just the third 100-plus point season in franchise history, and establishing a franchise record with a nine-game unbeaten streak, the Kings returned to the playoffs, where they lost to a highly skilled third-seeded Vancouver Canucks team in six games.\nThe Kings entered the 2011 playoffs as the seventh seed in the West and played the second-seeded San Jose Sharks in the first round. Despite Anze Kopitar's absence with injury, the Kings pushed the series to six games until an overtime goal by Joe Thornton qualified the Sharks.\nStanley Cup championships (2011\u20132014).\nA bad start to the 2011\u201312 season resulted in coach Terry Murray being fired, with Darryl Sutter being chosen as his replacement. The Kings were much improved under Sutter, finishing with the eighth seed after trading for Jeff Carter midseason and having finishing the season with a 40\u201327\u201315 record for 95 points. The Kings then headed into the 2012 playoffs against the back-to-back Presidents' Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks. After playing two games in Vancouver and one in Los Angeles, the Kings were up 3\u20130 in the series, a franchise first. By winning game 5 in Vancouver in overtime, the Kings advanced to the conference semifinals for the first time since the 2000\u201301 season, whereupon they swept the second-seeded St. Louis Blues, advancing to the conference finals for only the second time in franchise history. In doing so, the Kings also became the first NHL team to enter the playoffs as the eighth seed and eliminate the first- and second-seeded teams in the conference. They then defeated Phoenix in five games to reach the Stanley Cup Final, culminating in an overtime goal by Dustin Penner in game 5, and thus becoming the second team in NHL history to beat the top three Conference seeds in the playoffs (the Calgary Flames achieved the same feat in 2004, ironically also under Darryl Sutter) and the first eighth seed to accomplish the feat.\nLos Angeles faced the New Jersey Devils in the Cup Final, defeating them in six games to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. With the game 6 victory occurring on home ice at Staples Center, the Kings became the first team since the 2007 Anaheim Ducks to win the Stanley Cup at home, as well as the second Californian NHL team to do so. The Kings became the first eight seed champion in any of the North American major leagues, the first Stanley Cup champion that finished below fifth in its conference, and the third to finish below second in its division (after the 1993 Canadiens and the 1995 Devils). Goaltender Jonathan Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs, and soon after signed a ten-year contract extension on June 28.\nDue to the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout, the 2012\u201313 NHL season began on January 19, 2013, and was shortened to 48 games. The Kings finished the season as the fifth seed in the West and began the defense of the Cup on the road against the St. Louis Blues, who they swept in the 2012 playoffs. After losing the first two games, the Kings won four in a row to eliminate the Blues in six games. In the second round, they then played a very tough San Jose Sharks team, this time with home-ice advantage. In the first game, Jarret Stoll suffered an injury from the Sharks' Raffi Torres, who ended up being suspended for the rest of the series. The Kings eventually won in seven games. In the conference finals, they faced the number one seed in the West and Presidents' Trophy winning-Chicago Blackhawks. After dropping the first two games, the Kings won game 3 with Jeff Carter suffering an injury from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith, who was suspended for game 4 as a result. After losing game 4, the Kings battled the Blackhawks through two overtime periods in game 5, with Patrick Kane eventually scoring the game-winning goal that won the game and the series, sending the Blackhawks to the 2013 Stanley Cup Final against the Boston Bruins (whom they defeated in six games for their second Stanley Cup in four seasons) and ending the Kings' season.\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, the Kings acquired Marian Gaborik, and qualified for their fifth straight playoffs with the sixth-best result of the West. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Kings played their in-state rivals, the San Jose Sharks. After losing the first three games to the Sharks, the Kings became the fourth team in NHL history to win the final four games in a row after initially being down three games to none, beating the Sharks in San Jose in the deciding game 7. In the second round, the Kings played another in-state rival, Anaheim. After starting the series with two wins, the Kings lost three-straight games, trailing the series three games to two. However, for the second time in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Kings were able to rally back after being down in the series and defeated the Ducks in Anaheim in game 7. In the third round, the Kings jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead against Stanley Cup-defending Chicago, but were unable to close out the series in the fifth and sixth games. On June 1, 2014, the Kings advanced to the Stanley Cup Final for the second time in three years after winning game 7, 4\u20133, in overtime through a goal from Alec Martinez, clinching their third Western Conference title in franchise history. The Kings became the first team in NHL history to win three game 7s en route to a Stanley Cup Final berth. Not only were the Kings the first team in history to accomplish this feat, but they also managed to win all game sevens on opposing ice. For the third time, the Kings were finalists after finishing third in their division and sixth or lower in their conference.\nIn the Stanley Cup Final, the Kings faced the Eastern Conference-winning New York Rangers, who had defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games in the conference finals. The Kings won the Stanley Cup in five games, culminating with an Alec Martinez goal in the second overtime of game 5 at Staples Center. The championship run had a record-tying 26 playoff games (the 1986\u201387 Philadelphia Flyers and 2003\u201304 Calgary Flames being the others), with the Kings facing elimination a record seven times. With their game 7 victory in the conference finals and wins in the first two games of the Cup Final, they became the first team to win three consecutive playoff games after trailing by more than one goal in each game. Justin Williams, who scored twice in the Cup Final and had points in all three game 7s throughout the playoffs, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.\nPost-Stanley Cup titles and continued contention (2014\u2013present).\nHaving won two Stanley Cup championships in the last three years, the Kings entered the 2014\u201315 season as the early favorites to retain their title. However, the Kings struggled often, with scoring slumps, defensemen losing games to injury and suspensions and frequent road losses. A defeat to the Calgary Flames in the penultimate game of the season eliminated the Kings from playoff contention, while qualifying Calgary, which coincidentally missed the postseason during the Kings' five-season playoff streak. Despite finishing with a record of 40\u201327\u201315, the Kings became the first defending Stanley Cup champion to miss the postseason since the 2006\u201307 Carolina Hurricanes and only the fourth overall since the 1967 NHL expansion season.\nAt the start of the 2015\u201316 season, the Kings were expected to make the playoffs. They entered the playoffs as the fifth seed in their conference and second seed in their division. They faced the San Jose Sharks, but lost to them in five games. On June 16, 2016, the Kings named Anze Kopitar the 14th captain in team history, replacing Dustin Brown, who had led the team for the past eight seasons.\nThe Kings celebrated their 50th anniversary during the 2016\u201317 season along with the other still active 1967 expansion teams (the St. Louis Blues, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins), and for the first time since 2002, they hosted the NHL All-Star Game; Jeff Carter and Drew Doughty would represent the Kings at the All-Star Game, with the former leading the team in scoring this season. Goaltender Jonathan Quick suffered an injury on opening night that sidelined him for most of the season, and the Kings struggled without him. Backup Peter Budaj filled the void, earning his first starting duties since his time with the Colorado Avalanche six years earlier, but near the trade deadline, the Kings traded him to Tampa Bay for another goaltender, Ben Bishop who shared the crease with Jonathan Quick down the stretch, the superstar having returned from his injury. Despite the trade, the Kings ultimately missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons and, in the off-season, fired general manager Dean Lombardi and head coach Darryl Sutter. Assistant general manager Rob Blake was promoted to be the new general manager and John Stevens took over as head coach after serving as associate head coach for the Kings for several seasons. In the 2017 NHL expansion draft, the Vegas Golden Knights drafted defenseman Brayden McNabb, who had been left unprotected by the Kings. In the next season, the Kings clinched the 2018 playoffs as a wild card, but were swept by the expansion Golden Knights.\nOn November 4, 2018, the Kings fired Stevens as head coach after the team started the 2018\u201319 season 4\u20138\u20131, and replaced him with Willie Desjardins. In Desjardins' debut on November 7, the Kings defeated the Ducks 4\u20131. The Kings finished the 2018\u201319 season in last place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference with 71 points and they missed the playoffs for the third time in five seasons.\nThe Kings hired Todd McLellan as their next head coach on April 16, 2019. The 2019\u201320 season was highlighted by several rebuilding moves, as players such as Trevor Lewis, Jack Campbell, Kyle Clifford, Derek Forbort and Alec Martinez would all depart the team, through trades or via free agency. The team notably won the 2020 Stadium Series in a 3\u20131 win over the Colorado Avalanche, which saw Tyler Toffoli score the league's first hat trick in an outdoor regular season game; Toffoli was traded to the Vancouver Canucks two days after the feat. In their later portion of the season, the Kings called up several prospects including Mikey Anderson, Gabriel Vilardi and Cal Petersen, as the team went on a seven-game win streak, showcasing their deep and talented prospect pool. However, this win streak would mark the end of their season; the NHL would pause its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of their plan to return to play, the regular season was officially ended, and the Kings were one of seven teams left out of the playoffs. They were automatically entered into the first phase of the 2020 NHL draft lottery, in which the Kings received the second overall pick.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Kings had another rebuilding year as they traded Jeff Carter, extended Alex Iafallo and saw debuts of prospects such as Jaret Anderson-Dolan, Arthur Kaliyev, Tobias Bjornfot, Rasmus Kupari and Quinton Byfield. A bright spot saw Anze Kopitar score his 1,000th point near season's end. They finished sixth in the West Division and missed the playoffs again. During the 2021 NHL expansion draft, the Seattle Kraken selected Kurtis MacDermid from the Kings, who was left unprotected.\nIn the lead-up to the 2021\u201322 season, the Kings acquired forwards Phillip Danault and Viktor Arvidsson during the off-season. They also signed defenseman Alexander Edler in an effort to bolster their blue line presence. The Kings qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four seasons, despite losing Drew Doughty to injury. This season would also prove to be Dustin Brown's last, as the forward announced on April 28, 2022, that he would retire following the 2022 playoffs. They were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers in seven games in the first round.\nDuring the 2022 off-season, the Kings acquired Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild to replace Brown on the first line. The 2022\u201323 season would start off well, as Fiala would lead the team in points for much of the season and be elected to the 2023 All-Star Game. Clinching the 2023 playoffs, the Kings once again faced the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, this time losing in six games.\nThe Kings made a blockbuster move in the 2023 off-season, trading forwards Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Rasmus Kupari to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for forward Pierre-Luc Dubois, who signed an eight-year, $68 million contract upon being traded.\nThe 2023\u201324 season got off to a strong start, as the team began the season with an 11\u20130\u20130 record on the road, breaking the NHL record (previously held by the Buffalo Sabres) for the longest unbeaten road streak to start the year. Goaltender Cam Talbot's resurgent play led to him being named to the 2024 NHL All-Star weekend. However, in January 2024, the Kings' season collapsed; despite making no major lineup or personnel changes, the Kings suddenly won just three of their final 17 games before the All-Star break. On February 2, the Kings fired head coach McLellan, with assistant Jim Hiller named interim head coach. Under Hiller, the Kings regained their footing but never fully returned to their stronger form from earlier in the season. They finished third in the Pacific Division and clinched the 2024 playoffs, where they would be eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers for the third year in a row, this time in five games.\nHiller was subsequently promoted to full-time head coach following the season. Much discussion during and after the Kings' season centered around Pierre-Luc Dubois, as his season in Los Angeles was largely underwhelming. Dubois only managed 16 goals and 40 points, and finished with a plus-minus rating of \u20139, despite the heavy expectations that came with his new deal. His first season with the Kings would be his only one, as he would be traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for goaltender Darcy Kuemper, who had previously spent time with the Kings.\nThe 2024\u201325 season started off well, the Kings continued to be at a strong run of form after the 4 Nations Face-Off break which saw them finish second in the Pacific Division and clinched the 2025 playoffs, with goaltender Darcy Kuemper\u2019s resurgent play saw him named Vezina Trophy finalist at the end of the season. In the playoffs they would meet their heated rivals the Edmonton Oilers for the fourth consecutive year after initially taking a 2\u20130 series lead, in game 3 with the Kings holding a 4\u20133 lead in the third period and potentially a 3\u20130 series lead before head coach Hiller made a unsuccessful coach challenge call on the Evander Kane tying goal for goaltender interference which resulted in the Oilers scoring the game winning goal on the power play by Evan Bouchard with the Oilers winning it 7\u20134, ultimately the coach challenge call was the turning point of the series as the Kings would end up losing the next four games and being eliminated for the fourth consecutive year in the first round.\nFollowing the season the Kings announced that vice-president and general manager Rob Blake contract would not be renewed, the Kings would subsequently hired former Edmonton Oilers general manager Ken Holland as their new vice-president and general manager.\nTeam identity.\nUniforms and logos.\nThe Los Angeles Kings debuted in the NHL wearing purple \u2013 officially the shade \"Forum blue\" \u2013 and gold uniforms. The original design was simple and straightforward, featuring monochrome striping on the shoulders and tail, as well as purple pants with white and gold trim. Later on, white trim was added on the numbers, and names were also added, while tail stripes were adjusted. At one point, gold pants were used to pair with the gold uniforms during the 1970s. A variation of the original crown logo, with a contrasting color background, was used with this uniform.\nFrom 1980 to 1988, the Kings modified their uniforms to include a contrasting yoke that extends from sleeve to sleeve. White was also added to the socks, on the tail stripes, and at the bottom of the yoke, but the color was removed from the pants. The names and numbers were also modified to a standard NHL block lettering.\nJust in time for Wayne Gretzky's arrival, the Kings' colors changed to black and silver, mirroring those of the Los Angeles Raiders. The team's banner logo, which previously had been modified with the word \"KINGS\" enlarged beyond the boundaries of the banner, was now fully enclosed, and rendered in silver and black; the enclosed logo drew comparisons to the Chevrolet bowtie logo. The new uniforms did not deviate much from the prior design, save for the color scheme, the new logo, and a switch from a contrasting yoke color to sleeve stripes containing the sleeve numbers. With minor changes to the text, number font and pant striping, the uniforms were used until the 1997\u201398 season.\nThe Kings briefly reintroduced purple and gold to the color scheme upon unveiling an alternate jersey for the 1995\u201396 season. The uniform featured a gradually fading black splash, medieval-inspired serif text, and a logo of a bearded figure wearing a golden crown. The so-called \"Burger King\" jersey proved to be unpopular with fans, and was scrapped after only one season.\nFor the 1998\u201399 season, the Kings unveiled new logos, uniforms and a new purple-silver-white color scheme, as black and silver had become associated with gang colors. The shade of purple was a lighter shade than the one used in the \"Forum blue and gold\" era. The new primary logo was a shield and crest featuring three royal symbols\u2013a sunglass-clad lion, a crown and the Sun. The jerseys featured the shield logo with hints of purple on the yoke, sleeve stripes and tail. By coincidence, this was the same color scheme as the NBA's Sacramento Kings, who had rebranded to the scheme four years before the NHL's Kings did, as well as the Colorado Rockies (not to be confused with the NHL Rockies who became the New Jersey Devils) of Major League Baseball. The bottom of the jerseys read the city name. A purple alternate jersey featuring the updated secondary crown logo was unveiled for the 1999\u20132000 season. In 2002, the crown logo became the primary while the shield logo was demoted to alternate status. The socks on the black and purple uniforms also switched designations to match their counterparts. Upon moving to the Reebok Edge design in 2007, the jerseys were updated without the tail stripes. The purple-tinged road jerseys were used until the 2010\u201311 season, while the home jersey was demoted to alternate status in 2011 and remained in use until 2013.\nIn 2008, the Kings unveiled an alternate jersey inspired by the 1988\u20131998 Kings motif. The current logo, now in a black and silver banner with the updated crown logo and 'LA' abbreviation on top, made its debut with the jersey. Three years later, the Kings completed the transition back to the classic black and silver by unveiling a new away jersey, which unlike the home jersey, features a black and silver tail stripe. The Kings script from their 1988\u201398 logo returned on the helmets, and would stay that way until 2013, when they were replaced by the current Kings script.\nFrom the 2010\u201311 to the 2016\u201317 seasons, the Kings have also worn their classic purple and gold jerseys from the late 1970s as part of \"Legends Night\" on select home dates. Minor changes in the uniform include the NHL shield logo on the neck piping, as well as the use of the Reebok Edge design.\nThe Kings wore silver jerseys with white trim, black stripes and shoulder yoke during the 2014 Stadium Series. The uniforms featured a metallic treatment of the alternate crown logo in front. The sleeve numbers were slightly tilted diagonally, while the back numbers were enlarged for visibility purposes. A new 'LA' alternate logo was placed on the left shoulder yoke. For the 2015 Stadium Series, the Kings wore a tricolored jersey featuring the team's silver, black and white colors. Both the sleeve and back numbers are enlarged, while white pants were used with this jersey.\nAs part of the Kings' 50th anniversary in the 2016\u201317 season, the team wore commemorative silver alternate jerseys with a black shoulder yoke and striping for every Saturday home game. The logos and lettering were accented with metallic gold, while a purple neckline featured five gold diamonds to symbolize the Kings' original colors. A 50th Anniversary patch was adorned on the right shoulder.\nAdidas signed an agreement with the NHL to be the official manufacturer of uniforms and licensed apparel for all teams, starting with the 2017\u201318 season, replacing Reebok. The home and away uniforms that were debuted in the 2007\u201308 season remained identical with the exception of the new Adidas ADIZERO template and the new collar. With the new collar, the NHL shield was moved to the front and center on a pentagon with a new \"Chrome Flex\" style. The waist stripes on the road white jersey became curved instead of being straight across.\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Kings brought back their silver alternate uniforms last used in the 2016\u201317 season, minus the metallic gold elements in the logo and numerals. The uniform was retired following the 2020\u201321 season.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, the Kings brought back the 1992\u20131998 white uniform (with black letters and silver trim) as a \"heritage\" uniform for two games.\nThe 2020 Stadium Series saw the Kings wear special black and white uniforms with \"LA\" tilted upward in front, along with chrome helmets. The uniforms took cues from the angular architecture and aircraft of the United States Air Force Academy.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Kings unveiled a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas. The uniform essentially recreated the design worn from 1988 to 1998, but black and silver were replaced by the team's original purple and gold colors.\nBefore the 2021\u201322 season, the Kings replaced their silver alternates with a modernized version of the throwback 1990s white uniforms. The design featured slightly different striping patterns from the originals, and were paired with chrome helmets. In the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Kings opted to wear these alternates during road games, but replaced the chrome helmets with the primary white helmets.\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was unveiled in the 2022\u201323 season, featuring the 1980\u201388 uniform but with a white base, purple stripes and gold accents.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Kings unveiled a new primary logo, which is a modernized version of their 1988 logo. The new uniforms were also heavily based on the 1988\u20131998 uniforms, but the sleeve numbers were no longer placed on the contrasting stripe as they were in the previous uniform.\nOn October 7, 2025, the Kings released a new alternate uniform, using a black base and silver elements. The crest in front is the team's classic \"crown\" logo, and the fonts used were based on the wordmark found on the primary logo. The design was highly influenced by the original purple and gold \"crown\" uniforms the team wore from 1967 to 1980. Like with their previous alternate uniform, these were paired with chrome helmets, though on a few occasions they also wore the black helmets.\nMascot.\nSince 2007, the mascot of the Kings is Bailey, a lion who wears No. 72 (the average temperature in Los Angeles). He was named in honor of Garnet \"Ace\" Bailey, who served as Director of Pro Scouting for seven years before dying in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Bailey is the second mascot, after Kingston the snow leopard in the early 1990s, who now serves as the mascot of the Kings' AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign.\nRivalries.\nThe Kings have developed strong rivalries with the two other Californian teams of the NHL, the Anaheim Ducks \u2013 who also play in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, leading to the rivalry dubbed the \"Freeway Face-Off\" as both cities are separated by the Interstate 5, and the rivalry with the San Jose Sharks \u2013 also reflects the animosity between Northern and Southern California. The Kings eliminated both teams during the 2014 Stanley Cup run, and have played outdoor games with them for the NHL Stadium Series, losing to the Ducks at Dodger Stadium in 2014 and beating the Sharks at Levi's Stadium the following year. During the 1980s, the Kings developed a heated rivalry with the Edmonton Oilers, which has rekindled in recent years after meeting and losing for four straight years in the first round of the playoffs against the Oilers between 2022 and 2025.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Kings.

In addition to players and builders, athletic trainers have been inducted into the Hall of Fame through the Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers Society, and the Society of Professional Hockey Equipment Managers. Two athletic trainers from the Kings organization were inducted into the Hall of Fame: Peter Demers in 2007 and Mark O'Neill in 2016.\nThree sports broadcasters for the Kings were awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for their contributions to hockey broadcasting: Jiggs McDonald (1990), Bob Miller (2000), and Nick Nickson (2015).

Considered to be one of the finest hockey play-by-play announcers, Miller held the post continuously until retirement in 2017, and is often referred to as the \"Voice of the Kings\". He received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the NHL Hockey Broadcasters Association on November 13, 2000, making him a media honoree for the Hockey Hall of Fame, and he also earned a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. Miller has written two books about his experiences with the team, \"Bob Miller's Tales of the Los Angeles Kings\" (2006), and \"Tales From The Los Angeles Kings Locker Room: A Collection Of The Greatest Kings Stories Ever Told\" (2013). On March 2, 2017, citing health reasons, Miller announced his retirement after 44 years with the team, and finished his career broadcasting the final two games of the 2016\u201317 Kings season. The Kings named NBCSN announcer Alex Faust as Miller's replacement, play-by-play announcer the team on TV for the 2017\u201318 season on June 1, 2017.\nOn September 18, 2018. the team announced that it would cease over-the-air radio broadcasts, and had partnered with iHeartMedia to form the \"Los Angeles Kings Audio Network\", which streams exclusively on the iHeartRadio platform. The deal also includes pre-game shows and other ancillary content streaming on iHeartRadio. Two pre-season games were simulcast by KEIB before the transition was completed.\nOn June 5, 2023, the Kings parted ways with Alex Faust and planned on returning to a TV/radio simulcast format with Nick Nickson, Jim Fox and Daryl Evans, which they last used in the 1989\u201390 season.\nOn September 14, 2023, the Kings announced a new contract with Bally Sports West, airing around 65 games, and KCAL-TV, airing around 6 games.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Kings announced a new deal with ESPN Radio 710 to stream all games on the ESPN LA app, with 25 games to simulcast on the radio.\nNick Nickson retired after the 2024\u201325 season, and the Kings reverted to employing separate radio and television announce teams. On September 11, 2025, former St. Louis Blues announcer John Kelly was hired to call games on television, while Josh Schaefer was promoted to lead play-by-play on radio. On games where Kelly was assigned to work nationally for ESPN, Schaefer would take over on television. Additionally, the Kings brought in former players Ray Ferraro, Tony Granato and Jarret Stoll to rotate alongside lead analyst Jim Fox on television.\nTelevision: FanDuel Sports Network West and KCAL-TV\nRadio: ESPN Radio 710 and ESPN LA App\nPublic address:\nAffiliate teams.\nThe Kings are currently affiliated with the Ontario Reign in the American Hockey League, they also have an affiliation with the Greenville Swamp Rabbits in the ECHL.

He founded Aesthetic Realism, a philosophical movement based in New York City. An idea central to Aesthetic Realism\u2014that every person, place or thing in reality has something in common with all other things\u2014was expressed in the title poem of his first volume, \"\". His second volume was \"Hail, American Development\".\nSiegel's philosophic works include \"Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism,\" \"Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,\" and \"The Aesthetic Nature of the World\". His teaching of Aesthetic Realism spanned almost four decades and included thousands of extemporaneous lectures on poetry, the arts and sciences, religion, economics, and national ethics, as well as lessons to individuals and general classes which showed that questions of everyday life are aesthetic and ethical.\nHis lecture on the poetry of William Carlos Williams, which Williams attended, is published in \"The Williams-Siegel Documentary\" and his lectures on Henry James's \"The Turn of the Screw\" were edited into a critical consideration titled \"James and the Children\".\nSiegel's philosophy, and his statement, \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites\", has influenced artists, scientists, and educators.\nLife.\nBorn in Dvinsk, Russian Empire, Siegel emigrated to the United States in 1905 with his parents, Mendel and Sarah (Einhorn) Siegel. The family settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where Siegel attended Baltimore City College and joined the speech and debate team now referred to as the Bancroft/Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies. He contributed to the senior publication \"The Green Bag\" and graduated in 1919. In 1922, together with V.F. Calverton [George Goetz], he co-founded \"The Modern Quarterly,\" a magazine in which his earliest essays appeared, including \"The Scientific Criticism\" (Vol. I, No. 1, March 1923) and \"The Equality of Man\" (Vol. I, No. 3, December 1923).\nIn 1925, his \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" was selected from four thousand anonymously submitted poems as the winner of \"The Nation's\" esteemed poetry prize. The magazine's editors described it as \"the most passionate and interesting poem which came in\u2014a poem recording through magnificent rhythms a profound and important and beautiful vision of the earth on which afternoons and men have always existed.\" The poem begins:\nQuiet and green was the grass of the field,\nThe sky was whole in brightness,\nAnd O, a bird was flying, high, there in the sky,\nSo gently, so carelessly and fairly.\n\"Hot Afternoons\" met violent opposition, according to William Carlos Williams, who wrote, years later: \"Only today do I realize how important that poem is in the history of our development as a cultural entity.\" \"In Hot Afternoons\", Siegel later explained, \"I tried to take many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and to show, in a beautiful way, that they aren't so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with one another.\"\nSiegel continued writing poetry throughout his life but devoted the majority of his time over the next decades to developing the philosophy he later called Aesthetic Realism. After moving to New York City, he became a member of the Greenwich Village poets, famous for his dramatic readings of \"Hot Afternoons\" and other poems. His two-word poem, \"One Question\", won recognition in 1925 as the shortest poem in the English language. It appeared in the \"Literary Review\" of the \"New York Evening Post\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis poem was later reprinted without the author's name in an anthology edited by Louis Untermeyer and an anthology edited by Max J. Herzberg.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor several years in the 1930s Siegel served as master of ceremonies for regular poetry readings that were well known for combining poetry and jazz. He was also a regular reviewer for \"Scribner's\" magazine and the \"New York Evening Post\" Literary Review. In 1938, Siegel began teaching poetry classes with the view that \"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life\". In 1941, students in these classes asked him to give individual lessons in which they might learn about their own lives. These were the first Aesthetic Realism lessons.\nIn 1944, Siegel married Martha Baird (University of Iowa), who had begun studying in his classes the year before. Baird would later become Secretary of the Society for Aesthetic Realism, and also a musicologist and poet in her own right.https://\nIn 1946, at Steinway Hall, Siegel began giving weekly lectures in which he presented the philosophy he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism) \"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier\".\nFrom 1941 to 1978, he gave many thousand lectures on poetry, history, economics\u2014a wide variety of the arts and sciences. And he gave thousands of individual Aesthetic Realism lessons to men, women, and children. In these lessons the way of seeing the world based on aesthetics\u2014which is Aesthetic Realism\u2014was taught.\nIn 1951, William Carlos Williams read Siegel's \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" again, and wrote to Martha Baird: \"Everything we most are compelled to do is in that one poem.\" Siegel, he wrote, \"belongs in the very first rank of our living artists\". The prize poem became the title poem of Siegel's first volume, \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana: Poems\", nominated for a National Book Award in 1958. A decade later, his second volume, \"Hail, American Development\", also met with critical acclaim. \"I think it's about time Eli Siegel was moved up into the ranks of our acknowledged Leading Poets\", wrote Kenneth Rexroth in the \"New York Times.\" Walter Leuba described Siegel's poems as \"alive in a burning honesty and directness\" and yet, having \"exquisite emotional tact\". He pointed to these lines from \"Dear Birds, Tell This to Mothers\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt the age of 76 Siegel had an operation for a benign prostatic condition. He called it \"the operation so disastrous to me\". As a result, he lost the use of his feet and was unable to sleep. According to Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, the operation was \"the cause of his dying 5-1/2 months later\".\nAesthetic Realism.\nThe basis of Aesthetic Realism is the principle, \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\"http:// In the book \"Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There\", six working artists explain this principle in life and their own craft. Reviewing them, the \"Library Journal\" tells us: \"Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that 'all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality'.\" (September 1, 1969) http://\nThe ethics Siegel taught\u2014\"the art of enjoying justice\"\u2014includes this definition of \"good will\": \"The desire to have something else stronger and more beautiful, for this desire makes oneself stronger and more beautiful.\" Good will is necessary, he stated, for a person to like him\u2013 or herself: \"This desire is the fundamental thing in human consciousness.\" (\"The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known\", issue no. 121)\nWorks.\nBooks.\nAmong Siegel's many published works are:\nEssays.\nSome of his many essays and broadsides include:\nComments on Siegel's work.\nWilliam Carlos Williams wrote of the poem \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\", \"I say definitely that that single poem, out of a thousand others written in the past quarter century, secures our place in the cultural world.\"https:// Williams was an early supporter of Siegel's poetry and defender of his views. He wrote:\nI can't tell you how important Siegel's work is in the light of my present understanding of the modern poem. He belongs in the very first rank of our living artists.\nAnd Williams added:\nThe other side of the picture is the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new. It shows itself by the violent opposition Siegel received from the \"authorities\" whom I shall not dignify by naming and after that by neglect. ...\nJohn Henry Faulk, speaking of the poems in \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\", said on CBS radio, \"Eli Siegel makes a man glad he's alive.\"&lt;br&gt;\nKenneth Rexroth wrote in the \"https://\" of \"Hail, American Development\" that Siegel's poems contained \"...incomparable sensibility at work saying things nobody else could say and in the long ones the rhythms are as new inventions as once were Blake's or Whitman's or Apollinaire's\", adding, \"...all through \"Hail, American Development\" are Translations, mostly from the French, that show a penetration both original and extraordinary. His Translations of Baudelaire and his commentaries on them rank him with the most understanding of the Baudelaire critics in any language.\" (March 23, 1969) https://&lt;br&gt;\nIn \"Contemporary Authors\" Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, stated (in a book published by Definition Press, said Foundation's publishing arm):\nEli Siegel's work, which in time became Aesthetic Realism, was the cause of some of the largest praise, the largest love in persons, and also the largest resentment \u2026&lt;br&gt;\nIn writing an entry about [him] for \"Contemporary Authors\", you are somewhat in the position you would be writing an entry on the poet John Keats in 1821. That is, if you were to rely on what was said of Keats by most established critics (critics now remembered principally for their injustice to one of the greatest English writers), you would present the author of `Ode to a Nightingale' as a presumptuous `Cockney poet' whose works were `driveling idiocy.' In writing about Eli Siegel [now], you are writing about a contemporary who is great; who all his life met what William Carlos Williams described him as meeting, `the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new'; who now, after his death, is beginning, just barely beginning, to be seen with something like fairness.\nHuntington Cairns, Secretary of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., described Siegel's place in the understanding of aesthetics\u2014the branch of philosophy which studies beauty\u2014as follows:\nI believe that Eli Siegel was a genius. He did for aesthetics what Spinoza did for ethics. http://\nDonald Kirkley wrote in \"The Baltimore Sun\" (1944) reporting on Siegel's reaction to his 1925 national fame,\nBaltimore friends close to him at the time will testify to a certain integrity and steadfastness of purpose which distinguished Mr. Siegel ... He refused to exploit a flood of publicity which was enough to float any man to financial comfort ...https://\nAnd William Carlos Williams also wrote,\nOnly today do I realize how important that poem [\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\"] is in the history of our development as a cultural entity. https://\nIn 2002 the city of Baltimore placed a plaque in Druid Hill Park to commemorate the centennial of Eli Siegel's birth. That same year, on July 26, 2002, Representative Elijah E. Cummings read a tribute to Siegel in the United States House of Representatives. https://\nEpitaph.\nhttps://\nThe following are lines from \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\", one of the poems which Selden Rodman commented \"say more (and more movingly) about here and now than any contemporary poems I have read\". (August 17, 1957 http://) These lines stand for what Ellen Reiss has described as Siegel's \"beautiful, faithful, passionate, critical, loving attention to the world and humanity.\"http:// \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73138", "revid": "49473253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73138", "title": "Arizona Coyotes", "text": "Inactive National Hockey League team\nThe Arizona Coyotes are an inactive professional ice hockey team based in the Phoenix metropolitan area. They competed in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division (1996\u20131998, 2021\u20132024) and the Pacific Division (1998\u20132020) in the Western Conference, and the West Division (2020\u20132021). They played at America West Arena (now Mortgage Matchup Center) in downtown Phoenix from 1996 to 2003, at Glendale's Gila River Arena (now Desert Diamond Arena) from 2003 to 2022, and at Mullett Arena in Tempe from 2022 to 2024. The organization was established on December 27, 1971, as the Winnipeg Jets, a charter franchise of the World Hockey Association (WHA).\nAfter seven WHA seasons, they were one of four organizations enfranchised by the NHL on June 22, 1979, when the WHA ceased operations. Due to financial troubles, the Jets were sold to American owners, who moved the team to Phoenix on July 1, 1996, where they were renamed the Phoenix Coyotes. The franchise was renamed the Arizona Coyotes on June 27, 2014. Alex Meruelo became the majority owner on July 29, 2019, later becoming the franchise's sole owner following the arrest of minority owner Andrew Barroway.\nThe team failed to gain long-term stability despite the relocation to Arizona, enduring multiple changes in ownership and struggling for a profitable arena for home games. The NHL took over the Phoenix Coyotes franchise in 2009 when then-owner Jerry Moyes gave up the team after filing for bankruptcy. The NHL maintained control of the franchise until 2013, when they found new ownership willing to keep it in Arizona. Despite a difficult working relationship with the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, the Coyotes were able to secure a year-to-year arrangement to play in the Gila River Arena until the end of the 2021\u201322 season.\nNegotiations with the city deteriorated, and the team subsequently signed an agreement to play their games at Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University, starting with the 2022\u201323 season. The arrangement was intended to be brief, lasting only until a new arena was built in Tempe, but the arena proposal was rejected by the city's residents in May 2023.\nAmid growing pressure to resolve the arena situation and to find an alternative to a college arena considered too small even for temporary usage, the Coyotes suspended hockey operations following the conclusion of the 2023\u201324 season. In a deal brokered by the NHL, the Coyotes were essentially split in half. The team's hockey assets (players, staff, and draft picks) were transferred to the Utah Hockey Club (now the Utah Mammoth), an expansion franchise awarded at the same time to Ryan Smith and based in Salt Lake City. The Coyotes' name, history, and other intellectual property were initially retained by Meruelo, who had intended to build a new arena in Arizona by 2029.\nMeruelo hoped to win a parcel of land at an auction in June 2024. When this auction was canceled by Arizona state authorities, Meruelo left the franchise and abandoned his efforts to revive the Coyotes, relinquishing the franchise rights and intellectual property to the NHL.\nHistory.\nOriginal Winnipeg Jets (1972\u20131996).\nThe team began play as the Winnipeg Jets, one of the founding franchises in the World Hockey Association (WHA). The Jets were the most successful team in the short-lived WHA, winning the Avco World Trophy, the league's championship trophy, three times and making the finals five out of the WHA's seven seasons. It then became one of the four teams admitted to the NHL as part of a merger when the financially struggling WHA folded in 1979.\nHowever, the club was never able to translate its WHA success into the NHL after the merger. The merger's terms allowed the established NHL teams to reclaim most of the players that had jumped to the upstart league, and the Jets lost most of their best players in the ensuing reclamation draft. As a result, they finished last in the NHL during their first two seasons, including a nine-win season in 1980\u201381 that is still the worst in franchise history. However, they recovered fairly quickly, making the playoffs 11 times in the next 15 seasons, but the Jets only won two playoff series, largely because they were in the same division as the powerful Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames. Because of the way the playoffs were structured for much of their Winnipeg run, the team was all but assured of having to defeat either the Oilers or the Flames (or both) to reach the conference finals. In 1984\u201385, for instance, they finished with the fourth-best record in the NHL with 96 points, at the time their best as an NHL team. However, they were swept by the Oilers in the division finals. Two seasons later, they dispatched the Flames in the first round, only to be swept again by the Oilers in the division finals. The franchise did not win another playoff series for 25 years.\nThe Jets ran into financial trouble when player salaries began spiralling up in the 1990s; this hit the Canadian teams particularly hard. Winnipeg was the second-smallest market in the NHL for most of the Jets' existence and became the smallest after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995 to become the Colorado Avalanche. In addition, the club's home arena, Winnipeg Arena, was one of the smallest in the league, seating just under 15,400 people. It was over 40 years old and had no luxury suites. Despite strong fan support, owner Barry Shenkarow was forced to put the team on the market. Several attempts to keep the team in Winnipeg fell through.\nRelocation to Phoenix.\nIn October 1995, Minnesota businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke purchased the team with plans to move it to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, which had lost the Minnesota North Stars in 1993, for the 1996\u201397 season. However, in December, after they were unable to secure a lease at Minneapolis' Target Center, they opted to move the Jets to Phoenix, instead. Minnesota was ultimately awarded an expansion team in 1997, the Minnesota Wild.\nAfter the franchise considered \"Mustangs\", \"Outlaws\", \"Wranglers\", and \"Freeze\", a name-the-team contest yielded the official name \"Coyotes\". At the time, the name was largely seen as play on the \"Looney Tunes\" character Wile E. Coyote of \"Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner\", since Phoenix was home to several minor league teams and one short-lived WHA team called the Phoenix Roadrunners, including an International Hockey League (IHL) team that was playing there in 1996. However, \"Coyotes\" was considered suitable in any case since the coyote is endemic to the whole of Arizona, unlike the roadrunner, which is only found in the southern and western regions of the state. The Roadrunners only played one more season before leaving Phoenix; however, the Coyotes later revived the \"Roadrunners\" nickname for their American Hockey League affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners.\nEarly years in Phoenix (1996\u20132005).\nIn the summer, the team added established superstar Jeremy Roenick from the Chicago Blackhawks, in exchange for trading Alexei Zhamnov. Roenick teamed up with power wingers Keith Tkachuk and Rick Tocchet to form a dynamic 1\u20132\u20133 offensive punch that led the Coyotes through their first years in Arizona. Also impressive were young players like Shane Doan (he eventually was the last remaining player from the team's days in Winnipeg), Oleg Tverdovsky, and goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, whom the fans nicknamed the \"Bulin Wall\".\nAnother key addition to the squad was veteran forward Mike Gartner, who had joined from the Toronto Maple Leafs. Despite his experience and scoring his 700th career goal on December 15, 1997, Gartner battled injuries in the latter half of the 1997\u201398 season. The Coyotes did not renew his contract and he retired at the end of the season. After arriving in Phoenix, the team posted six consecutive .500 or better seasons, making the playoffs in every year but one. The one time they did not make the playoffs, in 2000\u201301, they became the first team to earn 90 points and miss the playoffs.\nThe Coyotes' original home, America West Arena, was suboptimal for hockey. Although considered a state-of-the-art arena when built for the Phoenix Suns, it was designed specifically as a basketball venue, with sight lines optimized for the smaller playing surface of that sport, and not with hockey in mind. The floor was just barely large enough to fit a standard NHL rink, forcing the Coyotes to hastily re-engineer it to accommodate the 200-foot rink. The configuration left a portion of one end of the upper deck hanging \"over\" the boards and ice, obscuring almost a third of the rink and one goal from several sections. As a result, listed capacity had to be cut down from over 18,000 seats to just over 16,000 \u2013 the second-smallest in the league at the time \u2013 after the first season.\nBurke bought out Gluckstern in 1998 but was unable to attract more investors to alleviate the team's financial woes. In 2001, Burke sold the team to Phoenix-area developer Steve Ellman, with Wayne Gretzky as a part-owner and head of hockey operations.\nThe closest that they came to advancing past the first round during their first decade in Arizona was during the 1999 playoffs. After building a 3\u20131 series lead, the Coyotes fell in overtime of game 7 on a goal by Pierre Turgeon of the St. Louis Blues. In 2002, the Coyotes posted 95 points, one point behind their best total as an NHL team while in Winnipeg, but went down rather meekly to the San Jose Sharks in five games.\nFrom then until the 2007\u201308 season, the Coyotes were barely competitive and managed to break the 80-point barrier only once during that time. Attendance levels dropped considerably, worrying many NHL executives. In addition, an unfavorable arena lease at city-owned America West Arena had the team suffering massive financial losses (as much as $40 million a year at one point); the Coyotes have yet to recover from the resulting financial problems.\nEllman put forward numerous proposals to improve the hockey sightlines in America West Arena in hopes of boosting capacity back over the 17,000 mark. However, none of these got beyond the planning stages, leading Ellman to commit to building a new arena. After nearly three years of proposals to build an arena on the former Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale and having difficulty financing the purchase of the Coyotes and finishing demolition of Los Arcos, along with infighting in the Scottsdale City Council, Ellman looked toward the West Valley, and in December 2003, the team moved into Glendale Arena (which then became known as Jobing.com Arena during the 2006\u201307 NHL season). Simultaneously, the team changed its logo and uniforms, moving from the multi-colored kit to a more streamlined look. In 2005, Ellman sold the Coyotes, the National Lacrosse League's Arizona Sting and the lease to Gila River Arena to trucking magnate Jerry Moyes, who was also a part-owner of Major League Baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks.\nGretzky era (2005\u20132009).\nOn August 6, 2005, Brett Hull, son of former Jet Bobby Hull, was signed and promptly assigned the elder Hull's retired number 9. Two days later, Gretzky named himself head coach, replacing Rick Bowness, despite the fact he had never coached at any level of hockey. The Coyotes \"Ring of Honor\" was unveiled on October 8, inducting Gretzky (who had never played for the organization, but whose number 99 was retired by all NHL teams after his retirement in 1999) and Bobby Hull. Only a week later, Brett Hull announced his retirement. On January 21, 2006, Jets great Thomas Steen was the third inductee to the \"Ring of Honor\".\nAnother moment in a series of bad luck: the Coyotes were planning to host the 2006 NHL All-Star Game, but the event was canceled because of the 2006 Winter Olympics. The team returned to Winnipeg on September 17, 2006, to play a preseason game against the Edmonton Oilers, but were shut-out 5\u20130 before a sellout crowd of 15,015.\nOn April 11, 2007, chief executive officer Jeff Shumway announced that General Manager Michael Barnett (Gretzky's agent for over 20 years), senior executive vice president of hockey operations Cliff Fletcher and San Antonio Rampage's general manager and Coyotes' assistant general manager Laurence Gilman \"have been relieved of their duties\". The Coyotes finished the 2006\u201307 season 31\u201346\u20135, their worst record since relocating to Phoenix. On May 29, Jeff Shumway announced Don Maloney had agreed to a multi-year contract to become general manager of the Coyotes. As per club policy, the terms of the contract were not disclosed. However, as had been the case with all general managers since 2001, Maloney served in an advisory role to Gretzky.\nThe 2007\u201308 season was something of a resurgence for the Coyotes. After their disastrous 2006\u201307 campaign, the Coyotes looked to rebuild the team by relying on their drafted talent such as Peter Mueller and Martin Hanzal to make the team successful as opposed to using free agency. The Coyotes also acquired Radim Vrbata from the Chicago Blackhawks for Kevyn Adams in an effort to provide the team with more offense. The team signed both Alex Auld and David Aebischer to compete for the starting goaltender position with Mikael Tellqvist acting as the backup goaltender. Neither Auld or Aebischer were able to hold on to the starting position, leaving the Coyotes to turn to the waiver wire for assistance. On November 17, 2007, the Coyotes were able to claim Ilya Bryzgalov off waivers from the Anaheim Ducks. Bryzgalov responded by not only starting in goal the day he was acquired but posting a shutout in his Coyotes debut against the Los Angeles Kings. Bryzgalov was soon given a three-year contract extension because of his high level of play. Despite predictions of another disastrous season, the Coyotes played competitive hockey for most of the season. However, they finished eight points short of the last playoff spot, with 83 points.\nReturn to the playoffs and division title (2009\u20132012).\nOn September 24, 2009, Dave Tippett took over coaching duties of the Phoenix Coyotes after Wayne Gretzky stepped down hours before. In just 61 games, Tippett led the Coyotes to more wins in their 2009\u201310 regular season (37) than their previous season (36), en route to the first 50-win season in the franchise's NHL history.\nOn March 27, 2010, the Coyotes clinched a playoff spot, their first playoff spot since the 2001\u201302 season, and in the process, reached the 100-point mark for the first time ever as an NHL team, and the first time overall since the 1977\u201378 (WHA) Jets scored 102 points. They finished with 107 points, the highest point total in the franchise's 38-year history. This was good enough for fourth overall in the NHL, tying the 1984\u201385 Jets for the franchise's highest finish as an NHL team. They also qualified for the fourth seed in the Western Conference, giving them a home-ice advantage in the first round for the first time since 1999.\nTheir first round opponent in the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs were the Detroit Red Wings. Game 1 of the series was the first NHL playoff game to be played in Gila River Arena. However, an injury to Shane Doan sidelined him for most of the series, and the defending conference champion Red Wings defeated the Coyotes in seven games.\nThe Coyotes again faced Detroit in the first round of the 2011 playoffs, losing the series in four games.\nOn April 7, 2012, the Coyotes defeated the Minnesota Wild 4\u20131 to win the Pacific Division title \u2013 their first and only division title as an NHL team (in Winnipeg or Phoenix). This gave them the third seed in the West, and with it home-ice advantage in a playoff series for only the third time in franchise history. In the first round, they defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in six games, the franchise's first playoff series win since 1987. The first five games went to overtime, tying a record when the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs did it in the 1951 Stanley Cup Final. They faced the Nashville Predators in the second round, winning the first two games and the series 4\u20131. However, in the conference finals, the Coyotes fell to the Los Angeles Kings (who eventually went on to win the Cup that year) in game five of a 4\u20131 series.\n2009 bankruptcy and attempts to sell the team.\nIn December 2008, the media became aware the Coyotes were suffering massive losses and that the NHL was paying the team's bills. The media reports were minimized by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and vice president Bill Daly. However, Moyes had secretly given operational control of the team to the league. In May 2009, Moyes put the team into bankruptcy hours before Bettman was to present him an offer to sell the team to Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. Moyes intended to sell the team to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie, who in turn intended to purchase the team out of bankruptcy and move it to Hamilton, Ontario. The NHL responded by stripping Moyes of his remaining ownership authority.\nFrom May until September 2009, hearings were held in Phoenix bankruptcy court to determine the fate of the Coyotes and the holding company. Two potential bidders for the team surfaced, Reinsdorf and Ice Edge Holdings, but they did not submit a bid for the team. Instead, the NHL put in the only rival bid to Balsillie for the team, while it contended the Moyes\u2013Balsillie deal violated NHL rules. The bankruptcy court voided the planned sale to Balsillie, accepting the NHL's argument that bankruptcy could not be used to circumvent NHL rules. The NHL's bid was also declared insufficient, but the judge left the window open to an improved bid. Moyes and the NHL settled, with the NHL purchasing the team and assuming all debts. The NHL negotiated a temporary lease with the City of Glendale, which owns Gila River Arena.\nThe NHL then negotiated with Reinsdorf and Ice Edge toward a deal with Glendale. Ice Edge signed a letter of intent to purchase the team from the NHL, while Reinsdorf had won the approval of the City of Glendale. On May 7, 2010, ESPN.com reported the Reinsdorf bid had fallen apart and that the City of Glendale was working with Ice Edge to purchase the team in a last-ditch effort to keep them in Arizona. The \"National Post\" criticized both bids, as they were conditional on municipal taxpayers covering any losses the Coyotes might incur, and suggested that keeping the team in Phoenix was never economically viable.\nIn July 2010, the Ice Edge bid collapsed because it did not satisfy Glendale's financial conditions. Ice Edge decided to concentrate on an effort to purchase a minor league team. The City of Glendale had to step in and guarantee the team's losses for 2010\u201311 as a precondition of the NHL not transferring the franchise. A consortium of investors led by Chicago investor Matt Hulsizer then reached a deal to purchase the Coyotes from the NHL along with a lease agreement with Glendale. However, the Hulsizer deal collapsed in late June 2011 at least in part because of a threatened suit by the Goldwater Institute over the legality of payments that Glendale was to make to Hulsizer before the consortium bought the team. The threat of the suit may have prevented the sale of bonds to finance the payments. The team only stayed in the Phoenix area for the 2011\u201312 season after another $25 million payment by the City of Glendale.\nAlso in 2011, former Coyotes bidders True North Sports and Entertainment purchased the Atlanta Thrashers and moved them to Winnipeg, thus ending any possibility that the Coyotes would return to Manitoba. As part of the transaction, the NHL agreed to transfer the Jets' name, logos, and related trademarks from the league-owned Coyotes to True North and the Thrashers thus becoming the \"new\" Winnipeg Jets. However, the original Jets' history remains with the Coyotes organization.\nThe 2012\u201313 NHL lockout provided another opportunity for the Coyotes to find a potential owner and avoid relocation while the NHL suspended team operations during the labor dispute. A deal to former San Jose Sharks owner Greg Jamison had been drafted just as the lockout ended, but failed to be finalized and fulfilled by January 31, 2013. The deal would have kept the Coyotes in Phoenix for the next 20 years relying on a taxpayer subsidy, according to the agreement. It would also have had \"Phoenix\" dropped from the name and instead used \"Arizona\".\nCalifornia investment executive Darin Pastor also submitted a bid to purchase the Coyotes. His bid proposed to keep the team in the Glendale area while engaging young hockey players in the region through school partnerships and scholarship efforts. The NHL rejected Pastor's bid on May 13, 2013, citing the bid was \"inconsistent with what we had previously indicated were the minimum prerequisites\" of a bid.\nNew ownership and the Arizona Coyotes (2013\u20132024).\nBecause the team had been in bankruptcy since 2009 and lost revenue each year, the NHL planned to move the Coyotes should a deal with the city for a new lease and new ownership not be decided by July 2, 2013. The plan was to move the franchise to a new city, likely Seattle. On July 2, 2013, by a vote of 4\u20133, the Glendale City Council approved a 15-year lease agreement with Renaissance Sports and Entertainment (RSE), which purchased the team from the NHL for US$225 million by August 5, 2013. The members of the Canadian group were executive chairman and governor George Gosbee; president, chief executive officer and alternate governor Anthony LeBlanc; alternate governor Craig Stewart; and directors Gary J. Drummond, W. David Duckett, William \"Bill\" Dutton, Robert Gwin, Scott Saxberg and Richard Walter. RSE partnered with Global Spectrum (owners of the Philadelphia Flyers) for help in managing Gila River Arena. The agreement had the City of Glendale giving RSE US$15 million per year for management fees. There was a clause stipulating RSE could relocate the team after five years if it accrued US$50 million in losses.\nOn January 29, 2014, the new ownership group announced that the team would change its name to the \"Arizona Coyotes\" for the 2014\u201315 season. According to Coyotes club president Anthony LeBlanc, the change was made to reflect the fact the team is no longer located within Phoenix city limits and to include all hockey fans in the state of Arizona. Aside from a new shoulder patch, the team's uniform design did not change. The name officially changed on June 27.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2013\u201314 season, it was reported that lackluster revenue from parking and non-hockey events enabled the City of Glendale to recoup just $4.4 million, which was significantly less than the $6.8 million the city expected to receive back from sources including parking receipts, ticket sales, and naming rights for the arena.\nOn June 4, 2014, it was reported that a Scottsdale, Arizona, public-relations firm had sued IceArizona, the owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, alleging the NHL club had reneged on a sponsorship deal worth nearly $250,000. A Coyotes spokesman responded to this issue by calling it a \"quarter-million-dollar scheme\". By October, IceArizona entered a deal to sell a 51% controlling interest in the Coyotes to Philadelphia-based hedge fund manager Andrew Barroway, who had recently failed in his attempt to purchase the New York Islanders. The deal was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on December 31, 2014.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, the team finished last in the Pacific Division with the second-worst record in the NHL. On June 10, 2015, Glendale City Council voted to terminate its 15-year, $225 million agreement with the Coyotes. The city claimed \"It was entitled to terminate the agreement because two former city employees, Craig Tindall and Julie Frisoni, were involved in securing the deal and later worked for the Coyotes.\" On July 23, 2015, it was announced the Coyotes and City Council had agreed on a resolution. On July 24, 2015, the Coyotes announced the City Council had reached a two-year deal.\nAt the conclusion of the 2015\u201316 season, general manager Don Maloney, who had won General Manager of the Year award in 2010, was fired from his position after eight seasons. The Coyotes replaced Maloney with John Chayka, who, at 26 years of age, became the youngest NHL general manager of all time, being promoted from his position as assistant general manager/analytics within the Coyotes staff. In August 2016, Dawn Braid was hired as the Coyotes' skating coach, making her the first female full-time coach in the NHL.\nOn November 14, 2016, the Coyotes announced plans to build a new arena in Tempe, Arizona, which was scheduled to be completed for the 2019\u201320 NHL season. The project would have included an adjoining 4,000-seat arena to be used for Coyotes practices and as the home for the Arizona State University hockey team. However, the arena project was withdrawn when ASU pulled out of the deal in February 2017.\nAt the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Barroway bought out the rest of the IceArizona ownership group and became the sole owner of the franchise. Following the transfer, former IceArizona chief executive officer Anthony LeBlanc and the director of hockey operations Gary Drummond both left the organization. On June 19, 2017, the Coyotes opted not to re-sign long-time captain Shane Doan, who had been with the franchise since they were the Winnipeg Jets. The Coyotes left Doan a standing offer to remain with the team in a non-playing role. On June 22, 2017, head coach Dave Tippett left his positions within the Coyotes after eight seasons, and was succeeded by Rick Tocchet on July 11, 2017.\nOn December 4, 2018, it was announced that the team would move to the Central Division in 2021, changing divisions for the second time since relocating to Arizona, as part of a league realignment following the addition of the Seattle Kraken. The team previously played in the Central Division for their first two seasons following their relocation from Winnipeg in 1996. On December 20, 2018, the team extended their lease in Gila River Arena through the 2019\u201320 season.\nOn July 29, 2019, Barroway sold controlling interest in the Coyotes to billionaire Alex Meruelo, with Barroway remaining as a minority owner until his arrest, which left Meruelo the sole owner of the franchise.\nDuring the 2020 NHL entry draft, the Coyotes received widespread backlash and criticism for drafting Mitchell Miller in the fourth round (111th pick overall), after allegations surfaced that he had bullied and discriminated against an African-American classmate having a learning disability, during high school in 2016. Soon thereafter, they renounced his draft rights.\nFor the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2020\u201321 season the Coyotes were placed in the reformed West Division and played a division-only 56-game schedule. They finished in fifth place with 54 points, outside of the playoffs. After the season, the team and coach Rick Tocchet mutually agreed to part ways. Andre Tourigny was hired as head coach of the Coyotes on July 1, 2021.\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, the Coyotes moved into the Central Division upon the arrival of the Kraken in the Pacific Division. In the 2021 NHL entry draft, the Coyotes would select Josh Doan, son of former Coyotes player Shane Doan; Josh would later play with the Coyotes in 2024. On August 19, 2021, the city of Glendale and the Gila River Arena chose to not renew their operating agreement with the Coyotes beyond the 2021\u201322 season, as the team's lease had been renewed each year since 2016. The franchise entered negotiations with Tempe to develop a new arena on an old solid waste compost yard, but the terrain had problems regarding environmental remediation. On September 3, they submitted a proposal to build a new arena in Tempe.\nOn December 8, 2021, the Coyotes were informed that they would be locked out of Gila River Arena on December 20, 2021, if they did not pay $1.3 million owed in taxes, including $250,000 to the City of Glendale. The team paid the bills the next day, citing \"unfortunate human error\" as the cause of the issue. In late January 2022, the Coyotes were in talks with Arizona State University (ASU) to use their new 5,000-seat arena as a temporary home arena for the next few years. On February 10, 2022, the Coyotes signed a three-year agreement to play their games at Mullett Arena, starting with the 2022\u201323 season. On April 29, 2022, the Coyotes played their final home game at the Gila River Arena against the Nashville Predators, with a 5\u20134 comeback win. On October 28, 2022, the Coyotes would make their debut in the Mullett Arena, which sold out to a crowd of 4,600 people that day, in a 3\u20132 overtime loss to the current Winnipeg Jets franchise, with Christian Fischer scoring the first two goals of the franchise at the arena for that game.\nAsset transfer to Utah and suspension of operations.\nA proposal by the Coyotes to build a new arena in Tempe was rejected by residents of the city on May 16, 2023. The arena was estimated to cost $2.1 billion, with $1.9 billion of the cost privately funded. Despite speculation on immediate relocation, the team remained in Arizona, playing at Mullett Arena during the 2023\u201324 NHL season. The Coyotes spoke with the city of Mesa about a potential arena at the Fiesta Mall site, but that plan was ultimately rejected for unknown reasons. In January 2024, Scottsdale mayor David Ortega announced his opposition to a Coyotes' proposal, which planned an arena in northern Phoenix near the border of Scottsdale. Following this, the Coyotes initially stated on social media their commitment to keeping the team in Arizona. They announced that the ownership was intent on winning a land auction for of state-owned land between Scottsdale Road and Loop 101 in Phoenix to build an arena. However, the auction had been delayed from January to June 2024, which likely played a part into the ownership's final decision with the franchise near the end of the 2023\u201324 season.\nOn April 10, 2024, it was reported that, with the NHL's permission, the Coyotes were making efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City, following concerns about an indefinite timeframe for finding a new arena and the effects of continued play at Mullett Arena, in the interim. This led to the NHL buying the franchise then reselling it to Ryan Smith, owner of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA), for a reported $1.2 billion. Of that payment, $1 billion went to Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo for the sale (with Meruelo agreeing to refund the money to the NHL as an expansion fee should his efforts to locate a new home for the franchise succeed) and $200 million went to the NHL's other 31 owners, as the equivalent of a relocation fee. The Utah team will play its home games at the Jazz's home arena, the Delta Center. Renovations will be required to make it the team's permanent home, similar to the renovations made to Climate Pledge Arena before the Kraken began play in the NHL two seasons prior.\nOn April 12, 2024, ahead of a 3\u20132 overtime win against the Edmonton Oilers at Rogers Place, general manager Bill Armstrong officially disclosed the news of the team's impending sale and relocation to Coyotes players and staff. Five days later, on April 17, the Coyotes played their final game at Mullett Arena, and ultimately their last game before deactivation, against the same Oilers team. With the fans engaging in one last Whiteout (and audibly heard chanting phrases such as \"Salt Lake sucks\" and \"we love you Coyotes\" throughout the game), the Coyotes won 5\u20132, with Sean Durzi scoring the final goal of the team's first incarnation, into an empty net. Amongst the events of the game, Shane Doan was given his retirement banner (which had been lost by the team in the move to Mullett Arena but had been rediscovered by a local fan), and following the end of the game the fans gave the outgoing team a standing ovation, and the players, in turn, spent over an hour afterward on the ice giving away team apparel and equipment (also signing a majority of the fan gifts), as well as taking a final team picture on the ice and taking turns hugging and thanking longtime equipment manager Stan Wilson, who had moved with the team from Winnipeg in 1996. The following day, the sale and relocation was officially approved, and the team was officially deactivated until further notice.\nIt subsequently emerged that the Utah club was considered an expansion team, not a relocated Coyotes team. In a deal that effectively split the Coyotes franchise in half, Smith acquired the Coyotes' player contracts, hockey operations staff, and draft picks while the Coyotes went \"dormant\" pending a permanent arena. This move was similar to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL), with the Coyotes continuing minor business operations, mostly focused on finding a new arena. Meruelo remained on the NHL Board of Governors as an observer, retaining the rights to the Coyotes brand and history (including the history and records of the 1972\u20131996 Winnipeg Jets), with a five-year window to build or otherwise locate a new arena for his team, before \"reactivating\" the Coyotes through an expansion draft. Conversely, if Meruelo were to fail to come up with a suitable arena by end of that five-year window, he would be required to permanently halt franchise operations and cede the franchise back to the NHL. The sale was finalized on April 18, after the NHL Board of Governors voted to grant a new Utah franchise to Smith, effectively expanding the NHL to a total of 33 clubs, if the Coyotes succeeded in building a new team arena.\nOn June 21, 2024, the Arizona State Land Department canceled a land auction for a 110-acre parcel of land in north Phoenix which Meruelo intended to purchase as a site for a new arena. Three days later, it was reported that Meruelo had told staff he had no plans to pursue further arena options for the team. At the Board of Governors meeting on June 26, Meruelo informed Bettman that he was not pursuing the franchise reactivation. Meruelo formally relinquished his rights to the franchise as well as its intellectual property on July 10.\nCommittee to bring back the Coyotes.\nIn September 2025, an advisory panel, led by the wife of former Coyotes player Shane Doan, was formed with the aim of bringing an expansion team to Maricopa County. If successful, this team would also be known as the Arizona Coyotes. The NHL has expressed interest in returning professional ice hockey to the area.\nTeam information.\nName.\nUpon the franchise's relocation to Phoenix, a public team-naming vote was held, with \"Coyotes\" defeating \"Scorpions\" among the finalists. Both coyotes and scorpions are inhabitants of the Sonoran Desert, and the owners/supporters of the club wanted the team name to be an animal that was representative of the region. On June 27, 2014, the team changed their geographic name to Arizona.\nLogos and jerseys.\nUpon their arrival in Phoenix in 1996, the team adopted a look with a traditional Southwestern design. The primary logo was a Southwest Native American-styled hockey stick-wielding coyote in a kachina-inspired style. The jerseys featured pointed green shoulders with brick red trim over a white (home) or black (road) body, and non-traditional striping patterns. These uniforms remained in place until 2003. A third jersey, primarily green with a nighttime desert landscape wrapped around the bottom and the cuffs of the sleeves, was introduced in 1998 and was retired in 2003 when the team redesigned the uniforms.\nAs the NHL switched home and road jerseys beginning in the 2003\u201304 season and coinciding with the team's move from America West Arena to the newly completed Glendale Arena, the Coyotes redesigned their look completely, adopting a howling coyote head logo while dropping several colors from the team's palette. Sedona red and white became the primary colors, with desert sand and black remaining as logo trim colors. A variation of these colors was later used for the Major League Baseball team Arizona Diamondbacks. The team also changed its shoulder patch, taking the form of the outline of the state of Arizona, with an homage to the state flag and the abbreviation \"PHX\". This logo was worn only on the right shoulder leaving the left shoulder bare.\nThe Coyotes updated their jerseys for the 2007\u201308 season, along with all NHL teams, as part of the switchover to \"Rbk Edge\" jerseys. The changes made were adding an NHL crest just below the neck opening, removing the stripes that were previously just above the lower hem, and moving the \"PHX\" patch from the right to the left shoulder. The white jersey also gained red shoulder coloring and laces at the collar. The three-stripe pattern is applied to the side of the pants.\nThe Coyotes also added a third jersey for the 2008\u201309 season. It is primarily black and features a new alternate coyote logo on the front, with the primary logo (coyote head) patch on the right shoulder, and the \"Official Seal\" on the left. Since white does not appear on the alternate, solid red pant shells are worn with this jersey.\nBefore the 2014\u201315 season, it was announced the Coyotes' third jersey would no longer be used. The patch on the home and away jerseys that used to read \"PHX\" would also be changed to read \"AZ\" to match the team's rebranded name.\nOn June 26, 2015, the Coyotes introduced updated jerseys. The uniforms reintegrated black into the design; the color was prominently featured on the uniform sleeves, socks, and pants.\nThe Coyotes wore their black Kachina jerseys for a few dates between 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 seasons. The style was similar to the originals but was adapted to the Reebok Edge cut. For the 2018\u201319 season and beyond, the Coyotes revived the Kachina uniforms as a third jersey, and was updated to the Adidas adizero cut. In 2020, the black Kachina design became the primary home jerseys (for 2021 only, the red trim on the letters were changed to silver to commemorate the team's 25th season in Arizona), but kept the previous red \"howling coyote\" jerseys as an alternate. The road \"howling coyote\" jerseys were also retained. In addition, the Coyotes wore a second alternate uniform: a purple \"Reverse Retro\" version of the 1998\u20132003 Kachina head alternates.\nBefore the 2021\u201322 season, the Coyotes hinted at a possible rebrand in September after the team named MullenLowe LA as its branding partner. During the off-season, the Coyotes quietly brought back the 1996\u20132003 Kachina logo as the primary, and later revealed a white road version of the Kachina uniforms while keeping the previous \"howling coyote\" home uniform as an alternate.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, Arizona once again wore its 1998\u20132003 Kachina head alternates as its \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, but with sienna as the base color. Also during that season, a new alternate uniform was released, returning to the simplified brick red and sand color scheme from 2003 to 2015 but with kachina patterns at the bottom and on the sleeves. The uniform features \"Arizona\" in sand with a star above the \"i\", and a sand saguaro on the right side of the pants. The captain's patch is denoted by the crescent moon alternate, while the alternate captain's patch is denoted by two saguaros crossing each other.\nMascot.\nHowler has been the coyote-suited mascot of the Arizona Coyotes. He was introduced on October 15, 2005. The Coyotes' official kids club was called Howler's Kids Club. Howler wore number 96 on his jersey, representing the year the Winnipeg Jets moved to Arizona, and he also wore an \"M\" designation for \"mascot\". He was known to beat on a bucket to encourage the fans to cheer and has had many different outfits in games.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Coyotes.

Captains are required to wear the letter \"C\" on their uniform for identification, which is high.\n\"Note: This list does not include captains from the original Winnipeg Jets (NHL &amp; WHA).\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nPrior to the cessation of the team's operations, the following television stations carried the team's games:\nKNXV-TV (Independent, Phoenix) would also be involved earlier in the team's final season of play, but would drop out in covering games live shortly after the season began.\nOn October 5, 2023, the Coyotes reached a new multi-year broadcast agreement with Scripps Sports, with games airing on Scripps-owned broadcast stations in the Coyotes' designated market. As part of the agreement, the Coyotes planned to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service. In Phoenix, KNXV-TV's Antenna TV-affiliated subchannel 15.2 initially served as flagship station; due to network programming commitments with ABC and The CW, KNXV or sister station KASW could not carry the games on their main channels, but were still scheduled to air team-produced ancillary programming. In November 2023, Scripps announced that KASW would become the independent station Arizona 61 on November 20, taking over as the flagship station of the Coyotes television network. The CW would concurrently move to KNXV-DT2. With the team's cessation in 2024, the Coyotes' deal would end prematurely, but it would be replaced with the Utah Hockey Club taking on the team's original contractual rights with Scripps Sports instead.\nOn February 16, 2024, the Coyotes launched Coyotes Central, a direct-to-consumer streaming service that featured all locally televised games in partnership with Kiswe. At launch, the service cost $11.99 per month and $24.99 for the remainder of the 2023\u201324 season. The service would shut down following the Coyotes' suspension period turned into an abandoned revival project starting on April 18, 2024.\nFrom its move to Phoenix in 1996 to the end of the 2007\u201308 season, the regional television rights for Arizona Coyotes were split between Fox Sports Arizona and over-the-air broadcasters including KTVK and KASW (1996\u20132006) and KAZT-TV (2006\u20132008).\nFrom the 2007\u201308 NHL season until the 2023 NHL preseason period, Bally Sports Arizona (formerly Fox Sports Arizona) was the exclusive regional television rightsholder for all Arizona Coyotes games not broadcast nationally by NBCSN, NBC, ESPN, ABC, or TNT. As part of Bally Sports' bankruptcy proceedings, on October 4, 2023, Diamond Sports rejected Bally Sports Arizona's contract with the Coyotes. For the 2023\u201324 NHL season, Scripps Sports became the new exclusive regional television rightsholder for all Arizona Coyotes games not broadcast nationally.\nRadio.\nIn 2021, the Arizona Coyotes entered a two-year deal with Bonneville Phoenix to broadcast the team's games on the radio in the Phoenix market on either KMVP-FM or KTAR. In 2023, the Arizona Coyotes extended the deal with Bonneville Phoenix by one-year.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73139", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73139", "title": "San Jose Sharks", "text": "National Hockey League team in California, United States\nThe San Jose Sharks are a professional ice hockey team based in San Jose, California. The Sharks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. The franchise is owned by San Jose Sports &amp; Entertainment Enterprises. Beginning play in the 1991\u201392 season, the team initially played its home games at the Cow Palace, before moving to its present home, now named SAP Center at San Jose, in 1993; the SAP Center is known locally as \"the Shark Tank\". The Sharks are affiliated with the San Jose Barracuda of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL.\nThe Sharks were founded on May 9, 1990, after the owners of the Minnesota North Stars sold the stake to award the NHL franchise based in the San Francisco Bay Area. They were the first team to be based in the region since the California Golden Seals relocated to Cleveland in 1976. The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup Final once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016. They have won the Presidents' Trophy once, as the team with the league's best regular season record in the 2008\u201309 season. They have also won six division titles as a member of the Pacific Division since 1993.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Sharks origins began with the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League (WHL) when they were awarded an expansion franchise for San Francisco on April 23, 1961, to former Vancouver Canucks owner Coleman (Coley) Hall. The Seals won two WHL championships and were renamed to the California Seals in 1966, playing their games at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.\nThe following season, the California Golden Seals joined the NHL, played their seasons from 1967 to 1976, who were neither successful on the ice nor at the box office. Gordon and George Gund III became minority owners of the Golden Seals in 1974, and were instrumental in their move to Cleveland in 1976 and a 1978 merger with the Minnesota North Stars, which they purchased that year. In 1988, group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose, where a new arena was being built. Eventually, the League struck a compromise: the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin's group, with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the 1991\u201392 season and being allowed to take a certain number of players from the North Stars to their new club. In return, the North Stars would be allowed to participate as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new Bay Area team. On May 5, 1990, the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team for the Bay Area, based in San Jose. The owners paid to the league an expansion fee of US$45\u00a0million and the new franchise was approved on May 9.\nOver 5,000 potential names were submitted by mail for the new team. While the first-place finisher was \"Blades\", the Gunds were concerned about the name's potentially negative association with weapons, and went with the runner-up, \"Sharks\". The name was said to have been inspired by the large number of sharks living in the Pacific Ocean. Seven varieties live there, and one area of water near the Bay Area is known as the \"red triangle\" because of its shark population. Matt Levine\u2014the team's first marketing head\u2014said of the new name, \"Sharks are relentless, determined, swift, agile, bright and fearless. We plan to build an organization that has all those qualities.\" In 1990, Jack Ferreira was hired as the team's first general manager.\nCow Palace years (1991\u20131993).\nFor their first two seasons, the Sharks played at the Cow Palace in Daly City, just outside San Francisco. Pat Falloon was their first draft choice and led the team in points during their first season. The team was placed in the Campbell Conference's Smythe Division. George Kingston was their first head coach during their first two seasons. Though the 1991\u201392 roster consisted primarily of NHL journeymen, minor leaguers and rookies, the Sharks had at least one notable player when they acquired 14-year veteran and former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Doug Wilson from the Chicago Blackhawks on September 6, 1991. Wilson was named the team's first captain and All-Star representative in the inaugural season. However, the team struggled in its first two seasons. Between their first and second seasons, they fired Ferreira, promoting Kingston, director of player personnel Chuck Grillo, and assistant GM Dean Lombardi as the shared general manager. Their 71 losses in the 1992\u201393 season is an NHL record. They also suffered a 17-game losing streak, while winning just 11 games and earning 24 points in the standings. Kingston was fired following the end of the 1992\u201393 season.\nDespite the Sharks' futility in the standings, the team led the NHL's merchandise sales with $150\u00a0million, accounting for 27% of the NHL's total and behind only National Basketball Association champions Chicago Bulls among all North American leagues.\nThe inaugural year also saw the introduction of the San Jose Sharks mascot, \"S. J. Sharkie\". On January 28, 1992, at a game against the New York Rangers, the then-unnamed mascot emerged from a Zamboni during an intermission. A \"Name the Mascot\" contest began that night, with the winning name of \"S. J. Sharkie\" being announced on April 15, 1992.\nEarly success and rebuilding (1993\u20131996).\nFor their third season, 1993\u201394, the Sharks moved to their new and current home, the San Jose Arena, and were placed in the Western Conference's Pacific Division. Under new head coach Kevin Constantine, the Sharks pulled off the biggest turnaround in NHL history, finishing with a 33\u201335\u201316 record and making the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in team history with 82 points, an NHL record 58-point jump from the previous season. They were seeded eighth in the Western Conference playoffs and faced the Detroit Red Wings, the top-seeded Western Conference team and a favorite to win the Stanley Cup. In one of the biggest upsets in Stanley Cup playoff history, the underdog Sharks shocked the Red Wings in seven games. In game seven at Joe Louis Arena, Jamie Baker scored the game-winning goal in the third period after goaltender Chris Osgood was out of position and the Sharks won 3\u20132, becoming the first eighth-seed in the history of North American professional sports to defeat the first seed in a playoff series. In the second round, the Sharks had a 3\u20132 series lead over the Toronto Maple Leafs, but lost the final two games in Toronto.\nIn 1994\u201395, the Sharks earned their second-straight playoff berth and again reached the second round. Ray Whitney scored the double-overtime game-winning goal of game seven of the conference quarterfinals against the Calgary Flames. Despite their success against Calgary, they lost in a four-game sweep to Detroit. However, the 1994\u201395 season also saw the only rainout in the history of the NHL, when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March 1995, making it impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between the Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings. Constantine was given a three-year deal prior to the 1995\u201396 season.\nIn the regular season, Constantine was fired after a 3\u201318\u20134 start to the season and replaced by Jim Wiley. The Sharks finished last in the Pacific Division and failed to make the playoffs. The team also traded out forward Sandis Ozolinsh to the Colorado Avalanche for Owen Nolan. Grillo was also fired with Lombardi holding the sole responsibility of general manager.\nDean Lombardi era (1996\u20132003).\nThe 1996\u201397 season was no better under Al Sims, with the Sharks again finishing last and winning only 27 games. Sims was fired after his one season of play. Their standing would help them draft Patrick Marleau second overall in the 1997 NHL entry draft. The Sharks returned to the playoffs in 1997\u201398 with goaltender Mike Vernon, whom they acquired from the Red Wings, and new head coach Darryl Sutter. They were eliminated by the Dallas Stars in the conference quarterfinals. Over the summer, they acquired goaltender Steve Shields, and during the 1998\u201399 season, San Jose acquired Montreal Canadiens forward Vincent Damphousse. However, the Colorado Avalanche defeated them in the conference quarterfinals. In an upset on par with the one they had pulled on Detroit six years earlier, the Sharks managed to eliminate the Presidents' Trophy-winning St. Louis Blues by coming back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to win in seven games. However, the Sharks were defeated in the second round of the playoffs by the Stars.\nIn 2000\u201301, Kazakh goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, who was originally drafted in 1994, won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's best rookie. The team also acquired Finnish star forward Teemu Selanne from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. In the 2001 playoffs, the St. Louis Blues eliminated the Sharks in six games in the first round. In 2001\u201302, the Sharks won their first Pacific Division title, but they fell to the Avalanche in the second round in seven games.\nFollowing the 2001\u201302 season, the Gunds sold the Sharks to a group of local investors headed by team president Greg Jamison. The 2002\u201303 season did not start well for the Sharks as they began 8\u201312\u20132\u20132 and fired Sutter as head coach. Ron Wilson was hired as head coach a few days later. Near the 2003 NHL trade deadline, captain Owen Nolan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Lombardi's tenure with the team ended with his dismissal on March 18, 2003. Doug Wilson was named to the role on May 13.\nDoug Wilson era (2003\u20132022).\nResurgence and arrival of Joe Thornton (2003\u20132008).\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw the team turn around their record from the previous season, finishing atop the Pacific Division. In the 2004 playoffs, the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues in the conference quarterfinals and the Colorado Avalanche in the conference semifinals, advancing to the conference finals. However, they fell to the Calgary Flames in six games. During that season, without a captain following Nolan's trade, San Jose utilized a rotating captaincy. When the job eventually fell to Patrick Marleau, he kept the captaincy. During the off-season, forward Vincent Damphousse was left in free agency to the Colorado Avalanche.\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season the Sharks traded Brad Stuart, Wayne Primeau, and Marco Sturm to the Boston Bruins in exchange for star player Joe Thornton. In the 2006 playoffs, the Sharks fell to the Edmonton Oilers in the conference semifinals. Thornton was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player, as well as the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points, with 125. Jonathan Cheechoo was awarded the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy for scoring the most goals during the regular season with 56.\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season they traded for defenseman Craig Rivet and winger Bill Guerin at the trade deadline. The Sharks finished the regular season second in the Pacific Division with a 51\u201326\u20135 record. In the conference quarterfinals, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators for the second consecutive year. In the conference semifinals, the Sharks were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the Sharks picked up Brian Campbell at the trade deadline, giving up Steve Bernier. The Sharks captured their third Pacific Division title with a franchise-record 108 points. San Jose started the 2008 playoffs beating the Calgary Flames four games to three. San Jose eventually lost to the Dallas Stars in the conference semifinals. Game six required four overtime periods, and was the longest game in the team's history. Following the playoff loss, the Sharks fired Ron Wilson as head coach.\nTodd McLellan as head coach (2008\u20132015).\nOn June 11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks named former Detroit Red Wings assistant coach Todd McLellan as their new head coach for the 2008\u201309 season. During the offseason, the Sharks signed defenseman Rob Blake and acquired defensemen Dan Boyle and Brad Lukowich. Midway through the season, San Jose added Claude Lemieux to their roster. Lemieux was rejoining the NHL after a five-year absence. The Sharks finished the regular season as Presidents' Trophy champions with 53 wins and 117 points, both franchise records. Despite their successful regular season, the Sharks were eliminated by the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in six games in the first round of the playoffs. The team was heavily criticized for once again failing to succeed in the postseason.\nIn the 2009 offseason, Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo were sent to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dany Heatley and a draft pick. Claude Lemieux also announced his retirement from the NHL. Another move by San Jose was stripping Patrick Marleau of the captaincy and assigning it to the newly re-signed Rob Blake. On February 7, 2010, San Jose acquired Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes. The Sharks finished the 2009\u201310 regular season leading the Western Conference with 113 points. In the conference quarterfinals, the Sharks eliminated the Colorado Avalanche. In the conference semifinals, the Sharks defeated the Detroit Red Wings. The Chicago Blackhawks beat the Sharks in the conference finals with a four-game sweep.\nOn June 23, 2010, Wilson announced they would not offer an unrestricted free agent contract to long-time goaltender Evgeni Nabokov after playing ten seasons with the team. On September 2, 2010, the Sharks signed former member of the Chicago Blackhawks and Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Antti Niemi to a one-year contract. On March 1, 2011, Niemi signed a four-year contract extension with San Jose worth $15.2\u00a0million. On March 31, 2011, the Sharks clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth with a 6\u20130 victory over the Dallas Stars. Five days later, they clinched their sixth Pacific Division championship. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, the Sharks opened their playoff run with the franchise's first playoff series against intrastate rival, the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings took a 4\u20130 lead in game three but five-second-period goals by the Sharks capped with a Devin Setoguchi overtime winner gave the Sharks a 6\u20135 victory and tied them for the second-biggest comeback in Stanley Cup playoff history. They would win the series in six games, with captain Joe Thornton scoring the series-winning overtime goal. The Sharks advanced to the conference semifinals to face the third-seed Detroit Red Wings. Although went out to a 3\u20130 series lead like the previous season, the Sharks dropped three more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a game seven after being down 3\u20130 in the series. However, they would not become the fourth team in history to pull off the comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 3\u20132 in game seven. The Sharks advanced to their third conference finals series against the Vancouver Canucks, but lost in six games.\nThe first major move made by San Jose in the 2011 off-season was to trade winger Devin Setoguchi, the Sharks' 2010 first-round pick Charlie Coyle and a first-round pick in the 2011 NHL entry draft to the Minnesota Wild for All-Star defenseman Brent Burns and a 2012 second-round pick. This came after Setoguchi had signed a three-year, $9\u00a0million contract extension with the Sharks. The Sharks continued their offseason retool by orchestrating a second transaction with the Wild, shipping Dany Heatley to Minnesota in exchange for Martin Havlat. The Sharks finished the 2011\u201312 season with a 43\u201329\u201310 record, good for 96 points and the seventh seed in the Stanley Cup playoffs. However, after winning game one of their first-round series with the St. Louis Blues in overtime, they lost the final four games of the series. It was later announced that McLellan would remain on the bench for a fifth season.\nDuring to the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season, Raffi Torres was acquired. In the first round of the 2013 playoffs, the Sharks swept the Vancouver Canucks, their first series-sweep in franchise history. The Sharks would subsequently fall in seven games to the Los Angeles Kings in the second round of the playoffs.\nThe Sharks started the 2013\u201314 season 8\u20130\u20131, and were the last team in the NHL to stay undefeated in regulation until October 25, when the Sharks lost to the Boston Bruins. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Sharks were matched with rivals and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings. Although the Sharks took a 3\u20130 series lead, the Kings came back to tie the series before advancing with a 5\u20131 win in game seven (only the fourth time in NHL history where a team lost a best-of-seven series after winning their first three games).\nOn August 20, 2014, head coach Todd McLellan announced the team would go into training camp for the 2014\u201315 season without a captain, and that all players would have the opportunity to compete for the captaincy. The Sharks hosted the 2015 Stadium Series against the Kings at Levi's Stadium in February 2015, losing 2\u20131. Despite posting a record of 40\u201333\u20139, the Sharks finished fifth in the Pacific Division and missed the playoffs for the first time in ten years. On April 20, 2015, the team announced that they had agreed to part ways with McLellan.\nFirst Stanley Cup Final and continued contention (2015\u20132019).\nOn May 28, 2015, the team named Peter DeBoer as their head coach. During the offseason, they traded goalie Antti Niemi to the Dallas Stars for a seventh-round draft pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft. They also acquired forward Joel Ward and goaltender Martin Jones, the latter of which was flipped from the Boston Bruins via the Los Angeles Kings. They also named forward Joe Pavelski the team's captain. The Sharks finished third in the Pacific Division with 98 points. They defeated the Los Angeles Kings in five games, the Nashville Predators in seven games, and the St. Louis Blues in six games to win the Western Conference championship. This marked the first time in franchise history that the Sharks advanced to the Stanley Cup Final. The Sharks ultimately lost the Stanley Cup Final in the best-of-seven series against the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games.\nIn the following season, the Sharks finished in third place in the Pacific Division, but were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers in six games in the first round of the 2017 playoffs. Following the season, Patrick Marleau left the team to sign with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In the 2017\u201318 season, the Sharks acquired Evander Kane in a trade with the Buffalo Sabres. The Sharks once again finished in third place in the Pacific Division. They swept the Anaheim Ducks in the first round of the 2018 playoffs, but lost to the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in six games in the second round.\nPrior to the 2018\u201319 season, the Sharks traded Mikkel Boedker, Julius Bergman, and a draft pick for Mike Hoffman, a prospect, and a draft pick, but immediately flipped Hoffman to the Florida Panthers for three draft picks. Later that summer, the Sharks acquired Erik Karlsson and Francis Perron from the Senators for Rudolf Balcers, Dylan DeMelo, Josh Norris, Chris Tierney, and two draft picks. The Sharks saw another playoff berth and overcame a 3\u20131 series deficit over the Vegas Golden Knights. Game seven of the series featured a dramatic comeback over the Golden Knights; the Sharks scored four goals on a controversial five-minute power play with eight minutes remaining in the game, then Barclay Goodrow scored the overtime goal. The Sharks would go on to defeat the Colorado Avalanche in the second round before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in six games. Captain Joe Pavelski left the team in free agency following the season.\nMissing the playoffs (2019\u20132022).\nOn October 8, 2019, after two seasons in Toronto, Patrick Marleau was re-acquired by the Sharks. During the 2019\u201320 season, with the Sharks at 15\u201316\u20132 and failing to win a game during their five-game road stretch, DeBoer and his staff were fired. After DeBoer's firing, assistant coach Bob Boughner was named interim head coach. In March 2020, four months after Boughner became interim coach, the league was forced to suspend operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the 2019\u201320 season resumed in August with the playoffs, the Sharks were not included, finishing in last place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference. Boughner's interim label was removed on September 22, 2020.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the divisions for the 2019\u201320 season were realigned. The Sharks played in the West Division. The Sharks missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. In the 2021 NHL entry draft, the Sharks selected top-ranked European skater William Eklund seventh overall.\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, general manager Doug Wilson took medical leave on November 26, 2021, and resigned while away from the team on April 7, 2022. Assistant general manager Joe Will was elevated to interim general manager while the team sought a full-time candidate for the role. Evander Kane, who had violated the AHL COVID-19 protocol, was placed on unconditional waivers for purposes of terminating his contract. After clearing waivers, he was signed by the Edmonton Oilers, but still had a grievance filed against the Sharks which was settled later that year. The team missed the playoffs for the third straight season, and head coach Bob Boughner and other members of the coaching staff were relieved of duties in the summer in advance of the Sharks naming a new general manager.\nMike Grier era (2022\u2013present).\nRebuilding (2022\u2013present).\nOn July 5, 2022, the Sharks hired former player Mike Grier to serve as their new general manager, becoming the first black general manager in NHL history and fifth general manager in franchise history. On July 13, the Sharks traded defenseman Brent Burns along with a prosepect to the Carolina Hurricanes for Steven Lorentz and a draft pick. On July 26, Grier named former Rangers head coach David Quinn as the team's new head coach. San Jose opened its season in Europe as part of the 2022 NHL Global Series, with an exhibition match against Eisbaren Berlin and a two-game series against Nashville in Prague, Czech Republic to kick off the 2022\u201323 regular season. On February 25, 2023, the Sharks retired Patrick Marleau's number 12 in a pre-game ceremony. Marleau's number was the first to be retired in franchise history.Prior to the trade deadline, the Sharks and New Jersey Devils executed an 11-piece trade on February 26, in which the Sharks sent forward Timo Meier to New Jersey in exchange for multiple future assets, including two conditional first-round draft selections, 2020 first-round pick Shakir Mukhamadullin and winger Fabian Zetterlund. The Sharks finished in seventh place in the Pacific Division, 14th place in the Western Conference, and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. The Sharks were led in scoring by defenseman Erik Karlsson, who finished with 101 points and 67 assists, both of which are records by a Sharks defenseman. He scored a pair of goals on April 10, in Winnipeg to become the sixth defenseman in NHL history to record 100 points and first since Brian Leetch in 1991\u201392. His goal, assist and point totals at the end of the season led all NHL defensemen, and he was named to his seventh NHL All-Star game. He was awarded the Norris Trophy on June 26, the third of his career and second won by a Sharks defenseman.\nOn August 6, San Jose traded Karlsson to the Pittsburgh Penguins as part of a three-team trade also featuring the Montreal Canadiens. San Jose received a conditional first-round selection from Pittsburgh in the 2024 NHL entry draft, along with forwards Mikael Granlund and Mike Hoffman and defenseman Jan Rutta. During the 2023\u201324 season, the Sharks became the first team since the 1965\u201366 Boston Bruins to allow 10 goals in consecutive games. Their 0\u201310\u20131 record tied the record for longest losing streak to start the season. They traded Tomas Hertl at the trade deadline, receiving David Edstrom and a 2025 first round pick in return. After the 2023\u201324 season, head coach David Quinn was fired. \nOn May 7, 2024, the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery for the first time in franchise history, securing the number one pick for the 2024 NHL entry draft, picking Macklin Celebrini from Boston University. Assistant coach Ryan Warsofsky was announced as Quinn's replacement as head coach on June 13, 2024. The Sharks finished the 2024\u201325 season last but fell to picking second overall in the 2025 NHL entry draft, with which they selected Michael Misa. Following the season, captain Logan Couture retired, spending his entire NHL career with the Sharks.\nAt the start of the 2025\u201326 season, amidst the team losing their first five games of the season, Warsofsky said \"I'd give up one of my children for a f-----g win.\" He later apologized for the comments.\nTeam information.\nLogo and jerseys.\nThe Sharks' iconic logo of a shark chomping on a hockey stick has been in use since their inaugural 1991\u201392 season, with slight modifications prior to the 2007\u201308 season. The triangle on the logo references the Bay Area's Red Triangle near the Pacific Ocean. The Sharks also use various partial and alternate logos based on the primary logo.\nThe original Sharks' road jerseys were teal with white, gray and black striping and featured white block lettering with black trim. Home uniforms were white with teal, gray and black striping and featured teal block lettering with black trim. Both jerseys included the team's \"fin\" logo on either shoulder and were used until the 1997\u201398 season.\nThe Sharks introduced their future road (later home) jersey as an alternate during the 1997\u201398 season, featuring a darker teal base, wide gray sleeve and shoulder striping and modernized lettering. A white home (later road) counterpart was introduced the following season and featured teal and gray shoulder and sleeve stripes. In the 2001\u201302 season, the Sharks began wearing a black third jersey, featuring the return of the fin logo on the shoulders and minimalist teal and white sleeve stripes.\nUpon switching to the Reebok Edge template in 2007, the Sharks introduced new home and away jerseys. The teal home jersey featured a black shoulder yoke while the white road jersey used a teal shoulder yoke. Both jerseys replaced gray with orange trim on the stripes and lettering, added numbers on the right chest, and featured the full-body (or \"jumping\") shark logo on the shoulders.\nBefore the 2008\u201309 season, the Sharks introduced a new black alternate jersey, without the contrasting shoulder yoke, tail stripes or orange trim. It also featured the jumping shark logo in front and the \"SJ\" alternate logo on the shoulders. Prior to the 2013\u201314 season, the Sharks unveiled new uniforms, which included less orange, along with adding a lace-up collar. The front numbers were replaced with the Sharks' 25th-anniversary logo prior to the 2015\u201316 season.\nFollowing the switch to Adidas' AdiZero template in 2017, the Sharks kept much of their basic look save for the replacement of the \"jumping shark\" logo in favor of the \"screaming shark\" logo (home jersey) and \"SJ\" logo (road jersey) on the shoulder. The slogan \"This Is Sharks Territory\" was added inside the neckline. The black alternates were retired prior to the season, but in 2018, a new black jersey was introduced. Known as the \"Stealth\" jersey, it featured a slightly different rendition of the primary Sharks logo, an updated version of the original \"fin\" logo on the shoulders and stylized circuit board sleeve striping. The Stealth uniforms were not used in the 2020\u201321 season as the Sharks opted to wear their \"Reverse Retro\" and \"Heritage\" alternate uniforms in the shortened season (see descriptions below).\nThe Sharks participated in the 2015 Stadium Series by wearing a tricolor jersey of teal, white and black accented by the primary Sharks logo in front and a new \"Northern California\" alternate logo on the shoulders. The back of the jersey remained teal and featured larger lettering.\nDuring the 2015\u201316 season, as part of their 25th anniversary, the Sharks wore a slightly modified version of their original teal jerseys for a few home games. These uniforms were brought back in 2021 for the Sharks' 30th anniversary, albeit modified to the AdiZero cut.\nThe Sharks wore Reverse Retro alternate uniforms for the 2020\u201321 season. The design used was similar to the teal uniforms they wore from 1997 to 2007, but with a gray base and black stripes.\nThe Sharks released new uniforms in 2022, featuring elements inspired from the team's original 1991\u20131998 uniform set. In addition, the Sharks changed their pants, gloves and home helmet to teal. The Sharks also unveiled a second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform based on the last uniforms worn by their Bay Area predecessors, the California Golden Seals. The design replaced the \"Seals\" wordmark with \"Sharks\" in teal and gold trim.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Sharks unveiled a new \"Cali Fin\" black alternate uniform, featuring the updated fin logo as the main crest, along with a modified version of the \"Northern California\" shoulder patch adopted from the 2015 Stadium Series uniform. In addition to teal and white stripes, a teal yarn-dye-esque striping pattern adorned the sleeves, tail and socks.\nFor four games in the 2025\u201326 season, the Sharks will wear 35th anniversary \"Heritage\" uniforms based on the teal uniforms they wore from 1997 to 2007.\nBroadcasters.\nTelevision:\nRadio:\nOne of the first group of broadcasters for the Sharks was Joe Starkey, who did play-by-play alongside Dennis Hull in 1991\u201392 and Pete Stemkowski for both 1991\u201392 and 1992\u201393 and Brian Hayward (1991\u201392 when sidelined with injuries) on color commentary. CSN Bay Area (now NBC Sports Bay Area) was the television home of San Jose Sharks until the end of the 2008\u201309 NHL season when their games moved to Comcast SportsNet California (now NBC Sports California). Over-the-air telecasts aired on KGO 7 from 1991\u20131994 and on KICU 36 from 1995\u20131999. Other television color commentators include Chris Collins (1996\u201397), Steve Konroyd (1997\u20132000), Drew Remenda (2000\u201306; 2007\u201314), Marty McSorley (2006\u201307), Jamie Baker (2014\u201320), and Kendall Coyne Schofield (2019\u201320).\nOn June 1, 2023, Dan Rusanowsky was announced as the recipient of the 2023 Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, voted on by the NHL Broadcaster's Association and presented \"in recognition of members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting\".\nTraditions.\nThe Sharks' best-known tradition is their pre-game entrance scene. At the beginning of each Sharks home game, the lights go down and a 17-foot open shark mouth is lowered from the rafters. As the mouth is lowered the eyes flash red and fog pours out. Then, a live view of the locker room tunnel with Sharks players is shown on the scoreboard and the goalie leads the team out of the locker room, through the mouth, and onto the ice.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Sharks.

{"id": "73140", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73140", "title": "Nashville Predators", "text": "National Hockey League team in Nashville, Tennessee\nThe Nashville Predators (colloquially referred to as the Preds) are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Predators compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The team has played its home games at Bridgestone Arena since 1998. Their television broadcasting rights are held by Bally Sports South, and the Nashville Predators Radio Network flagship station is WPRT-FM. The Predators are currently affiliated with two minor league teams: the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL.\nThe club was founded in 1997, when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to Craig Leipold, with the team beginning play in the 1998\u201399 season. After five seasons, the Predators qualified for their first Stanley Cup playoffs during the 2003\u201304 season. In 2008, ownership of the team was transferred from Leipold to a locally based ownership group. The Predators advanced to their first Stanley Cup Final in 2017, but were defeated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. In the following season, the Predators won their first Presidents' Trophy and Central Division title. As of 2025, the Predators, along with Nashville SC, are one of two professional sports teams in the state of Tennessee to have not relocated from another location as the Titans and the Grizzlies moved to Tennessee from Houston and Vancouver respectively.\nHistory.\nBringing the NHL to Nashville.\nIn late 1995, rumors began to circulate that the New Jersey Devils would relocate to the planned Nashville Arena after they won their first-ever Stanley Cup championship. Nashville offered a $20\u00a0million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate, and the Devils attempted to terminate their lease with the NJSEA before ultimately restructuring it to remain in New Jersey.\nAfter the failed attempt to land the Devils, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman stated Nashville would probably be considered in upcoming expansion. The arena was opened in 1996, and after an attempt to bring the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings did not materialize, the city instead went after a hockey team.\nIn January 1997, a group led by Wisconsin businessman Craig Leipold made a formal presentation before the NHL requesting an expansion franchise. When Bettman and league officials visited Nashville to tour the arena, thousands gathered on the arena plaza to greet them. In June, the league granted conditional franchises to Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, and Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul.\nThe Nashville team would begin play in 1998 if they met the NHL requirement of selling 12,000 season tickets before March 31, 1998. Of the four cities, Nashville was the only one with a completed arena and therefore began play first. On July 9, 1997, Leipold named former Washington Capitals general manager David Poile as the franchise's first general manager. Portland Pirates' head coach Barry Trotz was named the franchise's first head coach on August 6.\nOn September 25, 1997, Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise's new logo, a saber-toothed cat (\"Smilodon fatalis\"). The logo was a reference to a partial \"Smilodon\" skeleton found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971 during construction of the First American National Bank building, now the UBS Tower.\nOnce the logo was unveiled, the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name. Three candidates were culled from 75: \"Ice Tigers,\" \"Fury\" and \"Attack.\" Leipold added his own submission to the vote, \"Predators\". On November 13, Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and the new franchise would be known as the \"Nashville Predators.\"\nWhen awarded a franchise, the city of Nashville paid 31.50% of the $80\u00a0million fee to join the league. The city has engaged an affiliate of the team to operate the arena, and that agreement protects the city against annual arena operating losses over approximately $3.8\u00a0million. The $15\u00a0million payroll of the team was the lowest of the NHL.\nEarly years (1998\u20132005).\nThe Predators began play during the 1998\u201399 season, taking to the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, where they lost 1\u20130 at home to the Florida Panthers. It was the only sold-out game of the Predators' first five bouts in Nashville. Three nights later, on October 13, they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3\u20132 for their first win. Forward Andrew Brunette scored the first goal. The Predators, in their first year of existence, finished second-to-last in the Western Conference with a 28\u201347\u20137 record. In the 1999\u20132000 season, the Predators finished with a similar record to the previous season, and finished last in the Western Conference behind the Calgary Flames. However, during a game versus the New York Islanders on February 20, 2000, the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds.\nTo begin the 2000\u201301 season, the Predators played two games at the Saitama Super Arena in Tokyo, Japan against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan (13,849 for the first game and 13,426 for the second game). This included around 100 fans who made the trip from Tennessee. Backed by the goaltending duo of Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the Western Conference, ten points out of a playoff spot with 80 total points. During the 2001\u201302 season, the Predators recorded their 100th victory on December 6, 2001. With that win, Nashville became the second-fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau. In the 2002\u201303 season, head coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team (392 games).\nIn June 2003, the Predators hosted the NHL entry draft. Future Predators captain Shea Weber was selected by the team with the 49th overall pick.\nThe club failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for their first five years as a franchise. However, in the 2003\u201304 season, the Predators finished eighth in the Western Conference, qualifying for their first postseason berth. The Predators were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. The following 2004\u201305 season was wiped out by a labor dispute between NHL owners and players.\nAfter the lockout (2005\u20132014).\nThe Predators made their biggest free agent signing to that point in August 2005, when they signed Paul Kariya to a two-year, $9 million contract.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal each (although two of those were shootout victories, which would have been tie games in previous seasons). They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8\u20130; the last time a team did so was the Toronto Maple Leafs, who set the mark with a 10\u20130 start in the 1993\u201394 season. The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2\u20130 shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 16, 2006. In that match, Chris Mason became the ninth goaltender to score a goal. By the end of the season, the Predators had accumulated 106 points\u2014their first 100-point season\u2014and clinched home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history. They finished the season with an NHL-best 32\u20138\u20131 record at home. However, the Predators would be eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs.\nDuring the off-season, the Predators acquired veteran center Jason Arnott from free agency on July 2, 2006. In the following season, Arnott and David Legwand led the team in goals with 27 each. Late in the season, the Predators traded two former first-round draft picks, Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent, plus their first and third-round pick in the 2007 NHL entry draft, to the Philadelphia Flyers for five-time NHL All-Star Peter Forsberg. The Predators finished the season ranked fourth in the Western Conference with a franchise-record 110 points, finishing third overall behind the Buffalo Sabres and the Red Wings. They were defeated by the Sharks in the first round of the 2007 playoffs for the second year in a row, losing the series 4\u20131.\nThe roster saw a depletion in talent during the off-season. With multiple potential buyers and rumors of the franchise moving hounding the team until almost mid-season, the Predators were not expected to be successful during the 2007\u201308 season. Chris Mason, former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun (who was traded to the Florida Panthers) had a shaky season and shared net-minding duties with Dan Ellis. Ellis, who was signed from the Dallas Stars before the season began, had a 233:39 long shutout streak (fifth longest in league history) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville attain the eighth playoff spot with 91 points. The Predators met the Presidents' Trophy-winning (and eventual Stanley Cup winners) Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated 4\u20132, their fourth-straight first-round knockout.\nNew ownership group.\nThe first off-season of settling in under new ownership was a quiet one for the Predators with little personnel movement. As such, the Predators began the 2008\u201309 season with little expectation. Following a strong push after the All-Star break and no movement at the trade deadline, the team found themselves still battling for a playoff spot into the last week of the season. Buoyed by the return of Steve Sullivan after almost two seasons recovering from a back injury, the Predators finished with 88 points, settling for tenth place in the Western Conference, missing the playoffs for the first time in five seasons.\nThe Predators made few major additions to their roster in the 2009 off-season, signing former San Jose Sharks forward Marcel Goc (who was extended for another year by the club in mid-season) and former Montreal Canadiens defenseman Francis Bouillon. The 2009\u201310 season also saw the much-anticipated debut of top prospect Colin Wilson. However, due to a groin injury suffered in training camp, Wilson spent the first week-and-a-half of the season on the sidelines, and was sent to the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL) in November. He returned to the club in February and scored 11 points in his next 15 games and finished the season with 15 points in 35 games. 2010 also saw a breakout year for the last pick in the 2005 draft, Patric Hornqvist, as the 23-year-old Swede scored 30 in the 2009\u201310 season, becoming the fourth Predator to do so (the others being Steve Sullivan, Paul Kariya and Jason Arnott). The Predators qualified for the 2010 playoffs, facing the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. The Predators earned their first postseason road win on April 16, 2010, when they beat the Blackhawks 4\u20131 at the United Center, although they lost the overall series in six games.\nOn July 9, 2010, the Predators announced defenseman Shea Weber would become the club's fifth captain. In the following season's playoffs, the Predators advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the Anaheim Ducks in the first round, winning the fourth game of the series at Bridgestone Arena on April 24, 2011. Two days prior, Predators' goaltender Pekka Rinne was nominated as a Vezina Trophy finalist for his performance during the 2010\u201311 season. The Predators played against the number-one ranked team in the NHL in the second round, the Vancouver Canucks. The Predators lost the series 4\u20132.\nOn June 22, 2011, the Predators unveiled their modified logo set for the 2011\u201312 season. With the color scheme simplified to blue, gold, and white and eliminating orange, silver, and steel, the Predators cleaned up their primary logo and wordmark. A new alternate logo incorporating elements from a guitar pick and the Tennessee state flag was also introduced. Home jerseys changed from blue to gold.\nIn the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season, on November 3, 2011, the Predators signed goaltender Pekka Rinne to a seven-year, $49\u00a0million deal. It was the largest contract awarded in Predators' history, as well as making Rinne the highest-paid goaltender in the NHL that year. On February 27, 2012, during the NHL's trade deadline, the Predators acquired Andrei Kostitsyn and Paul Gaustad from the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres, respectively. The Predators surrendered draft picks to bolster their team for the 2012 playoffs. The season also saw the return of Russian forward Alexander Radulov to the Predators after a four-year hiatus to play in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). For the second year in a row, and the second time in the team's history, the Predators won a first-round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs, defeating the Red Wings in a best-of-seven series 4\u20131. However, for the second year in a row, the Predators were ousted in the Western Conference second round, this time to the Phoenix Coyotes.\nThe following 2012\u201313 season was shortened to 48 games as a result of the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout. The Predators failed to qualify for the playoffs in the shortened season, the first time they failed to do so since the 2008\u201309 season. After the season, the Predators signed Weber through a front-loaded $110\u00a0million, 14-year offer sheet, $68\u00a0million of it as a signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek.\nThe following season saw the departure of center David Legwand, the first player ever drafted by the Predators, the club's all-time leading scorer, and co-leading scorer for the season at the time. Agreeing to waive his \"no-trade clause\", he was traded on March 5, 2014, to his hometown team, the Detroit Red Wings, in exchange for prospect forward Calle J\u00e4rnkrok, forward Patrick Eaves and a third-round pick in the upcoming 2014 NHL entry draft. After missing the playoffs for the second season in a row, the Predators opted not to renew the contract of Barry Trotz as their head coach after 15 years, although he was offered an unnamed position within the organization. On May 6, 2014, the Predators announced Peter Laviolette as their new head coach.\nPeter Laviolette era (2014\u20132020).\nRegaining consistency (2014\u20132016).\nIn Peter Laviolette's first season as the Predators' head coach, the Predators finished second in the Central Division. Despite having home advantage in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, they lost the first round in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. For the following 2015\u201316 season, the Predators named Sean Henry CEO and then finished as the Western Conference's first wild-card, earning 96 points. By beating the Anaheim Ducks in game 7, the franchise played its first seven-game series and earned its seven-game series win. In the second round, they were eliminated in seven games by the San Jose Sharks, who went on to win the conference.\nThe Predators hosted the 2016 National Hockey League All-Star Game at Bridgestone Arena.\nIn the 2016 off-season, on June 29, 2016, the Predators traded Weber to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for defenseman P. K. Subban. The trade surprised many hockey fans because the details to this trade were kept strictly confidential until the deal was already made. On September 7, 2016, the Predators announced Mike Fisher would replace Weber as the sixth captain of the club.\nFirst Stanley Cup Final appearance and first Presidents' Trophy (2016\u20132018).\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the Predators finished fourth in the Central Division with 94 points, which earned them the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. The 2016\u201317 season marked the first time the Predators sold out all 41 regular season home games. Their eighth-place finish in the conference gave them a first-round Stanley Cup playoff matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, who finished first in the conference during the regular season.\nThe Predators swept the Blackhawks in four games. This was the first time an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in NHL history as well as the first time that there had been a sweep by an eighth seed against a top seed in a best-of-seven playoff series in the history of North American major league professional sports. In the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games, marking the first time the team advanced to the conference finals. On May 16, the Predators became the first team in 20 years (since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997) to achieve 10 straight wins at home in the postseason. On May 22, 2017, the Predators defeated the Anaheim Ducks 6\u20133 and won the series four games to two, winning the Western Conference, and advancing to the club's first Stanley Cup Final. In the 2017 Stanley Cup Final, the Predators went down 2\u20130 against the Penguins before battling back and leveling the series at two, winning games 3 and 4 at home. Returning to Pittsburgh, the Predators lost 6\u20130 before being eliminated at home 2\u20130 in game 6.\nOn April 5, 2018, the Predators clinched their first division title in team history while also claiming their first Presidents' Trophy. They defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs in six games, and then lost to the Winnipeg Jets in seven games in the second round.\nEarly playoff exits (2018\u20132020).\nThe next season saw the Predators clinch their second consecutive division title, but lost to the Dallas Stars in the first round of the 2019 playoffs.\nThe Predators played in their first outdoor game at the 2020 Winter Classic, facing the Dallas Stars at the Cotton Bowl.\nThe Predators fired head coach Laviolette on January 6, 2020, with the team sitting at sixth place in the division at the time and a record of 19\u201315\u20137.\nJohn Hynes era (2020\u20132023).\nContinued playoff struggles (2020\u20132023).\nOn January 7, 2020, John Hynes was hired as the third head coach in the Predators' franchise history. In Hynes' first game as coach, Pekka Rinne became the second Predators goaltender to score a goal in a 5\u20132 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The team's season would come to an abrupt end two months later when the league suspended operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Predators advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Arizona Coyotes in the qualifying round. The Predators returned to the playoffs in 2021, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round.\nThe Predators hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning at Nissan Stadium in their second outdoor game, the 2022 Stadium Series, on February 26, 2022, losing 3\u20132 in front of a crowd of 68,619. They clinched the 2022 playoffs, but were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round.\nIn February 2023, David Poile announced that he would retire as general manager of the team at the end of the 2022\u201323 season, and that former head coach Barry Trotz would succeed him, effective June 30, 2023.\nAndrew Brunette era (2023\u2013present).\nOn May 31, 2023, Trotz announced that the team had hired former player Andrew Brunette as the fourth head coach in franchise history. In the 2023\u201324 season, the Predators finished as the first wildcard, but lost to the Vancouver Canucks in six games in the first round of the 2024 playoffs.\nTeam information.\nFacilities.\nThe Nashville Predators have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since their inaugural season in 1998. Opened in 1996, Bridgestone Arena is a multi-purpose venue in downtown Nashville.\nFan traditions.\nFans of the Nashville Predators have modified the octopus-throwing tradition of Detroit Red Wings fans to show their support: on occasion, a fan will throw a catfish onto the ice. \"The Tennessean\" newspaper of Nashville cites the first instance of this as being on October 30, 2003. On May 16, 2017, during game 3 of the conference finals at Bridgestone Arena, country music singer, songwriter, and record producer Keith Urban, who had performed the national anthem prior to the game, was seen on the Jumbotron hoisting a massive catfish that Tennessee Titans left tackle, Taylor Lewan had with him at the game. Lewan, along with fellow Titans offensive linemen Jack Conklin, Quinton Spain, Ben Jones, and Josh Klein, and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, served as the hype men prior to the game, another Predators playoff tradition prior to home games, which included them waving gold Predators towels, Mariota encouraging the crowd to get louder, Lewan hoisting the catfish, and the offensive linemen chugging beer.\nSection 303 is where a section of fans at the Bridgestone Arena sit, stand, and cheer, colloquially known as \"The Cellblock\". The group refers to themselves as \"the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL.\" The fan-based organization has been recognized by the Predators' front office. A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section.\nOn April 3, 2008, with the Predators clinging to a 3\u20132 lead with 4:30 in their final home game of the regular season, a sellout crowd at what was then known as the Sommet Center, gave the team a standing ovation through the entirety of the final TV timeout. The Predators went on to win the game against the St. Louis Blues and advanced to the playoffs that year, where the \"standing O\" during the final TV timeout has since become a fan tradition.\nThe mascot of the Predators is Gnash, a blue saber-toothed cat. Introduced in 1998, Gnash's trademark includes stunts, such as very fast rappels, zip lines, and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice. To go along with the saber-toothed cat mascot, Predators fans proudly use their \"Fang Fingers\" during each power play of the game. There are foam saber-fang gloves that can be purchased, but most fans simply curl their index and middle fingers on each hand into fang shapes and brandish them in an up-and-down motion. Fang Fingers are done to the horror sounds from the Alfred Hitchcock movie, \"Psycho\".\nFans are also known for a variety of chants taunting players of the opposing team, particularly the goalie. For example, after each Predators goal, fans call the opposing goalie's name, accompanied by shouts of \"It's all your fault\" and other epithets. These cheers are sometimes said to originate from tradition at college football games, but some of these derive from traditions held by fans of Nashville's former pre-NHL hockey teams Nashville Dixie Flyers, Nashville South Stars, Nashville Knights, and Nashville Nighthawks/Nashville Ice Flyers. This has contributed to the team also being called \"Smashville\".\nJersey and logo.\nThe original Predators uniforms were worn from 1998 to 2007 and both featured a silver yoke on the shoulder. Navy and white were the base uniform colors while gold was used only as an accent color. The white uniforms featured the primary Predators logo outside a navy triangle while the navy uniforms use the same logo minus the triangle. From 1998 to 2004 the secondary logo featuring the Gaylord Entertainment Center (now Bridgestone Arena) tower adorned the shoulders.\nFrom 2001 to 2007 the Predators wore mustard gold third jerseys featuring the front-facing saber-toothed cat logo. These jerseys are known by the nickname \"Mustard Cats.\" The logo then replaced the tower alternate logo on the shoulders of their primary uniforms in 2005.\nSwitching to Reebok's Edge template in 2007, the Predators made minor tweaks to their uniforms. Most notably, the white uniforms no longer featured a contrasting nameplate color, while the city name was added above the Predators logo.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the Predators wore navy third jerseys but with black replacing gold as trim color. A roundel logo featuring the fossilized cat adorned the shoulders while a checkerboard pattern of black and navy squares adorned the sleeves, tail stripes and socks.\nFor the 2011\u201312 season, the Nashville Predators changed their jersey design and color scheme. The home jerseys are a bright gold with navy and white highlights, while the away jerseys are white with gold and navy highlights. Furthermore, the Predators changed their logo, making it purely white, gold and navy. The jerseys have a guitar pick on the shoulder with the Tennessee state tri-star inside it, lines reminiscent of guitar strings on the numbers, and piano keys along the neckline inside the jersey as a nod to Nashville's internationally known music heritage. From the 2016\u201317 season gold helmets became a permanent part of the home uniform, after they first used them on Saturday home games the prior season.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season the Predators changed their uniform style to fit with the new Adidas template. While the gold home uniforms received minimal alterations, the away white uniforms featured more gold accents in the sleeves, shoulders and tail while navy was relegated to trim color.\nThe Predators unveiled a special edition uniform for the 2020 Winter Classic, featuring a design inspired from the uniforms of the defunct EHL team Nashville Dixie Flyers. Heavy gold stripes with navy trim adorn the chest and sleeves while a script rendition of the team name was inserted to the gold chest stripe. A navy felt-rendered saber-toothed cat logo was also added on the left shoulder.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Predators released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform, using the design they wore from 1998 to 2007. However, gold was used as the base color while navy was relegated to trim color.\nFor the 2022 Stadium Series, the Predators released a navy uniform with a thick gold stripe in front. The \"Smashville\" moniker in large navy letters along with the navy \"guitar pick\" alternate logo was emblazoned inside the gold stripe. Numbers were enlarged for visibility purposes.\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the 2001 to 2007 alternate uniform but with the current athletic gold in place of mustard gold.\nMascot.\nThe mascot of the team is an anthropomorphic saber-toothed tiger named Gnash.\nOwnership.\nThe franchise was initially owned by a group led by Craig Leipold. On May 23, 2007, Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to Research in Motion chairman and co-CEO Jim Balsillie. At the time, Leipold indicated that the team would play the 2007\u201308 season in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear.\nOn June 23, information leaked by several sources indicated that Leipold no longer wanted to sell the Predators to Balsillie. Subsequently, a campaign to land the team in Kansas City, Missouri, received a boost in late June 2007. The Canadian \"National Post\", citing anonymous sources, reported that Leipold planned to sell the team to San Jose venture capitalist William \"Boots\" Del Biaggio III, who wanted to relocate the club to Kansas City's new Sprint Center for the 2008\u201309 season. Del Biaggio, who had a contract with Anschutz Entertainment Group to own an NHL club that would play home games in Sprint Center, had made an offer reported to be for about $190\u00a0million for the Predators. Del Biaggio had entered an agreement two years earlier, in 2005, to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the club backed out of the deal after it won that year's NHL draft lottery and took Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick.\nOn July 19, 2007, a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the Sommet Center to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville. They drew approximately 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full-season tickets during the rally. The rally was heavily supported by George Plaster, then a sportscaster on WGFX 104.5 \"The Zone\" sports radio in Nashville. On August 1, 2007, the group released a letter of intent from Craig Leipold. After negotiations with the City of Nashville, the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with Mayor of Nashville Karl Dean, and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29, 2007.\nIn June 2008, Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in his filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Furthermore, it was alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means, prompting an FBI investigation and criminal charges. The charges culminated in a 97-month prison sentence for Del Biaggio. Under United States bankruptcy law, a trustee was appointed to sell Del Biaggio's assets, including his stake in the Predators, to pay off his creditors. In November 2011, it was announced that Calgary businessman W. Brett Wilson had purchased a 5% interest in the Nashville Predators.\nOn March 1, 2010, during the 2009\u201310 season, the Predators front office saw Freeman step down as chairman of the Nashville Predators in favor of Thomas Cigarran. On September 2, Cigarran announced that the local ownership group had completed the purchase of the Del Biaggio stake.\nOwnership dispute.\nOn June 23, 2016, Freeman filed a $250\u00a0million lawsuit against the Nashville Predators and Cigarran. His claim was that his ownership stake has been improperly diluted by Cigarran failing to notify him of capital calls, and that he had not received loan guaranty fees that the ownership group had agreed to pay him. The lawsuit stated that Freeman initially owned a 48% share, while the holding company for the Nashville Predators stated that Freeman controlled less than 1% of ownership in the team at the time of the suit. This dilution was exacerbated by the existence of two classes of investments in the Predators: the common units owned by Freeman were subject to capital calls; the Series A units originally owned by Del Biaggio and his minority partner were not subject to capital calls.\nThe dispute was sent to court-ordered arbitration on July 29, 2016, under the supervision of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. As of January 25, 2018, arbitration was continuing in the unresolved dispute. The outcome may remain undisclosed, as the arbitration is private.\nBill Haslam purchases majority stake.\nOn June 17, 2022, the Predators announced that former Governor of Tennessee Bill Haslam would purchase shares in the club and become majority owner over the course of several years. Haslam's brother, Jimmy Haslam, is the owner of the Cleveland Browns and the Columbus Crew.\nBroadcasters.\nLocal television rights of Predators games are held by FanDuel Sports Network South (formerly Bally Sports South), with its territory covering Tennessee, Georgia, most of Kentucky, northern Mississippi and northern Alabama. Radio coverage is carried by the Nashville Predators Radio Network, whose flagship station is WPRT-FM.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Predators.
