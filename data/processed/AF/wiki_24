The molecule is a complex consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings sandwiching a central iron atom. It is an orange solid with a camphor-like odor that sublimes above room temperature, and is soluble in most organic solvents. It is remarkable for its stability: it is unaffected by air, water, strong bases, and can be heated to 400\u00a0\u00b0C without decomposition. In oxidizing conditions it can reversibly react with strong acids to form the ferrocenium cation . \nThe first reported synthesis of ferrocene was in 1951. Its unusual stability puzzled chemists, and required the development of new theory to explain its formation and bonding. The discovery of ferrocene and its many analogues, known as metallocenes, sparked excitement and led to a rapid growth in the discipline of organometallic chemistry. Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer, both of whom worked on elucidating the structure of ferrocene, later shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on organometallic sandwich compounds. Ferrocene itself has no large-scale applications, but has found more niche uses in catalysis, as a fuel additive, and as a tool in undergraduate education.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nFerrocene was discovered by accident twice. The first known synthesis may have been made in the late 1940s by unknown researchers at Union Carbide, who tried to pass hot cyclopentadiene vapor through an iron pipe. The vapor reacted with the pipe wall, creating a \"yellow sludge\" that clogged the pipe. Years later, a sample of the sludge that had been saved was obtained and analyzed by Eugene O. Brimm, shortly after reading Kealy and Pauson's article, and was found to consist of ferrocene.\nThe second time was around 1950, when Samuel A. Miller, John A. Tebboth, and John F. Tremaine, researchers at British Oxygen, were attempting to synthesize amines from hydrocarbons and nitrogen in a modification of the Haber process. When they tried to react cyclopentadiene with nitrogen at 300\u00a0\u00b0C, at atmospheric pressure, they were disappointed to see the hydrocarbon react with some source of iron, yielding ferrocene. While they too observed its remarkable stability, they put the observation aside and did not publish it until after Pauson reported his findings. Kealy and Pauson were later provided with a sample by Miller \"et al.\", who confirmed that the products were the same compound.\nIn 1951, Peter L. Pauson and Thomas J. Kealy at Duquesne University attempted to prepare fulvalene () by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene (). To that end, they reacted the Grignard compound cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether with ferric chloride as an oxidizer. However, instead of the expected fulvalene, they obtained a light orange powder of \"remarkable stability\", with the formula .\nDetermining the structure.\nPauson and Kealy conjectured that the compound had two cyclopentadienyl groups, each with a single covalent bond from the saturated carbon atom to the iron atom. However, that structure was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain the unexpected stability of the compound, and chemists struggled to find the correct structure.\nThe structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952. Robert Burns Woodward, Geoffrey Wilkinson, et al. observed that the compound was diamagnetic and nonpolar. A few months later they described its reactions as being typical of aromatic compounds such as benzene. The name ferrocene was coined by Mark Whiting, a postdoc with Woodward. Ernst Otto Fischer and Wolfgang Pfab also noted ferrocene's diamagneticity and high symmetry. They also synthesized nickelocene and cobaltocene and confirmed they had the same structure. Fischer described the structure as \"Doppelkegelstruktur\" (\"double-cone structure\"), although the term \"sandwich\" came to be preferred by British and American chemists. Philip Frank Eiland and Raymond Pepinsky confirmed the structure through X-ray crystallography and later by NMR spectroscopy.\nThe \"sandwich\" structure of ferrocene was shockingly novel and led to intensive theoretical studies. Application of molecular orbital theory with the assumption of a Fe2+ centre between two cyclopentadienide anions resulted in the successful Dewar\u2013Chatt\u2013Duncanson model, allowing correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule as well as explaining its remarkable stability.\nImpact.\nThe discovery of ferrocene was considered so significant that Wilkinson and Fischer shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, called sandwich compounds\".\nStructure and bonding.\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy indicates that the iron center in ferrocene should be assigned the +2 oxidation state. Each cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring should then be allocated a single negative charge. Thus ferrocene could be described as iron(II) bis(cyclopentadienide), .\nEach ring has six \u03c0-electrons, which makes them aromatic according to H\u00fcckel's rule. These \u03c0-electrons are then shared with the metal via covalent bonding. Since Fe2+ has six \"d\"-electrons, the complex attains an 18-electron configuration, which accounts for its stability. In modern notation, this sandwich structural model of the ferrocene molecule is denoted as , where \"\u03b7\" denotes hapticity, the number of atoms through which each ring binds.\nThe carbon\u2013carbon bond distances around each five-membered ring are all 1.40\u00a0\u00c5, and all Fe\u2013C bond distances are 2.04\u00a0\u00c5. The Cp rings rotate with a low barrier about the Cp(centroid)\u2013Fe\u2013Cp(centroid) axis, as observed by measurements on substituted derivatives of ferrocene using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For example, methylferrocene (CH3C5H4FeC5H5) exhibits a singlet for the C5H5 ring.\nFrom room temperature down to 164\u00a0K, X-ray crystallography yields the monoclinic space group; the cyclopentadienide rings are a staggered conformation, resulting in a centrosymmetric molecule, with symmetry group D5d. However, below 110\u00a0K, ferrocene crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal lattice in which the Cp rings are ordered and eclipsed, so that the molecule has symmetry group D5h. In the gas phase, electron diffraction and computational studies show that the Cp rings are eclipsed. While ferrocene has no permanent dipole moment at room temperature, between 172.8 and 163.5\u00a0K the molecule exhibits an \"incommensurate modulation\", breaking the D5 symmetry and acquiring an electric dipole.\nIn solution, eclipsed D5h ferrocene was determined to dominate over the staggered D5d conformer, as suggested by both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations.\nSynthesis.\nEarly methods.\nThe first reported syntheses of ferrocene were nearly simultaneous. Pauson and Kealy synthesised ferrocene using iron(III) chloride and cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide. A redox reaction produces iron(II) chloride. The formation of fulvalene (the intended outcome), does not occur.\nAnother early synthesis of ferrocene was by Miller \"et al.\", who treated metallic iron with gaseous cyclopentadiene at elevated temperature. An approach using iron pentacarbonyl was also reported.\nFe(CO)5 + 2\u00a0C5H6 \u2192 Fe(C5H5)2 + 5\u00a0CO + H2\nVia alkali cyclopentadienide.\nMore efficient preparative methods are generally a modification of the original transmetalation sequence using either commercially available sodium cyclopentadienide or freshly cracked cyclopentadiene deprotonated with potassium hydroxide and reacted with anhydrous iron(II) chloride in ethereal solvents.\nModern modifications of Pauson and Kealy's original Grignard approach are known:\nEven some amine bases (such as diethylamine) can be used for the deprotonation, though the reaction proceeds more slowly than when using stronger bases:\n2\u00a0C5H6 + 2\u00a0(CH3CH2)2NH + FeCl2 \u2192 Fe(C5H5)2 + 2\u00a0(CH3CH2)2NH2Cl\nDirect transmetalation can also be used to prepare ferrocene from some other metallocenes, such as manganocene:\nFeCl2 + Mn(C5H5)2 \u2192 MnCl2 + Fe(C5H5)2\nProperties.\nFerrocene is an air-stable orange solid with a camphor-like odor. As expected for a symmetric, uncharged species, ferrocene is soluble in normal organic solvents, such as benzene, but is insoluble in water. It is stable to temperatures as high as 400\u00a0\u00b0C.\nFerrocene readily sublimes, especially upon heating in a vacuum. Its vapor pressure is about 1 Pa at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 10 Pa at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, 100 Pa at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, 1000 Pa at 116\u00a0\u00b0C, and 10,000 Pa (nearly 0.1 atm) at 162\u00a0\u00b0C.\nReactions.\nAromatic substitution.\nFerrocene is an aromatic substance. Electrophiles typically substitute onto, rather than add to, the cyclopentadienyl ligands. For example, a common undergraduate experiment performs Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetic anhydride and a phosphoric acid catalyst. Just as this reagent mixture converts benzene to acetophenone, it converts ferrocene to acetylferrocene. \nIn the presence of aluminium chloride, Me2NPCl2 and ferrocene react to give ferrocenyl dichlorophosphine, whereas treatment with phenyldichlorophosphine under similar conditions forms \"P\",\"P\"-diferrocenyl-\"P\"-phenyl phosphine. Vilsmeier-Haack formylation using formylanilide and phosphorus oxychloride gives ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. \nUnsubstituted ferrocene undergoes aromatic substitution more easily than benzene, because electrophiles can attack the metal ion before rearranging to the Wheland intermediate. Thus ferrocene reacts with the weak electrophile P4S10 to form a diferrocenyl-dithiadiphosphetane disulfide. Mannich conditions suffice to iminylate ferrocene unto N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene. \nSuperacidic protonation does not complete aromatic substitution, but rather traps the unrearranged bent intermediate hydrido salt, [Cp2FeH]PF6. Strongly oxidizing electrophiles, such as halogens and nitric acid, neither rearrange to a Wheland intermediate nor coordinate to iron, instead generating ferrocenium salts (see ). \nIn accordance with cluster compound theory, ferrocene's rings behave as a single delocalized \u03c0 system. Electronic perturbations to one ring propagate to the other. For example, introduction of a deactivating aldehyde group on one ring inhibits formylation of the other ring as well.\nMetallation.\nFerrocene readily metallates. Ferrocene reacts with butyllithium to give 1,1\u2032-dilithioferrocene, which is a versatile nucleophile. In combination with butyllithiium, \"tert\"-butyllithium produces monolithioferrocene. Likewise ferrocene mercurates to give ferrocendiyl dimercuriacetate. \nFurther reaction gives the nitro, halo-, and borono derivatives.\nRedox chemistry.\nFerrocene undergoes a one-electron oxidation at around 0.4\u00a0V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), becoming ferrocenium. Although the nomenclature is not internally consistent, ferrocenium is abbreviated Fc+. This reversible oxidation has been used as standard in electrochemistry as Fc+/Fc\u00a0= 0.64\u00a0V versus the standard hydrogen electrode, however other values have been reported. Ferrocenium tetrafluoroborate is a common reagent. The remarkably reversible oxidation-reduction behaviour has been extensively used to control electron-transfer processes in electrochemical and photochemical systems. \nSubstituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the anodic direction (\"i.e.\" made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the cathodic direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication. Ferrocene is often used as an internal standard for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.\nStereochemistry of substituted ferrocenes.\nMonosubstituted ferrocenes have the formula . These derivatives are often referred to as ferrocenyl (abbreviated Fc) compounds. Examples include ferrocenyl aldehyde (FcCHO), ferrocenyl carboxylic acid (FcCO2H), and ferrocenyl methanol (FcCH2OH). When the substituent is chiral, then the entire molecule is chiral. \nDisubstituted ferrocenes can exist as either 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,1\u2032- isomers, none of which are interconvertible. Ferrocenes that are asymmetrically disubstituted on one ring are chiral\u00a0\u2013 for example [CpFe(EtC5H3Me)]. This planar chirality arises despite no single atom being a stereogenic centre..\nSeveral approaches have been developed to asymmetrically 1,1\u2032-functionalise the ferrocene.\nApplications of ferrocene and its derivatives.\nFerrocene and its numerous derivatives have no large-scale applications, but have many niche uses that exploit the unusual structure (ligand scaffolds, pharmaceutical candidates), robustness (anti-knock formulations, precursors to materials), and redox (reagents and redox standards).\nLigand scaffolds.\nChiral ferrocenyl phosphines are employed as ligands for transition-metal catalyzed reactions. Some of them have found industrial applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. For example, the diphosphine 1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) is a valued ligand for palladium-coupling reactions and Josiphos ligand is useful for hydrogenation catalysis. They are named after the technician who made the first one, Josi Puleo.\nFuel additives.\nFerrocene and its derivatives are antiknock agents used in the fuel for petrol engines. They are safer than previously used tetraethyllead. Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene can be added to unleaded petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol. The iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can form a conductive coating on spark plug surfaces. Ferrocene polyglycol copolymers, prepared by effecting a polycondensation reaction between a ferrocene derivative and a substituted dihydroxy alcohol, has promise as a component of rocket propellants. These copolymers provide rocket propellants with heat stability, serving as a propellant binder and controlling propellant burn rate.\nFerrocene has been found to be effective at reducing smoke and sulfur trioxide produced when burning coal. The addition by any practical means, impregnating the coal or adding ferrocene to the combustion chamber, can significantly reduce the amount of these undesirable byproducts, even with a small amount of the metal cyclopentadienyl compound.\nPharmaceuticals.\nFerrocene derivatives have been investigated as drugs, with one compound ferrocerone approved for use in the USSR in the 1970s as an iron supplement, though it is no longer marketed today. Only one drug has entered clinical trials in recent years, Ferroquine (7-chloro-N-(2-((dimethylamino)methyl)ferrocenyl)quinolin-4-amine), an antimalarial, which has reached Phase IIb trials. Ferrocene-containing polymer-based drug delivery systems have been investigated.\nThe anticancer activity of ferrocene derivatives was first investigated in the late 1970s, when derivatives bearing amine or amide groups were tested against lymphocytic leukemia. Some ferrocenium salts exhibit anticancer activity, but no compound has seen evaluation in the clinic. Ferrocene derivatives have strong inhibitory activity against human lung cancer cell line A549, colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, and breast cancer cell line MCF-7. An experimental drug was reported which is a ferrocenyl version of tamoxifen. The idea is that the tamoxifen will bind to the estrogen binding sites, resulting in cytotoxicity.\nFerrocifens are exploited for cancer applications by a French biotech, Feroscan, founded by Pr. Gerard Jaouen.\nSolid rocket propellant.\nFerrocene and related derivatives are used as powerful burn rate catalysts in ammonium perchlorate composite propellant.\nDerivatives and variations.\nFerrocene analogues can be prepared with variants of cyclopentadienyl. For example, bisindenyliron and bisfluorenyliron.\nCarbon atoms can be replaced by heteroatoms as illustrated by Fe(\"\u03b7\"5-C5Me5)(\"\u03b7\"5-P5) and Fe(\"\u03b7\"5-C5H5)(\"\u03b7\"5-C4H4N) (\"azaferrocene\"). Azaferrocene arises from decarbonylation of Fe(\"\u03b7\"5-C5H5)(CO)2(\"\u03b7\"1-pyrrole) in cyclohexane. This compound on boiling under reflux in benzene is converted to ferrocene.\nIron arene complexes are possible, but bis(arene)s are difficult to stabilize. The bis(benzene)iron(II) cation, isoelectronic with bis(benzene)chromium, is unstable against nucleophilic attack, and decomposes \"instantaneously\" in acetonitrile. It can be observed, however, in metastable nitromethane solution. \nBecause of the ease of substitution, many structurally unusual ferrocene derivatives have been prepared. For example, the penta(ferrocenyl)cyclopentadienyl ligand, features a cyclopentadienyl anion derivatized with five ferrocene substituents.\nIn hexaferrocenylbenzene, C6[(\"\u03b7\"5-C5H4)Fe(\"\u03b7\"5-C5H5)]6, all six positions on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R). X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30\u00b0 and \u221280\u00b0. Due to steric crowding the ferrocenyls are slightly bent with angles of 177\u00b0 and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a chair conformation with dihedral angles of 14\u00b0 and displays bond length alternation between 142.7\u00a0pm and 141.1\u00a0pm, both indications of steric crowding of the substituents.\nThe synthesis of hexaferrocenylbenzene has been reported using Negishi coupling of hexaiodobenzene and diferrocenylzinc, using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, in tetrahydrofuran:\nThe yield is only 4%, which is further evidence consistent with substantial steric crowding around the arene core.\nMaterials chemistry.\nFerrocene, a precursor to iron nanoparticles, can be used as a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. Vinylferrocene can be converted to (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. In addition to using organic polymer backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (\u2013PH(R)\u2013BH2\u2013)\"n\", and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple. Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70\u00b0 smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30\u00b0, and the switching of wettability is reversible. In the PFcMA case, the effect of lengthening the chains and hence introducing more ferrocene groups is significantly larger reductions in the contact angle upon oxidation."}

It is often abbreviated CpH because the cyclopentadienyl anion is abbreviated Cp\u2212.\nThis colorless liquid has a strong and unpleasant odor. At room temperature, this cyclic diene dimerizes over the course of hours to give dicyclopentadiene via a Diels\u2013Alder reaction. This dimer can be restored by heating to give the monomer.\nThe compound is mainly used for the production of cyclopentene and its derivatives. It is popularly used as a precursor to the cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp\u2212), an important ligand in cyclopentadienyl complexes in organometallic chemistry.\nProduction and reactions.\nCyclopentadiene production is usually not distinguished from dicyclopentadiene since they interconvert. They are obtained from coal tar (about 10\u201320\u00a0g/t) and by steam cracking of naphtha (about 14\u00a0kg/t). To obtain cyclopentadiene monomer, commercial dicyclopentadiene is cracked by heating to around 180\u00a0\u00b0C. The monomer is collected by distillation and used soon thereafter. It advisable to use some form of fractionating column when doing this, to remove refluxing uncracked dimer. \nSigmatropic rearrangement.\nThe hydrogen atoms in cyclopentadiene undergo rapid [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts. The hydride shift is, however, sufficiently slow at 0\u00a0\u00b0C to allow alkylated derivatives to be manipulated selectively. \nEven more fluxional are the derivatives C5H5E(CH3)3 (E = Si, Ge, Sn), wherein the heavier element migrates from carbon to carbon with a low activation barrier.\nDiels\u2013Alder reactions.\nCyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene in the Diels\u2013Alder reaction because minimal distortion of the diene is required to achieve the envelope geometry of the transition state compared to other dienes. Famously, cyclopentadiene dimerizes. The conversion occurs in hours at room temperature, but the monomer can be stored for days at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDeprotonation.\nThe compound is unusually acidic (p\"K\"a\u00a0= 16) for a hydrocarbon, a fact explained by the high stability of the aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion, C5H5\u2212. Deprotonation can be achieved with a variety of bases, typically sodium hydride, sodium metal, and butyl lithium. Salts of this anion are commercially available, including sodium cyclopentadienide and lithium cyclopentadienide. They are used to prepare cyclopentadienyl complexes.\nMetallocene derivatives.\nMetallocenes and related cyclopentadienyl derivatives have been heavily investigated and represent a cornerstone of organometallic chemistry owing to their high stability. The first metallocene characterised, ferrocene, was prepared the way many other metallocenes are prepared by combining alkali metal derivatives of the form MC5H5 with dihalides of the transition metals: As typical example, nickelocene forms upon treating nickel(II) chloride with sodium cyclopentadienide in THF.\nOrganometallic complexes that include both the cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself are known, one example of which is the rhodocene derivative produced from the rhodocene monomer in protic solvents.\nOrganic synthesis.\nIt was the starting material in Leo Paquette's 1982 synthesis of dodecahedrane. The first step involved reductive dimerization of the molecule to give dihydrofulvalene, not simple addition to give dicyclopentadiene.\nUses.\nAside from serving as a precursor to cyclopentadienyl-based catalysts, the main commercial application of cyclopentadiene is as a precursor to comonomers. Semi-hydrogenation gives cyclopentene. Diels\u2013Alder reaction with butadiene gives ethylidene norbornene, a comonomer in the production of EPDM rubbers.\nDerivatives.\nCyclopentadiene can substitute one or more hydrogens, forming derivatives having covalent bonds:\nMost of these substituted cyclopentadienes can also form anions and join cyclopentadienyl complexes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The product was envisioned as a low-cost alternative to personal computers. The Simputer project had the initial goal of selling 50,000 units, but only sold about 4,000 units by 2005, and has been called a failure by news sources.\nDesign and hardware.\nThe device was designed by the Simputer Trust, a non-profit organization formed in November 1999 by seven Indian scientists and engineers led by Dr. Swami Manohar. The word \"Simputer\" is an acronym for \"simple, inexpensive and multilingual people's computer\", and is a trademark of the Simputer Trust. The device includes text-to-speech software and runs the Linux operating system. Similar in appearance to the PalmPilot class of handheld computers, the touch sensitive screen is operated on with a stylus; simple handwriting recognition software is provided by the program Tapatap.\nThe Simputer Trust licensed two manufacturers to build the devices, Encore Software, which has also built the Mobilis for Corporate/Educational purposes and the SATHI for Defence purposes, and PicoPeta Simputers, which released a consumer product named the Amida Simputer.\nThe device features include touchscreen, smart card, Serial port, and USB connections, and an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port. It was released in both greyscale and color versions.\nSoftware.\nThe Simputer uses the Linux kernel (2.4.18 Kernel as of July 2005), and the Alchemy Window Manager (only the Amida Simputer). Software packages include: Scheduling, Calendar, Voice Recording and Playback, simple spreadsheet application, Internet and network connectivity, Web browsing and email, an e-Library, games, and support for Java ME, DotGNU (a free software implementation of .NET), and Flash.\nIn addition, both licensees developed custom applications for microbanking, traffic police, and medical applications.\nDeployments.\nIn 2004, Simputers were used by the government of Karnataka to automate the process of land records procurement. Simputers were also used in a project in Chhattisgarh for the purpose of e-education. In 2005, they were used in a variety of applications, such as automobile engine diagnostics (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra in Mumbai), tracking of iron-ore movement from mine pithead to shipping point (Dempo, Goa), Microcredit (Sanghamitra, Mysore), Electronic Money Transfer between UK and Ghana (XK8 Systems, UK), and others. In recent times, the Simputer has seen deployment by the police force to track traffic offenders and issue traffic tickets.\nCommercial production.\nPilot production of the Simputer started in September 2002. In 2004, the Amida Simputer became commercially available for \u20b912450 and up (approximately US$240). The prices for Amida Simputer vary depending on the screen type (monochrome or colour).\nBy 2006, both licensees had stopped actively marketing their Simputer devices. PicoPeta was acquired by Geodesic Information Systems (a developer of communication and collaboration systems) in 2005.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60730", "revid": "50996364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60730", "title": "Lucy Maud Montgomery", "text": "Canadian novelist (1874\u20131942)\nLucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874\u00a0\u2013 April 24, 1942), published as L. M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a collection of novels, essays, short stories, and poetry beginning in 1908 with \"Anne of Green Gables\". She published 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays. \"Anne of Green Gables\" was an immediate success; the title character, orphan Anne Shirley, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. Most of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island and those locations within Canada's smallest province became a literary landmark and popular tourist site\u2014namely Green Gables farm, the genesis of Prince Edward Island National Park.\nMontgomery's work, diaries, and letters have been read and studied by scholars and readers worldwide. The L. M. Montgomery Institute, University of Prince Edward Island, is responsible for the scholarly inquiry into the life, works, culture, and influence of Montgomery.\nEarly life and education.\nMontgomery was born in New London, Prince Edward Island, Canada, on November 30, 1874. Her mother, Clara Woolner (n\u00e9e Macneill)&lt;ref name=\"montyhistnotes/I9517\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery (1853\u20131876), died of tuberculosis (TB) when Maud was 21 months old. Stricken with grief, her father, Hugh John Montgomery (1841\u20131900), placed Maud in her maternal grandparents' custody, though he remained in the vicinity. When Maud was seven, her father moved to Prince Albert, North-West Territories (now Prince Albert, Saskatchewan). From then on Maud was raised by her grandparents, Alexander Marquis Macneill and Lucy Woolner Macneill, in the community of Cavendish, Prince Edward Island.\nMontgomery's early life in Cavendish was very lonely. Despite having relatives nearby, much of her childhood was spent alone. She created imaginary friends and worlds to cope with her loneliness, and Montgomery credited this time of her life with developing her creativity. Her imaginary friends were named Katie Maurice and Lucy Gray and lived in the \"fairy room\" behind the bookcase in the drawing room. During a church service, Montgomery asked her aunt where her dead mother was, leading her to point upwards. Montgomery saw a trap door in the church's ceiling, which led her to wonder why the minister did not just get a ladder to retrieve her mother from the church's ceiling.\nIn 1887, at age 13, Montgomery wrote in her diary that she had \"early dreams of future fame.\" She submitted a poem for publication, writing, \"I saw myself the wonder of my schoolmates\u2014 a little local celebrity.\" Upon rejection, Montgomery wrote, \"Tears of disappointment \"would\" come in spite of myself, as I crept away to hide the poor crumpled manuscript in the depths of my trunk.\" She later wrote, \"down, deep down under all the discouragement and rebuff, I knew I would 'arrive' someday.\"\nAfter completing her education in Cavendish, Montgomery spent one year (1890) in Prince Albert with her father and her stepmother, Mary Ann McRae (1863\u20131910), who had married in 1887. While she was in Prince Albert, Montgomery's first work, a poem titled \"On Cape LeForce\", was published in the Charlottetown paper \"The Daily Patriot\". She was as excited about this as she was about her return to Prince Edward Island in 1891. Before returning to Cavendish, Montgomery had another article published in the newspaper, describing her visit to a First Nations camp on the Great Plains. She often saw Blackfeet and Plains Cree in Prince Albert, writing that she saw many Indians on the Prairies who were much more handsome and attractive than those she had seen in the Maritimes.\nMontgomery's return to Cavendish was a great relief to her. Her time in Prince Albert was unhappy, for she did not get along with her stepmother. According to Montgomery, her father's marriage was not a happy one.\nIn 1893, Montgomery attended Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown to obtain a teacher's license. She loved Prince Edward Island. During solitary walks through the peaceful island countryside, Montgomery started to experience what she called \"the flash\"\u2014a moment of tranquility and clarity when she felt emotional ecstasy and was inspired by the awareness of a higher spiritual power running through nature. Montgomery's accounts of this \"flash\" were later given to the character Emily Byrd Starr in the \"Emily of New Moon\" trilogy, and also served as the basis for her descriptions of Anne Shirley's sense of emotional communion with nature. In 1905, Montgomery wrote in her journal, \"amid the commonplaces of life, I was very near to a kingdom of ideal beauty. Between it and me hung only a thin veil. I could never quite draw it aside, but sometimes a wind fluttered it. I seemed to catch a glimpse of the enchanting realm beyond\u2014only a glimpse\u2014but those glimpses had always made life worthwhile.\" A deeply spiritual woman, Montgomery found the moments when she experienced \"the flash\" some of the most beautiful, moving and intense of her life.\nMontgomery completed the two-year teaching program in Charlottetown in one year. In 1895 and 1896, she studied literature at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nWriting career, romantic interests, and family life.\nPublished books and suitors.\nUpon leaving Dalhousie, Montgomery worked as a teacher in various Prince Edward Island schools. Though she did not enjoy teaching, it afforded her time to write. Beginning in 1897, her short stories were published in magazines and newspapers. A prolific writer, Montgomery published over 100 stories between 1897 and 1907.\nDuring her teaching years, Montgomery had numerous love interests. As a highly fashionable young woman, she had \"slim, good looks\" and won the attention of several young men. In 1889, at 14, Montgomery began a relationship with a Cavendish boy, Nate Lockhart. To her, the relationship was merely a humorous and witty friendship. It ended abruptly when Montgomery refused his marriage proposal.\nThe early 1890s brought unwelcome advances from John A. Mustard and Will Pritchard. Mustard, her teacher, quickly became her suitor; he tried to impress her with his knowledge of religious matters. His best topics of conversation were his thoughts on predestination and \"other dry points of theology\", which held little appeal for Montgomery. During the period when Mustard's interest became more pronounced, Montgomery found a new interest from the brother of her friend Laura Pritchard. This friendship was more amiable, but he too felt more for Montgomery than she did for him. When Pritchard sought to take their friendship further, Montgomery resisted. She refused both marriage proposals; Mustard was too narrow-minded, and she considered Pritchard merely a good chum. She ended the period of flirtation when she moved to Prince Edward Island. She and Pritchard continued to correspond for over six years, until he died of influenza in 1897.\nIn 1897, Montgomery received a proposal from Edwin Simpson, a student in French River near Cavendish. She wrote that she accepted his proposal out of a desire for \"love and protection\" and because she felt her prospects were rather poor. Montgomery came to dislike Simpson, whom she regarded as intolerably self-centred and vain to the point of feeling nauseated in his presence. While teaching in Lower Bedeque, she had a brief but passionate affair with Herman Leard, a member of the family with which she boarded. (Leard himself was engaged to neighbour Ettie Schurman while involved with Montgomery.) Of the men she loved, it was Leard she loved the most, writing in her diary: Hermann suddenly bent his head and his lips touched my face. I cannot tell what possessed me\u2014I seemed swayed by a power utterly beyond my control\u2014I turned my head\u2014our lips met in one long passionate pressure\u2014a kiss of fire and rapture such I had never experienced or imagined. Ed's kisses at the best left me cold as ice\u2014\"Hermann's\" sent flame through every fibre of my being. On April 8, 1898, Montgomery wrote she had to stay faithful to Simpson: \"for the sake of my self respect I \"must not\" stoop to any sort of an affair with another man\". She then wrote: If I had\u2014or rather if I \"could\" have\u2014kept this resolve I would have saved myself incalculable suffering. For it was but a few days later that I found myself face to face with the burning consciousness that I \"loved\" Herman Leard with a wild, passionate, unreasoning love that dominated my entire being and possessed me like a flame\u2014a love I could neither quell nor control\u2014a love that in its intensity seemed little short of absolute madness. Madness! Yes! In Victorian Canada, premarital sex was rare for women, and Montgomery had been brought up in a strict Presbyterian household where she had been taught that all who \"fornicated\" were among the \"damned\" who burned in Hell forever, a message she had taken to heart. Despite this, she often invited Leard into her bedroom when everybody else was out, and though she refused to have sex with him, as she wanted to be a virgin bride, she and Leard engaged in kissing and \"preliminary lovemaking\". Montgomery called Leard in her diary only \"a very nice, attractive young animal!\", albeit one with \"magnetic blue eyes\".\nFollowing objections from her family and friends that Leard was not \"good enough\" for her, Montgomery broke off her relationship with him. He died shortly afterwards of the flu. In 1898, after much unhappiness and disillusionment, Montgomery broke off her engagement to Simpson. She ceased to seek romantic love. Montgomery was greatly upset when she learned of Leard's death in June 1899, writing in her diary: \"It is easier to think him as dead, mine, \"all\" mine in death, as he could never be in life, mine when no other women could ever lie on his heart or kiss his lips.\"\nIn 1898, Montgomery moved back to Cavendish to live with her widowed grandmother. For a nine-month period between 1901 and 1902, she worked in Halifax as a substitute proofreader for the newspapers \"Morning Chronicle\" and \"The Daily Echo\". Montgomery was inspired to write her first books during this time. Until her grandmother's death in March 1911, Montgomery stayed in Cavendish to take care of her. This coincided with a period of considerable income from her publications.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1908, Montgomery published her first book, \"Anne of Green Gables\". An immediate success, it established Montgomery's career, and she wrote and published material, including numerous sequels to \"Anne\", for the rest of her life. \"Anne of Green Gables\" was published in June 1908 and by November 1909 had gone through six printings. A sequel was published the following year. The Canadian press made much of Montgomery's roots on Prince Edward Island, which was portrayed as a charming part of Canada where the people retained old-fashioned values and everything moved at a much slower pace. The American press suggested that all of Canada was backward and slow, arguing that a book like \"Anne of Green Gables\" was only possible in a rustic country like Canada, where the people were nowhere near as advanced as in the U.S. Typical of the American coverage of Montgomery was a 1911 newspaper article in Boston, which asserted:Recently a new and exceedingly brilliant star arose on the literacy horizon in the person of a previously unknown writer of \"heart interest\" stories, Miss Lucy M. Montgomery, and presently the astronomers located her in the latitude of Prince Edward Island. No one would ever imagine that such a remote and unassertive speck on the map would ever produce such a writer whose first three books should one and all be included in the \"six best sellers.\" But it was on this unemotional island that \"Anne of Green Gables\" was born ... This story was the work of a modest young school teacher, who was doubtless as surprised as any of her neighbors when she found her sweetly simple tale of childish joys and sorrows of a diminutive red-haired girl who had made the literary hit of the season with the American public ...\nDespite the success of the first two \"Anne\" novels, Montgomery did not have any desire to write more featuring the character, writing in a 1910 letter:I have been flooded with letters entreating me to write a third \"Anne\" book ... but I feel as if I simply could not do it. The freshness has gone out of the \"Anne\" idea. It may return some day. But unless it does I shall never throw any further light on Anne's career. Despite her feeling the story of Anne Shirley had run its course, in 1912 she would publish a short story collection set in Avonlea (with Anne featured in one), \"Chronicles of Avonlea\", then in 1915 a third novel in the series, \"Anne of the Island\", followed by numerous others over the remainder of her life.\nIn contrast to this publisher's ideal image of her, Montgomery wrote in a letter to a friend: \"I am frankly in literature to make a living out of it.\" The British scholar Faye Hammill noted that in the books Anne is a tall girl and Montgomery was 37 at the time, which hardly made for a \"young school teacher\". Hammill also noted that the author of the piece chose to present Montgomery as the idealized female author, who was happiest in a domestic/rural environment and disliked fame and celebrity, which was seen at the time as conflicting with femininity. In emphasizing Montgomery's modesty and desire to remain anonymous, the author was portraying her as the ideal woman writer, who wanted to preserve her femininity by not embarking on a professional career, writing only a part-time job at best. At the same time, Hammill noted that the author was using the anachronistic French name for Prince Edward Island, to add to the picture of a romantic, mist-shrouded fantasy island where the old ways of life continued \"unspoiled\", just as Montgomery was portrayed as an \"unspoiled\" woman.\nShortly after her grandmother's death in 1911, Montgomery married Ewen (spelled in her notes and letters as \"Ewan\") Macdonald (1870\u20131943), a Presbyterian minister, and they moved to Ontario, where he had taken the position of minister of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Leaskdale in present-day Uxbridge Township, also affiliated with the congregation in nearby Zephyr. Montgomery wrote her next 11 books from the Leaskdale manse; she complained that it had neither a bathroom nor a toilet. The congregation later sold the structure, which is now the Leaskdale Manse National Historic Site. Macdonald was not especially intelligent, nor was he interested in literature. Montgomery wrote in her diary: \"I would not want him for a lover but I hope at first that I might find a friend in him.\" After their marriage, they honeymooned in England and Scotland; the latter was a particular point of interest to her, as it was for her the \"Old Country\"\u2014the romantic land of castles, rugged mountains, shining glens, lakes and waterfalls that was her ancestral homeland.\nBy contrast, Macdonald's parents had come to Canada after being evicted in the Highland Clearances, and he had no desire to visit the \"Old Country\". His wife had to drag him to the Isle of Skye, the home of the Clan Macdonald, where the Macdonalds had once reigned as the Lords of the Isles. The Macdonalds had been Scots-Gaelic-speaking Highlanders, while the Montgomerys and Macneils had been English-speaking Lowlanders, which might explain the differing attitudes the couple held toward Scotland, as Montgomery was more proud of her Scottish heritage than her husband. In England, Montgomery visited places associated with her favorite writers, going to the Lake District made famous by William Wordsworth, to William Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon, and to the Haworth house in the Yorkshire moors where the Bront\u00ebs (Anne, Charlotte, Emily and Branwell) had lived.\nThe Macdonalds had three sons; the second was stillborn. Montgomery believed it was her duty as a woman to make her marriage work, though, during a visit to Scotland, she quipped to a reporter, \"Those women whom God wanted to destroy He would make into the wives of ministers.\" The great increase of Montgomery's writings in Leaskdale is the result of her need to escape the hardships of real life. In 1909\u201310, Montgomery drew upon her Scottish-Canadian heritage and her memories of her teenage years to write her 1911 novel \"The Story Girl\". Her youth had been spent among a Scottish-Canadian family where Scottish tales, myths, and legends had often been recounted, and Montgomery used this background to create the character of 14-year-old Sara Stanley, a skilled storyteller who was an \"idealized\" version of her adolescent self. The character of Peter Craig in \"The Story Girl\" very much resembles Herman Leard, the great love of Montgomery's life, the man she wished she had married, but did not, right down to having blond curly hair. As with her relationship with Leard, the other characters object to the lower-class Craig as not being \"good enough\", but Felicity King chooses him anyway.\nWorld War I.\nDuring the First World War, Montgomery, horrified by reports of the \"Rape of Belgium\" in 1914, was an intense supporter of the war effort, seeing the war as a crusade to save civilization, regularly writing articles urging men to volunteer for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and for people on the home front to buy victory bonds. Montgomery wrote in her diary on September 12, 1914, about the reports of the \"Rape of Belgium\":But oh, there have been such hideous stories in the papers lately of their cutting off the hands of little children in Belgium. Can they be true? They have committed terrible outrages and crimes, that is too surely true, but I hope desperately that these stories of the mutilation of children are false. They harrow my soul. I walk the floor in my agony over them. I cry myself to sleep about them and wake again in the darkness to cringe with the horror of it. If it were Chester! In Leaskdale, like everywhere else in Canada, recruiting meetings were held where ministers, such as the Reverend Macdonald, would speak of Kaiser Wilhelm II as the personification of evil, described the \"Rape of Belgium\" in graphic detail, and asked for young men to step up to volunteer to fight for Canada, the British Empire, and for justice, in what was described at the time as a crusade against evil. In a 1915 essay appealing for volunteers, Montgomery wrote: \"I am not one of those who believe that this war will put an end to war. War is horrible, but there are things that are more horrible still, just as there are fates worse than death.\" Montgomery argued prior to the war that Canada had been slipping into atheism, materialism and \"moral decay\", and the war had brought about a welcome revival of Christianity, patriotism and moral strength as the Canadian people faced the challenge of the greatest war yet fought in history. Montgomery ended her essay by stating that women on the home front were playing a crucial role in the war effort, which led her to ask for women's suffrage. On October 7, 1915, Montgomery gave birth to her third child and was thrown into depression when she discovered she could not produce breast milk to feed her son, who was given cow's milk instead, which was a health risk in the days before pasteurization.\nMontgomery identified very strongly with the Allied cause, leading her on March 10, 1916, to write in her diary: \"All my misery seemed to centre around Verdun where the snow was no longer white. I seemed in my own soul to embrace all the anguish and strain of France.\" In the same diary entry, Montgomery wrote of a strange experience, \"a great calm seemed to descend upon me and envelop me. I was at peace. The conviction seized upon me that Verdun was safe-that the Germans would not pass the grim barrier of desperate France. I was as a woman from whom some evil spirit had been driven-or can it be as a priestess of old, who out of depths of agony wins some strange foresight of the future?\" Montgomery celebrated every Allied victory at her house, for instance running up the Russian flag when she heard that the Russians had captured the supposedly impregnable Ottoman city-fortress of Trebizond in April 1916. Every Allied defeat depressed her. When she heard of the fall of Kut-al-Amara, she wrote in her diary on May 1, 1916: \"Kut-el-Amara has been compelled to surrender at last. We have expected it for some time, but that did not prevent us from feeling very blue over it all. It is an encouragement to the Germans and a blow to Britain's prestige. I feel too depressed tonight to do anything.\" Much to Montgomery's disgust, Ewen refused to preach about the war. As it went on, Maud wrote in her diary \"it unsettles him and he cannot do his work properly.\" The Reverend Macdonald had developed doubts about the justice of the war as it went along, and had come to believe that by encouraging young men to enlist, he had sinned grievously.\nMontgomery, a deeply religious woman, wrote in her diary: \"I believe in a God who is good, but not omnipotent. I also believe in a principle of Evil, equal to God in power ... darkness to His light. I believe an infinite ceaseless struggle goes on between them.\" In a letter, Montgomery dismissed Kaiser Wilhelm II's claim that God was on the side of Germany, stating that the power responsible for the death of \"little Hugh\" (her stillborn son) was the same power responsible for the \"Rape of Belgium\", and for this reason she believed the Allies were destined to win the war. Montgomery had worked as a Sunday School teacher at her husband's church, and many of the men from Uxbridge county who were killed or wounded in the war had once been her students, causing her much emotional distress. Uxbridge county lost 21 men in the Great War from 1915, when Canadian troops first saw action at the Second Battle of Ypres, until the war's end in 1918. Montgomery's biographer Mary Henley Rubio observed: \"Increasingly, the war was all that she thought of and wanted to talk about. Her journals show she was absolutely consumed by it, wracked by it, tortured by it, obsessed by it -- even addicted to it.\" Montgomery was sometimes annoyed if her husband did not buy a daily newspaper from the corner store because she always wanted to read the latest war news.\nBattles with depression and the Spanish flu.\nMontgomery underwent several periods of depression while trying to cope with the duties of motherhood and church life and with her husband's attacks of religious melancholia (endogenous major depressive disorder) and deteriorating health: \"For a woman who had given the world so much joy, life was mostly an unhappy one.\" In 1918, Montgomery was stricken with the Spanish flu. Bedridden for ten days, she almost died. The pandemic killed between 50 and 100 million people all over the world in 1918\u20131919. In her diary on December 1, 1918, Montgomery wrote after a visit to Toronto in November: \"Toronto was then beginning to be panic stricken over the outbreak of the terrible 'Spanish flu'. The drug counters were besieged with frantic people seeking remedies and safeguards\". Montgomery wrote, \"I was in bed for ten days. I never felt so sick or weak in my life\", going on to express thanks to God and her friends for helping her survive the ordeal. Montgomery's best friend, Frederica Campbell MacFarlane, was not so lucky and died after contracting the Spanish flu on January 20, 1919.\nAfter the First World War, a recurring character in Montgomery's journal that was to obsess her for the rest of her life was \"the Piper\", who at first appeared as a heroic Highlander piper from Scotland, leading men into battle while playing traditional Highland tunes, but who turned out to be the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a trickster taking children away from their parents forever. The figure of \"the Piper\" reflected Montgomery's own disillusionment with World War I and her guilt at her ardent support for the war. To inspire men to volunteer for the war, a piper had marched through the centre of Leaskdale daily for all four years of World War I, playing Highland war tunes, which had given Montgomery the inspiration of the figure of \"the Piper\", \"The Piper\" first appears in the Anne books in \"Rainbow Valley\" (1919), inspiring the future grown children of Glen St. Mary with his courage. In \"Rilla of Ingleside\" (1921), \"the Piper\" returns as a more sinister figure, inspiring Anne's son Walter to enlist in the Canadian expeditionary force, while taking on the appearance and personality of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\nAfter the end of the Great War and the death of their mutual close friend, Frederica, Ewen Macdonald suffered a nervous breakdown and was never the person he had been before 1919. The Reverend Ewen Macdonald, a good Calvinist who believed in predestination, had become convinced that he was not one of \"the Elect\" chosen by God to go to Heaven, leading him to spend hours depressed and staring into space. The Reverend Macdonald told his wife that during his episodes of depression, he wished she and their children had never been born as they were also not of \"the Elect\", and all of them were going to Hell when they died as he believed that they were all predestined to be among the \"damned.\" Macdonald refused to assist with raising the children or the housework, and was given over to erratic, reckless driving as if he was deliberately trying to get himself killed in a car crash, as perhaps he was. Montgomery herself was driven to depression by her husband's conduct, often writing that she wished she had married somebody else. Montgomery wrote in her diary that she could not stand looking at her husband's face, when he had that \"horrible imbecile expression on his face\" as he stared blankly into space for hours.\nIn February 1920, Montgomery wrote in her diary about having to deal with this:A letter from some pathetic ten-year old in New York who implores me to send her my photo because she lies awake in her bed wondering what I look like. Well, if she had a picture of me in my old dress, wresting with the furniture this morning, \"cussing\" the ashes and clinkers, she would die of disillusionment. However, I shall send her a reprint of my last photo in which I sat in rapt inspiration\u2014apparently\u2014at my desk, with pen in my hand, in gown of lace and silk with hair so\u2014Amen. A quite passable woman, of no kin whatever to the dusty, ash-covered Cinderella of the furnace-cellar. For much of her life, writing was her one great solace. In 1920, Montgomery wrote in her diary a quotation from the South African writer Olive Schreiner's book \"The Story of an African Farm,\" which defined different types of love, including a \"love without wisdom, sweet as life, bitter as death, lasting only a hour\", leading her to write: \"But it is worth having lived a whole life for that hour.\" (emphasis in the original). Montgomery concluded:My love for Hermann Leard, though so incomplete, is ... a memory which I would not barter for anything save the lives of my children and the return of Frede [Frederica Campbell MacFarlane, her best friend]. Montgomery believed her spells of depression and the migraine headaches from which she suffered were both expressions of her suppressed romantic passions and Leard's ghost haunting her.\nPublishing disputes and films.\nStarting in 1917, Montgomery was engaged in five bitter, costly, and burdensome lawsuits with Louis Coues Page, owner of the publishing house L.C. Page &amp; Company, that continued until she finally won in 1928. Page had a well-deserved reputation as one of the most tyrannical figures in American publishing, a bully with a ferocious temper who signed his authors to exploitative contracts and in public, liked to humiliate his subordinates, including his mild-mannered younger brother George. Montgomery received 7 cents on the dollar on the sale of every one of the \"Anne\" books, instead of the 19 cents on the dollar that she was entitled to, which led her to switch publishers in 1917 when she finally discovered that Page was cheating her. When Montgomery left the firm of L.C. Page &amp; Company, Page demanded she sign over the American rights to \"Anne's House of Dreams\", and when she refused he cut off the royalties from the earlier \"Anne\" books. Even though he did not own the U.S. rights to \"Anne's House of Dreams\", Page sold those rights to the disreputable publishing house of Grosset &amp; Dunlap, as a way of creating more pressure on Montgomery to capitulate. Instead, Montgomery sued Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Page was counting on the fact that he was a millionaire and Montgomery was not, and that the prospect of having to spend thousands in legal fees would force her to give in. Much to his surprise, she did not. Montgomery hired a lawyer in Boston and sued Page in the Massachusetts Court of Equity for illegally withholding royalties due her and for selling the U.S. rights to \"Anne's House of Dreams\", which he did not possess.\nIn 1920, the house where Montgomery grew up in Cavendish was torn down by her uncle, who complained that too many tourists were coming on to the property to see the house that inspired that in which Anne was depicted as growing up. Montgomery was very sentimental about that house, and the news of its destruction caused her great pain. Between May and July 1920, Montgomery was in Boston to attend court sessions with Page, who taunted her by telling her the \"Anne\" books were still selling well, making him millions.\nIn 1920, Montgomery was infuriated with the 1919 film version of \"Anne of Green Gables\" for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary: It was a pretty little play well photographed, but I think if I hadn't already known it was from my book, that I would never have recognized it. The landscape and folks were 'New England', never P.E. Island ... A skunk and an American flag were introduced\u2014both equally unknown in PE Island. I could have shrieked with rage over the latter. Such crass, blatant Yankeeism! Reporting on the film's premiere in Los Angeles, one American journalist described \"Anne of Green Gables\" as written by a \"Mr. Montgomery\", who is only mentioned in passing, two-thirds of the way into the article with the major focus being on the film's star Mary Miles Minter, who was presented as the true embodiment of Anne. Montgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she portrayed \"a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingery Anne\" and complained about a scene in the film where Anne used a shotgun to threaten people with, writing that her Anne would never do such a thing. Montgomery had no say in either the 1919 or 1934 versions of \"Anne of Green Gables.\" The publisher, L.C. Page had acquired the film rights to the story in 1908, and as such, all of the royalties paid by Hollywood for both versions of \"Anne of Green Gables\" went to him, not Montgomery. Montgomery stopped writing about Anne in about 1920, writing in her journal that she had tired of the character. By February 1921, Montgomery estimated that she had made about $100,000 from the sales of the Anne books while declaring in her diary: \"It's a pity it doesn't buy happiness.\" She preferred instead to create books about other young, female characters, feeling that her strength was writing about characters who were either very young or very old. Other series written by Montgomery include the \"Emily\" and \"Pat\" books, which, while successful, did not reach the same level of public acceptance as the \"Anne\" volumes. She also wrote a number of stand-alone novels, which were also generally successful, if not as successful as her Anne books.\nOn August 20, 1921, Montgomery started writing what became the novel \"Emily of New Moon\", as she planned to replace Anne with Emily as the star of a new series of novels. The character Emily was partly autobiographical, as Emily's dream was to be a writer when she grew up. Unlike Anne, who does not have clear goals about what she wants to be when she grows up, Emily Starr knows she wants to be a writer, a characteristic she shared with Montgomery. One aspect that Emily, Anne and Montgomery all shared was \"the flash\"\u2014the mystical power that Montgomery called in \"Emily of New Moon\" \"the wonderful moment when the soul seemed to cast aside the bonds of the flesh and spring upward towards the stars,\" allowing the soul to see \"behind the veil\" to a transcendent beauty.\nIn 1925, a Massachusetts court ruled in favour of Montgomery against her publisher, Louis Coues Page, as the judge found that he had systematically cheated her out of the profits from the \"Anne\" books since 1908. Page used every conceivable excuse to avoid paying Montgomery what he owed her and, after his brother George died of a heart attack in 1927, accused Montgomery of causing his brother's death by suing him for shares of the royalties. In fact, Louis Page was not close to George, who had just left the firm of L.C. Page &amp; Company to get away from his abrasive and arrogant brother before he died of a heart attack at age 52. In October 1928, Montgomery finally won while Page, continued to insist in public that she had caused the death of his brother, which he used as a reason why he should not have to pay Montgomery anything. Page waged a campaign of harassment against Montgomery, sending her telegrams accusing her of causing his brother's death and the subsequent mental breakdown of his widow by defeating him in court, asking her if she was pleased with what she had allegedly done. Page's behavior badly damaged his business, as no author chose to go with a publisher who had revealed himself to be both dishonest and vindictive, and after the 1920s Page's publishing house largely depended upon the reissuing older books rather than new ones as authors took their business elsewhere. On November 7, 1928, Montgomery received a cheque for the $15,000 US dollars, the amount that the auditors established Page had cheated her.\nIn terms of sales, both in her lifetime and since, Montgomery was the most successful Canadian author of all time, but because her books were seen as children's books and as women's books, she was often dismissed by the critics, who saw Montgomery as merely a writer for schoolgirls, and not as a serious writer. In 1924, the \"Maple Leaf\" magazine asked its readers to nominate the 14 greatest living Canadians, and all of the winners were men. Montgomery only made the runners-up, coming in at 16. However, Montgomery did make it onto another list of the 12\u00a0greatest living Canadian women. Hammill argued that Montgomery was successful at managing her fame, but the media's fixation on presenting her as the idealised woman writer, together with her desire to hide her unhappy home life with her husband, meant that her creation Anne, whose \"life\" was more \"knowable\" and easier to relate to, overshadowed her both in her lifetime and after.\nLater life.\nIn 1925, Ewen Macdonald became estranged from his flock when he opposed his church's joining the United Church of Canada, and was involved in an incident where he nearly ran over a Methodist minister who was promoting the union. Montgomery, as the minister's wife, had been a prominent member of the Leaskdale community and had been a much-loved figure who organized community events. Rubio wrote the people of Leaskdale \"liked\" the Reverend Macdonald, but \"loved\" Montgomery. At the same time, she complained in her diary that her husband had a \"medieval mind\" when it came to women; to him: \"A woman is a thing of no importance intellectually -- the plaything and servant of man -- and couldn't possibly do anything that would be worthy of a real tribute.\"\nIn 1926, the family moved into the Norval Presbyterian Charge in present-day Halton Hills, Ontario, where today the \"Lucy Maud Montgomery Memorial Garden\" can be seen from Highway 7. The Norval Presbyterian Church closed in February 2024, and is now an Indian congregation of the Oriental Orthodox faith: . In 1934, Montgomery's extremely depressed husband signed himself into a sanatorium in Guelph. After his release, a pharmacy gave Montgomery a \"blue pill\" intended to treat her husband's depression that was accidentally laced with insecticide (a mistake on the part of the drug store clerk) that almost killed him. The Reverend Macdonald became notably paranoid after this incident, as his mental health continued to deteriorate.\nIn 1933, Montgomery published \"Pat of Silver Bush\", which reflected a move towards more \"adult\" stories for young people. Unlike Anne with her sense of optimism and vibrancy, Pat is a \"queer\" moody girl who is noted for being a \"loner\". Pat's best friend, Elizabeth \"Bets\" Wilcox, dies of the Spanish flu, giving the book a darker tone than Montgomery's previous books. In a letter to a fan in 1934 who complained about the dark mood of \"Pat of Silver Bush\", Montgomery replied: \"I gave Anne my imagination and Emily Starr my knack for scribbling; but the girl who is more myself than any other is 'Pat of Silver Bush' ... Not \"externally\", but spiritually she is I\". Pat's deep attachment to the countryside of Prince Edward Island, especially her family farm, Silver Bush, mirrored Montgomery's own attachment to the countryside of her home province, and the farm that she grew up on.\nIn 1935, upon her husband's retirement, Montgomery moved to Swansea, Ontario, then a suburb of Toronto (it has now been annexed into the city proper). She purchased a house that she named Journey's End, situated on Riverside Drive along the east bank of the Humber River, where she continued to write; in addition to writing other material, she returned to writing about Anne after a 15-year hiatus, filling in previously unexplored gaps in the chronology she had developed for the character. She published \"Anne of Windy Poplars\" in 1936 and \"Anne of Ingleside\" in 1939. \"Jane of Lantern Hill\", a non-Anne novel, was also composed around this time and published in 1937. On June 3, 1935 (1935 Birthday Honours), King George V named Montgomery an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and on September 8, 1935, at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, the ceremony of investiture into the Order was held with the Governor-General, Lord Bessborough, conducting the ceremony. As an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Montgomery was given a special badge and ribbon, which could only be worn in public in the presence of the King or one of his representatives, such as the Governor-General of Canada. Her husband did not attend the ceremony, but Montgomery was by all accounts greatly honoured to be appointed an OBE.\nWriting kept up Montgomery's spirits as she battled depression while taking various pills to improve her mood, but in public she presented a happy, smiling face, giving speeches to various professional groups all over Canada. At the Toronto Book Fair, held on November 9, 1936, to promote Canadian literature, Montgomery met the pseudo-Ojibwe author and environmentalist Grey Owl. During her speech to the assembled authors, Montgomery spoke of hearing an \"owl's laughter\" in Leaskdale, causing Grey Owl to jump up and interrupt her, saying: \"You are the first white person I have ever met who has heard an owl's laughter. I thought nobody but Indians ever heard it. We hear it often because we are a silent race. My full name is Laughing Grey Owl.\" Grey Owl's remark made the front page of \"The Toronto Mail and Empire\" newspaper the next day. Montgomery described Grey Owl in her diary: \"Grey Owl was looking quite the Indian of romance, with his long black braids of hair, his feather headdress and a genuine scalping knife -- at least he told us it was genuine.\" Montgomery liked Grey Owl's speech the same evening, stating that Canada's \"greatest asset is her forest lands\" and that most Canadians were too proud of \"skyscrapers on Yonge Street\" rather than the \"natural resources we are destroying as fast as we can\". After Grey Owl's death in 1938, and the revelation that the supposed Ojibwe was actually the Englishman Archie Belaney, Montgomery stated that though Belaney lied about being an Ojibwe, his concerns for the environment, nature, and animals were real, and for this reason Grey Owl's message was worth cherishing.\nOn November 10, 1937, Montgomery gave a speech in Toronto at another annual gathering of the Toronto Book Fair, calling for Canadian writers to write more stories about Canada, arguing that Canadians had great stories worth writing. Despite her efforts to raise the profile of Canadian literature through the Canadian Authors Association, the male \"avant garde\" of Canadian literature led by Frederick Philip Grove, F. R. Scott, Morley Callaghan and Raymond Knister complained about the mostly female membership of the CAA, whom they felt had overly glorified someone like Montgomery who was not a \"serious\" writer. Over time, Montgomery became addicted to bromides and barbiturates that the doctors had given her to help treat her depression.\nMontgomery was greatly upset by World War II, calling the war in a 1940 letter \"this nightmare that has been loosed on the world... unfair that we should have to go through it again.\" In her only diary entry for 1941, Montgomery wrote on July 8, 1941: \"Oh God, such an end to life. Such suffering and wretchedness.\" On December 28, 1941, Montgomery wrote to a friend: \"This past year has been one of constant blows to me. My oldest son has made a mess of his life and his wife has left him. My husband's nerves are even worse than mine. I have kept the nature of his attacks from you for over 20 years but they have broken me at last ... I could not go out to select a book for you this year. Pardon me. I could not even write this if I had not been a hypodermic. The war situation kills me along with many other things. I expect conscription will come in and they will take my second son and then I will give up all effort to recover because I shall have nothing to live for.\" In 1940, the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King introduced conscription under the National Resources Mobilization Act, but with the caveat that conscripts could only be used in the defence of North America, and only volunteers would be sent overseas, but Mackenzie King scheduled a referendum for April 27, 1942, to ask the voters to release him from his promise to only send volunteers overseas. Montgomery alluded to this in her letter mentioning \"conscription will come in.\" In her last entry in her diary on March 23, 1942, Montgomery wrote: \"Since then my life has been hell, hell, hell. My mind is gone\u2014everything in the world I lived for has gone\u2013the world has gone mad. I shall be driven to end my life. Oh God, forgive me. Nobody dreams of what my awful position is.\"\nIn the last year of her life, Montgomery completed what she intended to be a ninth book featuring Anne, titled \"The Blythes Are Quoted\". It included fifteen short stories (many of which were previously published) that she revised to include Anne and her family as mainly peripheral characters; forty-one poems (most of which were previously published) that she attributed to Anne and to her son Walter, who died as a soldier in the Great War; and vignettes featuring the Blythe family members discussing the poems. The book was delivered to Montgomery's publisher on the day of her death, but for reasons unexplained, the publisher declined to issue the book at the time. Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre speculates that the book's dark tone and anti-war message (Anne speaks very bitterly of WWI in one passage) may have made the volume unsuitable to publish in the midst of the Second World War.\nAn abridged version of this book, which shortened and reorganized the stories and omitted all the vignettes and all but one of the poems, was published as a collection of short stories called \"The Road to Yesterday\" in 1974, more than 30 years after the original work had been submitted. A complete edition of \"The Blythes Are Quoted\", edited by Benjamin Lefebvre, was finally published in its entirety by Viking Canada in October 2009, more than 67 years after it was composed.\nDeath.\nOn April 24, 1942, Montgomery was found dead in her bed in her Toronto home. The primary cause of death recorded on her death certificate was coronary thrombosis. However, in September 2008, her granddaughter, Kate Macdonald Butler, revealed that Montgomery suffered from depression\u2014possibly as a result of caring for her mentally ill husband for decades\u2014and may have ended her life through a drug overdose.\nA note was found on Montgomery's bedside table, which read, in part:\n... I have lost my mind by spells and I do not dare think what I may do in those spells. May God forgive me and I hope everyone else will forgive me even if they cannot understand. My position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best.\u200a\nAn alternative explanation of this document is provided in Mary Henley Rubio's 2008 biography \"Lucy Maud Montgomery: The Gift of Wings\", which suggests that Montgomery may have intended it as an entry in part of a journal now lost, rather than a suicide note.\nMontgomery was buried at the Cavendish Community Cemetery in Cavendish following her wake in the Green Gables farmhouse and funeral in the Cavendish United Church (formerly Cavendish Presbyterian Church).\nDuring her lifetime, Montgomery had published twenty novels, over 500 short stories, an autobiography, and a book of poetry. Aware of her fame, by 1920 Montgomery began editing and recopying her journals, presenting her life as she wanted it remembered. In doing so, certain episodes were changed or omitted.\nLegacy.\nPosthumous short story compilations.\nSince the late 1970s - and in earnest since the publication of \"Akin to Anne\" in 1988 - dozens of Montgomery's short stories, many of which were only published once in magazine format in the early 20th century and unavailable in the decades that followed, have been compiled into a variety of themed omnibuses. Examples include \"Akin to Anne\" (stories about other orphans separate from Anne Shirley), \"Among the Shadows\" (dark tales), \"At the Altar\" (marriage-themed stories), \"Along the Sea\" (stories with a maritime theme) and a collection of Christmas-related pieces.\nCollections.\nThe L. M. Montgomery Institute, founded in 1993, at the University of Prince Edward Island, promotes scholarly inquiry into the life, works, culture, and influence of L. M. Montgomery and coordinates most of the research and conferences surrounding her work. The Montgomery Institute collection consists of novels, manuscripts, texts, letters, photographs, sound recordings and artifacts and other Montgomery ephemera.\nHer major collections (including personal journals, photographs, needlework, two book manuscripts, and her personal library) are archived in the McLaughlin Library's Archival and Special Collections at the University of Guelph.\nThe first biography of Montgomery was \"The Wheel of Things: A Biography of L. M. Montgomery\" (1975), written by Mollie Gillen. Dr. Gillen also discovered over 40 of Montgomery's letters to her pen-friend George Boyd MacMillan in Scotland and used them as the basis for her work. Beginning in the 1980s, her complete journals, edited by Mary Rubio and Elizabeth Waterston, were published by the Oxford University Press. From 1988 to 1995, editor Rea Wilmshurst collected and published numerous short stories by Montgomery. Most of her essays, along with interviews with Montgomery, commentary on her work, and coverage of her death and funeral, appear in Benjamin Lefebvre's \"The L. M. Montgomery Reader\", Volume 1: \"A Life in Print\" (2013).\nDespite the fact that Montgomery published over twenty books, \"she never felt she achieved her one 'great' book.\" Her readership, however, has always found her characters and stories to be among the best in fiction. Mark Twain said Montgomery's Anne was \"the dearest and most moving and delightful child since the immortal Alice.\" Montgomery was honoured by being the first female in Canada to be named a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was invested Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.\nHowever, her fame was not limited to Canadian audiences. \"Anne of Green Gables\" became a success worldwide. For example, every year, thousands of Japanese tourists \"make a pilgrimage to a green-gabled Victorian farmhouse in the town of Cavendish on Prince Edward Island.\" In 2012, the original novel \"Anne of Green Gables\" was ranked number nine among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\", a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. The British public ranked it number 41 among all novels in The Big Read, a 2003 BBC survey to determine the \"nation's best-loved novel.\" The British scholar Faye Hammill observed that Montgomery as an author is overshadowed by her creation; licence plates on Prince Edward Island bear the slogan \"P.E.I. Home of Anne of Green Gables\" rather than \"P.E.I. Birthplace of L.M Montgomery. Much to Montgomery's own annoyance, the media in both the United States and Canada tried to project the personality of Anne Shirley onto her.\nLandmarked places.\nMontgomery's home, the Leaskdale Manse in Ontario, including the area surrounding Green Gables, and her Cavendish home on Prince Edward Island, have both been designated National Historic Sites. Montgomery herself was designated a Person of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada in 1943.\nBala's Museum in Bala, Ontario, is a house museum established in 1992. Officially it is \"Bala's Museum with Memories of Lucy Maud Montgomery\", for Montgomery and her family ate their meals in the boarding house while staying at another boarding house nearby during a July 1922 holiday that inspired her novel \"The Blue Castle\" (1926). The museum hosts some events pertaining to Montgomery or her fiction, including a re-enactment of the holiday visit.\nHonours and awards.\nMontgomery was honoured by King George V as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1935 Birthday Honours; there were no Canadian orders, decorations or medals for civilians until the 1970s.\nMontgomery was named a National Historic Person in 1943 by the Canadian federal governmenthttps://. Her Ontario residence was designated a National Historic Site in 1997 (Leaskdale Manse), while the place that inspired her famous novels, Green Gables, was formally recognized as \"L. M. Montgomery's Cavendish National Historic Site\" in 2004.\nOn May 15, 1975, the Post Office Department issued a stamp to \"Lucy Maud Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables\" designed by Peter Swan and typographed by Bernard N. J. Reilander. The 8\u00a2 stamps are perforated 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.\nA pair of stamps was issued in 2008 by Canada Post, marking the centennial of the publication of Montgomery's classic first novel.\nThe City of Toronto named a park for her (Lucy Maud Montgomery Park) and in 1983 placed a historical marker there near the house where she lived from 1935 until her death in 1942.\nOn November 30, 2015 (her 141st birthday), Google honoured Montgomery with a Google Doodle published in twelve countries.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint issued a commemorative loonie to celebrate Montgomery's 150th birthday. The coin features artwork by Brenda Jones of Montgomery and Anne Shirley, Montgomery's most famous character. The coin was unveiled June 26, 2024 and began circulation on June 27, 2024.\nDisputes over royalties intellectual property rights.\nThere have been multiple adaptations of Montgomery's work. Television producer Kevin Sullivan negotiated permission with Montgomery's heirs prior to producing the popular 1985 miniseries \"Anne of Green Gables\", and several sequels, only to have multiple legal disputes with them. In 1999 Sullivan and his partners announced plans to make Sullivan Entertainment a publicly traded company. In their prospectus they described the works based on Montgomery's novels as profitable. Montgomery's heirs sued him, claiming he had not paid them their contracted share of royalties, claiming the films had failed to turn a profit. However, a settlement for the outstanding Anne of Green Gables lawsuit between Sullivan, the Montgomery heirs and the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority (AGGLA) was reached in 2006 to deal with the outstanding disagreements.\nIn popular culture.\nAlison Louder portrays Montgomery in episode 12 of season 9 \"Unlucky In Love\" (February 1, 2016) and in episode 3 of season 16 \"The Write Stuff\" (September 26, 2022) of the Canadian television period detective series Murdoch Mysteries. Writer Candace Amarante voiced L.M. Montgomery for 5 episodes of the podcast mini-series \"https://,\" produced by Knockabout Media and distributed by Acast (December 26, 2024).\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nTexts and collections\nOrganizations\nOthers"}
{"id": "60731", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60731", "title": "Anachronism", "text": "Chronological inconsistency\nAn anachronism (from the Greek , 'against' and , 'time') is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.\nAn anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used intentionally for purposes of rhetoric, propaganda, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, terminology and language, customs and attitudes, or even fashions between different historical periods and eras.\nTypes.\nThe metachronism-prochronism contrast is nearly synonymous with parachronism-anachronism, and involves postdating-predating respectively.3\nParachronism.\nA parachronism (from the Greek , \"on the side\", and , \"time\") postdates.9 It is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).\nThis may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era. They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate. They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion or idioms.\nProchronism.\nA prochronism (from the Greek , \"before\", and , \"time\") predates.7 It is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time. A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved or bred, or use of a technology that had not yet been created.\nMetachronism.\nA metachronism (from the Greek , \"after\", and , \"time\") postdates.7 It is the use of older cultural artifacts in modern settings which may seem inappropriate. For example, it could be considered metachronistic for a modern-day person to be depicted wearing a top hat or writing with a quill.\nPolitically motivated anachronism.\nWorks of art and literature promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause may use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is, or otherwise intentionally blur the distinctions between past and present. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter Constantin Lecca depicts the peace agreement between Ioan Bogdan Voievod and Radu Voievod\u2014two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history\u2014with the flags of Moldavia (blue-red) and of Wallachia (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s: anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia into the Kingdom of Romania at the time the painting was made. \nArt and literature.\nAnachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. Anachronisms may be the unintentional result of ignorance, or may be a deliberate aesthetic choice.\nSir Walter Scott justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: \"It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in.\" However, as fashions, conventions and technologies move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. \"Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period\", writes Anthony Grafton; \"Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! Ludwig van Beethoven! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker.\"\nIt is only since the beginning of the 19th century that anachronistic deviations from historical reality have jarred on a general audience. C. S. Lewis wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All medieval narratives about the past are ... lacking in a sense of period... It was known that Adam went naked till he fell. After that, [medieval people] pictured the whole past in terms of their own age. So indeed did the Elizabethans. So did Milton; he never doubted that \"capon and white broth\" would have been as familiar to Christ and the disciples as to himself. It is doubtful whether the sense of period is much older than the Waverley novels. It is hardly present in Gibbon. Walpole's \"Otranto\", which would not now deceive schoolchildren, could hope, not quite vainly, to deceive the public of 1765. Where even the most obvious and superficial distinctions between one century (or millennium) and another were ignored, the profounder differences of temper and mental climate were naturally not dreamed of... [In Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\"], [t]he manners, the fighting, the religious services, the very traffic-regulations of his Trojans, are fourteenth-century.\nAnachronisms abound in the works of Raphael and Shakespeare, as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Carol Meyers says that anachronisms in ancient texts can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents. Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as the belief that Roman legionaries wore leather armor.\nComical anachronism.\nComedy fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.\nFuture anachronism.\nEven with careful research, science fiction writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political, social, and technological change.\nFor example, many books, television shows, radio productions and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the Soviet Union, to Saint Petersburg in Russia as Leningrad, to the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs and to divided Germany and divided Berlin. \"Star Trek\" has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of \"retconning\" these errors, the 2009 film retained them for consistency with older franchises.\nBuildings or natural features, such as the World Trade Center in New York City, can become out of place once they disappear, with some works having been edited to remove the World Trade Center to avoid this situation.\nFuturistic technology may appear alongside technology which would be obsolete by the time in which the story is set. For example, in the stories of Robert A. Heinlein, interplanetary space travel coexists with calculation using slide rules.\nLanguage anachronism.\nLanguage anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional. Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, audiences willingly accept characters speaking an updated language, and modern slang and figures of speech are often used in these films.\nUnconscious anachronism.\nUnintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the perspectives of historical recorders are conditioned by the assumptions and practices of their own times, in a form of cultural bias. One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various medieval tomb effigies and figures in stained glass in records made by English antiquaries of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have unconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which they were rare.\nIn academia.\nIn historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as presentism. Empiricist historians, working in the traditions established by Leopold von Ranke in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided. Arthur Marwick has argued that \"a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know\" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that \"anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history\".\nDetection of forgery.\nThe ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. Anthony Grafton discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher Porphyry, of Isaac Casaubon (1559\u20131614), and of Richard Reitzenstein (1861\u20131931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the \"Hermetic Corpus\", through \u2013 among other techniques \u2013 the recognition of anachronisms. The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of diplomatics, the critical analysis of the forms and language of documents, developed by the Maurist scholar Jean Mabillon (1632\u20131707) and his successors Ren\u00e9-Prosper Tassin (1697\u20131777) and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Toustain (1700\u20131754). The philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... \"The mention of posterior facts;\" \u2013 first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;\nIn a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... \"The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;\" \u2013 second indication of forgery.\nExamples are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First used by the Czechs in Bohemia in the 15th century, it was the title of the second-highest military commander after the king in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 16th to 18th centuries. Hetman was also the title of the head of the Cossack state in Ukraine after the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648. Throughout much of the history of Romania and Moldavia, hetmans were the second-highest army rank. In the modern Czech Republic, the title is used for regional governors.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"hetman\" was a Polish borrowing, most likely stemming via Czech from the Turkic title \"ataman\" (literally 'father of horsemen'), however it could also come from the German \u2013 lit. captain. Since hetman as a title first appeared in Czechia in the 15th century, assuming it stems from a Turkic language, it is possible it was introduced to Czechs by the Cumans.\nHetmans of Poland and Lithuania.\nThe Polish title \"Grand Crown Hetman\" () dates from 1505. The title of \"Hetman\" was given to the leader of the Polish Army. Until 1581 the hetman position existed only during specific campaigns and wars. After that, it became a permanent title, as were all the titles in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. At any given time the Commonwealth had four hetmans \u2013 a \"Great Hetman\" and \"Field\" (deputy) \"Hetman\" each for both Poland and Lithuania.\nFrom 1585, the title could not be taken away without a proven charge of treachery, so most hetmans served for life. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz literally commanded the army from his deathbed (1621). Hetmans were not paid by the royal treasury. Hetmans were the main commanders of the military forces, second only to the monarch in the army's chain of command. The fact that they could not be removed by the monarch made them very independent, and thus often able to pursue independent policies.\nThis system worked well when a hetman had great ability and the monarch was weak, but sometimes produced disastrous results in the opposite case. The security of the position notably contrasted with that of military leaders in states bordering the commonwealth, where sovereigns could dismiss their army commanders at any time. In 1648 the Zaporizhian Host (then a Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth subject) elected a hetman of its own, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, igniting the Ukrainian struggle for independence.\nThe military reform of 1776 curtailed the powers of the hetmans. The Hetman office was abolished after the Third Partition of Poland (1795).\nHetmans of the Cossack Hetmanate in Ukraine.\nAt the end of the sixteenth century, the commanders of the Zaporizhian Cossacks were titled or \"Hetman\"; Christof Kosynsky was the first Zaporizhian hetman. In 1572, a hetman was a commander of the Registered Cossack Army () of the Commonwealth. From 1648, the start of Bohdan Khmelnytsky's uprising, a hetman was the head of the whole Ukrainian State \u2014 and heads of the Cossack Hetmanate. As supreme military commanders and lawmakers (by administrative decree), they had very broad powers, although they were elected.\nAfter the split of Ukraine along the Dnieper River by the 1667 Polish\u2013Russian Treaty of Andrusovo, Ukrainian Cossacks (and Cossack hetmans) became known as Left-bank Cossacks (of the Cossack Hetmanate) and Right-bank Cossacks.\nIn the Russian Empire, the office of Cossack Hetman was abolished by Catherine II of Russia in 1764. The last Hetman of the Zaporozhian Army (the formal title of the hetman of Ukraine) was Kyrylo Rozumovsky, who reigned from 1751 until 1764.\nThe title was revived in Ukraine during the revolution of 1917 to 1921. In early 1918, a conservative German-supported coup overthrew the radical socialist Ukrainian Central Rada and its Ukrainian People's Republic, establishing a hetmanate monarchy headed by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who claimed the title \"Hetman of Ukraine\". This regime lasted until late 1918, when it was overthrown by a new Directorate of Ukraine, of a re-established Ukrainian People's Republic.\nHetmans of Bohemia, Romania, and Moldavia.\nUsed by the Czechs in Bohemia from the Hussite Wars (15th century) onward, is today the term for the elected governor of a Czech region ().\nFor much of the history of Romania and the Principality of Moldavia, hetmans were second in rank in the army, after the ruling prince, who held the position of voivode.\nOther uses.\n\"Hetman\" has often been used figuratively to mean 'commander' or simply 'leader'. Examples:\nQueen (chess piece) is called \"hetman\" in Polish and coded as H in the algebraic notation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60737", "revid": "50931916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60737", "title": "Bond (finance)", "text": "Instrument of indebtedness\nIn finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged \u2013 depending on the terms \u2013 to provide cash flow to the creditor; which usually consists of repaying the principal (the amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date, as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time. The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.\nBonds are often identified by their international securities identification number, or ISIN, which is a 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\nEtymology.\nIn English, the word \"bond\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". The use of the word \"bond\" in this sense of an \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\" dates from at least the 1590s.\nIssuance.\nBonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and supranational institutions in the primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a syndicate, buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and resell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by \"bookrunners\" who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The overall rate of return on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid. The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the bond market.\nHistorically, an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a \"tap issue\" or \"bond tap\".\nFeatures.\nPrincipal.\nNominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\nMaturity.\nThe issuer is obligated to repay the nominal amount on the maturity date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term shorter than 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are four categories of bond maturities:\nCoupon.\nThe coupon is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. For fixed rate bonds, the coupon is fixed throughout the life of the bond. For floating rate notes, the coupon varies throughout the life of the bond and is based on the movement of a money market reference rate (historically this was generally LIBOR, but with its discontinuation the market reference rate has transitioned to SOFR).\nHistorically, coupons were physical attachments to the paper bond certificates, with each coupon representing an interest payment. On the interest due date, the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Today, interest payments are almost always paid electronically. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual (every six months) or annual.\nYield.\nThe yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers to one of the following:\nCredit quality.\nThe quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.\nHigh-yield bonds are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called \"junk bonds\".\nMarket price.\nThe market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, among other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\nThe price can be quoted as clean or dirty. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high probability of default on the bond).\nTypes.\n \nBonds can be categorised in several ways, such as the type of issuer, the currency, the term of the bond (length of time to maturity) and the conditions applying to the bond. The following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\nThe nature of the issuer and the security offered.\nThe nature of the issuer will affect the security (certainty of receiving the contracted payments) offered by the bond, and sometimes the tax treatment.\nForeign currencies.\nSome companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as the foreign currency may appear to potential investors to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency. Issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets.\nA downside is that the government loses the option to reduce its bond liabilities by inflating its domestic currency.\nThe proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law. Not all of the following bonds are restricted for purchase by investors in the market of issuance.\nBond valuation.\nThe market price of a bond is the present value of all expected future interest and principal payments of the bond, here discounted at the bond's yield to maturity (i.e. rate of return). That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see Bond valuation.\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The market price of a bond may be quoted including the accrued interest since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"dirty price\". (\"See also\" Accrual bond.) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"clean price\".\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of \u00a3100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\nAlthough bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), their prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"pull to par\". At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. (The position is a bit more complicated for inflation-linked bonds.)\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the current yield (this is the nominal yield multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the yield curve, a graph plotting this relationship.\nIf the bond includes embedded options, the valuation is more difficult and combines option pricing with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the option price as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under . This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated lattice- or simulation-based techniques may (also) be employed.\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\nInvesting in bonds.\nBonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and banks. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through bond funds. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than equities, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are often liquid \u2013 it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities \u2013 and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often receive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and prepayment risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, event risk, exchange rate risk, volatility risk, inflation risk, sovereign risk and yield curve risk. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect mutual funds that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading portfolio falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"marked to market\" or not).\nIf there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", interest rate risk could become a real problem, conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its duration. Efforts to control this risk are called immunization or hedging.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\nBond indices.\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the S&amp;P 500 or Russell Indexes for companies' shares. The most common American benchmarks are the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate (ex Lehman Aggregate), Citigroup BIG and Merrill Lynch Domestic Master. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMarket specific\nGeneral\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first documented Polish monarch was Duke Mieszko I (c.\u2009960\u2013992). The Piasts' royal rule in Poland ended in 1370 with the death of King Casimir III the Great.\nBranches of the Piast dynasty continued to rule in the Duchy of Masovia (until 1526) and in the Duchies of Silesia until the last male Silesian Piast died in 1675. The Piasts intermarried with several noble lines of Europe, and possessed numerous titles, some within the Holy Roman Empire. The Jagiellonian kings ruling after the death of Casimir IV of Poland were also descended in the female line from Casimir III's daughter.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe early dukes and kings of Poland are said to have regarded themselves as descendants of the semi-legendary Piast the Wheelwright (\"Piast Ko\u0142odziej\"), first mentioned in the \"Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\" (\"Deeds of the Princes of the Poles\"), written c. 1113 by Gallus Anonymus. However, the term \"Piast Dynasty\" was not applied until the 17th century. In a historical work, the expression Piast dynasty was introduced by the Polish historian Adam Naruszewicz; it is not documented in contemporary sources.\nHistory.\nThe first \"Piasts\", probably of Polan descent, appeared around 940 in the territory of Greater Poland at the stronghold of Giecz. Shortly afterwards they relocated their residence to Gniezno, where Prince Mieszko I ruled over the \"Civitas Schinesghe\" from about 960. The Piasts temporarily also ruled over Pomerania, Bohemia and the Lusatias, as well as part of Ruthenia, and the Hungarian Spi\u0161 region in present-day Slovakia. The ruler bore the title of a duke or a king, depending on their position of power.\nThe Polish monarchy had to deal with the expansionist policies of the Holy Roman Empire in the west, resulting in a chequered co-existence, with Piast rulers like Mieszko I, Casimir I the Restorer or W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman trying to protect the Polish state by treaties, oath of allegiances and marriage alliances with the Imperial Ottonian and Salian dynasties. The Bohemian P\u0159emyslid dynasty, the Hungarian Arpads and their Anjou successors, the Kievan Rus', later also the State of the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were mighty neighbours.\nThe Piast position was decisively enfeebled by an era of fragmentation following the 1138 Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth. For nearly 150 years, the Polish state shattered into several duchies, with the Piast duke against the formally valid principle of agnatic seniority fighting for the throne at Krak\u00f3w, the capital of the Lesser Polish Seniorate Province. Numerous dukes like Mieszko III the Old, W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks or Leszek I the White were crowned, only to be overthrown shortly afterwards, and others restored and ousted, at times repeatedly. The senior branch of the Silesian Piasts, descendants of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth's eldest son Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile, went separate ways and since the 14th century were vassals of the Bohemian Crown.\nAfter the Polish royal line and Piast junior branch had died out in 1370, the Polish crown fell to the Anjou king Louis I of Hungary, son of late King Casimir's sister Elizabeth Piast. The Masovian branch of the Piasts became extinct with the death of Duke Janusz III in 1526. The last ruling duke of the Silesian Piasts was George William of Legnica who died in 1675. His uncle Count August of Legnica, the last male Piast, died in 1679. The last legitimate heir, Duchess Karolina of Legnica-Brieg died in 1707 and is buried in Trzebnica Abbey. Nevertheless, numerous families, like the illegitimate descendants of the Silesian duke Adam Wenceslaus of Cieszyn (1574\u20131617), link their genealogy to the dynasty.\nCoat of arms.\nAbout 1295, Przemys\u0142 II used a coat of arms with a white eagle \u2013 a symbol later referred to as the Piast coat of arms or as the Piast Eagle.\nThe Silesian Piasts in the 14th century used an eagle modified by a crescent, which became the coat of arms of the Duchy of Silesia.\nPiast rulers.\nPiast kings and rulers of Poland appear in list form in the following table.

Both Poitou and Poitiers are named after the Pictones Gallic tribe.\nGeography.\nThe main historical cities are Poitiers (historical capital city), Ch\u00e2tellerault (France's kings' establishment in Poitou), Niort, La Roche-sur-Yon, Thouars, and Parthenay.\nHistory.\nHistorically, Poitou was ruled by the count of Poitou, a continuous line of which can be traced back to an appointment of Charlemagne in 778. A marshland called the Poitevin Marsh (French \"Marais Poitevin\") is located along the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort.\nAt the conclusion of the Battle of Taillebourg in the Saintonge War, which was decisively won by the French, King Henry III of England recognized his loss of continental Plantagenet territory to France. This was ratified by the Treaty of Paris of 1259, by which King Louis annexed Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Poitou).\nDuring the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Poitou was a hotbed of Huguenot (French Calvinist Protestant) activity among the nobility and bourgeoisie. The Protestants were discriminated against and brutally attacked during the French Wars of Religion (1562\u20131598). Under the Edict of Nantes, such discrimination was temporarily suspended but this measure was repealed by the French Crown.\nSome of the French colonists, later known as Acadians, who settled beginning in 1604 in eastern North America came from southern Poitou. They established settlements in what is now Nova Scotia, and later in New Brunswick\u2014both of which were taken over in the later 18th century by the English, (after their 1763 victory in the Seven Years' War).\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the French Roman Catholic Church conducted a strong Counter-Reformation effort. In 1793, this effort had contributed to the three-year-long open revolt against the French Revolutionary Government in the Bas-Poitou (D\u00e9partement of Vend\u00e9e). Similarly, during Napoleon's Hundred Days in 1815, the Vend\u00e9e stayed loyal to the Restoration Monarchy of King Louis XVIII. Napoleon dispatched 10,000 troops under General Jean Maximilien Lamarque to pacify the region.\nAs noted by historian Andre Lampert: \n\"The persistent Huguenots of 17th Century Poitou and the fiercely Catholic rebellious Royalists of what came be the Vend\u00e9e of the late 18th Century had ideologies very different, indeed diametrically opposed to each other. The common thread connecting both phenomena is a continuing assertion of a local identity and opposition to the central government in Paris, whatever its composition and identity. (...) In the region where Louis XIII and Louis XIV had encountered stiff resistance, the House of Bourbon gained loyal and militant supporters exactly when it had been overthrown and when a Bourbon loyalty came to imply a local loyalty in opposition to the new central government, that of Robespierre.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By her two marriages she was Queen of Hungary from 1063 to 1074 and Duchess of Poland from 1089 to 1102.\nEarly life.\nBorn probably at the Imperial Palace of Goslar, Judith was the youngest of the six children born to Emperor Henry III and Empress Agnes. Soon after her birth on 9 April 1054, Judith was betrothed to Philip, eldest son of King Henry I of France. However, after the death of Emperor Henry III on 5 October 1056, with Empress Agnes acting as regent on behalf of her minor son, King Henry IV, the engagement was broken in September 1058, when a peace treaty was concluded with King Andrew I of Hungary. Emperor Henry III had waged two unsuccessful campaigns against Hungary in 1051 and 1052, whereafter Pope Leo IX arranged an agreement. As a part of the new alliance, Judith was engaged to the Hungarian king's son Solomon at the Bavarian court in Regensburg. When King Andrew I died in 1060, his widow and sons had to take refuge in Germany. Nevertheless, with the support of his powerful brother-in-law, Solomon could recover the Hungarian throne after the death of his uncle B\u00e9la I in 1063 and soon after married with Judith in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.\nQueen of Hungary.\nJudith's marriage to Solomon proved to be unsuccessful, and apparently both the king and queen had love affairs. Although it is generally believed that the union was childless, some sources state that Solomon and Judith had a daughter, Sophia, who later married Count Poppo of Berg-Schelklingen.\nDuring the 1070s, a struggle for power commenced between King Solomon and his cousins (Geza and Ladislaus, sons of the late B\u00e9la I). On 14 March 1074 at the Battle of Mogyor\u00f3d, the king's forces were decisively defeated by his cousins and their allies, the Dukes of Poland and Bohemia. Judith fled back to Germany, while Solomon continued his fight for the Hungarian throne; in 1077 he accepted the rule of his cousin King L\u00e1szl\u00f3 I, who gave him in exchange extensive landholdings after his formal abdication (1081). Despite this, Solomon never gave up his pretensions and began to plot against King L\u00e1szl\u00f3 I; however, his plans were discovered and he was imprisoned by the King in the Tower of Visegr\u00e1d until 15 August 1083, when on the occasion of the canonization of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, Solomon was released.\nIn the meantime, Judith remained in Germany and settled in her residence in Regensburg (with short breaks) from May or July 1074 until 1088. After his release, Solomon went to Germany and tried to reunite with his wife, but she refused to receive him. After a long wandering, Solomon made an alliance with Kuteshk, the leader of a Pecheneg tribe settled in the later principality of Moldavia. Between 1084-1085 he married his daughter, committing bigamy with this act.\nSolomon promised to hand over parts of the kingdom of Hungary in exchange for his new father-in-law's military assistance. In 1085, Solomon led the Pecheneg troops against Hungary, but King Ladislaus I defeated them. Two years later, in 1087, Solomon took part in the Pechenegs' campaign against the Byzantine Empire and was killed in a battle near Hadrianopolis.\nDuchess of Poland.\nIn 1089, Judith married Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman of Poland. This union considerably benefited German-Polish relations; on the occasion of the wedding, Emperor Henry IV commissioned to St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg the creation of Gospel Books to the Polish court, now kept in the library of the Wawel Cathedral chapter in Krak\u00f3w. After her marriage, Judith changed her name to Sophia, perhaps to distinguish herself from W\u0142adys\u0142aw I's first wife, Judith of Bohemia. Judith of Swabia's daughters with W\u0142adys\u0142aw were Sophia(?) (who married Prince Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich of Vladimir-Volynia), Agnes (later abbess of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim), and the wife of a Polish lord whose name is not known. According to older historians his third daughter did not marry a Polish lord, but was Adelaide (who married Margrave Diepold III of Vohburg).\nJudith probably had a big impact on Poland's political life. It is believed that she was the mistress of Sieciech, the count palatine and true governor of the country. Judith actively aided Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country; the death of Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic under mysterious circumstances was, in all probability, caused by orders of the Count Palatine and Judith. With the help of Sieciech, Judith convinced her husband to send W\u0142adys\u0142aw I's first-born son Zbigniew (who seems to be a strong candidate to the succession despite his illegitimacy) to Quedlinburg Abbey where her sister Adelaide was abbess; also, they wanted an eventual alliance with the only legitimate son of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth, born from his first marriage with Judith of Bohemia.\nAfter discovering the plans of Sieciech and Judith to take over the country, Boles\u0142aw and Zbigniew became allies. Both brothers demanded that the reigns of government should be handed over to them. Eventually, after some attempts to break the alliance between the brothers, Sieciech was defeated, deposed and exiled (ca. 1100\u20131101). On 4 June 1102 Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I died. The country was divided between Boles\u0142aw III and Zbigniew.\nJudith's date of death was disputed among historians and web sources. Although 14 March is stated as the correct day in almost all the known sources, in the case of the year is more difficult to ascertain. Sources established that she died between 1092\u20131096, but this seems improbable, because it is known that around 1105, Boles\u0142aw III entered into an agreement with her, under which, in exchange for abundant dower lands, Judith guaranteed her neutrality in the Duke's political contest with his half-brother Zbigniew. Thus, she died after that date. Gerard Labuda stated that Judith spent her last years of life in Regensburg with her (supposed) daughter Adelaide, wife of Count Dietpold III of Vohburg and Cham; since the date of the marriage between Adelaide and Count Dietpold III was ranked between 1110\u20131118, it is assumed that Judith died after the latter year, at a relatively advanced age. Her place of burial, Admont Abbey in Austria, apparently confirm this theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60744", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60744", "title": "Cubic zirconia", "text": "Cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide\nCubic zirconia (CZ) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). The synthesized material is hard and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). It is sometimes erroneously called \"cubic zirconium\".\nBecause of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite.\nTechnical aspects.\nCubic zirconia is crystallographically isometric, an important attribute of a would-be diamond simulant. During synthesis zirconium oxide naturally forms monoclinic crystals, which are stable under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer is required for cubic crystals (taking on the fluorite structure) to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; typically this is either yttrium or calcium oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.\nIt is a dense substance, with a density between 5.6 and 6.0\u00a0g/cm3\u2014about 1.65 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8\u20138.5 on the Mohs scale\u2014slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15\u20132.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is Adamantine lustre. Its dispersion is very high at 0.058\u20130.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no cleavage and exhibits a conchoidal fracture. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered brittle.\nUnder shortwave UV cubic zirconia typically fluoresces a yellow, greenish yellow or \"beige\". Under longwave UV the effect is greatly diminished, with a whitish glow sometimes being seen. Colored stones may show a strong, complex rare earth absorption spectrum.\nHistory.\nDiscovered in 1892, the yellowish monoclinic mineral baddeleyite is a natural form of zirconium oxide.\nThe high melting point of zirconia (2750\u00a0\u00b0C or 4976\u00a0\u00b0F) hinders controlled growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product \"stabilized zirconia\" introduced in 1929. Although cubic, it was in the form of a polycrystalline ceramic: it was used as a refractory material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540\u00a0\u00b0C or 4604\u00a0\u00b0F).\nIn 1937, German mineralogists M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba discovered naturally occurring cubic zirconia in the form of microscopic grains included in metamict zircon. This was thought to be a byproduct of the metamictization process, but the two scientists did not think the mineral important enough to give it a formal name. The discovery was confirmed through X-ray diffraction, proving the existence of a natural counterpart to the synthetic product.\nAs with the majority of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).\nSome of the earliest research into controlled single-crystal growth of cubic zirconia occurred in 1960s France, much work being done by Y. Roulin and R. Collongues. This technique involved molten zirconia being contained within a thin shell of still-solid zirconia, with crystal growth from the melt. The process was named \"cold crucible\", an allusion to the system of water cooling used. Though promising, these attempts yielded only small crystals.\nLater, Soviet scientists under V. V. Osiko in the Laser Equipment Laboratory at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow perfected the technique, which was then named \"skull crucible\" (an allusion either to the shape of the water-cooled container or to the form of crystals sometimes grown). They named the jewel \"Fianit\" after the institute's name FIAN (Physical Institute of the Academy of Science), but the name was not used outside of the USSR. This was known at the time as the Institute of Physics at the Russian Academy of Science. Their breakthrough was published in 1973, and commercial production began in 1976. In 1977, cubic zirconia began to be mass-produced in the jewelry marketplace by the Ceres Corporation, with crystals stabilized with 94% yttria. Other major producers as of 1993 include Taiwan Crystal Company Ltd, Swarovski and ICT inc. By 1980, annual global production had reached 60 million carats (12 tonnes) and continued to increase, with production reaching around 400 tonnes per year in 1998.\nBecause the natural form of cubic zirconia is so rare, all cubic zirconia used in jewelry has been synthesized, one method of which was patented by Josep F. Wenckus &amp; Co. in 1997.\nSynthesis.\nThe skull-melting method refined by Josep F. Wenckus and coworkers in 1997 remains the industry standard. This is largely due to the process allowing for temperatures of over 3000\u00a0\u00b0C to be achieved, lack of contact between crucible and material as well as the freedom to choose any gas atmosphere. Primary downsides to this method include the inability to predict the size of the crystals produced and it is impossible to control the crystallization process through temperature changes.\nThe apparatus used in this process consists of a cup-shaped crucible surrounded by radio frequency-activated (RF-activated) copper coils and a water-cooling system.\nZirconium dioxide thoroughly mixed with a stabilizer (normally 10% yttrium oxide) is fed into a cold crucible. Metallic chips of either zirconium or the stabilizer are introduced into the powder mix in a compact pile manner. The RF generator is switched on and the metallic chips quickly start heating up and readily oxidize into more zirconia. Consequently, the surrounding powder heats up by thermal conduction, begins melting and, in turn, becomes electroconductive, and thus it begins to heat up via the RF generator as well. This continues until the entire product is molten. Due to the cooling system surrounding the crucible, a thin shell of sintered solid material is formed. This causes the molten zirconia to remain contained within its own powder which prevents it from being contaminated from the crucible and reduces heat loss. The melt is left at high temperatures for some hours to ensure homogeneity and ensure that all impurities have evaporated. Finally, the entire crucible is slowly removed from the RF coils to reduce the heating and let it slowly cool down (from bottom to top). The rate at which the crucible is removed from the RF coils is chosen as a function of the stability of crystallization dictated by the phase transition diagram. This provokes the crystallization process to begin and useful crystals begin to form. Once the crucible has been completely cooled to room temperature, the resulting crystals are multiple elongated-crystalline blocks.\nThis shape is dictated by a concept known as crystal degeneration according to Tiller. The size and diameter of the obtained crystals is a function of the cross-sectional area of the crucible, volume of the melt and composition of the melt. The diameter of the crystals is heavily influenced by the concentration of Y2O3 stabilizer.\nPhase relations in zirconia solids solutions.\nAs seen on the phase diagram, the cubic phase will crystallize first as the solution is cooled down no matter the concentration of Y2O3. If the concentration of Y2O3 is not high enough the cubic structure will start to break down into the tetragonal state which will then break down into a monoclinic phase. If the concentration of Y2O3 is between 2.5\u20135% the resulting product will be PSZ (partially stabilized zirconia) while monophasic cubic crystals will form from around 8\u201340%. Below 14% at low growth rates tend to be opaque indicating partial phase separation in the solid solution (likely due to diffusion in the crystals remaining in the high temperature region for a longer time). Above this threshold crystals tend to remain clear at reasonable growth rates and maintains good annealing conditions.\nDoping.\nBecause of cubic zirconia's isomorphic capacity, it can be doped with several elements to change the color of the crystal. A list of specific dopants and colors produced by their addition can be seen below.\nPrimary growth defects.\nThe vast majority of YCZ (yttrium bearing cubic zirconia) crystals are clear with high optical perfection and with gradients of the refractive index lower than . However some samples contain defects with the most characteristic and common ones listed below.\nUses outside jewelry.\nDue to its optical properties, yttrium cubic zirconia (YCZ) has been used for windows, lenses, prisms, filters and laser elements. Particularly in the chemical industry, it is used as window material for the monitoring of corrosive liquids due to its chemical stability and mechanical toughness. YCZ has also been used as a substrate for semiconductor and superconductor films in similar industries.\nMechanical properties of partially stabilized zirconia (high hardness and shock resistance, low friction coefficient, high chemical and thermal resistance, high wear and tear resistance) allow it to be used as a very particular building material, especially in the bio-engineering industry: It has been used to make reliable super-sharp medical scalpels for doctors that are compatible with bio-tissues and contain an edge much smoother than one made of steel.\nInnovations.\nManufacturers have sought ways to distinguish their product by supposedly \"improving\" cubic zirconia. Coating finished cubic zirconia with a film of diamond-like carbon (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using chemical vapor deposition. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess fire of cubic zirconia, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, because of the high percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in Raman spectra.\nAnother technique first applied to quartz and topaz has also been adapted to cubic zirconia: An iridescent effect created by vacuum-sputtering onto finished stones an extremely thin layer of a precious metal (typically gold), or certain metal oxides, metal nitrides, or other coatings. This material is marketed as \"mystic\" by many dealers. Unlike diamond-like carbon and other hard synthetic ceramic coatings, the iridescent effect made with precious metal coatings is not durable, due to their extremely low hardness and poor abrasion wear properties, compared to the remarkably durable cubic zirconia substrate.\nComparison with diamond.\nKey features of cubic zirconia distinguish it from diamond:\nEffects on the diamond market.\nCubic zirconia, as a diamond simulant and jewel competitor, can potentially reduce demand for conflict diamonds, and affect the controversy surrounding the rarity and value of diamonds.\nRegarding value, the paradigm that diamonds are costly due to their rarity and visual beauty has been replaced by an artificial rarity attributed to price-fixing practices of De Beers Company which held a monopoly on the market from the 1870s to early 2000s. The company pleaded guilty to these charges in an Ohio court in 13 July 2004. However, while De Beers has less market power, the price of diamonds continues to increase due to the demand in emerging markets, such as India and China. The emergence of artificial stones, such as cubic zirconia, with optic properties similar to diamonds could be an alternative for jewelry buyers given their lower price and noncontroversial history.\nAn issue closely related to monopoly is the emergence of conflict diamonds. The Kimberley Process (KP) was established to deter the illicit trade of diamonds that fund civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. However, the KP is not as effective in decreasing the number of conflict diamonds reaching the European and American markets. Its definition does not include forced labor conditions or human right violations. A 2015 study from the Enough Project, showed that groups in the Central African Republic have reaped between US$3\u00a0million and US$6\u00a0million annually from conflict diamonds. UN reports show that more than US$24\u00a0million in conflict diamonds have been smuggled since the establishment of the KP. Diamond simulants have become an alternative to boycott the funding of unethical practices. Terms such as \u201cEco-friendly Jewelry\u201d define them as conflict free origin and environmentally sustainable. However, concerns from mining countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are that a boycott in purchases of diamonds would only worsen their economy. According to the Ministry of Mines in Congo, 10% of its population relies on the income from diamonds. Therefore, cubic zirconia are a short term alternative to reduce conflict but a long term solution would be to establish a more rigorous system of identifying the origin of these stones.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the second son, W\u0142adys\u0142aw was not destined for the throne. However, due to the flight from Poland of his older brother Boles\u0142aw the Bold in 1079, he became duke of Poland. Opinions vary on whether W\u0142adys\u0142aw played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the best candidate to replace Boles\u0142aw.\nGerman relations.\nIn 1080, in order to improve the relations between Poland and Bohemia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw married Judith, the daughter of Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia, a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. After this, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's foreign policy gravitated strongly towards appeasing the Holy Roman Empire, and he accepted the overlordship of Emperor Henry IV. While Vratislaus was declared a king in 1085 by Emperor Henry, W\u0142adys\u0142aw never pursued kingship. Soon after, he was forced by the barons of Poland to recall his nephew Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic from exile in Hungary. Mieszko accepted the overlordship of his uncle and gave up his claim to Poland in exchange for becoming first in the line of succession. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was forced to accept the terms of his nephew, because his eldest and only son at that time, Zbigniew, was born from a union not recognized by the church. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's relations with Henry considerably improved after Judith of Bohemia died and W\u0142adys\u0142aw married Henry's sister Judith, dowager queen of Hungary, in 1089.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw abandoned the alliance with Hungary favored by his deposed brother, and joined the anti-papal camp. He also resumed paying tribute for Silesia to Bohemia. In addition, Krak\u00f3w and Cieszyn were ceded to Bohemia, and Lubusz Land was lost to Germany, while Przemy\u015bl Land in the east was lost to Halych-Ruthenia. W\u0142adys\u0142aw did make attempts to regain control of Pomerania, and through numerous expeditions was temporarily (1090\u20131091) able to do so.\nDomestic difficulties.\nAlthough W\u0142adys\u0142aw was formally duke of Poland, in reality the barons who banished his brother used this victory to strengthen their position. It is not surprising, therefore, that within a short time W\u0142adys\u0142aw was forced to give up the government to his count palatine (Polish: wojewoda), a nobleman named Sieciech. Sieciech's administration of the realm was negatively perceived by those of the barons who were not the beneficiaries of the power shift.\nThe birth of Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth to W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Judith of Bohemia changed the political situation in Poland. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's nephew Mieszko was already seventeen at that time and was, by the previous agreement made after his return, the first in line to succeed. In 1089 Mieszko died under mysterious circumstances, probably poisoned on the orders of Sieciech and Judith of Swabia. Almost immediately, Zbigniew was sent to Germany and placed in the Quedlinburg Abbey. With the idea of forcing his first-born son to take holy vows, W\u0142adys\u0142aw intended to deprive him of any chance of succession.\nIn 1090 Sieciech, with help of Polish forces under his command, managed to gain control of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, the rest were burned, in order to thwart any future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region's independence from Poland. Sieciech's tyrannical rule reflected negatively on W\u0142adys\u0142aw, causing a massive political migration out of Poland. In 1093 Silesia rebelled, and the \"comes\" Magnus, with the assistance of the Bohemian and Polish knights, welcomed Zbigniew after he escaped from Germany; however, soon Sieciech captured the prince and imprisoned him. The increasing dissatisfaction in the country forced the release of Zbigniew in 1097. Immediately after this W\u0142adys\u0142aw (after an unsuccessful retaliatory expedition against Silesia and being forced to recognize Zbigniew as the legitimate heir) appointed his sons as commanders of the army which was formed in order to recapture Gda\u0144sk Pomerania.\nSimultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. W\u0142adys\u0142aw, a tolerant ruler, attracted the Jews to his domains, and permitted them to settle throughout the entire country without restriction.\nSoon Zbigniew and Boles\u0142aw decided to join forces and demanded that the reins of government should be handed over to them. W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while he himself kept control of Mazovia and its capital at P\u0142ock. W\u0142adys\u0142aw also retained control of the most important cities--\"i.e.\", Wroc\u0142aw, Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz. Zbigniew's province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, \u0141\u0119czyca and Sieradz. Boles\u0142aw's territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land. However, Sieciech, alarmed by the evident diminution of his power, began to intrigue against the brothers. W\u0142adys\u0142aw decided to support him against his own sons. Defeated, and after the mediation of Martin, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Duke was forced to confiscate Sieciech's properties and exiled him in 1101.\nErection of churches.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw founded several churches in Poland. Most notably he was the founder of the Romanesque Wawel Cathedral of which the Silver Bells Tower still remains standing. He was also very fond of Saint Giles (Polish: Idzi) to whom he founded no less than three churches: in Krak\u00f3w, Inow\u0142\u00f3dz and Giebu\u0142t\u00f3w. This is attributed to the fact that while his first wife was finally pregnant after six years of childless marriage, the Duke sent rich gifts to the Benedictine monastery of Saint Gilles in southern France, begging for a healthy child. When a son was born, Wladyslaw began building churches in his honor. According to legend, he also founded a church \"on the sand\" dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was later granted to the Carmelites.\nHealth.\nAccording to Gallus Anonymus, W\u0142adys\u0142aw long suffered from a debilitating ailment that affected his legs. There is also a legend which states that in 1086 W\u0142adys\u0142aw was affected by a terrible pox, with abscesses that affected his nose and face. According to the legend, the Holy Virgin appeared in the duke's dream and led him to find the cure in the sandy area outside the city. Once healed W\u0142adys\u0142aw founded a Church of the Holiest Virgin Mary \"on the sand\" in the spot where he found the cure.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw died on 4 June 1102, without resolving the issue of succession, leaving his sons to struggle for supremacy. His body was interred in the P\u0142ock Cathedral.\nMarriages and issue.\nBefore W\u0142adys\u0142aw became duke of Poland, probably during the 1070s, he had a relationship with a woman named Przec\u0142awa, whose exact origins are unknown, although some sources stated that she belonged to the Prawdzic clan. Her status is also a matter of dispute among the historians: some believed that she was only W\u0142adys\u0142aw's mistress and others asserted that she was his wife, but this union was performed under pagan rituals and in consequence not recognized by the Church as a valid marriage. By 1080, one year after W\u0142adys\u0142aw ascended to the Polish throne, Przec\u0142awa either died or was sent away; it is believed by some sources that after she was dismissed by W\u0142adys\u0142aw, Przec\u0142awa took the veil under the name Christina () and died around 1092. This union produced a son, Zbigniew (b. c. 1070/73 \u2013 d. c. 1112/14), who was considered illegitimate.\nIn 1080, W\u0142adys\u0142aw married Judith (c. 1056 \u2013 1086), daughter of Vratislaus II of Bohemia. They had a son, Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth (1086 \u2013 1138). In 1089 W\u0142adys\u0142aw married Judith (1054 \u2013 1105), daughter of Emperor Henry III and widow of King Solomon of Hungary. Their daughters were:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the only child of Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman and his first wife, Judith of Bohemia.\nBoles\u0142aw began to rule in the last decade of the 11th century, when the central government in Poland was significantly weakened. W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman fell under the political dependence of the Count palatine Sieciech, who became the \"de facto\" ruler of the country. Backed by their father, Boleslaw and his half-brother Zbigniew finally expelled Sieciech from the country in 1101, after several years of fighting. After the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman in 1102, two independent states were created, ruled by Boles\u0142aw and Zbigniew.\nBoles\u0142aw sought to gain Pomerania which caused an armed conflict between the brothers, and forced Zbigniew to flee the country and seek military help from King Henry V of Germany. Boles\u0142aw punished Zbigniew by blinding him. This action caused outrage among supporters of Zbigniew, resulting in a political crisis in Poland. Boles\u0142aw once again gained the favor of his subjects with public penance, and made a pilgrimage to the monastery of his patron, Saint Giles, in Hungary.\nBoles\u0142aw, like Boles\u0142aw II the Generous, based his foreign policy on maintaining good relations with neighboring Hungary and Kievan Rus, with whom he forged strong links through marriage and military cooperation in order to break Poland's political dependence on Germany and Henry's vassal, the King of Bohemia, who in moments of weakness of Polish policy was forced to pay tribute in Silesia. These alliances had allowed Boles\u0142aw to effectively defend the country from invasion in 1109. Several years later, Boles\u0142aw skillfully took advantage of the dynastic disputes in Bohemia to ensure peace on the south-west border.\nBoles\u0142aw devoted the second half of his rule to the conquest of Pomerania. In 1113 he conquered the northern cities along Note\u0107, which strengthened the border with the Pomeranians. In subsequent years, he took further steps toward the conquest of Pomerania. The resolution of the conflict with the Holy Roman Empire allowed Boles\u0142aw to subordinate Western Pomerania and incorporate Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. The expeditions, carried out in three stages, ended in the 1120s with military and political successes. Integration of the newly annexed lands enabled Boles\u0142aw to build churches and begin the process of converting Pomerania. Bishop Otto of Bamberg confirmed the Christianization of Pomerania from 1123 onward.\nIn the 1130s Boles\u0142aw participated in the dynastic dispute in Hungary. After an unexpected defeat, he was forced to make an agreement with Germany. The Congress of Merseburg of 1135 addressed the issues of Pomerania, Silesian (probably also Polish) sovereignty and the supremacy of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg over the Polish Church.\nBoles\u0142aw was married twice. His first marriage, to the Kievan princess Zbyslava, gave him an excuse to intervene militarily in the internal affairs of Rus'. After her death, Boles\u0142aw married a German noblewoman, Salomea of Berg, which in some way was the cause of changes in Polish foreign policy: in the second half of his rule, the duke sought to restore diplomatic relations with his western neighbor. His last, and perhaps most momentous act, was his will and testament known as \"The Succession Statute\" in which he divided the country among his sons, leading to almost 200 years of feudal fragmentation of the Polish Kingdom.\nBoles\u0142aw III Wrymouth has been recognized by historiography as a symbol of Polish political aspirations until well into the 19th century. He also upheld the independence of the Polish archbishopric of Gniezno, despite a temporary failure in the 1130s. Although he achieved undoubted successes, he committed serious political errors, most notably against Zbigniew of Poland, his half-brother. The crime against Zbigniew and his penance for it show Boles\u0142aw's great ambition as well as his ability to find political compromise.\nChildhood.\nSituation of Poland during the 1080s.\nIn 1086 the coronation of Vratislav II as King of Bohemia, and his alignment with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 I, King of Hungary, threatened the position of the Polish ruler, duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman. Therefore, that same year W\u0142adys\u0142aw I was forced to recall from Hungarian banishment the only son of Boles\u0142aw II the Bold and a rightful heir to the Polish throne, Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic. Upon his return young Boles\u0142awowic accepted the over-lordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him. In return, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman granted his nephew the district of Krak\u00f3w. The situation was further complicated for W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman by a lack of a legitimate male heir, as his first-born son Zbigniew came from a union not recognized by the church. With the return of Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic to Poland, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I normalized his relations with the kingdom of Hungary as well as Kievan Rus (the marriage of Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic to a Kievan princess was arranged in 1088). These actions allowed Herman to strengthen his authority and alleviate further tensions in international affairs.\nBirth and naming.\nThe lack of a legitimate heir, however, remained a concern for W\u0142adys\u0142aw I and in 1085 he and his wife Judith of Bohemia sent rich gifts, among which was a life size statue of a child made of gold, to the Benedictine Sanctuary of Saint Giles in Saint-Gilles, Provence begging for offspring. The Polish envoys were led by the personal chaplain of Duchess Judith, Piotr.\nThe date of birth of Boles\u0142aw is closely linked with the death of his mother Judith. This fact is evidenced by contemporary sources:\nHistorian August Bielowski established Boles\u0142aw's birth on 26 December 1085 and the death of his mother two days later, on 28 December. According to him Gallus Anonymus committed two errors. First, instead of \"the Sunday after the Nativity of the Lord\", he wrote incorrectly \"in the Sunday of the Nativity\". Secondly, he mistook the day of Saint Stephen (26 December) for the festivities of King Stephen of Hungary (20 August). Both corrections lead to the birth date of Boles\u0142aw on 26 December. This theory was supported by the fact that, in 1085, 28 December fell on a Sunday.\nOswald Balzer refuted Bielowski's theory, arguing that Judith's death was on the night of 24/25 December 1086, and the birth of Boles\u0142aw was four months before, on 20 August. According to him, this timing of Judith's death gives rise to possible discrepancies in determining the exact date of Boles\u0142aw's birth, but corroborates all known sources who placed the death of Judith. Gallus wrote that Judith died shortly after giving birth to a son. Later sources interpret this as a death in childbirth and Cosmas of Prague followed this fact, though he didn't receive the information firsthand. Hence, his mistake would result in this point. In contrast, the correct date of birth of Boles\u0142aw would be 20 August, as indicated by Gallus. In the medieval tradition the year began on 25 December. In that case, the reports of Cosmas allow us to conclude that Boles\u0142aw was born in 1085. This information, however, was contradicted by the \"Kalendarz krakowski\", which gave the year as 1086. Judith was styled by the authors of the \"Kalendarz\" as \"regina Polonia\" (\"Queen of Poland\" in Latin), and this title could be associated with her father's coronation as King of Bohemia and Poland on 15 June 1086 (according to Cosmas). Karol Maleczy\u0144ski refuted Balzer's date for the coronation of Vratislav II, the one given by Cosmas. However, most researchers indicate that the coronation took place on 15 June 1085, so Judith could have been called Queen a year earlier.\nKarol Maleczy\u0144ski determined that the death of Judith took place on the night between 24 and 25 December 1085, and Boles\u0142aw was born four months before, on 20 August. Researchers found that the date given by the \"Rocznik kapitu\u0142y krakowskiej\" (24 December 1086) was the same established by Cosmas (25 December 1085). The difference in the year could be explained in the different style of dating followed by Cosmas, who began the year according to the Julian calendar on 1 January and Christmas (\"Nativitate\" in Latin) on 25 December. According to Maleczy\u0144ski, Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski failed to consider this calendar difference, which occurs only during the period of 25\u201331 December.\nArchaeologist Wojciech Szafra\u0144ski reassumed the theory of Bielowski: Judith of Bohemia died on 28 December 1085, and Boles\u0142aw was born two days before, on 26 December. According to Szafra\u0144ski Cosmas used the term \"VIII Calends of January\", with no specific date. However, in the Chronicle of Gallus should read that Judith died \"on Christmas Day\", but \"on Sunday in the Octave of Christmas\". Using such a broadened range of days, the investigator determined the birth of Boleslaw in the feast of Saint Stephen (26 December). For this reasons, the date of 1085 given by Bielowski is correct according to him. However, Jasi\u0144ski pointed the weaknesses of the argument of Szafra\u0144ski because Gallus has written about the Octave, but specifically about Christmas night, but the investigator didn't consider all other sources, as well as the achievements of research in genealogy.\nMarian Plezia argued that Boles\u0142aw was born on 2 September 1085 or 1086. According to Gallus, the day of King Stephen of Hungary was also celebrated on 2 September. Jasi\u0144ski considered this theory unfounded. In Poland the feast of King Stephen of Hungary is pointed by the \"Kalendarz krakowski\" and the \"kalendarz Kodeksu Gertrudy\" on 20 August. Besides, if Boles\u0142aw was born on 2 September, Gallus probably would be noted that this was the day after the celebration of Saint Giles (1 September), which was attributed to be the intercessor of his birth.\nKazimierz Jasi\u0144ski placed the death of Judith in the night between 24 and 25 December 1086 and the birth of Boles\u0142aw four months before, on 20 August. In this point he agrees with the findings of Balzer. He supported his views with additional arguments: All sources are based in the missing \"Rocznika kapitu\u0142y krakowskiej\", and the next known text of this source refers to events in 1086. Cosmas, writing his chronicle a few decades later, probably benefited from oral tradition and could make a mistake when he placed the year. His reports who placed the birth of Boles\u0142aw three days before the death of his mother denoted a quite short time.\nToday is widely recognized the view of both Jasi\u0144ski and Balzer, that Boles\u0142aw most likely was born in the day of King Stephen of Hungary, 20 August 1086. According to Cosmas of Prague, Boles\u0142aw was named after his uncle, Boles\u0142aw II the Generous. W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman had no reason to named his first-born legitimate son after his brother, but probably in this way tried to placate the former allies of his predecessor.\nBoles\u0142aw's nickname \"Wrymouth\" (pl: \"Krzywousty\") appeared in Polish and Latin sources of the 13th century: \"Genealogia p\u0142ocka (Criwousti)\" and the \"Rocznik \u015bwi\u0119tokrzyski m\u0142odszy (Crzyvousti)\". Probably the origin of this nickname dates back on the 12th century and is related with some physical characteristics of the Polish ruler, who were noticed at the time of his reign. Probably he began to be named in this way after 1114, because Gallus Anonymus in his \"Chronicle\" never mentioned it. In the \"Kronika ksi\u0105\u017c\u0105t polskich\" and \"Kronika polsko-\u015bl\u0105ska\" Boles\u0142aw was qualified by the Latin adjective \"curvus\", whose significance remains unclear. According to the 14th-century \"Kronika o Piotrze W\u0142ostowicu\" the duke was hunchbacked (Latin: \"gibbosus\") or had a crooked mouth. The 15th-century chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz wrote:\n He had a mouth on one side slightly bent, and for this he was called Wrymouth; however, this is not marred his face, and even added to him some charm.\nIn March 1972, in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral of P\u0142ock, where according to tradition Boles\u0142aw was buried, an archaeological research project was conducted. A coffin was discovered containing the bones of 16 men and women. One of the skulls, of a man who died aged 50, had a deformed mandible. There is a hypothesis that these remains belonged to Boles\u0142aw. Opponents of this theory suggest that the duke was named in this way many years after his death, and his contemporary Gallus did not mention any physical defect in the hero of his Chronicles. The defenders of the hypothesis argue that the work of Gallus has the characteristics of a panegyric in honor of Boles\u0142aw, because the chronicler did not mention his physical infirmities. It is also speculated that the bone damage occurred as a result of childbirth complications, which led to the death of his mother a few months later.\nThe nickname of Boleslaw was also explained in other ways. According to a legend, Boleslaw slammed his face against a wall after watching his father's subservience towards the Germans and Czechs. According to Jan D\u0142ugosz, the duke in his youth had an ulcer, which caused the deformity of his face. According to older historiography, he received the nickname Wrymouth for his perjury.\nEarly years.\nFollowing Boles\u0142aw's birth the political climate in the country changed. The position of Boles\u0142aw as an heir to the throne was threatened by the presence of Mieszko Boles\u0142awowic, who was already seventeen at the time and was furthermore, by agreement with W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman himself, the first in line to succeed. In all likelihood it was this situation that precipitated the young duke Mieszko's demise in 1089. In that same year Wladyslaw I Herman's first-born son Zbigniew was sent to a monastery in Quedlinburg, Saxony. This suggests that Wladyslaw I Herman intended to be rid of Zbigniew by making him a monk, and therefore depriving him of any chance of succession. This eliminated two pretenders to the Polish throne, secured young Boles\u0142aw's inheritance as well as diminished the growing opposition to Wladyslaw I Herman among the nobility. Shortly after his ascension, however, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman was forced by the barons to give up the \"de facto\" reins of government to Count Palatine Sieciech. This turn of events was likely due to the fact that Herman owed the throne to the barons, the most powerful of whom was Sieciech.\nAround this time W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman married again. The chosen bride was Judith-Maria, daughter of Emperor Henry III and widow of King Solomon of Hungary, who after her wedding took the name \"Sophia\" in order to distinguish herself from W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman's first wife. Through this marriage Boles\u0142aw gained three or four half-sisters, and as a consequence he remained the only legitimate son and heir. It is believed that the new Duchess was actively aiding Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country and that she became his mistress.\nPosition of Sieciech in Poland.\nIn 1090 Polish forces under Sieciech's command managed to gain control of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, and the rest were burned in order to thwart future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region's independence from Poland. The following year a punitive expedition was organized, in order to recover Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. The campaign was decided at the battle of the Wda River, where the Polish knights suffered a defeat despite the assistance of Bohemian troops.\nDuke Boles\u0142aw's childhood happened at a time when a massive emigration from Poland was taking place due to Sieciech's political repression. Most of the elites who became political refugees found safe haven in Bohemia. Another consequence of Sieciech's political persecution was the kidnapping of Zbigniew by Sieciech's enemies and his return from abroad in 1093. Zbigniew took refuge in Silesia, a stronghold of negative sentiment for both Sieciech and his nominal patron W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman. In the absence of Sieciech and Boles\u0142aw, who were captured by Hungarians, duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I then undertook a penal expedition to Silesia, which was unsuccessful and subsequently obliged him to recognize Zbigniew as a legitimate heir. In 1093 W\u0142adys\u0142aw I signed an Act of Legitimization which granted Zbigniew the rights of descent from his line. Zbigniew was also granted the right to succeed to the throne. Following Sieciech and Boles\u0142aw's escape from Hungary, an expedition against Zbigniew was mounted by the Count Palatine. Its aim was to nullify the Act of Legitimization. The contestants met at the battle of Gop\u0142o in 1096, where Sieciech's forces annihilated the supporters of Zbigniew. Zbigniew himself was taken prisoner, but regained his freedom a year later, in May 1097, due to the intervention of the bishops. At the same time his rights, guaranteed by the Act of Legitimization, were reinstated.\nSimultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. The tolerant rule of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman attracted the Jews who were permitted to settle throughout the entire kingdom without restrictions. The Polish duke took great care of the Hebrew Diaspora, as he understood its positive influence on the growth of the country's economy. The new Jewish citizens soon gained the trust of the gentiles during the rule of Boles\u0142aw III.\nYouth.\nDivision of the country.\nIn view of his father's disapproval, and after discovering the plans of Sieciech and Duchess Judith-Sophia to take over the country Zbigniew gained an ally in the young duke Boles\u0142aw. Both brothers demanded that the reins of government be handed over to them. It is difficult to believe, however, that Boles\u0142aw was making independent decisions at this point as he was only 12 years of age. It is postulated that at this stage he was merely a pawn in service of the Baron's power struggle. W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman, however, agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while the duke \u2013 W\u0142adys\u0142aw I himself \u2013 kept control of Mazovia and its capital at P\u0142ock. W\u0142adys\u0142aw also retained control of the most important cities, \"i.e.\", Wroc\u0142aw, Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz. Zbigniew's province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, \u0141\u0119czyca Land and Sieradz Land. Boles\u0142aw's territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land.\nThe division of the country under Boles\u0142aw and Zbigniew's co-rule greatly alarmed Sieciech, who then began preparing to dispose of the brothers altogether. Sieciech understood that the division of the country would undermine his position. He initiated a military settlement of the issue and he gained the duke's support for it. The position of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I is seen as ambiguous as he chose to support Sieciech's cause instead of his sons'.\nFight against Sieciech.\nIn response to Sieciech's preparations Boles\u0142aw and Zbigniew entered into an alliance at a popular assembly or Wiec organized in Wroc\u0142aw by a magnate named Skarbimir of the Awdaniec family. There it was decided to remove the current guardian of Boles\u0142aw, a noble named Wojslaw who was a relative of Sieciech, and arrange for an expedition against the Palatine. Subsequently, in 1099, the armies of Sieciech and duke Herman encountered the forces of Zbigniew and Boles\u0142aw near \u017barnowiec by the river Pilica. There the forces of Boles\u0142aw and Zbigniew defeated Sieciech's army, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman was obliged to permanently remove Sieciech from the position of Count Palatine. In the same year, at Christmas, Boles\u0142aw concluded a short-lived peace with Bohemia in \u017datec. According to Cosmas, Boles\u0142aw was appointed Miecznik (en: \"Sword-bearer\") of his uncle Bretislaus II, Duke of Bohemia. In addition, the young duke would be paid the amount of 100 pieces of fine silver and 10 talents of gold annually as a tribute to Bohemia (it was about the land of Silesia, for which he paid tribute to W\u0142adys\u0142aw I).\nThe rebel forces then headed to Sieciech\u00f3w, where the Palatine took refuge. Unexpectedly, duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw came to the aid of his besieged favorite with a small force. At this point, the dukes decided to depose their father. The opposition sent Zbigniew with an armed contingent to Masovia, where he was to take control of P\u0142ock, while Boles\u0142aw was directed to the South to encircle W\u0142adys\u0142aw's forces. W\u0142adys\u0142aw, however, predicted this maneuver and sent his forces back to Masovia. In the environs of P\u0142ock the battle was finally joined and the forces of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I were defeated. The duke was thereafter forced to send Sieciech into exile. The Palatine left Poland around 1100/1101 and spent time in German territory. He eventually returned to Poland but never played a political role again. He may have been blinded.\nFirst years of government.\nStruggle for supremacy (1102\u201306).\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman died on 4 June 1102. The country was divided into two provinces, each administered by one of the late duke's sons. The extent of each province closely resembled the provinces that the dukes were granted by their father three years earlier, the only difference being that Zbigniew also controlled Mazovia with its capital at P\u0142ock, effectively ruling the northern part of the kingdom, while his younger half-brother Boles\u0142aw ruled its southern portion. In this way two virtually separate states were created. According to some historians, Zbigniew tried to play the role of \"princeps\" or overlord, because at that time Boles\u0142aw was only 16 years old. Because he was still too inexperienced to independently direct his domains, the local nobility had great influence over political affairs, including his teacher, Skarbimir, from the Awdaniec family.\nThey conducted separate policies internally as well as externally. They each sought alliances, and sometimes they were enemies of one another. Such was the case with Pomerania, towards which Boles\u0142aw aimed his ambitions. Zbigniew, whose country bordered Pomerania, wished to maintain good relations with his northern neighbor. Boles\u0142aw, eager to expand his dominion, organized several raids into Pomerania and Prussia. In Autumn of 1102 Boles\u0142aw organized a war party into Pomerania during which his forces sacked Bia\u0142ogard.\nThe Pomeranians sent retaliatory war parties into Polish territory, but as Pomerania bordered Zbigniew's territory these raids ravaged the lands of the duke who was not at fault. Therefore, in order to put pressure on Boles\u0142aw, Zbigniew allied himself with Bo\u0159ivoj II of Bohemia, to whom he promised to pay tribute in return for his help. By aligning himself with Boles\u0142aw's southern neighbor Zbigniew wished to compel Boles\u0142aw to cease his raids into Pomerania. Boles\u0142aw, on the other hand, allied himself with Kievan Rus and Hungary. His marriage to Zbyslava, the daughter of Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich in 1103, was to seal the alliance between himself and the prince of Kiev. However, Boles\u0142aw's first diplomatic move was to recognize Pope Paschal II, which put him in strong opposition to the Holy Roman Empire. A later visit of papal legate Gwalo, Bishop of Beauvais, put church matters into order and increased Boles\u0142aw's influence.\nZbigniew declined to attend the marriage of Boles\u0142aw and Zbyslava. He saw this union and the alliance with Kiev as a serious threat. He bribed his ally, Bo\u0159ivoj II of Bohemia, to invade Boles\u0142aw's province, ostensibly to claim the Polish crown. Boles\u0142aw retaliated with expeditions into Pomerania in 1103 (including the battle of Ko\u0142obrzeg, where he was defeated) and Moravia in 1104\u201305, which brought the young duke not only loot, but also effectively ended the Pomeranian alliance. During the return of the army, one part, commanded by \u017belis\u0142aw, was defeated by the Bohemians. Boles\u0142aw, who commanded the other part, couldn't defeat them. Skarbimir bribed Bo\u0159ivoj II, who returned to his homeland and concluded a short-lived peace with Boles\u0142aw. Then Bo\u0159ivoj II ended his alliance with Zbigniew.\nThe intervention of Boles\u0142aw in a dynastic dispute in Hungary put him in a difficult political situation. At first, he supported the pretender \u00c1lmos, and marched to Hungary to help him. However, during the siege of Aba\u00fajv\u00e1r in 1104, \u00c1lmos changed his mind and made peace overtures to his brother and rival King Coloman, at that point Zbigniew's ally. Boles\u0142aw then retired his troops from Hungary and in 1105 made a treaty with Coloman. In addition, the Hungarian King broke his agreements with Bohemia. The dynastic dispute in Prague between Bo\u0159ivoj II and his cousin Svatopluk prompted Boles\u0142aw and his new ally King Coloman to intervene in support of Svatopluk. However, a new rebellion by \u00c1lmos forced Coloman and his army to return to Hungary. Boles\u0142aw also decided to retreat. Svatopluk tried to capture the city alone, but suffered a complete defeat and so his attempt to seize power in Bohemia was unsuccessful.\nAlso in 1105, Boles\u0142aw entered into an agreement with his half-brother, similar to that entered just a few years before with their stepmother Judith-Sophia, which, in exchange for abundant dower lands, secured her neutrality in Boles\u0142aw's political contest with Zbigniew. The treaty, signed in Tyniec, dealt with foreign policy, albeit with no agreement about Pomerania. One year later, the treaty ended when Zbigniew refused to help his half-brother in his fight against Pomerania. While hunting, Boles\u0142aw was unexpectedly attacked by them. In the battle, the young duke almost died. Bohemia, using the involvement of Boles\u0142aw in Pomeranian affairs as an excuse, attacked Silesia. The duke tried to re-establish the alliance with his half-brother, but without success, and so reached a rapprochement with Bohemia in 1106. Boles\u0142aw managed to bribe Bo\u0159ivoj II to join his side in the contest against Zbigniew and shortly after formally allied himself with Coloman of Hungary. With the help of his Kievan and Hungarian allies Boles\u0142aw attacked Zbigniew's territory, beginning a civil war. The allied forces of Boles\u0142aw easily took control of most important cities, including Kalisz, Gniezno, Spycimierz and \u0141\u0119czyca, in effect taking half of Zbigniew's lands. Through the mediation of Baldwin, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, a peace treaty was signed at \u0141\u0119czyca, in which Zbigniew officially recognized Boles\u0142aw as the Supreme Duke of all Poland. However, he was allowed to retain Masovia as a fief.\nSole Ruler of Poland.\nFirst Expedition to Bohemia and exile of Zbigniew.\nIn 1107 Boles\u0142aw III along with his ally King Coloman of Hungary invaded Bohemia in order to aid Svatopluk in gaining the Czech throne and to secure Polish interests to the south. The expedition was a complete success: on 14 May 1107 Svatopluk was made Duke of Bohemia in Prague.\nIn the winter of 1107\u201308, with the help of Kievan and Hungarian allies, Boles\u0142aw undertook a punitive expedition against his brother Zbigniew. One reason for this was that Zbigniew had not followed his orders and had refused to burn down one of the fortresses of Kur\u00f3w near Pu\u0142awy. Another reason was that Zbigniew had not performed his duties as a vassal by failing to provide military aid to Boles\u0142aw for a campaign against the Pomeranians. Boles\u0142aw's forces attacked Mazovia and quickly forced Zbigniew to surrender. Following this, Zbigniew was banished from the country and, with his followers, took refuge in Prague, where he gained the support of Svatopluk. From then Boles\u0142aw was the sole lord of the Polish lands, though in fact his over-lordship began in 1107 when Zbigniew paid him homage as his feudal lord.\nIn 1108 the balance of power in Europe changed. Svatopluk decided to pay homage to Emperor Henry V and in exchange received from him the formal investiture of Bohemia. At the same time King Coloman of Hungary was under attack from the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia. Svatopluk, joined by Zbigniew and his followers, also attacked Poland. Boles\u0142aw avoided a direct confrontation because he was busy fighting Pomerania. The Polish-Hungarian coalition gave aid and shelter to Bo\u0159ivoj II. Later that year, Boles\u0142aw and Coloman sent a new expedition to Bohemia, prompted by the invasion of Hungary by the German-Bohemian coalition (during which Pozsony Castle was put under siege) and the fact that Svatopluk, who owed Boles\u0142aw his throne, didn't honor his promise to return Silesian cities seized from Poland (Racib\u00f3rz, Kamieniec, Ko\u017ale among others) by his predecessors. Boles\u0142aw then decided to restore Bo\u0159ivoj II to the Bohemian throne, but was unable to do so owing to the need to divert his forces north to thwart a Pomeranian invasion.\nPolish-German War of 1109.\nIn response to Boles\u0142aw's aggressive foreign policy, the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, undertook a punitive expedition against Poland in 1109, assisted by Czech warriors provided by Svatopluk of Bohemia. The alleged \"casus belli\" was to restore Zbigniew to his former position. The Emperor gave Boles\u0142aw an ultimatum: he would abandon the expedition only if Boles\u0142aw gave Zbigniew half of Poland to rule, formally recognized Henry as overlord and paid 300 pieces of fine silver as a regular tribute. Boles\u0142aw rejected Henry's demands. During the negotiations between the Empire and Poland, the Polish ruler was in the middle of a war against Pomerania. On the west side of the Oder river, Henry V hurriedly gathered knights for his expedition against Poland. Before the fight ended in Pomerania, the German troops were able to approach G\u0142og\u00f3w.\nThe military operations mainly took place in Silesia in southwestern Poland, where Henry V's army laid siege to the major cities of G\u0142og\u00f3w, Wroc\u0142aw and Bytom Odrza\u0144ski. In addition to defending the towns, Boles\u0142aw conducted a guerrilla war against the Holy Roman Emperor and his allies. He reportedly defeated the expedition at the Battle of Hundsfeld on 24 August 1109, although the existence of this battle is doubted by historians because it was first recorded about a century later.\nSecond Expedition to Bohemia.\nIn 1110 Boles\u0142aw undertook an unsuccessful military expedition against Bohemia. His intention was to install yet another pretender on the Czech throne, Sob\u011bslav I, who sought refuge in Poland. During the campaign he won a decisive victory against the Czechs at the Battle of Trutina on 8 October 1110; however, following this battle he ordered his forces to withdraw. The reason for this is speculated to be the unpopularity of Sob\u011bslav I among Czechs as well as Boles\u0142aw's unwillingness to further harm his relations with the Holy Roman Empire. In 1111 a truce between Poland and the Empire was signed, stipulating that Sob\u011bslav I would be able to return to Bohemia while Zbigniew would be able to return Poland. Boles\u0142aw's assent was likely under pressure from the many supporters of the exiled duke in 1108, who, according to the reports of Gallus Anonymus, was surrounded by bad advisers (probably including Martin I, Archbishop of Gniezno). Once in Poland, his advisers persuaded Zbigniew to claim sovereignty over his previous domains. The first step was his presence at the Advent ceremonial, surrounded by attendants, with a sword carried before him, an exclusive prerogative of the ruler. As he had recognized Boles\u0142aw as his overlord in \u0141\u0119czyca in 1107, Boleslaw considered this an act of treason, causing a definitive breach in their relationship. Probably for these reasons, Zbigniew was blinded on Boles\u0142aw's orders in 1112.\nExcommunication.\nThe blinding of Zbigniew caused a strong negative reaction among Boles\u0142aw's subjects. Unlike in the east, blinding in medieval Poland was accomplished not by burning the eyes out with a red hot iron rod or knife, but employed a much more brutal technique in which the condemned's eyes were pried out using special pliers. The condemned was then made to open his eyes and if he did not do so, his eyelids were also removed.\nContemporary sources don't provide clear information on whether Boles\u0142aw was excluded from the community of the Church. It is generally believed that Archbishop Martin I of Gniezno (who was a strong supporter of Zbigniew) excommunicated Boles\u0142aw for blinding his half-brother. The excommunication exempted all Boles\u0142aw's subjects from their oaths of obedience. The duke was faced with a real possibility of an uprising of the sort that deposed Boles\u0142aw the Bold. Recognizing his precarious situation, Boles\u0142aw sought the customary penance that would reconcile him with the high priesthood. According to Gallus Anonymus, Boles\u0142aw first fasted for forty days and made gifts to the poor:\n (...)\"He slept in ashes and sackcloth, among the streams of tears and sobs, as he renounced communion and conversation with people.\"\nIt is possible that Boles\u0142aw decided to do this to rebuild his weakened authority and gain the favor of Zbigniew's supporters. Blinding his half-brother might have been perceived by Polish society as a breach of the principle of solidarity among the members of the ruling dynasty, a key foundation of public order.\nAccording to Gallus, Boles\u0142aw also sought and received forgiveness from his half-brother. In the next part of his penance, the duke made a pilgrimage to Hungary to the Abbeys of Saint Giles in Somogyv\u00e1r and Saint Stephen I in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The pilgrimage to the Abbey of Saint Giles also had a political goal; Boles\u0142aw strengthened his ties of friendship and alliance with the Arpad dynasty. Following his return to Poland, Boles\u0142aw even traveled to Gniezno to pay further penance at the tomb of Saint Adalbert of Prague, where poor people and clergy received numerous costly gifts from the duke. Only after this was the excommunication finally lifted. Following his repentance the Polish duke made a vague commitment to the Church.\nNo information survives about Zbigniew's death. In the obituary of the Benedictine monastery in Lubi\u0144 dated 8 July 1113 was reported the death of a monk in Tyniec called \"brother Zbigniew\". Historians believed that he could be Boles\u0142aw's half-brother. The information marked that his burial place was in the Benedictine monastery of Tyniec.\nConquest and conversion of Pomerania.\nThe loss of Pomerania during the reign of Casimir I the Restorer weakened the Polish state, and, during the second half of the 11th century, subsequent rulers were not able to recover all the lands that once belonged to Mieszko I and Boles\u0142aw I the Brave. Only after defeating Zbigniew and successfully opposing Bohemian claims against Silesia in 1109 was Boles\u0142aw III able to expand to the West.\nStrengthening the Polish-Pomeranian borders.\nThe conquest of Pomerania had been a lifelong pursuit for Boles\u0142aw. His political goals were twofold: strengthen the Polish border on the Note\u0107 river line, and subjugate Pomerania. He intended to exercise Polish political overlordship but not actually incorporate Pomerania with the exception of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania and a southern belt north of the River Note\u0107. By 1113 the northern border had been strengthened, including the fortification of Santok, Wiele\u0144, Nak\u0142o, Czarnk\u00f3w, Uj\u015bcie and Wyszogr\u00f3d. Some sources report that the border began at the mouth of the rivers Warta and Oder in the west, running along the Note\u0107 all the way to the Vistula.\nBefore Boles\u0142aw III began to expand in Gda\u0144sk Pomerania (Pomerelia), he normalized his political relations with Bohemia in 1114 at a great convention on the border of the Nysa K\u0142odzka river. He was assisted by Bohemian princes of the Premyslid line: namely, Vladislaus I, Otto II the Black and Sob\u011bslav I. The pact was sealed by the marriage of Boles\u0142aw (a widower since his wife Zbyslava's death) with Vladislaus I and Otto II's sister-in-law, the German noblewoman Salomea of Berg.\nThe conquest of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania.\nAfter normalising his relations with Bohemia, Boles\u0142aw conducted a successful expedition against Prussia in 1115. This secured Poland's north-east border, which allowed him to invade Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. The conquest of this part of the Pomeranian lands from 1115 to 1119 achieved a long-time aim of previous Polish rulers: the complete incorporation of the territories on the Vistula River, including the castellany of Nak\u0142o, into Poland. The northern borders of the Polish duchy were probably established on the line of the rivers Gwda and Uniesta (in later times these rivers were the boundary between Pomerania and the Oder Slavic). It is also possible that the border ran along the \u0141eba.\nThe local rulers of the conquered Gda\u0144sk and S\u0142upsk were replaced by Polish nobles. Boles\u0142aw also introduced Polish clerical organization, in order to protect his interests in that territory. However, these areas refused to follow the church organization. The incorporation into the Polish Church occurred only during 1125\u201326 at the time of the visit of the papal legate, Gilles, Cardinal-Bishop of Tusculum.\nRebellion of Skarbimir.\nDuring Boles\u0142aw's Pomeranian campaign a rebellion led by Count Palatine Skarbimir from the Awdaniec family began. The rebellion was quelled by the duke in 1117 and the mutinous nobleman was blinded as punishment. The conflict between Boles\u0142aw and the Awdaniec family is difficult to explain due to the lack of sources. The cause was probably the growing influence of the family, Skarbimir's ambition, and his jealousy of Boles\u0142aw and his increased popularity. Other probable factors were the desire to establish W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, Boles\u0142aw's first-born son, as the sole ruler after his death, or Boleslaw's fears of losing his position, as had happened in the conflict with Sieciech. It was also suggested that Skarbimir contacted the Pomeranians and Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus'. Medieval historiography also associated the rebellion with the Law of Succession issued by Boleslaw. The underlying inheritance controversy arose between 1115 and 1116, after the birth of his second son Leszek, first of his second marriage. According to one hypothesis, Skarbimir objected to the adoption of the statute, which changed the traditional Polish succession customs. In the suppression of the rebellion a major role was played by Piotr W\u0142ostowic of the Labedz family, who replaced Skarbimir as Count Palatine. On his defeat, Skarbimir received a minor punishment from Boles\u0142aw. The rebellion of Skarbimir also underlined the importance of the conquest of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania.\nIntervention of Kievan Rus'.\nThe Rurikid ruler Vladimir II Monomakh and his sons are believed to have intervened in Skarbimir's rebellion. In 1118 Monomakh incorporated Volhynia into his domains and expelled the ruler, Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich, who sought refuge first in Hungary, then in Poland. In Yaroslav's place, Monomakh made his son Roman ruler of Volhynia, and after Roman's early death in 1119, replaced him with another son, Andrew, who invaded Polish territory in 1120 with the support of the Kipchaks tribe. A year later, Boles\u0142aw, with his brother-in-law, the exiled Yaroslav, organized a retaliatory expedition to Czermno. For several years thereafter Boles\u0142aw intervened in the dynastic disputes of the House of Rurik.\nDuring the 1120s the Kievan princes continued their expeditions against Poland. The neutrality of the neighbouring Principality of Peremyshl was attributed to Count Palatine Piotr W\u0142ostowic, who in 1122 captured Prince Volodar. A year later Boles\u0142aw intervened again in Volhynia, where he wished to restore Yaroslav. The expedition (aided by Bohemian, Hungarian, Peremyshl and Terebovl forces) failed due to the death of Yaroslav and the stubborn resistance of the besieged Volodymyr-Volynskyi, aided by Skarbimir's supporters. This failed military expedition led to disturbances in the Polish-Hungarian-Halych alliance.\nConquest of Western Pomerania.\nIn 1121 (or 1119) Pomeranian Dukes Wartislaw I and Swietopelk I were defeated by Boles\u0142aw's army at the battle of Niek\u0142ad\u017a near Gryfice. Polish troops ravaged Pomerania, destroyed native cities, and forced thousands of Pomeranians to resettle deep into Polish territory. Boles\u0142aw's further expansion was directed to Szczecin (1121\u201322). He knew that this city was well defended by both the natural barrier of the Oder river and his well-built fortifications, like Ko\u0142obrzeg. The only way to approach the walls was through the frozen waters of a nearby swamp. Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Boles\u0142aw launched his assault from precisely that direction, and took control of the city. Much of the population was slaughtered and the survivors were forced to pay homage to the Polish ruler.\nBoles\u0142aw probably fought battles on the western side of the Oder, as well as near Lake Morzyce (now the German \"M\u00fcritz\"), which were technically outside of Pomerania. At the same time, Lothair, Duke of Saxony (and future Holy Roman Emperor), also moved against this area. According to contemporary sources, a Saxon army approached from above the Elbe River in the direction of modern-day Rostock. They conquered the Warinis, Circipanes, Kessinians and part of the Tollensers tribes. This two-pronged expansion was probably the result of earlier unknown agreements between the rulers. This was the first step for the later Christianization of Pomeranian lands.\nIn 1122 Boles\u0142aw finally conquered Western Pomerania, which became a Polish fief. Duke Wartislaw I was forced to pay homage, as well as an annual tribute of 500 marks of fine silver to the Polish ruler, and was further obliged to give military aid at Boles\u0142aw's request. In subsequent years the tribute was reduced to 300 marks. This success enabled Boles\u0142aw to make further conquests. In 1123 his troops even reached R\u00fcgen, but failed to conquer it.\nAccording to modern historiography, Boles\u0142aw began to pay tribute to Emperor Henry V, at least from 1135, believed to have been 500 marks of fine silver annually. It is unknown why Boles\u0142aw did this, as the sources do not contain any reference to the Polish ruler being tributary to the Holy Roman Empire in the period 1121\u201335.\nChristianization of Western Pomerania.\nIn order to strengthen ties with Pomerania, Boles\u0142aw organized a mission to Christianize the newly acquired territory. At the same time he wished to subordinate Pomerania to the Gniezno Archbishopric. Unfortunately first attempts made by unknown missionaries did not make the desired progress. Another attempt, officially sponsored by Boles\u0142aw and led by Bernard the Spaniard, who traveled to Wolin during 1122\u201323, ended in another failure. The next two missions were carried out in 1124\u201325 and 1128 by Bishop Otto of Bamberg (called the Apostle of Pomerania). After appropriate consultation with Boles\u0142aw, Bishop Otto set out on the first stage of Christianization of the region in 1124. During the mission Otto stayed first at Boles\u0142aw's court, where he was provided with appropriate equipment, fire and several clergymen for his trip to Pomerania.\nThe Bishop was accompanied throughout his mission by the Pomeranian ruler Wartislaw I, who greeted him on the border of his domains, in the environs of the city of Sanok. In Stargard the pagan prince promised Otto his assistance in the Pomeranian cities as well as help during the journey. He also assigned 500 armored knights to act as guards for the bishop's protection, and obtain the baptism of the elders tribal leaders. Primary missionary activities were directed to Pyrzyce, then the towns of Kamie\u0144, Wolin, Szczecin and once again Wolin. In the first two towns the Christianization went without resistance. In Kamie\u0144 the task was facilitated by the intercession of Wartislaw I's own wife and dignitaries. At Szczecin and Wolin, which were important centers of Slavic paganism, opposition to conversion was particularly strong among the pagan priests and local population. The conversion was finally accepted only after Boles\u0142aw lowered the annual tribute imposed on the Pomeranians. Four great pagan temples were torn down and churches were built in their places. Otto's mission of 1124 ended with the erection of bishoprics in Lubusz for Western Pomerania and in Kruszwica for Eastern Pomerania (Gda\u0144sk), which was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Gniezno.\nIn 1127 the first pagan rebellions began to take place. These were due to both the large tribute imposed by Poland as well as a plague that descended on Pomerania, which was blamed on Christianity. The rebellions were largely instigated by the old pagan priests, who had not come to terms with their new circumstances. Wartislaw I confronted these uprisings with some success, but was unable to prevent several insurgent raids into Polish territory. Because of this Boles\u0142aw prepared a massive punitive expedition that may have spoiled all the earlier accomplishments of the missionary work by Bishop Otto. Thanks to Otto's diplomacy, direct confrontation was avoided and in 1128 he embarked on another mission to Pomerania. Wartislaw I greeted Otto at Demmin with some Polish knights. This time more pressure was applied to the territories west of the Oder River, i.e. Usedom, Wolgast and G\u00fctzkow, which weren't under Polish suzerainty. The final stage of the mission returned to Szczecin, Wolin and Kamie\u0144. The Christianization of Pomerania is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of Boles\u0142aw's Pomeranian policy.\nIn late 1120s Boles\u0142aw concluded an alliance with King Niels of Denmark, directed against Wartislaw I and the attempts of Lothair III, King of Germany to subordinate Western Pomerania. Around 1128, Niels' son Magnus married Ryksa, Boles\u0142aw's eldest daughter. In retaliation for the sack of P\u0142ock by Wartislaw I in 1128, Polish-Danish troops took the Western Pomeranian islands of Wolin and Usedom.\nAt end of the 1120s Boles\u0142aw began to implement an ecclesiastical organization of Pomerania. Gda\u0144sk Pomerania was added to the Diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek, known at the time as the Kujavian Diocese. A strip of borderland north of Note\u0107 was split between the Diocese of Gniezno and Diocese of Poznan. The bulk of Pomerania was, however, made an independent Pomeranian bishopric (whose first bishop, Adalbert, was one of the participants in the missionary expedition and former Polish royal chaplain), set up in the territory of the Duchy of Pomerania in 1140, and, after Boles\u0142aw died in 1138, the duchy became independent of Poland.\nThe project of Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg.\nDuring the 1130s, Norbert, Archbishop of Magdeburg undertook a project under which Pomerania would be divided between two dioceses subordinated to his archbishopric. At the same time, he revived the old claims of Magdeburg's ecclesiastical sovereignty over all Poland. A first Bull was prepared by 1131, but never entered into force. Despite this setback, Norbert continued to attempt to subdue the Polish Church during 1132\u201333. A call was made in the Curia on behalf of the Polish bishops.\nThe Polish bishops didn't appear before Pope Innocent II, which resulted in the issuing of the Bull \"Sacrosancta Romana\" in 1133, which confirmed the sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg over the Polish Church and the projected Pomeranian dioceses. The formal \"privilegium maius\" was the culmination of Norbert's efforts. Boles\u0142aw, trying to save his past efforts in Pomeranian politics, submitted at Merseburg in 1135.\nConquest of R\u00fcgen and alliance with Wartislaw I.\nTo consolidate his power over Pomerania Boles\u0142aw conducted an expedition to the island of R\u00fcgen in 1130 with Danish support. The fleet transported Polish troops to R\u00fcgen, but the intended battle on the island never happened, because, at the sight of the Polish-Danish combined forces, the defending Rani recognized Boles\u0142aw's overlordship.\nAfter the successful invasion of the Danish capital, Roskilde, in 1134, Boles\u0142aw formed an alliance with Wartislaw I of Pomerania against King Eric II of Denmark, an ally of Emperor Lothair III. The role of the Polish duke was limited to aiding the House of Griffins, not due while the real interest in Danish affairs. The Danish, after repelling the first attack, led a successful retaliatory expedition and expansion into Pomerania.\nCongress of Merseburg.\nPolitical Background.\nIn 1125 Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, died. His successor, Lothair of Supplinburg, was embroiled in disputes over his inheritance, and became involved in papal politics. In 1130 there was a double election to the Apostolic See. Lothair supported Pope Innocent II, hoping in this way to secure his own coronation. Contrary to expectations, Lothair's Imperial coronation didn't end his disputes against the contenders for the German throne.\nIn 1130 Boles\u0142aw controlled the areas situated on the left bank of the Oder river on the island of R\u00fcgen. Germany had designs on these lands, but its internal political situation and its involvement in a civil war in Hungary, made an armed conflict impractical. The death of King Stephen II of Hungary in 1131 had led to war between two claimants to the throne: B\u00e9la the Blind (son of \u00c1lmos, Duke of Croatia) and Boris (the alleged son of King Coloman). Boris sought the help of the Polish ruler, who hoped for a closer alliance with Hungary and cooperation with the Kievan princes (Boris was a son of a daughter of Vladimir II Monomakh). However, Boles\u0142aw overestimated his strength against B\u00e9la, who had the support of almost all his country. The Polish army faced the combined forces of Hungary, Bohemia, Austria and Germany in the Battle of the Saj\u00f3 River (22 July 1132), where the coalition achieved complete victory over the Polish duke, who was forced to retreat.\nThe success in Hungary was used by the Bohemian ruler Sob\u011bslav I, an Imperial vassal, who during 1132\u201334, repeatedly invaded Silesia. The question of Silesia's property was left to Lothair III. Around the same time, the bull \"Sacrosancta Romana\" of 1133 gave the Archbishopric of Magdeburg sovereign rights over the Pomeranian dioceses instituted by Boles\u0142aw.\nPreparations for the Congress.\nIn February 1134 Sob\u011bslav I of Bohemia and dignitaries of King B\u00e9la II of Hungary, together with Peter, Bishop of Transylvania, went to Altenburg, where they presented their allegations against the Polish ruler. They again, as they had two years before, requested the intervention of the Holy Roman Empire. Lothair III agreed to arbitrate the various dynastic disputes.\nAt the same time B\u00e9la II and Prince Volodymyrko of Peremyshl undertook a military expedition against Poland. The combined forces occupied Lesser Poland, reaching to Wi\u015blica. Shortly after, Boles\u0142aw received a summons to the Imperial court at Magdeburg on 26 June 1135. He sent deputies in his stead in order to play for time. The emperor sent another delegation and requested his personal appearance on 15 August 1135, this time in Merseburg. Boles\u0142aw realized that without an agreement with Lothair III he couldn't maintain control over the newly conquered lands on the west side of the Oder and the island of R\u00fcgen.\nEven before the Congress of Merseburg took place, Boles\u0142aw persuaded one of ruling dukes of Western Pomerania, Ratibor I, to make an expedition against Denmark, a clear provocation to Emperor Lothair III, as the King of Denmark was a German vassal. A Pomeranian fleet of 650 boats (with 44 knights and 2 horses) attacked the rich Norwegian port city of Kungah\u00e4lla (now Kung\u00e4lv in Sweden).\nProvisions of the Congress.\nThe Congress took place on 15 August 1135. During the ceremony, Emperor Lothair III recognized the rights of the Polish ruler over Pomerania. In return, Boles\u0142aw agreed to pay homage for the Pomeranian lands and the Principality of R\u00fcgen, with the payment of 6,000 pieces of fine silver from these lands to the Holy Roman Empire; however, he remained fully independent ruler of his main realm, Poland. With Boles\u0142aw's death in 1138, Polish authority over Pomerania ended, triggering competition of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark for the area. The conflict with Hungary also ended, with Boles\u0142aw recognizing B\u00e9la II's rule. The agreement was sealed with the betrothal of Boles\u0142aw's daughter Judith with B\u00e9la II's G\u00e9za (this marriage never took place). In the case of the Bohemian-Polish dispute the Imperial mediation failed. Boles\u0142aw argued he must be treated as a sovereign ruler, which wasn't the case of Sob\u011bslav I, an imperial vassal. Lothair III, unable to come to an agreement with the Polish ruler, proposed to discuss the matter in subsequent negotiations.\nThe Congress ended with church ceremonies, during which Boles\u0142aw carried the imperial sword. This was an honor granted only to sovereign rulers. An indirect goal of Polish diplomacy was the successful invalidation of the Papal Bull of 1133 and the recognition of metropolitan rights of the Archbishopric of Gniezno at the Synod of Pisa in 1135. On 7 July 1136, Pope Innocent II issued the protectionist Bull \"Ex commisso nobis a Deo\" under which the unquestioned sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Gniezno over the Polish dioceses was confirmed.\nLast years and death.\nNormalization of relations with his neighbors.\nAfter coming under the imperial sphere of influence, Poland normalized its relations with Bohemia at the Congress of K\u0142odzko on 30 May 1137 (the so-called \"Peace of K\u0142odzko\"), but the details of this agreement are unknown. This treaty was confirmed in the town of Niemcza, where W\u0142adys\u0142aw, the eldest son of Boles\u0142aw, stood as godfather in the baptism of Wenceslaus, Sob\u011bslav I's son.\nIn the last years of his life, Boles\u0142aw's main concern was to arrange political marriages for his children in order to strengthen his relations with neighboring countries. In 1137 Boles\u0142aw reinforced his relations with the Kievan Rus' with the marriage of his son Boles\u0142aw with Princess Viacheslava, daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Pskov. In the year of his death, he finally normalized his relations with Hungary through the marriage of his son Mieszko with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King B\u00e9la II.\nDeath.\nBoles\u0142aw III Wrymouth died on 28 October 1138, probably in the town of Sochaczew. There are no records about the circumstances of his death, and twelfth-century sources don't provide information about his place of burial. It was only in the 15th century that Jan D\u0142ugosz recorded that the duke's tomb was in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral in P\u0142ock. He didn't reveal the source of this information, but it was presumably from the lost \"Rocznik mazowiecki\". Wawrzyniec Wszerecz, Canon of P\u0142ock during the 16th\u201317th centuries, wrote that Boles\u0142aw was in a common coffin at the cathedral, where the remains of his father W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman and several other Piast Masovian rulers were also placed. In his testament he divided his lands among his sons into five principalities.\nFamily.\nFirst marriage.\nZbyslava of Kiev (c. 1085/90 \u2013 c. 1114), his first wife, was a member of the Rurikid dynasty. She was the daughter of Grand Prince Sviatopolk II of Kiev. The marriage was probably concluded in 1103 in order to obtain future military help from Kiev in the fight against Zbigniew. This union also notoriously limited the attacks of the princes of Galicia and Terebovlia against Poland. Until Zbyslava's death, relations between Poland and the Principality of Galicia\u2013Volhynia remained friendly. The children born from this marriage were:\nOlder historiography referred to an unnamed second son born from the marriage of Boles\u0142aw and Zbyslava. Gallus Anonymous wrote that this son was born around 1107\u201308. According to Oswald Balzer, he died shortly after birth. However, Karol Maleczy\u0144ski believed that he never existed, noting that the sources who provided the year of 1105 as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's date of birth (\"Rocznik \u015bwi\u0119tokrzyski\" and \"Rocznik kapitulny\") were probably mistaken.\nSecond marriage.\nSalomea of Berg (c. 1093/1101 \u2013 27 July 1144), his second wife, was German, the daughter of Count Henry of Berg-Schelklingen. The marriage took place in January or February 1115. This union was connected with the signing of a peace treaty between Poland and Bohemia. Salomea came from a powerful family, who, having supported the opposition after the death of Emperor Henry V in 1125, lost its political influence at the court of Lothair III.\nOlder historiography attributed another two daughters from the marriage of Boles\u0142aw and Salomea: Adelaide and Sophia. Adelaide (c. 1114 - 25 March before 1132), was the first wife of Adalbert II the Pious, eldest son of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria. Modern historians deny that she was a daughter of Boles\u0142aw. Sophia (d. 10 October 1136), was probably the mother of Mateusz, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w.\nIn older historiography Adelaide, a supposed daughter of Emperor Henry IV, was erroneously considered to be another wife of Boles\u0142aw. The information about this stated that after the death of Zbyslava, Boles\u0142aw married her in Bamberg in 1110. This report is provided by Jan D\u0142ugosz and Archdeacon Sulger. This view was challenged by Oswald Balzer.\nSuccession provisions.\nSenioral principle.\nBoles\u0142aw's experiences during his youth probably motivated him to make a division of his domains among his surviving sons. The loyal Count Palatine Piotr W\u0142ostowic was appointed to execute the provisions. In his testament, also known as the \"Statute of Succession\", Boles\u0142aw introduced the \"senioral principle\" in Poland in an effort to preserve the unity of the state and to prevent a power struggle among his sons. This regulation about the succession came into force after Boles\u0142aw's death, although is unknown the exact date of his establishment. It is believed that its creation may have occurred in 1115 or 1116, after the birth of his son Leszek, or after the suppression of the rebellion of Skarbimir (in 1117). Sources indicate that the original document about the succession was drawn up in 1137. The Statute was nullified in 1180 but restored by Pope Innocent III in 1210 after a petition of the Silesian rulers; however, historians challenge this account in the absence of any other information.\nThe senioral principle established that the eldest member of the dynasty was to have supreme power over the rest and was also to control an indivisible \"senioral part\": a vast strip of land running north\u2013south down the middle of Poland, with Krak\u00f3w its chief city. The senior duke's prerogatives also included control over Pomerania, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Sources showed a discrepancy in terms of the power exercised by the senior duke. Pope Innocent III wrote about primogeniture, while Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek refers to both seniority and primogeniture. Kad\u0142ubek combined in one sentence the two systems, \"i.e.\", inheritance of supreme power in individual districts, where primogeniture was in force. Among historians, there is a view that what Boles\u0142aw established was not seniority, but primogeniture that belongs exclusively to W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his descendants. The coverage and nature of power exercised by Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly in 1146 supports this hypothesis.\nDivision of the Polish state.\nBoles\u0142aw divided his domains into the following provinces:\nThe Seniorate Province (with his capital Krak\u00f3w) was supposed to be non-inherited and indivisible. It consisted of Lesser Poland, Sieradz and \u0141\u0119czyca, the western part of Kruszwica and Kuyavia, the eastern part of Greater Poland, Kalisz, Gniezno and Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. Western Pomerania as a fief would remain under the control of the senior duke.\nCasimir II, Boles\u0142aw's youngest son, was not included in the testament, because he was born after his father's death or shortly before.\nAmong medievalists there is a view that the Statute only provide the inheritance of Boles\u0142aw's descendants in the first generation (\"i.e.\", his sons). After their deaths, their lands were to be included in the Seniorate Province. However, the later fights between them transformed the provinces into hereditary domains.\nFeudal division of Poland.\nThe \"Senioral Principle\" was soon broken, leading to a period of nearly 200 years of Polish disintegration, also known as feudal fragmentation, a phenomenon common in medieval Europe. Among other countries affected by this were Russia, Hungary, and Germany. This was a time of internal struggles that caused the weakening of the Polish state and the enormous growth of internal development, culture, and improvement of the situation of the broader population. Distribution of the then-princely rights by contemporary historiography also had benefits, which include: the reconstruction of the political system in the new economic fundamentals and placement of greater responsibility for the fate of the country upon its upper echelons.\nOrganization of state.\nA detailed knowledge of the internal organization of the 12th century Polish state is impossible. There are no documents from this period and the reports of chroniclers reflect a lack of real knowledge of the principality's management.\nBoles\u0142aw divided his domains into provinces, districts and gords (Polish: ; a type of fortified village or castellany). The \"Opole\" remained within this structure. The territorial scope of the province corresponded to the later \"Dzielnica\". It is believed that 6\u20137 provinces were created: Masovia, Silesia, Greater Poland, Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Kalisz-\u0141\u0119czyca and Pomerania (from the lands of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania). During Boles\u0142aw's reign attempts were made to organize the border areas into marches following the German model. Among the marches corroborated in the available sources are: G\u0142og\u00f3w, Gda\u0144sk and probably Lubusz. Boles\u0142aw likely had a number of well-maintained castles that served political, economic and administrative roles.\nThe state's nature during the Piast dynasty was patrimonial. The ducal court (Latin: \"curia ducis\") was a center of power, which belonged to the reigning family (along with a separate court for the duchess); after them came the secular and Church dignitaries and subjects, then lower officials, knights, courtiers, and chaplains. The most important office at the court of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman and Boles\u0142aw was the count palatine, also known as voivode. The duties of the count palatine (Latin: \"comes palatinus\") included major command of the military expeditions in place of the ruler, defense of the State, supervision of the administration as head of the ducal court, control and appointment of the heads of the castellanies, and the administration of the courts. The office of count palatine was abolished in 1180. The Polish bureaucracy developed as early as the reign of Mieszko II Lambert. The collector (Latin: \"camerarius\") managed the economy of the ducal court. Among other offices in the ducal court were the cze\u015bnik (\"cup-bearer\"), the stolnik (esquire), the stra\u017cnik (guard), the miecznik (\"Sword-bearer\"), the Koniuszy (\"Master of the Horse\") and the \u0141owczy (\"Master of the Hunt\"). During Boles\u0142aw's reign appeared the office of the chancellor, who directed the work of the court offices and the ducal chapel (Latin: \"capella\"), which consisted of a bunch of secular and religious duties. Micha\u0142 Awdaniec was a chancellor at this time. Also under the central government were the treasurer, the Mint Master, and others. During the rule of Boles\u0142aw the structure of the state was closely linked to the organization of the Polish Church, given that the church was subject to the ruler, who had the right of Investiture.\nThe ducal court was in contact with the subjects via the castellanies, who were managed by the \"Naczelnik\" or Town Chief (Latin: \"princeps terrae\"). He had sovereignty over the castellanies or gords (Latin: \"comes\"), while the castellans (grod rulers) should exercise the local civil authority, getting benefits from the public, organizing the defense and probably exercising the courts. Under the direct obligation of the ruler are the bailiff, the \u017aupan (gastald), the minters, the celnik (tax collector) and collectors. All important functions in the principality are held by the nobility. The castellan belonged to the group of nobles, officials and ministerialis. Some had served directly to the ruler, others held the offices, while the role of others are of food shortages. The Margraves (who are in charge of the border areas) were directly subordinate to the Polish ruler and had greater power than the provincial chiefs.\nAt the end of the 11th century, waned this princely organization. Was replaced with the Western European model of troops consisting of chivalry. The Latin term \"milites\", which had been used to determine the soldiers came to be called the category of knights and warriors who could afford to keep a horse. Polish armed forces in Boles\u0142aw's times are composed of three types of forces: the princely army (\"Oddzia\u0142u nadwornego\"), the lord's army (\"Dru\u017cyny mo\u017cnow\u0142adc\u00f3w\") and the militia (\"Pospolite ruszenie\"), composed of branches of small feudal lords and peasants (according to other views the militia adjutant troops were powerful and also composed by clergy and laity).\nThe princely army consisting of his nobles\u2014at the end of the 11th century, the so-called \"New People\" (pl: \"Nowi Ludzie\"): tribal chiefs, local leaders and opolne rulers who aspired to participate in government, sent their sons to the duke's court, where he was accompanied the ruler. Boles\u0142aw's personal guard was probably chosen by himself, using an invocation which was written in the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymous:\n A young people, with great manners and high birth, by at my side constantly in battle, with me accustomed to hardships!\nThe nobles maintained their own army, which consisted of poor knights supported by peasants. They also are responsible for their armament. Among the equipment used by them was a wooden weapons (like spear), blunt weapons (like club), cutting weapons (like sword) and belching weapons (like crossbow, bow and arrow, sling), and the so-called protective equipment (shield, helmet, armor). These armies over time become larger than the princely one, the most notorious example from this was Sieciech. During the constant conflicts at the beginning of the 12th century, the nobles invoked the militia, particularly of endangered lands. The whole militia was divided into branches, which were given the names of their native districts (for example, the \"Kruszwiczan hordes\"). In the case of an armed conflict to a greater weapon are invoked independent branches composed by peasants (for example, during 1109).\nIn addition to the nobles (who were tied to the ruler and his court) and warriors the Polish society in Boles\u0142aw's times also consisted of free peasants and servants (attached to his place of residence). A distinct social group were the free people, the so-called guests (Latin: \"hospites\") -who do not own property-, the warriors (Latin: \"milites gregarii\") who had farms and are counted into the common people. At the end of the social scale are the slaves (bra\u0144cy of war, or their descendants). There are little difference between them and the free peasants, but their duty to their master was higher. Non-free population was also used for personal services or to work on the land in favor of the ruler.\nAll aspects of life in the state were regulated by the ducal judge (Latin: \"ius ducale\"). He covered all the rights of the duke, in relation to the subjects or property, the enforcement of a variety of benefits, dues and ministries. The expanded state apparatus and the church maintained by benefits from the population producing material goods. The main burden of the tax rests on the lowest social class: the peasantry (Latin: \"heredes, rustici ducis, possesores\"). Up to them to submit certain levies, tithes, and other forms of taxes like the \"podworowe\" (in the form of a cow, which consisted of the entire village), \"podymne\" (for every house), \"poradlne\" (for each piece of land), \"narzazu\" (for grazing pigs in the woods), the \"stacji\" or \"stanu\" (who allow the maintenance of the duke's court) and the \"pos\u0142ug komunikacyjnych\", who regulated the transport ways in the country and was divided in three main taxes: \"przew\u00f3d\" (\"the cable\"), \"pow\u00f3z\" (\"the carriage\") and \"podw\u00f3d\" (\"the wagon\"). Other minor taxes involved hunting, military, guards (who had custody the gords), taxes on regalia and criminal penalties. In addition, subjects were required to repair roads, bridges, construction and maintenance of castles.\nSeals and coinage.\nOf the five oldest preserved seals from Polish rulers four were discovered in various places during 2002\u201306, while one of more than 100 years ago. Polish archaeologists made further discoveries in G\u0142\u0119bokie (2002), in Ostr\u00f3w Tumski (2005), in Gniezno (2005) and in an undisclosed location in the village of Susk near Sierpc, 32\u00a0km. from P\u0142ock (2006). The first preliminary studies suggested that the seals could belonged to Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth. They are made of lead, a durable material, with a diameter of 36\u201340\u00a0mm. The lead seals are used at that time in European courts and are from the \"Bulla\" tipe. Seals are known in municipal and military orders. Occasionally, in the most important documents (acts) were used golden bullas.\nThe discovered bullas from Boles\u0142aw's reign fall into two major types, differing in the form of writing:\nOne example from both type of seals came from the relationship with St. Adalbert, where he emphasizes his pontifical recognition (in type I) and in the crosier, with the gesture of the imposition of hands, clearly visible in the seals after restoration (in type II). The use of the genitive seals in Poland came from the 12th century, a phenomenon (unprecedented), with its only then monetary equivalent in the denarius with the Latin legend: \"Denarivs ducis Bolezlai\". At the end of Boles\u0142aw's reign returned to the staid mold inscriptions with the Latin legend: \"Dvx Bolezlavus\". According to S. Suchodolski the bullas were used for the authentication of princely documents like letters, privileges, judgments, etc., and by T. Jurek, they could also be used to secure the business arrangements (like buy of doors, chests, reliquaries).\nIn October 2006, the Pozna\u0144 Society of Friends of Learning has confirmed that the discovered bullas during 2002\u201305 belonged to Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth.\nDuring Boles\u0142aw's reign appeared a two-sided denarius, which was denominated the foreign coin (Polish: \"monet\u0105 obc\u0105\"). The first known denarius from this time bears the Latin legend \"Bolezlav\". For the others most commonly used coins bears the Latin inscription \"Bolezlavs, denarivus, dicis Bolezlai\" with St. Adalbert in the reverse. Another type of coins didn't have legends. They differ mostly came from the weight: they were much lighter, punched for purely economic purposes.\nIn this time was also modeled mainly on the Magdeburg technique a bracteate, who was one of the oldest in Europe. There are two types of bracteates who dated from Boles\u0142aw's reign:\nIn addition to the two presented bracteates from Boles\u0142aw's there is one, which is now counted among the oldest known in numismatics. This bracteate was found in Brzeg (in Gmina P\u0119czniew) and preserved almost the 2/3 part of the whole weight of 0.61 g and a diameter of 27\u00a0mm. The coin shows the figure of the ruler with crown, sword in hand and an outstretched hand. Initially, was believed that showed W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile. Further studies, included by A. Mikolajczyk, identified this image with Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth. Among researchers, however, today, there are discrepancies about what ruler showed the coin, because the inscription preserved is incomplete.\nPrincely mints are mostly located in Wroc\u0142aw, P\u0142ock, Gniezno and Krak\u00f3w. In that time also existed private mints, such as Palatine Sieciech, who placed them in Sieciech\u00f3w and near Krak\u00f3w.\nChurch foundations.\nIt was customary during the 12th-century for ruling families to engage in wide-ranging religious activities like donations in the benefit of the Church. The main objective was to spread Christianity. This was to legitimize religious rulers in the face of God, church hierarchs, clergy and society. Boles\u0142aw was not the exception, and he was not only a predatory warrior, a cunning politician and a diplomat; he was also a patron of cultural developments in his realm.\nLike most medieval monarchs, he founded several churches and monasteries. Among the most important of which are: \n \"The pious Duke Boles\u0142aw founded in \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra an Abbey dedicated to the Holy Trinity with monks of the Order of St. Benedict\".\nStored documents from about 1427 (called the \"\u015bwi\u0119tokrzyskie dokumenty pergaminowe\") confirm the history of the Bishop, adding that the co-founder of the monastery was the knight Wojs\u0142aw.\nThe connection of Boles\u0142aw and his second wife Salomea with the Swabian monastery of Zwiefalten was well known. The detailed description of Berthold of Zwiefalten was the only evidence of the cultural, artistic and religious development of the 12th-century Polish court:\n The Polish Duke Boles\u0142aw sent the black cover choirs black, sewn white oxen [...] the gold, the silver, and the tablecloths, and especially in the most numerous of any kind of valuable furs to this monastery more than seventy grzywna. Salomea, his wife, sent gold woven stole, two alb knitted silk and silver pitcher with four grzywna on the box of ivory studded with gold, to draw up the choir covers his red coat decorated with gold stripes, and another coat on for the Mass all interwoven gold, dissuaded gold stripes and bottom trimmed with red frames, which according to the custom of the people is decorated with golden stars, curtain wall, one with a silk frames, the other adorned with white lions and the third red in the white list, [...] a hand from Saint Stephen the Martyr [...], a large piece of the Holy Cross, a tooth from Saint John the Baptist, a tooth from Saint Pancras, a tooth of Saint Cecilia, some of the blood of Christ, milk of the Virgin Mary and a chain of Saint Peter. In addition, one hundred pounds of silver, one gold appliqu\u00e9 alb, a cross gold weighing more than four fine gold, a silver gilt chalice, a silver plated pitcher of nearly six fines, a stole embroidered with gold, together with a scarf, a belt, a dalmatic all woven of gold, with the value of fifty and more brands, one black tunic with gold appliqu\u00e9, a scarf and a cloth interwoven with gold, which together can have a value of twenty grzywna, a curtain wall, knitted silk, one box of ivory, one beautiful crystal vessel, three horses, two ounces of gold, two coats, one of which [...] ermine, a bishop's miter with gloves, on four fine and three coats of other goodies.\nThe same source mentioned that the golden cross donated to the monastery was made by master Leopard, who worked for the Polish ruler during 1129\u201337.\nThe Reliquary of 1113 is an example of the artistic development during Boles\u0142aw's rule; was made during the penitential journey to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno Cathedral after the blinding of Zbigniew, according to the reports the Gallus Anonymous:\n The evidence of the great work of goldsmiths, Boles\u0142aw had made on a relic of the Saint, as a testimony to his devotion and penance. Half coffin contains in itself 80 grzywna, the purest gold, not counting the pearls and precious stones that probably matched the value of the gold.\nThe reliquary contained the head of Saint Adalbert. At the end of the 15th century, it was melted in order to make a new one. According to the notes of 1494, it had the form of an octagonal shrine. The side walls have the shape of squares and were separated by small columns, which were based on the figures of saints or prophets. The monument was decorated with 8 pearls and 40 sapphires.\nPolish historiography during Boles\u0142aw's reign.\nDuring his rule, Boles\u0142aw wanted the history of the Piast dynasty to be chronicled. This task was assigned to an unnamed Benedictine monk (Historians have coined the name Gallus Anonymous for the chronicler). Research has suggested multiple hypotheses for the monk's origin, finding connections to Venetian, French, Hungarian, etc.\nThe \"Gesta Chronica Polonorum\", written in Latin, was made between 1112 and 1116. The history of the State (Latin: \"gesta ducum\") was made describing the fate of the rulers. The Chronicle covers the history from legendary times until 1114. Composed of three parts, this unfinished literary work justified the right of the Piasts to rule over Poland. The Chronicle also explain many controversial events that were placed under the responsibility of the rulers, and give a full explanation about their policy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Casimir was the son of Mieszko II Lambert and Richeza of Lotharingia. He is known as the Restorer because he managed to reunite parts of the Kingdom of Poland after a period of turmoil. He reincorporated Masovia and conquered Silesia and Pomerania. However, he failed to crown himself King of Poland, mainly because of internal and external threats to his rule.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nRelatively little is known of Casimir's early life. He must have spent his childhood at the royal court of Poland in Gniezno. In order to acquire a proper education, he was sent to one of the Polish monasteries in 1026. According to some older sources he initially wanted to have a career in the Church (it is probable that he held the post of oblate) and even asked for a dispensation to become a monk. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by modern historians. Regardless, he left church work indefinitely in 1031.\nCasimir's father, Mieszko II, was crowned King of Poland in 1025 after the death of his father, Boles\u0142aw the Brave. However, the powerful magnates of the country feared a strong central government like the one that existed under Boles\u0142aw I's rule. This led to considerable friction between the King and the nobility. Taking advantage of the King's precarious situation, Mieszko II's older half-brother Bezprym and younger brother Otto turned against him and allied themselves with the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, whose forces attacked Poland and regained Lusatia. Years of chaos and conflict followed, during which Mieszko II was forced to cede the throne to Bezprym in 1031, fled to Bohemia, was imprisoned by Duke Old\u0159ich and castrated, returned to rule a portion of the kingdom, eventually regained the kingdom, and then died in May 1034 under suspicious circumstances.\nSometime during the reign of Bezprym, Casimir and his sisters were taken by their mother to Germany (her native land) for refuge. It has been reported that Queen Richeza brought the Polish royal crown and regalia to Emperor Conrad II at Bezprym's request to indicate his acceptance of the primacy of his western neighbor, although the Queen could have taken them for safekeeping, or they could have been brought to the Emperor by another means. At the time of his father's death in 1034, Casimir was about 18 years old and in Germany at the court of his uncle Archbishop Hermann II of Cologne.\nBoles\u0142aw I.\nThe central district of Greater Poland (\"Wielkopolska\") revolted against the nobles and Catholic clergy \"en masse\". A pagan revival in the area lasted for several years. The district of Masovia seceded and a local lord, Miec\u0142aw, formed a state of his own. A similar situation occurred in Pomerania.\nIn 1037 both the young prince and his mother returned to Poland and attempted to seize the throne. This precipitated a rebellion by local barons, which coupled with the so-called \"Pagan Reaction\" of the commoners, forced Casimir and Richeza to flee to Saxony. However, soon Casimir returned to Poland and in 1038, once again, tried to regain power with the aide of his influential mother. This also failed and he had to flee again, this time to the Kingdom of Hungary where he was imprisoned by Stephen I. Richeza remained in Germany as a nun until her death, in 1063.\nTaking advantage of the chaos and his neighbour's weakness, Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia invaded and ravaged the country in 1039. Lesser and Greater Poland were severely pillaged, Pozna\u0144 was captured, and Bretislaus sacked Gniezno, taking the relics of Saint Adalbert, Radim Gaudentius, and the five hermit brothers with him. On the way back he conquered part of Silesia, including Wroc\u0142aw, destroyed religious buildings which were built by Mieszko I during the feast of the conversion of Poland, and plundered Mieszko I's tomb.\nRestoration.\nAfter initially escaping to Hungary, Casimir went to Germany, where in 1039 his relative Emperor Henry III (who feared the increased power of the Bohemian ruler) gave him military and financial support. Casimir received a force of 1,000 heavy footmen and a significant amount of gold to restore his power in Poland. Casimir also signed an alliance with Yaroslav I the Wise, the Prince of Kievan Rus', who was linked with him through Casimir's marriage with Yaroslav's sister, Maria Dobroniega. With this support, Casimir returned to Poland and managed to retake most of his domain. In 1041, Bretislaus, defeated in his second attempted invasion by Emperor Henry III, signed a treaty at Regensburg (1042) in which he renounced his claims to all Polish lands except for Silesia, which was to be incorporated into the Bohemian Kingdom. It was Casimir's success in strengthening royal power and ending internal strife that earned him the epithet of \"the Restorer\".\nThe treaty gained Casimir a period of peace on the southern border and the capital of Poland was moved to Krak\u00f3w, the only major Polish city untouched by the wars. It is probable that the Holy Roman Emperor was pleased with the balance of power that had been restored to the region and forced Casimir not to crown himself the King of Poland. In 1046 Emperor Henry III held royal and imperial courts at Merseburg and Meissen, at which he ended the strife among the Duke of Pomerania (\"Dux Bomeraniorum\"), Duke Bretislaus of Bohemia, and Casimir I.\nIn 1047 Casimir, aided by his Kievan brother-in-law, started a war against Masovia and seized the land. It is probable that he also defeated Miec\u0142aw's allies from Pomerania and attached Gda\u0144sk to Poland. This secured his power in central Poland. Three years later, against the will of the Emperor, Casimir seized Bohemian-controlled Silesia, thus securing most of his father's domain. In 1054 in Quedlinburg, the Emperor ruled that Silesia was to remain in Poland in exchange for a yearly tribute of 117\u00a0kg. of silver and 7\u00a0kg. of gold.\nAt that time Casimir was focused on internal matters. To strengthen his rule he re-created the bishopric in Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw and erected the new Wawel Cathedral. During Casimir's rule heraldry was introduced into Poland and, unlike his predecessors, he promoted landed gentry over the \"dru\u017cyna\" as his base of power. One of his reforms was the introduction, to Poland, of a key element of feudalism: the granting of fiefdoms to his retinue of warriors, thus gradually transforming them into medieval knights.\nMarriage and issue.\nCasimir married Maria Dobroniega (c. 1012\u20131087), daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir I of Kiev. There is no consensus among historians as to when it took place. W\u0142adymir D. Koroliuk said that it was in 1039, Aleksej A. Szachmatow and Iwan Linniczenko agreed on 1041, while Dymitr S. Lichaczew postulated that it occurred during 1043.\nCasimir and Maria had five children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The method was first mentioned explicitly by Raymond E. A. C. Paley and Norbert Wiener in their 1934 treatise on Fourier transforms in the complex domain. Given the status of these latter authors and the widespread availability and use of their treatise, it is almost certain that Box and Muller were well aware of its contents.\nThe Box\u2013Muller transform is commonly expressed in two forms. The basic form as given by Box and Muller takes two samples from the uniform distribution on the interval (0,1) and maps them to two standard, normally distributed samples. The polar form takes two samples from a different interval, [\u22121,+1], and maps them to two normally distributed samples without the use of sine or cosine functions.\nThe Box\u2013Muller transform was developed as a more computationally efficient alternative to the inverse transform sampling method. The ziggurat algorithm gives a more efficient method for scalar processors (e.g. old CPUs), while the Box\u2013Muller transform is superior for processors with vector units (e.g. GPUs or modern CPUs).\nBasic form.\nSuppose \"U\"1 and \"U\"2 are independent samples chosen from the uniform distribution on the unit interval (0, 1). Let\nformula_1\nand\nformula_2\nThen \"Z\"0 and \"Z\"1 are independent random variables with a standard normal distribution.\nThe derivation is based on a property of a two-dimensional Cartesian system, where X and Y coordinates are described by two independent and normally distributed random variables, the random variables for \"R\"2 and \u0398 (shown above) in the corresponding polar coordinates are also independent and can be expressed as\nformula_3\nand\nformula_4\nBecause \"R\"2 is the square of the norm of the standard bivariate normal variable (\"X\", \"Y\"), it has the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. In the special case of two degrees of freedom, the chi-squared distribution coincides with the exponential distribution, and the equation for \"R\"2 above is a simple way of generating the required exponential variate.\nPolar form.\n The polar form was first proposed by J. Bell and then modified by R. Knop. While several different versions of the polar method have been described, the version of R. Knop will be described here because it is the most widely used, in part due to its inclusion in \"Numerical Recipes\". A slightly different form is described as \"Algorithm P\" by D. Knuth in \"The Art of Computer Programming\".\nGiven u and v, independent and uniformly distributed in the closed interval [\u22121, +1], set \"s\" = \"R\"2 = \"u\"2 + \"v\"2. If \"s\" = 0 or \"s\" \u2265 1, discard \"u\" and \"v\", and try another pair (\"u\", \"v\"). Because u and v are uniformly distributed and because only points within the unit circle have been admitted, the values of \"s\" will be uniformly distributed in the open interval (0, 1), too. The latter can be seen by calculating the cumulative distribution function for \"s\" in the interval (0, 1). This is the area of a circle with radius formula_5, divided by formula_6. From this we find the probability density function to have the constant value 1 on the interval (0, 1). Equally so, the angle \u03b8 divided by formula_7 is uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1) and independent of s.\nWe now identify the value of \"s\" with that of \"U\"1 and formula_8 with that of \"U\"2 in the basic form. As shown in the figure, the values of formula_9 and formula_10 in the basic form can be replaced with the ratios formula_11 and formula_12, respectively. The advantage is that calculating the trigonometric functions directly can be avoided. This is helpful when trigonometric functions are more expensive to compute than the single division that replaces each one.\nJust as the basic form produces two standard normal deviates, so does this alternate calculation.\nformula_13\nand\nformula_14\nContrasting the two forms.\nThe polar method differs from the basic method in that it is a type of rejection sampling. It discards some generated random numbers, but can be faster than the basic method because it is simpler to compute (provided that the random number generator is relatively fast) and is more numerically robust. Avoiding the use of expensive trigonometric functions improves speed over the basic form. It discards of the total input uniformly distributed random number pairs generated, i.e. discards uniformly distributed random number pairs per Gaussian random number pair generated, requiring input random numbers per output random number.\nThe basic form requires two multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and one trigonometric function for each normal variate. On some processors, the cosine and sine of the same argument can be calculated in parallel using a single instruction. Notably for Intel-based machines, one can use the fsincos assembler instruction or the expi instruction (usually available from C as an intrinsic function), to calculate complex\nformula_15\nand just separate the real and imaginary parts.\nNote: \nTo explicitly calculate the complex-polar form use the following substitutions in the general form,\nLet formula_16 and formula_17 Then\nformula_18\nThe polar form requires 3/2 multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and 1/2 division for each normal variate. The effect is to replace one multiplication and one trigonometric function with a single division and a conditional loop.\nTails truncation.\nWhen a computer is used to produce a uniform random variable it will inevitably have some inaccuracies because there is a lower bound on how close numbers can be to 0. If the generator uses 32 bits per output value, the smallest non-zero number that can be generated is formula_19. When formula_20 and formula_21 are equal to this the Box\u2013Muller transform produces a normal random deviate equal to formula_22. This means that the algorithm will not produce random variables more than 6.660 standard deviations from the mean. This corresponds to a proportion of formula_23 lost due to the truncation, where formula_24 is the standard cumulative normal distribution. With 64 bits the limit is pushed to formula_25 standard deviations, for which formula_26.\nImplementation.\nC++.\nThe standard Box\u2013Muller transform generates values from the standard normal distribution (\"i.e.\" standard normal deviates) with mean \"0\" and standard deviation \"1\". The implementation below in standard C++ generates values from any normal distribution with mean formula_27 and variance formula_28. If formula_29 is a standard normal deviate, then formula_30 will have a normal distribution with mean formula_27 and standard deviation formula_32. The random number generator has been seeded to ensure that new, pseudo-random values will be returned from sequential calls to the codice_1 function.\n//\"mu\" is the mean of the distribution, and \"sigma\" is the standard deviation.\nstd::pair&lt;double, double&gt; generateGaussianNoise(double mu, double sigma)\n constexpr double two_pi = 2.0 * M_PI;\n //initialize the random uniform number generator (runif) in a range 0 to 1\n static std::mt19937 rng(std::random_device{}()); // Standard mersenne_twister_engine seeded with rd()\n static std::uniform_real_distribution&lt;&gt; runif(0.0, 1.0);\n //create two random numbers, make sure u1 is greater than zero\n double u1, u2;\n do\n u1 = runif(rng);\n while (u1 == 0);\n u2 = runif(rng);\n //compute z0 and z1\n auto mag = sigma * sqrt(-2.0 * log(u1));\n auto z0 = mag * cos(two_pi * u2) + mu;\n auto z1 = mag * sin(two_pi * u2) + mu;\n return std::make_pair(z0, z1);\nJavaScript.\n/* Syntax:\n * [ x, y ] = rand_normal();\n * x = rand_normal()[0];\n * y = rand_normal()[1];\nfunction rand_normal() {\n let theta = 2 * Math.PI * Math.random();\n let R = Math.sqrt(-2 * Math.log(Math.random()));\n let x = R * Math.cos(theta);\n let y = R * Math.sin(theta);\n return [ x, y ];\nJulia.\n boxmullersample(N)\nGenerate `2N` samples from the standard normal distribution using the Box-Muller method.\nfunction boxmullersample(N)\n z = Array{Float64}(undef,N,2);\n for i in axes(z,1)\n z[i,:] .= sincospi(2 * rand());\n z[i,:] .*= sqrt(-2 * log(rand()));\n end\n vec(z)\nend\n boxmullersample(n,\u03bc,\u03c3)\nGenerate `n` samples from the normal distribution with mean `\u03bc` and standard deviation `\u03c3` using the Box-Muller method.\nfunction boxmullersample(n,\u03bc,\u03c3)\n \u03bc .+ \u03c3*boxmullersample(cld(n,2))[1:n];\nend"}

Alternative names historically used for the region include Pasht\u016bnkhw\u0101 or Pakht\u016bnkhw\u0101 (), or simply the Pashtun Belt.\nDuring British rule in India in 1893, Mortimer Durand drew the Durand Line, fixing the limits of the spheres of influence between the Emirate of Afghanistan and British India during the Great Game and leaving about half of historical Pashtun territory under British colonial rule; after the partition of British India, the Durand Line now forms the internationally recognized border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The traditional Pashtun homeland stretches roughly from the areas south of the Amu River in Afghanistan to the areas west of the Indus River in Pakistan; it predominantly comprises the southwestern, eastern and some northern and western districts of Afghanistan, as well as most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan in Pakistan. The region is bordered by Punjab and Hazara to the east, Balochistan to the south, Kohistan and Chitral to the north, and Hazarajat and Tajik-inhabited territory to the west.\nThe 16th-century revolutionary Ormur leader Bayazid Pir Roshan of Waziristan and the 17th-century \"warrior-poet\" Khushal Khan Khattak assembled Pashtun armies to fight against the Mughal Empire in the region. During this time, the eastern parts of Pashtunistan were ruled by the Mughals while the western parts were ruled by Safavid Iran. Pashtunistan first gained an autonomous status in 1709, when Mirwais Hotak successfully revolted against the Safavids in Loy Kandahar. The Pashtuns later achieved unity under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who founded the Durrani dynasty and established the Afghan Empire in 1747. In the 19th century, however, the Afghan Empire lost large parts of its eastern territory to the Sikh Empire and later the British Empire. Many famous Indian independence activists emerged from the region including Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his anti-colonial Khudai Khidmatgar movement to free the region from British control. In 1969, the autonomous princely states of Swat, Dir, Chitral, and Amb were merged into the Pakistani NWFP. In 2018, the Pashtun-majority Federally Administered Tribal Areas, formerly a federally-controlled buffer zone of Pakistan on the international border with Afghanistan, were merged into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (previously known as the NWFP), fully integrating the region with Pakistan proper.\nThe Pashtuns practice \"Pashtunwali\", the indigenous culture of the Pashtuns, and this remains significant for many Pashtuns. Although the Pashtuns are politically separated by the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, many Pashtun tribes from the FATA area and the adjacent regions of Afghanistan, tend to ignore the border and cross back and forth with relative ease to attend weddings, family functions and take part in the joint tribal councils known as \"jirgas\". Depending on the source, the ethnic Pashtuns constitute 42-60% of the population of Afghanistan. In neighboring Pakistan they constitute 15.4% percent of over the 241 million population, which includes the Pashtun diaspora in other Pakistani cities and provinces.\nOrigin of term.\nThe name used for the region during the Middle Ages especially during the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages and up until the 20th century was Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a reference to this land by its ethnicity, which were the Afghans, while Pashtunistan is a reference to this land by its language. Mention of this land by the name of Afghanistan predates mention by the name of Pashtunistan, which has been mentioned by Ahmad Shah Durrani in his famous couplet, 14th-century Moroccan scholar Ibn Battuta, Mughal Emperor Babur, 16th-century historian Firishta and many others. While mention of Afghans have been mentioned of a community of people, chieftains of tribes of Bactria known as Abgan or Avagana () or () the exact origin or etymology of the term is not known with some scholars believe it to have been derived with the name Asvakan who were a people living in the Swat valley's then in the regions of Bactria.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The men of Kabul and Khilj also went home; and whenever they were questioned about the Musulmans of the Kohistan (the mountains), and how matters stood there, they said, \"Don't call it Kohistan, but Afghanistan; for there is nothing there but Afghans and disturbances.\" Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in their own language Afghanistan, and themselves Afghans. But it occurs to me, that when, under the rule of Muhammadan sovereigns, Musulmans first came to the city of Patna, and dwelt there, the people of India (for that reason) called them Patans\u2014but God knows!\u2014\u200a\nThe Pashto name Pakhtunistan or Pashtunistan ( ) evolved originally from the Indian word \"Pathanistan\" (Hindustani: \u067e\u0679\u06be\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 , \u092a\u0920\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 ). The concept of Pashtunistan was inspired by the term \"Pakhtunkhwa\". British Indian leaders, including the Khudai Khidmatgar, started using the word \"Pathanistan\" to refer to the region, however the word \"Pashtunistan\" was more popular among Pashtuns.\nThe native people.\nThe native or indigenous people of Pashtunistan are the Pashtuns (also known as Pakhtuns and historically as ethnic Afghans), an Iranic ethnic group. Pashtuns are generally mixed with South Asian, Central Asian and European ethnicity. They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and the second largest in Pakistan. The Pashtuns are concentrated mainly in the south and east of Afghanistan but also exist in northern and western parts of the country as a minority group. In Pakistan they are concentrated in the west and north-west, inhabiting mainly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan. In addition, communities of Pashtuns are found in other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and in the nation's capital, Islamabad. The main language spoken in the delineated Pashtunistan region is Pashto. Depending on the region other languages are also spoken such as Dari in Afghanistan and Gujari, Balochi, Hindko, and Urdu in Pakistan.\nThe Pashtuns practice \"Pashtunwali\", the indigenous culture of the Pashtuns, and this pre-Islamic identity remains significant for many Pashtuns and is one of the factors that have kept the Pashtunistan issue alive. Although the Pashtuns are politically separated by the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, many Pashtun tribes from the FATA area and the adjacent regions of Afghanistan, tend to ignore the border and cross back and forth with relative ease to attend weddings, family functions and take part in the joint tribal councils known as \"jirgas\". Though this was common before the war on terror but after several military operations conducted in FATA, this cross border movement is checked via military and has become much less common in comparison to the past.\nDepending on the source, the ethnic Pashtuns constitute 42-60% of the population of Afghanistan. In neighboring Pakistan they constitute 15.42 percent of the 200 million population, which does not include Pashtun diaspora in other Pakistani cities and provinces. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, Pashto speakers constitute above 73 percent of the population as of 1998.\nHistory.\nSince the 2nd millennium BC, the region now inhabited by the native Pashtun people had been conquered by Ancient Iranian peoples, the Medes, Achaemenids, Greeks, Mauryas, Kushans, Hephthalites, Sasanians, Arab Muslims, Turks, Mughals, and others. In recent age, people of the Western world have nominally explored the area.\nArab Muslims arrived in the 7th century and began introducing Islam to the native Pashtun people. The Pashtunistan area later fell to the Turkish Ghaznavids whose main capital was at Ghazni, with Lahore serving as the second power house. The Ghaznavid Empire was then taken over by the Ghorids from today's Ghor, Afghanistan. The army of Genghis Khan arrived in the 13th century and began destroying cities in the north while the Pashtun territory was defended by the Khalji dynasty of Delhi. In the 14th and 15th century, the Timurid dynasty was in control of the nearby cities and towns, until Babur captured Kabul in 1504.\nDelhi Sultanate and the Durrani Empire.\nDuring the Delhi Sultanate era, the region was ruled by mainly Afghan and various, largely Sunni, Hanafi-jurisprudential driven Turkic dynasties from Delhi, India. An early Pashtun nationalist was the \"Warrior-poet\" Khushal Khan Khattak, who was imprisoned by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for trying to incite the Pashtuns to rebel against the rule of the Mughals. However, despite sharing a common language and believing in a common ancestry, the Pashtuns first achieved unity in the 18th century. The eastern parts of \"Pashtunistan\" were ruled by the Mughal Empire, while the western parts were ruled by the Persian Safavids as their easternmost provinces. During the early 18th century, Pashtun tribes led by Mirwais Hotak successfully revolted against the Safavids in the city of Kandahar. In a chain of events, he declared Kandahar and other parts of what is now southern Afghanistan independent. By 1738 the Mughal Empire had been crushingly defeated and their capital sacked and looted by forces of a new Iranian ruler; the military genius and commander Nader Shah. Besides Persian, Turkmen, and Caucasian forces, Nader was also accompanied by the young Ahmad Shah Durrani, and 4,000 well trained Abdali Pashtun troops from what is now Afghanistan.\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747 and the disintegration of his massive empire, Ahmad Shah Durrani created his own large and powerful Durrani Empire, which included all of modern-day Afghanistan, North east Iran, Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan and Kashmir. The famous couplet by Ahmad Shah Durrani describes the association the people have with the regional city of Kandahar:\n\"Da Dili takht herauma cheh rayad kam zama da khkule Pukhtunkhwa da ghre saroona\".\nTranslation: \"I forget the throne of Delhi when I recall the mountain peaks of my beautiful Pukhtunkhwa.\"\nThe last Afghan Empire was established in 1747 and united all the different Pashtun tribes as well as many other ethnic groups. Parts of the Pashtunistan region around Peshawar was invaded by Ranjit Singh and his Sikh army in the early part of the 19th century, but a few years later they were defeated by the British Raj, the new powerful empire which reached the Pashtunistan region from the east.\nEuropean influence.\nFollowing the decline of the Durrani dynasty and the establishment of the new Barakzai dynasty in Afghanistan, the Pashtun domains began to shrink as they lost control over other parts of South Asia to the British, such as the Punjab region and the Balochistan region. The Anglo-Afghan Wars were fought as part of the overall imperialistic Great Game that was waged between the Russian Empire and the British. Poor and landlocked, newly born Afghanistan was able to defend its territory and keep both sides at bay by using them against each other. In 1893, as part of a way for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence, the Durand Line Agreement was signed between Afghan \"Iron\" Amir Abdur Rahman and British Viceroy Mortimer Durand. In 1905, the North-West Frontier Province (today's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was created and roughly corresponded to Pashtun majority regions within the British domain. The FATA area was created to further placate the Pashtun tribesmen who never fully accepted British rule and were prone to rebellions, while the city of Peshawar was directly administered as part of a British protectorate state with full integration into the federal rule of law with the establishment of civic amenities and the construction of railway, road infrastructure as well as educational institutes to bring the region at par with the developed world.\nDuring World War I, the Afghan government was contacted by the Ottoman Turkey and Germany, through the Niedermayer\u2013Hentig Mission, to join the Central Allies on behalf of the Caliph in a Jihad; some revolutionaries, tribals, and Afghan leaders including a brother of the Amir named Nasrullah Khan were in favour of the delegation and wanted the Amir to declare Jihad. Kazim Bey carried a firman from the Khalifa in Persian. It was addressed to \"the residents of Pashtunistan.\" It said that when the British were defeated, \"His Majesty the Khalifa, in agreement with allied States, will acquire guarantee for independence of the united state of Pashtunistan and will provide every kind of assistance to it. Thereafter, I will not allow any interference in the country of Pashtunistan.\" (Ahmad Chagharzai; 1989; pp.\u00a0138\u2013139). However the efforts failed and the Afghan Amir Habibullah Khan maintained Afghanistan's neutrality throughout World War I.\nSimilarly, during the 1942 Cripps Mission, and 1946 Cabinet Mission to India, the Afghan government made repeated attempts to ensure that any debate about the independence of India must include Afghanistan's role in the future of the NWFP. The British government wavered between reassuring the Afghan to the rejection of their role and insistence that NWFP was an integral part of British India.\nDuring World War II, the government of Nazi Germany proposed an alliance with neutral Afghanistan in order to destabilize British control over the north-west of its domain in India. In return, the Afghans sought that NWFP and the Port of Karachi would be ceded to the Kingdom of Afghanistan with German military aid, so that it could gain valuable access to the Arabian Sea. Such a plan would require annexation of NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh provinces.\nThe Khudai Khidmatgars (also known as the \"Red Shirts\") were members of a civil rights movement. Its leader Bacha Khan claimed to have been inspired by the Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi. While the Red Shirts were willing to work with the Indian National Congress from a political point of view, the Pashtuns living in the NWFP desired independence from India. However, the Bacha Khan wanted the Pashtuns areas in British India to remain part of United India instead of gaining independence.\nBannu Resolution.\nIn June 1947, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), Bacha Khan, and other Khudai Khidmatgars declared the Bannu Resolution, demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new state of Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.\n1947 NWFP referendum.\nThe NWFP joined the Dominion of Pakistan as a result of the 1947 NWFP referendum, which had been boycotted by the Khudai Khidmatgar movement, including Bacha Khan and then-chief minister Dr. Khan Sahib, as they were ditched by the leadership of Congress. About (99.02%) of the votes were cast in favor of Pakistan and only 2,874 (0.98%) in favor of India.\nIndependence of Pakistan in 1947.\nThe concept of Pashtunistan has varying meanings across Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nIn Afghanistan, Pashtun nationalists look after the interests of the Pashtun ethnic group and have support only from them. They favor the ideas of \"L\u014dy Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n\" or \"Greater Afghanistan\", and maintain an irredentist claim on the entire Pashtun-populated region. The Pashtunistan demand also served the cause of domestic Afghan politics, where several successive governments used the idea to strengthen \"Pashtun ethnic support\" for the state. This policy intensified ethno-linguistic rivalry between Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns in the country. These claims are contested in Pakistan, where Pashtun politics centers on political autonomy rather than irredentist politics.\nSince the late 1940s with the dissolution of British India and independence of Pakistan, some rigid Pashtun nationalists proposed merging with Afghanistan or creating Pashtunistan as a future sovereign state for the local Pashtun inhabitants of the area. At first, Afghanistan became the only government to oppose the entry of Pakistan into the United Nations in 1947, although it was reversed a few months later. On July 26, 1949, when Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan relations were rapidly deteriorating, a loya jirga was held in Afghanistan after a military aircraft from the Pakistan Air Force bombed a village on the Afghan side of the Durand Line. As a result of this violation, the Afghan government declared that it recognized \"neither the imaginary Durand nor any similar line\" and that all previous Durand Line agreements were void. Bacha Khan when took an oath of allegiance to Pakistan in 1948 in legislation assembly and during his speech he was asked by PM Liaquat Ali Khan about Pashtunistan to which he replied that it's just a name to the Pashtun province in Pakistan same like Punjab, Bengal, Sindh and Baluchishtan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, contrary to what he believed and strived for Pashtunistan an independent state. During the 1950s to the late 1960s, Pashtuns were promoted to higher positions within the Pakistani government and military, thereby integrating Pashtuns into the Pakistani state and severely weakening secessionist sentiments to the point that by the mid-1960s, popular support for an independent Pashtunistan had all but disappeared.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An important development in Pakistan during the Ayub period (1958\u20131969) was the gradual integration into Pakistani society and the military-bureaucratic establishment. It was a period of Pakistan's political history which saw a large number of ethnic Pashtuns holding high positions in the military and the bureaucracy. Ayub himself was a non-Pashto speaking ethnic Pashtun belonging to the Tarin sub-tribe of the Hazara District in the Frontier. The growing participation of Pashtuns in the Pakistani Government resulted in the erosion of the support for the Pashtunistan movement in the Province by the end of the 1960s.\u2014\u200a\nAfghanistan and Pashtun nationalists did not exploit Pakistan's vulnerability during the nation's 1965 and 1971 wars with India, and even backed Pakistan against a largely Hindu India. Further, had Pakistan been destabilized by India, nationalists would have had to fight against a much bigger country than Pakistan for their independence.\nSardar Daoud Khan, who was the-then prime minister of Afghanistan supported a nationalistic reunification of the Pashtuns in Pakistan with Afghanistan. He wanted Pashtun-dominated areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baloch-dominated areas like Balochistan to become part of Afghanistan. However, his policy of reunification of Pashtuns antagonized Non-Pashtuns like Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras living in Afghanistan. Non-Pashtuns believed that the aim of reunification of Pashtuns areas was to increase the population of Pashtuns in Afghanistan. As a result, Daoud Khan was extremely unpopular with Non-Pashtun Afghans. \nBacha Khan stated that \"Daoud Khan only exploited the idea of reunification of Pashtun people to meet his own political ends\". In 1960 and later in 1961, Daoud Khan made two attempts to capture Bajaur District in Khyber Pakthunkhwa, Pakistan. However, all of Daoud Khan attempts failed as the Afghan army was routed with heavy casualties. Several Afghan army soldiers were also captured by Pakistani soldiers and they were paraded in front of international media which in turn caused embarrassment for Daoud Khan. As a consequence of Daoud Khan's actions, Pakistan closed its border with Afghanistan which caused economic crisis in Afghanistan. Because of continued resentment against Daoud's autocratic rule, close ties with the Soviet Union and economic downturn caused by the blockade imposed by Pakistan, Daoud Khan was forced to resign by King Zahir Shah. Under King Zahir Shah rule, relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan improved and Pakistan opened its border with Afghanistan. However, later on in 1973, Daoud Khan seized power from King Zahir Shah in a military Coup d'\u00e9tat and declared himself the first president of Afghanistan. After seizing the power, the Daoud Khan's government started proxy war against Pakistan. Daoud Khan's government established several training camps for anti-Pakistani militants in Kabul and Kandahar with the aim of training and arming those militants to carry out their activities against Pakistan.\nOn the other hand, Mirzali Khan and his followers continued their guerilla war against the Pakistani government from their base in Gurwek. In 1960, Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan sent the Afghan military across the poorly-demarcated Durand Line into the Pakistani Bajaur Agency in order to manipulate events in the region and press the Pashtunistan issue; these plans ultimately came to nothing after the Afghan troops were defeated by Pakistani irregular forces. In support of the quasi-invasion, the Afghan government engaged in an intense propaganda war via radio broadcasts.\nPakistani government decided to retaliate against the Afghan government's Pashtunistan policy by supporting Non-Pashtun opponents of the Afghan government including future Mujaheddin leaders like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud. This operation was remarkably successful, and by 1977 the Afghan government of Daoud Khan was willing to settle all outstanding issues in exchange for a lifting of the ban on the National Awami Party and a commitment towards provincial autonomy for Pashtuns, which was already guaranteed by Pakistan's Constitution, but stripped by the Bhutto government when the One Unit scheme was introduced.\nBacha Khan who previously strived greatly for Pashtunistan later on in 1980 during an interview with an Indian journalist, Haroon Siddiqui said that the \"idea of Pashtunistan never helped Pashtuns. In fact it was never a reality\". He further said that \"successive Afghan governments have exploited the idea for their own political ends\". It was only towards the end of Mohammed Daoud Khan regime that he stopped talking about Pashtunistan. Later on, even Nur Muhammad Taraki also talked about the idea of Pashtunistan and caused trouble for Pakistan. He also said that \"Pashtun people greatly suffered because of all this.\"\nIn 1976, the then president of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan recognised Durand Line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He made this declaration while he was on an official visit to Islamabad, Pakistan.\nDaoud would be overthrown by Khalqist military officers in 1978 leading to the formation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan which was dominated by Pashtun Khalqists who would go on to \"reopen the Pashtunistan wound\". In 1979 under General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki the Khalqists regime in Afghanistan changed the official map to include NWFP and Balochistan as new \"frontier provinces\" of the DRA. The Khalqist regime also sought to make Pashto the sole language of the Afghan government and the lingua franca, they did so by undermining Dari. The Afghan anthem under the communist regime was only in Pashto and not Dari with non-Pashtuns being required to sing it in Pashto. Up until the overthrow of Dr Najibullah's Homeland Party regime in 1992, Afghan governments had favored Pashto in the media and over 50% of Afghan media was in Pashto. After 1992 with the formation of the Tajik led Islamic State of Afghanistan, this number dropped drastically.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in Afghanistan, millions of Afghans including non-Pashtun people fled to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n20th and 21st century.\nPashtuns in Pakistan make up the second largest ethnic group after Punjabis making up around 15.4% of the total population which equates to about 39 million (This figure includes all Pashtuns in Pakistan including the diaspora in Punjab and Sindh). In addition, there are 1.7 million Afghan refugees of whom majority are Pashtuns. These refugees, however, are expected to leave Pakistan and settle in Afghanistan in the coming years. Three Pakistani presidents belonged to the Pashtun ethnic group. Pashtuns continue to occupy important places in the military and politics, with the former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan who leads Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and \"Awami National Party\" led by Asfandyar Wali . In addition to this, some Pashtun media, music and cultural activities are based out of Pakistan, with AVT Khyber being a Pashto TV channel in Pakistan. Pashto cinema is based out of the Pakistani city of Peshawar. The Pakistani city of Karachi is believed to host the largest concentration of Pashtuns.\nThere are more than 19 million Pashtuns in Afghanistan, constituting 48% of the population. Other sources say that up to 60% of Afghanistan's population is made up of ethnic Pashtuns, forming the largest ethnic group in that country. Pashto is one of the official languages of Afghanistan, the Afghan National Anthem is recited in Pashto language and the Pashtun dress is the national dress of Afghanistan. Since the late 19th century, the traditional Pashtunistan region has gradually expanded to the Amu River in the north. However, most Pashtun living in north of the Helmand River tend to speak Dari instead of Pashto.\nImportant government positions in Afghanistan have historically been held by Pashtuns. The Afghan Armed Forces was also traditionally dominated by Pashtuns however the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 led to the creation of the Tajik dominated Islamic State of Afghanistan.\nThe majority of the Afghan Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns, with past Pashtun leaders such as Mullah Mohammed Omar, Mohammad Rabbani and Jalaluddin Haqqani. The current leaders of the Taliban include Pashtuns such as Abdul Kabir, Hibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani.\nAfghanistan makes its claim on the Pashtun areas on the ground that it served as the Pashtun seat of power since 1709 with the rise of the Hotaki dynasty followed by the establishment of the Durrani Afghan Empire. According to historic sources, Afghan tribes did not appear in Peshawar valley until after 800 AD, when the Islamic conquest of this area took place.\nAgreements cited by the Afghan government as proof of their claim over the Pashtun tribes include Article 11 of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921, which states: \"The two contracting parties, being mutually satisfied themselves each regarding the goodwill of the other and especially regarding their benevolent intentions towards the tribes residing close to their respective boundaries, hereby undertake to inform each other of any future military operations which may appear necessary for the maintenance of order among the frontier tribes residing within their respective spheres before the commencement of such operations.\" A supplementary letter to the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 reads: \"As the conditions of the Frontier tribes of the two governments are of interest to the Government of Afghanistan. I inform you that the British government entertains feelings of goodwill towards all the Frontier tribes and has every intention of treating them generously, provided they abstain from outrages against the people of India.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Durand Line and Pashtunistan issues have been raised by different Afghan regimes in the past. However, it may no longer be a concern. Pashtuns are now so well integrated in Pakistani society that the majority will never opt for Pashtunistan or Afghanistan. Afghan-Pashtun refugees have been staying in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for more than 30 years. Threat perceptions about Afghanistan need re-evaluation so that suitable changes are made in our Afghan policy.\u2014\u200a\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nProminent 20th century proponents of the Pashtunistan cause have included Khan Abdul Wali Khan and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Ghaffar Khan stated in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly in 1948 that he simply wanted \"the renaming of his province as Pashtunistan same like Punjab, Sindh and Baluchishtan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, Another name mentioned is Afghania where the initial \"A\" in Choudhary Rahmat Ali Khan's theory stated in the \"Now or Never\" pamphlet stands for the second letter in \"Pakistan\". However, this name has failed to capture political support in the province.\nThere was support, however, to rename North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunkhwa (which translates as \"area of Pashtuns\"). Nasim Wali Khan (the wife of Khan Abdul Wali Khan) declared in an interview: \"I want an identity. I want the name to change so that Pashtuns may be identified on the map of Pakistan...\"\nOn 31 March 2010, Pakistan's Constitutional Reform Committee agreed that the province be named and recognized as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. This is now the official name for the former NWFP.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bretnor worked extensively both to write science fiction and to edit science and science fiction-related compendia (e.g., his trilogy of symposia beginning with \"Science Fiction Today and Tomorrow: A Discursive Symposium\" (1975), and he edited some of the earliest books to consider science fiction from the perspective of literary theory and criticism. His non-fiction included works on military history, theory, and futurology (e.g., his trilogy on \"The Future of War\", beginning 1979), as well as on public affairs. Most of Bretnor's own fiction, science fiction and otherwise, was in short story form, and often featured whimsical story lines or ironic plot twists.\nEarly life and education.\nReginald Bretnor was born on July 30, 1911, in Vladivostok, in the Russian empire. Bretnor's father, Grigory Kahn, has alternatively been described as a \"Latvian Jewish banker\", and a Russian Jew, and his mother, her name not yet identified in a biographical source, alternatively as an English governess, and one born British that became a Russian subject. Bretnor's family left Siberia for Japan, spending from 1917 to 1920 there, then moving to San Diego, California. Al least one other source states it was his mother that settled them\u2014she, and the children Reginald and Margaret\u2014in the United States, in 1920.\nMilitary and governmental service.\nAccording to papers in the SOHS Archives, Bretnor's military background included service in the last cavalry unit in the U.S. Army. Health issues led to his discharge in August 1941. He tried to reenlist in 1942, but was rejected. He was hired by the Office of War Information to write propaganda to be sent to Japan, and papers related to his work are held in the SOHS Archives. After World War II, Bretnor worked for the U.S. State Department until ill health once again caused him to resign.\nLiterary career.\nBretnor contributed substantial work as an American science fiction author and editor between the 1950s and 1980s. As well, Bretnor worked extensively to edit science and science fiction-related compendia, and he edited some of the earliest books to consider science fiction from the perspective of literary theory and criticism.\nBretnor wrote and edited extensively in the area of non-fiction, including substantial works on military theory, and some on public affairs. He wrote multiple articles, including on cats, and he translated \"Les Chats\", the first known book about cats, written by Moncrif in 1727.\nBibliography.\nSymposia on science fiction.\nReginald Bretnor organised and edited several substantial volumes, inviting leading SF authors and science writers to contributing essays to his virtual symposia, including the following, discussing the science fiction genre:\nNon-fiction anthologies and related works.\nFurther volumes Bretnor wrote or organised, again leading to substantial volumes, were on the subject of the military and war. In 1969, Bretnor published \"Decisive Warfare\". Largely unnoticed by his science fiction readership and foreshadowing his \"Future at War\" series in 1979\u20131980, it proved him a scholar of varied talents. His collection \"Of Force and Violence and Other Imponderables: Essays on War, Politics, and Government\" was published in 1992, the year of his death.\nFerdinand Feghoot series.\nUnder the pseudonym Grendel Briarton (an anagram of Reginald Bretnor), he published a series of over eighty science-fiction themed shaggy-dog vignettes featuring the time-traveling hero Ferdinand Feghoot. Known as \"Feghoots\", the stories involved Feghoot resolving a situation encountered while traveling through time and space (\u00e0 la Doctor Who) with a bad pun. In one example, he explained his inability to pay his dues for a Sherlock Holmes fan society by turning out his empty pockets and declaring \"share lack\". In his adventures, Feghoot worked for the Society for the Aesthetic Re-Arrangement of History and traveled via a device that had no name but was typographically represented as the \")(\". In 1980, \"The Compleat Feghoot\" collected all of Bretnor's Feghoots published up to that time and included a selection of winners and honorable mentions from a contest run by \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\". The book is, as of 2006, out of print and very rare.\nOther writings.\nBretnor also wrote nonfiction articles for the survivalist newsletter \"P.S. Letter\", edited by Mel Tappan.\nPersonal life.\nBretnor was married to Helen Harding, a translator and U.C. Berkeley librarian, from 1948 until her death in 1967. He subsequently married Rosalie, whom he referred to in a letter in the Southern Oregon Historical Society Archives as Rosalie McShane, although she wrote under the name Rosalie Bodrero.\nBrentnor died at the age of 80, in Medford, Oregon, on July 22, 1992.\nThe Church of Satan website alleges that Bretnor was an early associate of Anton Szandor LaVey before his founding of the Church of Satan, and that Bretnor and other science fiction authors were members of LaVey's \"Order of the Trapezoid\" in the early 1950s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the most famous example of a pseudospherical surface. A pseudospherical surface is a surface piecewise smoothly immersed in formula_1 with constant negative Gaussian curvature. A \"pseudospherical surface of radius R\" is a surface in formula_1 having curvature \u22121/\"R\"2 at each point. Its name comes from the analogy with the sphere of radius R, which is a surface of curvature 1/\"R\"2. Examples include the tractroid, Dini's surfaces, breather surfaces, and the Kuen surface.\nThe term \"pseudosphere\" was introduced by Eugenio Beltrami in his 1868 paper on models of hyperbolic geometry.\nTractroid.\nBy \"the pseudosphere\", people usually mean the tractroid. The tractroid is obtained by revolving a tractrix about its asymptote. As an example, the (half) pseudosphere (with radius 1) is the surface of revolution of the tractrix parametrized by\n formula_4\nIt is a singular space (the equator is a singularity), but away from the singularities, it has constant negative Gaussian curvature and therefore is locally isometric to a hyperbolic plane.\nThe name \"pseudosphere\" comes about because it has a two-dimensional surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature, just as a sphere has a surface with constant positive Gaussian curvature.\nJust as the sphere has at every point a positively curved geometry of a dome the whole pseudosphere has at every point the negatively curved geometry of a saddle.\nAs early as 1693 Christiaan Huygens found that the volume and the surface area of the pseudosphere are finite, despite the infinite extent of the shape along the axis of rotation. For a given edge radius R, the area is 4\u03c0\"R\"2 just as it is for the sphere, while the volume is \u03c0\"R\"3 and therefore half that of a sphere of that radius.\nThe pseudosphere is an important geometric precursor to mathematical fabric arts and pedagogy.\nLine congruence.\nA line congruence is a 2-parameter families of lines in formula_5. It can be written asformula_6where each pick of formula_7 picks a specific line in the family.\nA focal surface of the line congruence is a surface that is tangent to the line congruence. At each point on the surface,formula_8The above equation expands to a quadratic equation in formula_9:formula_10Thus, for each formula_11, there in general exists two choices of formula_12. Thus a generic line congruence has exactly two focal surfaces parameterized by formula_12.\nFor a bundle of lines normal to a smooth surface, the two focal surfaces correspond to its evolutes: the loci of centers of principal curvature.\nIn 1879, Bianchi proved that if a line congruence is such that the corresponding points on the two focal surfaces are at a constant distance 1, that is, formula_14, then both of the focal surfaces have constant curvature -1.\nIn 1880, Lie proved a partial converse. Let formula_15 be a pseudospherical surface. Then there exists a second pseudospherical surface formula_16 and a line congruence formula_17 such that formula_15 and formula_16 are the focal surfaces of formula_17. Furthermore, formula_16 and formula_17 may be constructed from formula_15 by integrating a sequence of ODEs.\nUniversal covering space.\nThe half pseudosphere of curvature \u22121 is covered by the interior of a horocycle. In the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model one convenient choice is the portion of the half-plane with \"y\" \u2265 1. Then the covering map is periodic in the x direction of period 2\u03c0, and takes the horocycles \"y\" = \"c\" to the meridians of the pseudosphere and the vertical geodesics \"x\" = \"c\" to the tractrices that generate the pseudosphere. This mapping is a local isometry, and thus exhibits the portion \"y\" \u2265 1 of the upper half-plane as the universal covering space of the pseudosphere. The precise mapping is\n formula_24\nwhere\n formula_25\nis the parametrization of the tractrix above.\nHyperboloid.\nIn some sources that use the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperboloid is referred to as a pseudosphere.\nThis usage of the word is because the hyperboloid can be thought of as a sphere of imaginary radius, embedded in a Minkowski space.\nRelation to solutions to the sine-Gordon equation.\nPseudospherical surfaces can be constructed from solutions to the sine-Gordon equation. A sketch proof starts with reparametrizing the tractroid with coordinates in which the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations can be rewritten as the sine-Gordon equation. \nOn a surface, at each point, draw a cross, pointing at the two directions of principal curvature. These crosses can be integrated into two families of curves, making up a coordinate system on the surface. Let the coordinate system be written as formula_26. \nAt each point on a pseudospherical surface there in general exists two asymptotic directions. Along them, the curvature is zero. Let the angle between the asymptotic directions be formula_27. \nA theorem states thatformula_28In particular, for the tractroid the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations are the sine-Gordon equation applied to the static soliton solution, so the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations are satisfied. In these coordinates the first and second fundamental forms are written in a way that makes clear the Gaussian curvature is \u22121 for any solution of the sine-Gordon equations. \nThen any solution to the sine-Gordon equation can be used to specify a first and second fundamental form which satisfy the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations. There is then a theorem that any such set of initial data can be used to at least locally specify an immersed surface in formula_1.\nThis connection between sine-Gordon equations and pseudospherical surfaces mean that one can identify solutions to the equation with surfaces. Then, any way to generate new sine-Gordon solutions from old automatically generates new pseudospherical surfaces from old, and vice versa.\nA few examples of sine-Gordon solutions and their corresponding surface are given as follows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a specific interdisciplinary branch of mineralogy. Some jewelers (and many non-jewelers) are academically trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.\nHistory.\nRudimentary education in gemology for jewellers and gemologists began in the nineteenth century, but the first qualifications were instigated after the National Association of Goldsmiths of Great Britain (NAG) set up as an Education Committee for this purpose in 1908. The committee emerged as a distinct branch of NAG (named the Gemmological Association) in 1931, shortly after the incorporation of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). In 1938 the branch was renamed as the Gemmological Association of Great Britain, before being incorporated in 1847. The organisation is now an educational charity and accredited awarding body with its courses taught worldwide.\nThe first US graduate of Gem-A's diploma course, in 1929, was Robert Shipley, who then established both the Gemological Institute of America and the American Gem Society. There are now several professional schools and associations of gemologists and certification programs around the world.\nThe first gemological laboratory serving the jewelry trade was established in London in 1925, prompted by the influx of the newly developed \"cultured pearl\" and advances in the synthesis of rubies and sapphires. There are now numerous gem laboratories around the world requiring ever more advanced equipment and experience to identify the new challenges \u2013 such as treatments to gems, new synthetics, and other new materials.\nBackground.\nIt is often difficult to obtain an expert judgement from a neutral laboratory. Analysis and estimation in the gemstone trade usually have to take place on site. Professional gemologists and gemstone buyers use mobile laboratories, which pool all necessary instruments in a travel case. Such so-called travel labs even have their own current supply, which makes them independent from infrastructure. They are also suitable for gemological expeditions.\nGemstones are basically categorized based on their crystal structure, specific gravity, refractive index, and other optical properties, such as pleochroism. The physical property of \"hardness\" is defined by the irregular Mohs scale of mineral hardness.\nGemologists study these factors while valuing or appraising cut and polished gemstones. Gemological microscopic study of the internal structure is used to determine whether a gem is synthetic or natural by revealing natural fluid inclusions or partially melted exogenous crystals that are evidence of heat treatment to enhance color.\nThe spectroscopic analysis of cut gemstones also allows a gemologist to understand the atomic structure and identify its origin, which is a major factor in valuing a gemstone. For example, a ruby from Myanmar (Burma) will have definite internal and optical activity variance from a Thai ruby.\nWhen the gemstones are in a rough state, the gemologist studies the external structure; the host rock and mineral association; and natural and polished color. Initially, the stone is identified by its color, refractive index, optical character, specific gravity, and examination of internal characteristics under magnification.\nGemological instruments.\nGemologists use a variety of tools and equipment which allow for the accurate tests to be performed in order to identify a gemstone by its specific characteristics and properties.\nThese include:\nGeneral identification of gems.\nGem identification is basically a process of elimination. Gemstones of similar color undergo non-destructive optical testing until there is only one possible identity.\nAny single test is nearly always only indicative. For example: The specific gravity of ruby is 4.00, glass is 3.15\u20134.20, and cubic zirconia is 5.6\u20135.9\u00a0. So one can easily tell the difference between cubic zirconia and the other two; however, there is overlap between ruby and glass.\nAs with all naturally occurring materials, no two gems are identical. The geological environment they are created in influences the overall process so that although the basics can be identified, the presence of chemical \"impurities\", and substitutions along with structural imperfections create \"individuals\".\nIdentification by refractive index.\nOne test to determine the gem's identity is to measure the refraction of light in the gem. Essentially, when light passes from one medium to another, it bends. Blue light bends more than red light. How much the light bends will vary depending on the gem mineral.\nEvery material has a critical angle, above which point light is reflected back internally. This can be measured and thus used to determine the gem's identity. Typically this is measured using a refractometer, although it is possible to measure it using a microscope.\nIdentification by specific gravity.\nSpecific gravity, also known as relative density, varies depending upon the chemical composition and crystal structure type. Heavy liquids with a known specific gravity are used to test loose gemstones.\nSpecific gravity is measured by comparing the weight of the gem in air with the weight of the gem suspended in water.\nIdentification by spectroscopy.\nThis method uses a similar principle to how a prism works to separate white light into its component colors. A gemological spectroscope is employed to analyze the selective absorption of light in the gem material. Coloring agents or chromophores show bands in the spectroscope and indicate which element is responsible for the gem's color.\nIdentification by inclusions.\nInclusions can help gemologists to determine whether or not a gemstone is natural, synthetic or treated (i.e. fracture-filled or heated).\nIdentification by flaws and striations.\nDuring the Verneuil process for synthesizing gems, a fine crushed material is heated at extremely high temperatures. The powdered gem mineral is then melted (or a metallic mixture directly burned in an oxygen flame) the residue of which then drips through a furnace onto a boule. The boule where the corundum or spinel cools down and crystallizes, spins and thus causes the curved striations, which are diagnostic for a lab-created gem: Natural corundum does not show curved striations.\nLikewise, natural stones, particularly beryl minerals, show small flaws \u2013 short planar cracks where the direction of the crystalline orientation in the gem abruptly changes. The natural formation of gemstones tends to layer the minerals in regular crystalline sheets, whereas many synthetically produced gems have an amorphous structure, like glass. Synthetics made by the Verneuil process either do not show flaws at all, or if any flaws are present, show curvy, undulating surfaces rather than flat ones.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If a curve or surface is contained in a larger space, curvature can be defined \"extrinsically\" relative to the ambient space. Curvature of Riemannian manifolds of dimension at least two can be defined \"intrinsically\" without reference to a larger space.\nFor curves, curvature describes how sharply the curve bends. The canonical examples are circles: smaller circles bend more sharply and hence have higher curvature. For a point on a general curve, the direction of the curve is described by its tangent line. How sharply the curve is bending at that point can be measured by how much that tangent line changes direction per unit distance along the curve. \nCurvature measures the angular rate of change of the direction of the tangent line, or the unit tangent vector, of the curve per unit distance along the curve. Curvature is expressed in units of radians per unit distance. For a circle, that rate of change is the same at all points on the circle and is equal to the reciprocal of the circle\u2019s radius. Straight lines don\u2019t change direction and have zero curvature. The curvature at a point on a twice differentiable curve is the magnitude of its curvature vector at that point and is also the curvature of its osculating circle, which is the circle that best approximates the curve near that point.\nFor surfaces (and, more generally for higher-dimensional manifolds), that are embedded in a Euclidean space, the concept of curvature is more complex, as it depends on the choice of a direction on the surface or manifold. This leads to the concepts of \"maximal curvature\", \"minimal curvature\", and \"mean curvature\".\nHistory.\nThe history of curvature began with the ancient Greeks' basic distinction between straight and circular lines, with the concept later developed by figures like Aristotle and Apollonius. The development of calculus in the 17th century, particularly by Newton and Leibniz, provided tools to systematically calculate curvature for curves. Euler then extended the study to surfaces, followed by Gauss's crucial insight of \"intrinsic\" curvature, which is independent of how a surface is embedded in space, and Riemann's generalization to higher dimensions.\nIn \"Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum,\" the 14th-century philosopher and mathematician Nicole Oresme introduces the concept of curvature as a measure of departure from straightness; for circles he has the curvature as being inversely proportional to the radius; and he attempts to extend this idea to other curves as a continuously varying magnitude.\nThe curvature of a differentiable curve was originally defined through osculating circles. In this setting, Augustin-Louis Cauchy showed that the center of curvature is the intersection point of two infinitely close normal lines to the curve.\nCurves.\nIntuitively, curvature describes for any part of a curve how much the curve direction changes over a small distance along the curve. The direction of the curve at any point P is described by a unit tangent vector, T. A section of a curve is also called an arc, and length along the curve is arc length, s. So the curvature for a small section of the curve is the angle of the change of the direction of the tangent vector divided by the arc length \u0394s. For a general curve which might have a varying curvature along its length, the curvature at a point P on the curve is the limit of the curvature of sections containing P as the length of the sections approaches zero. For a twice differentiable curve, that limit is the magnitude of the derivative of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. Using the lowercase Greek letter kappa to denote curvature:\nformula_1\nCurvature is a differential-geometric property of the curve; it does not depend on the parametrization of the curve. In particular, it does not depend on the orientation of the parametrized curve, i.e. which direction along the curve is associated with increasing parameter values.\nArc-length parametrization.\nA curve that is parametrized by arc length is a vector-valued function that is denoted by the Greek letter gamma with an overbar, , that describes the position of a point on the curve, P, in terms of its arc-length distance, s along the curve from some other reference point on the curve. Thus for some interval \"I\" \n [\"a\", \"b\"] in &amp;Ropf;, with\nformula_2\nIf is a differentiable curve, then the first derivative of , is a unit tangent vector, T(\"s\"), and\nformula_3\nformula_4\nIf is twice differentiable, the second derivative of is T\u2032(\"s\"), which is also the curvature vector, K(\"s\").\nformula_5\nCurvature is the magnitude of the second derivative of \u2009.\nformula_6 \nThe parameter s can also be interpreted as a time parameter. Then describes the path of a particle that moves along the curve at a constant unit speed. Curvature can then be understood as a measure of how fast the direction of the particle rotates.\nGeneral parametrization.\nA twice differentiable curve, \u03b3: [\"a\", \"b\"] \u2192 &amp;Ropf;\"n\", that is not parametrized by arc length can be re-parametrized by arc length provided that \u03b3\u2032(t) is everywhere not zero, so that is always a finite positive number.\nThe arc-length parameter, s, is defined by\nformula_7\nwhich has an inverse function \"t\"(\"s\").\nThe arc-length parametrization is the function which is defined as\nformula_8\nBoth \u03b3 and trace the same path in &amp;Ropf;\"n\" and so have the same curvature vector and curvature at each point P on the curve. For a given s and its corresponding \"t\" \n \"t\"(\"s\"), point P and its unit tangent vector, T, curvature vector, K, and curvature, \u03ba, are:\nformula_9\nformula_10\nformula_11\nformula_12\nThe curvature vector, K, \nis the perpendicular component of \n\u03b3\u2032\u2032(\"t\") /\n\u2016\u03b3\u2032(\"t\")\u20162\nrelative to the tangent vector\n\u03b3\u2032(\"t\").\nThis is also reflected in the second expression for the curvature: the expression inside the parentheses is cos \"\u03b8\", \nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors T and \u03b3\u2032\u2032(\"t\"), so that the square root produces sin \"\u03b8\".\nIf \u03b3 is twice continuously differentiable, then so is s(t) and , while T(\"t\") is continuously differentiable, and K(\"t\") and \"\u03ba\"(\"t\") are continuous.\nOften it is difficult or impossible to express the arc-length parametrization, , in closed form even when \u03b3 is given in closed form. This is typically the case when it is difficult or impossible to express \"s\"(\"t\") or its inverse \"t\"(\"s\") in closed form. However curvature can be expressed only in terms of the first and second derivatives of \u03b3, without direct reference to .\nCurvature Vector.\nThe curvature vector, denoted with an upper-case K, is the derivative of the unit tangent vector, T, with respect to arc length, s:\nformula_13\nThe curvature vector represents both the direction towards which the curve is turning as well as how sharply it turns.\nThe curvature vector has the following properties:\nOsculating circle.\nHistorically, the curvature of a differentiable curve was defined through the osculating circle, which is the circle that best approximates the curve at a point. More precisely, given a point P on a curve, every other point Q of the curve defines a circle (or sometimes a line) passing through Q and tangent to the curve at P. The osculating circle is the limit, if it exists, of this circle when Q tends to P. Then the \"center of curvature\" and the \"radius of curvature\" of the curve at P are the center and the radius of the osculating circle. \nThe radius of curvature, R, is the reciprocal of the curvature, provided that the curvature is not zero: formula_20\nFor a curve \u03b3, since a non-zero curvature vector, K(\"t\"), points from the point P \n \u03b3(\"t\") towards the center of curvature, but the magnitude of K(\"t\") is the curvature, \"\u03ba\"(\"t\"), the center of curvature, C(\"t\") is\nformula_21\nWhen the curvature is zero, for example on a straight line or at a point of inflection, the radius of curvature is infinite and the center of curvature is indeterminate or \"at infinity\".\nCurvature from arc and chord length.\nGiven two points P and Q on a curve \u03b3, let \"s\"(P,Q) be the arc length of the portion of the curve between P and Q and let \"d\"(P,Q) denote the length of the line segment from P to Q. The curvature of \u03b3 at P is given by the limit\nformula_22\nwhere the limit is taken as the point Q approaches P on \u03b3. The denominator can equally well be taken to be \"d\"(P,Q)3. The formula is valid in any dimension. The formula follows by verifying it for the osculating circle.\nExceptional cases.\nThere may be some situations where the preconditions for the above formulas do not apply, but where it is still appropriate to apply the concept of curvature.\nIt can be useful to apply the concept of curvature to a curve \u03b3 at a point P \n \u03b3(\"t0\") if the one-sided derivatives for \u03b3\u2032(\"t0\") exist but are different values, or likewise for \u03b3\u2032\u2032(\"t0\"). In such a case, it could be useful to describe the curve with curvature at each side. Such might be the case of a curve that is constructed piecewise.\nAnother situation occurs when the limit of a ratio results in an indeterminate 0 / 0 value for the curvature, for example when both derivatives exist but are both zero. In such a case, it might be possible to evaluate the underlying limit using l'H\u00f4pital's rule.\nExamples.\nThe following are examples of curves with application of the relevant concepts and formulas.\nCircle.\nA geometric explanation for why the curvature of a circle of radius \"R\" at any point P is 1/\"R\" is partially illustrated by the diagram to the right. \nThe length of the red arc is L and the measure in radians of the arc's central angle, angle ACB, is \"L\"/\"R\". The angle between the arc endpoint tangents is angle BDE, which is the same size as the central angle, because both angles are supplementary to angle BDE.\nThe ratio of the angle between the arc endpoint tangents, measured in radians, divided by the arc length L is (\"L\"/\"R\")/\"L\" \n 1/\"R\".\nSince the ratio is 1/\"R\" for any arc of the circle that is less than a half circle, for arcs containing any given point P on the circle, the limit of the ratio as arc length approaches zero is also 1/\"R\". Hence the curvature of the circle at any point P is 1/\"R\".\nA common parametrization of a circle of radius r is \u03b3(\"t\") \n (\"r\" cos \"t\", \"r\" sin \"t\"). Then \nformula_23\nThe general formula for curvature gives\nformula_24\nand the formula for a plane curve gives\nformula_25\nIt follows, as expected, that the radius of curvature is the radius of the circle, and that the center of curvature is the center of the circle.\nThe circle is a rare case where the arc-length parametrization is easy to compute, as it is\nformula_26\nIt is an arc-length parametrization, since the norm of\nformula_27\nis equal to one. Then\nformula_28\ngives the same value for the curvature.\nThe same circle can also be defined by the implicit equation \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") = 0 with \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") = \"x\"2 + \"y\"2 \u2013 \"r\"2. Then, the formula for the curvature in this case gives\nformula_29\nParabola.\nConsider the parabola \"y\" \n \"ax\"2 + \"bx\" + \"c\".\nIt is the graph of a function, with derivative 2\"ax\" + \"b\", and second derivative 2\"a\". So, the signed curvature is \nformula_30\nIt has the sign of a for all values of x. This means that, if \"a\" &gt; 0, the concavity is upward directed everywhere; if \"a\" &lt; 0, the concavity is downward directed; for \"a\" = 0, the curvature is zero everywhere, confirming that the parabola degenerates into a line in this case.\nThe (unsigned) curvature is maximal for \"x\" = \u2013, that is at the stationary point (zero derivative) of the function, which is the vertex of the parabola.\nConsider the parametrization \u03b3(\"t\") \n (\"t\", \"at\"2 + \"bt\" + \"c\") \n (\"x\", \"y\"). The first derivative of x is 1, and the second derivative is zero. Substituting into the formula for general parametrizations gives exactly the same result as above, with x replaced by t and with primes referring to derivatives with respect to the parameter t.\nThe same parabola can also be defined by the implicit equation \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") = 0 with \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") \n \"ax\"2 + \"bx\" + \"c\" \u2013 \"y\". As \"Fy\" = \u20131, and \"Fyy\" = \"Fxy\" = 0, one obtains exactly the same value for the (unsigned) curvature. However, the signed curvature is not defined for an implicit equation since the signed curvature depends on an orientation of the curve that is not provided by the implicit equation.\nPlane curves.\nLet \u03b3(\"t\") \n (\"x\"(\"t\"), \"y\"(\"t\")) be a proper parametric representation of a twice differentiable plane curve. Here \"proper\" means that on the domain of definition of the parametrization, the derivative \nexists and is nowhere equal to the zero vector.\nThe curvature \"\u03ba\" of a plane curve can be expressed in ways that are specific to two dimensions, such as\nformula_31\nwhere primes refer to derivatives with respect to t.\nThis can be expressed in a coordinate-free way as\nformula_32\nwhere the numerator is the absolute value of the determinant of the 2-by-2 matrix with \u03b3\u2032 and \u03b3\u2032\u2032 as the columns.\nThese formulas can be understood as an application of the cross product formula for curvature in three dimensions. Since the operands have zeros in the third dimension, the cross product result will have zero values for the first two dimensions, so only the value in the third dimension is relevant to calculating the magnitude of the cross product. The formula for the value of the third dimension thus appears in the numerator of the above formulas.\nSigned curvature.\nFor plane curves, it can be useful to express the curvature as a single scalar that can be positive or negative, called the signed curvature or oriented curvature and denoted with a lowercase k. The signed curvature formulas are similar to those for \u03ba except that they omit taking the absolute value of the numerator:\nformula_33\nThen \"k\" \n &amp;PlusMinus; \u03ba. Whether k is positive or negative depends on the orientation of the curve. Whether a positive k corresponds to clockwise or counterclockwise turning depends on the orientation of the curve and the orientation of the coordinate axes. With a standard orientation of the coordinate axes, when moving along the curve in the direction of increasing t, k is positive if the curve turns to the left, counterclockwise, and it is negative if the curve turns to the right, clockwise. This is consistent with the convention of treating counterclockwise rotations as rotations through a positive angle. However, since the sign of k is dependent on the orientation of the parametrization, k is not differential-geometric property property of the curve.\nExcept for orientation issues, the signed curvature for a plane curve captures similar information as the curvature vector, which for a plane curve is constrained to just one dimension, the line that is perpendicular to the unit tangent vector.\nUsing a standard orientation of the coordinate axes, let be the unit normal vector obtained from the unit tangent vector, T, by a counterclockwise rotation of .\nThen is dependent on the orientation of the curve and points to the left when moving along the curve in the direction of increasing \"t\". However the curvature vector, K is equal to the product of the signed curvature, k and , because their orientation dependencies cancel:\nformula_34\nSimilarly, the center of curvature can be expressed using the signed curvature and : \nformula_35\nGraph of a function.\nThe graph of a function \"y\" \n \"f\"(\"x\"), is a special case of a parametrized curve, of the form\nformula_36\nAs the first and second derivatives of x are 1 and 0, previous formulas simplify to \nformula_37\nfor the curvature and to\nformula_38\nfor the signed curvature.\nIn the general case of a curve, the sign of the signed curvature is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on the orientation of the curve. In the case of the graph of a function, there is a natural orientation by increasing values of x. This gives additional significance to the sign of the signed curvature.\nThe sign of the signed curvature is the same as the sign of the second derivative of f. If it is positive then the graph has an upward concavity, and, if it is negative the graph has a downward concavity. If it is zero, then one has an inflection point or an undulation point.\nWhen the slope of the graph (that is the derivative of the function) is small, the signed curvature is well approximated by the second derivative. More precisely, using big O notation, one has \nformula_39\nIt is common in physics and engineering to approximate the curvature with the second derivative, for example, in beam theory or for deriving the wave equation of a string under tension, and other applications where small slopes are involved. This often allows systems that are otherwise nonlinear to be treated approximately as linear.\nImplicit curve.\nFor a curve defined by an implicit equation \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") \n 0 with partial derivatives denoted Fx , Fy , Fxx , Fxy , Fyy ,\nthe curvature is given by\nformula_40\nThe signed curvature is not defined, as it depends on an orientation of the curve that is not provided by the implicit equation. Note that changing F into \u2013\"F\" would not change the curve defined by \"F\"(\"x\", \"y\") \n 0, but it would change the sign of the numerator if the absolute value were omitted in the preceding formula.\nA point of the curve where \"Fx\" = \"Fy\" = 0 is a singular point, which means that the curve is not differentiable at this point, and thus that the curvature is not defined (most often, the point is either a crossing point or a cusp).\nThe above formula for the curvature can be derived from the expression of the curvature of the graph of a function by using the implicit function theorem and the fact that, on such a curve, one has \nformula_41\nPolar coordinates.\nIf a curve is defined in polar coordinates by the radius expressed as a function of the polar angle, that is r is a function of \u03b8, then its curvature is\nformula_42\nwhere the prime refers to differentiation with respect to \u03b8.\nThis results from the formula for general parametrizations, by considering the parametrization \nformula_43\nCurvature comb.\nA \"curvature comb\" can be used to represent graphically the curvature of every point on a curve. If \u03b3 is a curve parametrized t, its comb is defined as the parametrized curve defined by\nformula_44\nwhere \u03ba is the curvature, N is the unit normal vector that points toward the center of curvature, and s is a scaling factor that is chosen to enhance the graphical representation.\nCurvature combs are useful when combining two different curves in CAD environments. They provide a visual representation of the continuity between the curves. The continuity can be defined as being in one of four levels.\nG0 : The 2 curvature combs are at an angle at the junction.\nG1 : The teeth of the 2 combs are parallel at the junction but are of different length.\nG2 : The teeth are parallel and of the same length. However the tangents of the 2 combs are not the same.\nG3 : The teeth are parallel and of the same length and the tangents of the 2 combs are the same.\nThe above image shows a G2 continuity at the 2 junctions.\nFrenet\u2013Serret formulas for plane curves.\nThe first Frenet\u2013Serret formula relates the unit tangent vector, curvature, and the normal vector of an arc-length parametrization\nformula_45\nwhere the primes refer to the derivatives with respect to the arc length s, and N(\"s\") is the normal unit vector in the direction of T\u2032(s).\nAs planar curves have zero torsion, the second Frenet\u2013Serret formula provides the relation\nformula_46\nFor a general parametrization by a parameter t, one needs expressions involving derivatives with respect to t. As these are obtained by multiplying by the derivatives with respect to s, one has, for any proper parametrization\nformula_47\nCurves in three dimensions.\nFor a parametrically defined curve in three dimensions given in Cartesian coordinates by \u03b3(\"t\") \n (\"x\"(\"t\"), \"y\"(\"t\"), \"z\"(\"t\")), the curvature is\nformula_48\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the parameter t. Both the curvature and the curvature vector can be expressed using the vector cross product and the unit tangent vector T:\nformula_49 \nformula_50\nThese formulas are related to the general formulas for curvature and the curvature vector, except that they use the vector cross product instead of the scalar dot product to express the perpendicular component of \u03b3\u2032\u2032 / \u2016\u03b3\u2032\u2016^2 relative to \u03b3\u2032.\nSurfaces.\nThe curvature of curves drawn on a surface is the main tool for the defining and studying the curvature of the surface.\nCurves on surfaces.\nFor a curve drawn on a surface (embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space), several curvatures are defined, which relates the direction of curvature to the surface's unit normal vector, including the:\nAny non-singular curve on a smooth surface has its tangent vector T contained in the tangent plane of the surface. The normal curvature, \"k\"n, is the curvature of the curve projected onto the plane containing the curve's tangent T and the surface normal u; the geodesic curvature, \"k\"g, is the curvature of the curve projected onto the surface's tangent plane; and the geodesic torsion (or relative torsion), \"\u03c4\"r, measures the rate of change of the surface normal around the curve's tangent.\nLet the curve be arc-length parametrized, and let t \n u \u00d7 T so that T, t, u form an orthonormal basis, called the Darboux frame. The above quantities are related by:\nformula_51\nPrincipal curvature.\nAll curves on the surface with the same tangent vector at a given point will have the same normal curvature, which is the same as the curvature of the curve obtained by intersecting the surface with the plane containing T and u. Taking all possible tangent vectors, the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature at a point are called the principal curvatures, \"k\"1 and \"k\"2, and the directions of the corresponding tangent vectors are called principal normal directions.\nNormal sections.\nCurvature can be evaluated along surface normal sections, similar to above (see for example the Earth radius of curvature).\nDevelopable surfaces.\nSome curved surfaces, such as those made from a smooth sheet of paper, can be flattened down into the plane without distorting their intrinsic features in any way. Such developable surfaces have zero Gaussian curvature (see below).\nGaussian curvature.\nIn contrast to curves, which do not have intrinsic curvature, but do have extrinsic curvature (they only have a curvature given an embedding), surfaces can have intrinsic curvature, independent of an embedding. The Gaussian curvature, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is equal to the product of the principal curvatures, \"k\"1\"k\"2. It has a dimension of length\u22122 and is positive for spheres, negative for one-sheet hyperboloids and zero for planes and cylinders. It determines whether a surface is locally convex (when it is positive) or locally saddle-shaped (when it is negative).\nGaussian curvature is an \"intrinsic\" property of the surface, meaning it does not depend on the particular embedding of the surface; intuitively, this means that ants living on the surface could determine the Gaussian curvature. For example, an ant living on a sphere could measure the sum of the interior angles of a triangle and determine that it was greater than 180 degrees, implying that the space it inhabited had positive curvature. On the other hand, an ant living on a cylinder would not detect any such departure from Euclidean geometry; in particular the ant could not detect that the two surfaces have different mean curvatures (see below), which is a purely extrinsic type of curvature.\nFormally, Gaussian curvature only depends on the Riemannian metric of the surface. This is Gauss's celebrated Theorema Egregium, which he found while concerned with geographic surveys and mapmaking.\nAn intrinsic definition of the Gaussian curvature at a point P is the following: imagine an ant which is tied to P with a short thread of length r. It runs around P while the thread is completely stretched and measures the length \"C\"(\"r\") of one complete trip around P. If the surface were flat, the ant would find \"C\"(\"r\") \n 2\u03c0\"r\". On curved surfaces, the formula for \"C\"(\"r\") will be different, and the Gaussian curvature K at the point P can be computed by the Bertrand\u2013Diguet\u2013Puiseux theorem as\nformula_52\nThe integral of the Gaussian curvature over the whole surface is closely related to the surface's Euler characteristic; see the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem.\nThe discrete analog of curvature, corresponding to curvature being concentrated at a point and particularly useful for polyhedra, is the (angular) defect; the analog for the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem is Descartes' theorem on total angular defect.\nBecause (Gaussian) curvature can be defined without reference to an embedding space, it is not necessary that a surface be embedded in a higher-dimensional space in order to be curved. Such an intrinsically curved two-dimensional surface is a simple example of a Riemannian manifold.\nMean curvature.\nThe mean curvature is an \"extrinsic\" measure of curvature equal to half the sum of the principal curvatures, . It has a dimension of length\u22121. Mean curvature is closely related to the first variation of surface area. In particular, a minimal surface such as a soap film has mean curvature zero and a soap bubble has constant mean curvature. Unlike Gauss curvature, the mean curvature is extrinsic and depends on the embedding, for instance, a cylinder and a plane are locally isometric but the mean curvature of a plane is zero while that of a cylinder is nonzero.\nSecond fundamental form.\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of a surface can be combined in the second fundamental form. This is a quadratic form in the tangent plane to the surface at a point whose value at a particular tangent vector X to the surface is the normal component of the acceleration of a curve along the surface tangent to X; that is, it is the normal curvature to a curve tangent to X (see above). Symbolically,\nformula_53\nwhere N is the unit normal to the surface. For unit tangent vectors X, the second fundamental form assumes the maximum value \"k\"1 and minimum value \"k\"2, which occur in the principal directions u1 and u2, respectively. Thus, by the principal axis theorem, the second fundamental form is\nformula_54\nThus the second fundamental form encodes both the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures.\nShape operator.\nAn encapsulation of surface curvature can be found in the shape operator, \"S\", which is a self-adjoint linear operator from the tangent plane to itself (specifically, the differential of the Gauss map).\nFor a surface with tangent vectors X and normal N, the shape operator can be expressed compactly in index summation notation as\nformula_55\nThe Weingarten equations give the value of \"S\" in terms of the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms as\nformula_56\nThe principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace.\nCurvature of space.\nBy extension of the former argument, a space of three or more dimensions can be intrinsically curved. The curvature is \"intrinsic\" in the sense that it is a property defined at every point in the space, rather than a property defined with respect to a larger space that contains it. In general, a curved space may or may not be conceived as being embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space; if not then its curvature can only be defined intrinsically.\nAfter the discovery of the intrinsic definition of curvature, which is closely connected with non-Euclidean geometry, many mathematicians and scientists questioned whether ordinary physical space might be curved, although the success of Euclidean geometry up to that time meant that the radius of curvature must be astronomically large. In the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity and cosmology, the idea is slightly generalised to the \"curvature of spacetime\"; in relativity theory spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Once a time coordinate is defined, the three-dimensional space corresponding to a particular time is generally a curved Riemannian manifold; but since the time coordinate choice is largely arbitrary, it is the underlying spacetime curvature that is physically significant.\nAlthough an arbitrarily curved space is very complex to describe, the curvature of a space which is locally isotropic and homogeneous is described by a single Gaussian curvature, as for a surface; mathematically these are strong conditions, but they correspond to reasonable physical assumptions (all points and all directions are indistinguishable). A positive curvature corresponds to the inverse square radius of curvature; an example is a sphere or hypersphere. An example of negatively curved space is hyperbolic geometry (see also: non-positive curvature). A space or space-time with zero curvature is called flat. For example, Euclidean space is an example of a flat space, and Minkowski space is an example of a flat spacetime. There are other examples of flat geometries in both settings, though. A torus or a cylinder can both be given flat metrics, but differ in their topology. Other topologies are also possible for curved space &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nGeneralizations.\nThe mathematical notion of \"curvature\" is also defined in much more general contexts. Many of these generalizations emphasize different aspects of the curvature as it is understood in lower dimensions.\nOne such generalization is kinematic. The curvature of a curve can naturally be considered as a kinematic quantity, representing the force felt by a certain observer moving along the curve; analogously, curvature in higher dimensions can be regarded as a kind of tidal force (this is one way of thinking of the sectional curvature). This generalization of curvature depends on how nearby test particles diverge or converge when they are allowed to move freely in the space; see Jacobi field.\nAnother broad generalization of curvature comes from the study of parallel transport on a surface. For instance, if a vector is moved around a loop on the surface of a sphere keeping parallel throughout the motion, then the final position of the vector may not be the same as the initial position of the vector. This phenomenon is known as holonomy. Various generalizations capture in an abstract form this idea of curvature as a measure of holonomy; see curvature form. A closely related notion of curvature comes from gauge theory in physics, where the curvature represents a field and a vector potential for the field is a quantity that is in general path-dependent: it may change if an observer moves around a loop.\nTwo more generalizations of curvature are the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature. In a curved surface such as the sphere, the area of a disc on the surface differs from the area of a disc of the same radius in flat space. This difference (in a suitable limit) is measured by the scalar curvature. The difference in area of a sector of the disc is measured by the Ricci curvature. Each of the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature are defined in analogous ways in three and higher dimensions. They are particularly important in relativity theory, where they both appear on the side of Einstein's field equations that represents the geometry of spacetime (the other side of which represents the presence of matter and energy). These generalizations of curvature underlie, for instance, the notion that curvature can be a property of a measure; see curvature of a measure.\nAnother generalization of curvature relies on the ability to compare a curved space with another space that has \"constant\" curvature. Often this is done with triangles in the spaces. The notion of a triangle makes senses in metric spaces, and this gives rise to CAT(\"k\") spaces.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60776", "revid": "10494543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60776", "title": "ACID", "text": "Robustness properties for database transactions\nIn computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a \"transaction\". For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.\nIn 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo H\u00e4rder coined the acronym \"ACID\", building on earlier work by Jim Gray who named atomicity, consistency, and durability, but not isolation, when characterizing the transaction concept. These four properties are the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems.\nAccording to Gray and Reuter, the IBM Information Management System supported ACID transactions as early as 1973 (although the acronym was created later).\nBASE stands for basically available, soft state, and eventually consistent: the acronym highlights that BASE is opposite of ACID, like their chemical equivalents. ACID databases prioritize consistency over \"availability\" \u2014 the whole transaction fails if an error occurs in any step within the transaction; in contrast, BASE databases prioritize \"availability\" over \"consistency\": instead of failing the transaction, users can access inconsistent data \"temporarily\": data consistency is achieved, but \"not immediately\". A database either leans towards ACID or BASE, but it cannot be both (according to CAP theorem). For example, SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS RedShift) are structured over the ACID model, while NoSQL databases (like DynamoDB or MongoDB) use the BASE architecture. However, some NoSQL databases might exhibit certain ACID traits.\nCharacteristics.\nThe characteristics of these four properties as defined by Reuter and H\u00e4rder are as follows:\nAtomicity.\nTransactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single \"unit\", which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database from occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next, it has already occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was cancelled in progress).\nConsistency.\nConsistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, preserving database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction. An example of a database invariant is referential integrity, which guarantees the primary key\u2013foreign key relationship.\nIsolation.\nTransactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the isolation level used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not be visible to other transactions.\nDurability.\nDurability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.\nExamples.\nThe following examples further illustrate the ACID properties. In these examples, the database table has two columns, A and B. An integrity constraint requires that the value in A and the value in B must sum to 100. The following SQL code creates a table as described above:CREATE TABLE acidtest (A INTEGER, B INTEGER, CHECK (A + B = 100));\nAtomicity.\nAtomicity is the guarantee that series of database operations in an atomic transaction will either all occur (a successful operation), or none will occur (an unsuccessful operation). The series of operations cannot be separated with only some of them being executed, which makes the series of operations \"indivisible\". A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database from occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. In other words, atomicity means indivisibility and irreducibility. Alternatively, we may say that a logical transaction may be composed of several physical transactions. Unless and until all component physical transactions are executed, the logical transaction will not have occurred. \nAn example of an atomic transaction is a monetary transfer from bank account A to account B. It consists of two operations, withdrawing the money from account A and depositing it to account B. We would not want to see the amount removed from account A before we are sure it has also been transferred into account B. Performing these operations in an atomic transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, that is, money is neither debited nor credited if either of those two operations fails.\nConsistency failure.\nConsistency is a very general term, which demands that the data must meet all validation rules. In the previous example, the validation is a requirement that . All validation rules must be checked to ensure consistency. Assume that a transaction attempts to subtract 10 from A without altering B. Because consistency is checked after each transaction, it is known that before the transaction begins. If the transaction removes 10 from A successfully, atomicity will be achieved. However, a validation check will show that , which is inconsistent with the rules of the database. The entire transaction must be canceled and the affected rows rolled back to their pre-transaction state. If there had been other constraints, triggers, or cascades, every single change operation would have been checked in the same way as above before the transaction was committed. Similar issues may arise with other constraints. We may have required the data types of both A and B to be integers. If we were then to enter, say, the value 13.5 for A, the transaction will be canceled, or the system may give rise to an alert in the form of a trigger (if/when the trigger has been written to this effect). Another example would be integrity constraints, which would not allow us to delete a row in one table whose primary key is referred to by at least one foreign key in other tables.\nIsolation failure.\nTo demonstrate isolation, we assume two transactions execute at the same time, each attempting to modify the same data. One of the two must wait until the other completes in order to maintain isolation.\nConsider two transactions:\nCombined, there are four actions:\nIf these operations are performed in order, isolation is maintained, although T2 must wait. Consider what happens if T1 fails halfway through. The database eliminates T1's effects, and T2 sees only valid data.\nBy interleaving the transactions, the actual order of actions might be:\nAgain, consider what happens if T1 fails while modifying B in Step 4. By the time T1 fails, T2 has already modified A; it cannot be restored to the value it had before T1 without leaving an invalid database. This is known as a write-write contention, because two transactions attempted to write to the same data field. In a typical system, the problem would be resolved by reverting to the last known good state, canceling the failed transaction T1, and restarting the interrupted transaction T2 from the good state.\nDurability failure.\nConsider a transaction that transfers 10 from A to B. First, it removes 10 from A, then it adds 10 to B. At this point, the user is told the transaction was a success. However, the changes are still queued in the disk buffer waiting to be committed to disk. Power fails and the changes are lost, but the user assumes (understandably) that the changes persist.\nImplementation.\nProcessing a transaction often requires a sequence of operations that is subject to failure for a number of reasons. For instance, the system may have no room left on its disk drives, or it may have used up its allocated CPU time. There are two popular families of techniques: write-ahead logging and shadow paging. In both cases, locks must be acquired on all information to be updated, and depending on the level of isolation, possibly on all data that may be read as well. In write ahead logging, durability is guaranteed by writing the prospective change to a persistent log before changing the database. That allows the database to return to a consistent state in the event of a crash. In shadowing, updates are applied to a partial copy of the database, and the new copy is activated when the transaction commits.\nLocking vs. multiversioning.\nMany databases rely upon locking to provide ACID capabilities. Locking means that the transaction marks the data that it accesses so that the DBMS knows not to allow other transactions to modify it until the first transaction succeeds or fails. The lock must always be acquired before processing data, including data that is read but not modified. Non-trivial transactions typically require a large number of locks, resulting in substantial overhead as well as blocking other transactions. For example, if user A is running a transaction that has to read a row of data that user B wants to modify, user B must wait until user A's transaction completes. Two-phase locking is often applied to guarantee full isolation.\nAn alternative to locking is multiversion concurrency control, in which the database provides each reading transaction the prior, unmodified version of data that is being modified by another active transaction. This allows readers to operate without acquiring locks, i.e., writing transactions do not block reading transactions, and readers do not block writers. Going back to the example, when user A's transaction requests data that user B is modifying, the database provides A with the version of that data that existed when user B started his transaction. User A gets a consistent view of the database even if other users are changing data. One implementation, namely snapshot isolation, relaxes the isolation property.\nDistributed transactions.\nGuaranteeing ACID properties in a distributed transaction across a distributed database, where no single node is responsible for all data affecting a transaction, presents additional complications. Network connections might fail, or one node might successfully complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of a failure on another node. The two-phase commit protocol (not to be confused with two-phase locking) provides atomicity for distributed transactions to ensure that each participant in the transaction agrees on whether the transaction should be committed or not. Briefly, in the first phase, one node (the coordinator) interrogates the other nodes (the participants), and only when all reply that they are prepared does the coordinator, in the second phase, formalize the transaction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60777", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60777", "title": "Limonite", "text": "Hydrated iron oxide mineral\nLimonite () is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as , although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 400 BC.\nNames.\nLimonite is named for the Ancient Greek word ( ), meaning \"wet meadow\", or ( ), meaning \"marshy lake\", as an allusion to its occurrence as bog iron ore in meadows and marshes. In its brown form, it is sometimes called brown hematite or brown iron ore.\nCharacteristics.\nLimonite is relatively dense with a specific gravity varying from 2.7 to 4.3. It is usually medium to dark yellowish brown in color. The streak of limonite on an unglazed porcelain plate is always yellowish brown, a character which distinguishes it from hematite with a red streak, or from magnetite with a black streak. The hardness is quite variable, ranging from 1 to 5. In thin section it appears as red, yellow, or brown and has a high index of refraction, 2.0\u20132.4. Limonite minerals are strongly birefringent, but grain sizes are usually too small for this to be detectable.\nAlthough originally defined as a single mineral, limonite is now recognized as a field term for a mixture of related hydrated iron oxide minerals, among them goethite, lepidocrocite, akaganeite, and jarosite. Determination of the precise mineral composition is practical only with X-ray diffraction techniques. Individual minerals in limonite may form crystals, but limonite does not, although specimens may show a fibrous or microcrystalline structure, and limonite often occurs in concretionary forms or in compact and earthy masses; sometimes mammillary, botryoidal, reniform or stalactitic. Because of its amorphous nature, and occurrence in hydrated areas limonite often presents as a clay or mudstone. However, there are limonite pseudomorphs after other minerals such as pyrite. This means that chemical weathering transforms the crystals of pyrite into limonite by hydrating the molecules, but the external shape of the pyrite crystal remains. Limonite pseudomorphs have also been formed from other iron oxides, hematite and magnetite; from the carbonate siderite and from iron rich silicates such as almandine garnets.\nFormation.\nLimonite usually forms from the hydration of hematite and magnetite, from the oxidation and hydration of iron rich sulfide minerals, and chemical weathering of other iron rich minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. It is often the major iron component in lateritic soils, and limonite laterite ores are a source of nickel and potentially cobalt and other valuable metals, present as trace elements. It is often deposited in run-off streams from mining operations.\nUses.\nNickel-rich limonite ores represent the largest reserves of nickel. Such minerals are classified as lateritic nickel ore deposits.\nOne of the first uses was as a pigment. The yellow form produced yellow ochre for which Cyprus was famous, while the darker forms produced more earthy tones. Roasting the limonite changed it partially to hematite, producing red ochres, burnt umbers and siennas. Bog iron ore and limonite mudstones are mined as a source of iron. \n\"Iron caps\" or gossans of siliceous iron oxide typically form as the result of intensive oxidation of sulfide ore deposits. These gossans were used by prospectors as guides to buried ore. \nLimonite was mined for its ancillary gold content. The oxidation of sulfide deposits which contained gold, often resulted in the concentration of gold in the iron oxide and quartz of the gossans. The gold of the primary veins was concentrated into the limonites of the deeply weathered rocks. In another example the deeply weathered iron formations of Brazil served to concentrate gold with the limonite of the resulting soils.\nHistory.\nLimonite was one of the earliest materials used as a pigment by humans, and can be seen in Neolithic cave paintings and pictographs.\nWhile the first iron ore was likely meteoric iron, and hematite was far easier to smelt, in Africa, where the first evidence of iron metallurgy occurs, limonite is the most prevalent iron ore. Before smelting, as the ore was heated and the water driven off, more and more of the limonite was converted to hematite. The ore was then pounded as it was heated above 1250\u00a0\u00b0C, at which temperature the metallic iron begins sticking together and non-metallic impurities are thrown off as sparks. Complex systems developed, notably in Tanzania, to process limonite. Nonetheless, hematite and magnetite remained the ores of choice when smelting was by bloomeries, and it was only with the development of blast furnaces in the 1st century BCE in China and about 1150 CE in Europe, that the brown iron ore of limonite could be used to best advantage.\nBog iron ore and limonite were mined in the US, but this ended with the development of advanced mining techniques.\nGoldbearing limonite gossans were productively mined in the Shasta County, California mining district. Similar deposits were mined near Rio Tinto in Spain and Mount Morgan in Australia. In the Dahlonega gold belt in Lumpkin County, Georgia gold was mined from limonite-rich lateritic or saprolite soil. \nAs saprolite deposits have been exhausted in many mining sites, limonite has become the most prominent source of nickel for use in energy dense batteries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a daughter of Nereus and Doris (or Oceanus and Tethys). Under the influence of the Olympian pantheon, she became the consort of Poseidon and was later used as a symbolic representation of the sea. Her Roman counterpart is Salacia, a comparatively minor figure, and the goddess of saltwater.\nFamily.\nAccording to Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Amphitrite was one of the 50 Nereid daughters of Nereus and Doris. The mythographer Apollodorus, however, lists her among both the Nereids, as well as the Oceanids, the daughters of Oceanus and Tethys.\nAmphitrite's offspring included seals and dolphins. She also bred sea monsters and her great waves crashed against the rocks, putting sailors at risk. Poseidon and Amphitrite had a son, Triton, who was a merman, and a daughter, Rhodos (if this Rhodos was not actually fathered by Poseidon on Halia or was not the daughter of Asopus as others claim). According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Benthesikyme was the daughter of Poseidon and Amphitrite.\nMythology.\nWhen Poseidon desired to marry her, Amphitrite, wanting to protect her virginity, fled to the Atlas Mountains. Poseidon sent many creatures to find her. A dolphin came across Amphitrite and convinced her to marry Poseidon. As a reward for the dolphin's help, Poseidon created the Delphinus constellation.\nEustathius said that Poseidon first saw her dancing at Naxos among the other Nereids, and carried her off. But in another version of the myth, she fled from his advances to Atlas, at the farthest ends of the sea; there the dolphin of Poseidon sought her through the islands of the sea, and finding her, spoke persuasively on behalf of Poseidon, if we may believe Hyginus and was rewarded by being placed among the stars as the constellation Delphinus.\nAmphitrite is not fully personified in the Homeric epics: \"out on the open sea, in Amphitrite's breakers\" (\"Odyssey\" iii.101), \"moaning Amphitrite\" nourishes fishes \"in numbers past all counting\" (\"Odyssey\" xii.119). She shares her Homeric epithet \"Halosydne\" () with Thetis. In some sense, the sea-nymphs are doublets.\nPindar, in his sixth Olympian Ode, recognized Poseidon's role as \"great god of the sea, husband of Amphitrite, goddess of the golden spindle.\" For later poets, Amphitrite became simply a metaphor for the sea: Euripides, in \"Cyclops\" (702) and Ovid, \"Metamorphoses\", (i.14).\nRepresentation and cult.\nThough Amphitrite does not figure in Greek \"cultus\", at an archaic stage she was of outstanding importance, for in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, she appears at the birthing of Apollo among, in Hugh G. Evelyn-White's translation, \"all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rhea and Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite\"; more recent translators are unanimous in rendering \"Ichnaean Themis\" rather than treating \"Ichnae\" as a separate identity. Theseus in the submarine halls of his father Poseidon saw the daughters of Nereus dancing with liquid feet, and \"august, ox-eyed Amphitrite\", who wreathed him with her wedding wreath, according to a fragment of Bacchylides. Jane Ellen Harrison recognized in the poetic treatment an authentic echo of Amphitrite's early importance: \"It would have been much simpler for Poseidon to recognize his own son\u2026 the myth belongs to that early stratum of mythology when Poseidon was not yet god of the sea, or, at least, no-wise supreme there\u2014Amphitrite and the Nereids ruled there, with their servants the Tritons. Even so late as the \"Iliad\" Amphitrite is not yet 'Neptuni uxor' [Neptune's wife].\"\nAmphitrite, \"the third one who encircles [the sea]\", was so entirely confined in her authority to the sea and the creatures in it that she was almost never associated with her husband, either for purposes of worship or in works of art, except when he was to be distinctly regarded as the god who controlled the sea. An exception may be the cult image of Amphitrite that Pausanias saw in the temple of Poseidon at the Isthmus of Corinth (ii.1.7).\nIn the arts of vase-painting and mosaic, Amphitrite was distinguishable from the other Nereids only by her queenly attributes. In works of art, both ancient ones and post-Renaissance paintings, Amphitrite is represented either enthroned beside Poseidon or driving with him in a chariot drawn by sea-horses (\"hippocamps\") or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by Tritons and Nereids. She is dressed in queenly robes and has nets in her hair. The pincers of a crab are sometimes shown attached to her temples.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His mother was named either Astydameia, the daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia, or Laonome, daughter of Guneus, or else Hipponome, daughter of Menoeceus. Amphitryon was the brother of Anaxo (wife of Electryon), and Perimede, wife of Licymnius. He was a husband of Alcmene, Electryon's daughter, and stepfather of the Greek hero Heracles.\nMythology.\nBorn\u2014according to tradition\u2014in Tiryns,\nin Argolis in the eastern part of the Peloponnese, Amphitryon became King of Troezen\nand regent of Mycenae.\nHe was a friend of Panopeus.\nHaving accidentally killed his prospective father-in-law, Electryon, king of Mycenae, Amphitryon was driven out of Mycenae by Electryon's brother, Sthenelus. However, there is an earlier tradition that Amphitryon killed Electryon in a fit of anger over some cattle. He fled with Alcmene to Thebes, where he was cleansed from the guilt of blood by Creon, king of Thebes.\nAlcmene, who was pregnant and had been betrothed to Amphitryon by her father, refused to marry him until he had avenged the deaths of her brothers, all but one of whom had fallen in battle against the Taphians. (It was on his return from this expedition that Electryon had been killed.) Amphitryon accordingly took the field against the Taphians, accompanied by Creon, who had agreed to assist him on condition that he slew the Teumessian fox which had been sent by Dionysus to ravage the Theban countryside.\nThe Taphians, however, remained invincible until Comaetho, the king's daughter, out of love for Amphitryon, plucked out the single golden hair of her father, Pterelaos, the possession of which had rendered him immortal. Having defeated the enemy, Amphitryon put Comaetho to death and handed over the kingdom of the Taphians to Cephalus. On his return to Thebes he married Alcmene, who gave birth to twin sons, Iphicles and Heracles. Only Iphicles was the son of Amphitryon - in a case of heteropaternal superfecundation, Heracles was the son of Zeus, who had visited Alcmene during Amphitryon's absence. Zeus, disguised as Amphitryon, described the victory over the sons of Pterelaus in such convincing detail that Alcmene accepted him as her betrothed. Amphitryon and Alcmene also had a daughter named Laonome.\nAmphitryon fell in battle against the Minyans, against whom he had undertaken an expedition, accompanied by the youthful Heracles, to deliver Thebes from a disgraceful tribute. In the play \"Heracles\" by Euripides, Amphitryon survives to witness the murders of Heracles' children and wife.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are important characters in one of the two founding myths of the city of Thebes, because they constructed the city's walls. Zethus or Amphion had a daughter called Neis (\u039d\u03b7\u03af\u03c2), and the Neitian gate at Thebes was believed to have derived its name from her.\nMythology.\nChildhood.\nAmphion and Zethus were the sons of Antiope, who fled in shame to Sicyon after Zeus raped her, and married King Epopeus there. However, either Nycteus or Lycus attacked Sicyon in order to carry her back to Thebes and punish her. On the way back, she gave birth to the twins and was forced to expose them on Mount Cithaeron. Lycus gave her to his wife, Dirce, who treated her very cruelly for many years.\nAntiope eventually escaped and found her sons living near Mount Cithaeron. After they were convinced that she was their mother, they killed Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull, gathered an army, and conquered Thebes, becoming its joint rulers. They also either killed Lycus or forced him to give up his throne.\nRule of Thebes.\nAmphion became a great singer and musician after his lover Hermes taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. Zethus became a hunter and herdsman, with a great interest in cattle breeding. As Zethus was associated with agriculture and the hunt, his attribute was the hunting dog, while Amphion\u2019s - the lyre. Amphion and Zethus built the fortifications of Thebes. They built the walls around the Cadmea, the citadel of Thebes, at the command of Apollo. While Zethus struggled to carry his stones, Amphion played his lyre and his stones followed after him and gently glided into place.\nAmphion married Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, the Lydian king. Because of this, he learned to play his lyre in the Lydian mode and added three strings to it. Zethus married Thebe, after whom the city of Thebes was named. Otherwise, the kingdom was named in honour of their supposed father Theobus.\nLater misfortunes.\nAmphion's wife Niobe had many children, but had become arrogant and because of this she insulted the goddess Leto, who had only two children, Artemis and Apollo. Leto's children killed Niobe's children in retaliation (see Niobe). Niobe\u2019s overweening pride in her children, offending Apollo and Artemis, brought about her children\u2019s deaths. In Ovid, Amphion commits suicide out of grief; according to Telesilla, Artemis and Apollo murder him along with his children. Hyginus, however, writes that in his madness he tried to attack the temple of Apollo, and was killed by the god's arrows.\nZethus had only one son, who died through a mistake of his mother Thebe, causing Zethus to kill himself. In the \"Odyssey\", however, Zethus's wife is called A\u00ebdon, a daughter of Pandareus in book 19, who killed her son Itylus in a fit of madness and became a nightingale. Later authors would clarify that A\u00ebdon tried to kill Niobe and Amphion's firstborn Amaleus out of jealousy that Niobe had borne many children, while she and Zethus only had one (though in some versions they also have a daughter Neis). However in the dark of the night, A\u00ebdon by mistake killed Itylus, and in her mourning she was transformed into a nightingale by her father-in-law Zeus when Zethus began to chase her down in rage for murdering their son. Alternatively, A\u00ebdon was afraid that her husband (here, mistakenly perhaps, spelled Zetes) was having an affair with a nymph, and that Itylus was assisting his father in his infidelity, so she killed him.\nAfter the deaths of Amphion and Zethus, Laius returned to Thebes and became king.\nElements of the brothers' mythology are comparable to myths of the twins Castor and Polydeuces (the Dioscuri), and of Romulus and Remus as founders of Rome.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60786", "revid": "13668448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60786", "title": "Romulus and Remus", "text": "Twin brothers and central characters of Rome's foundation myth\nIn Roman mythology, Romulus and Remus (, ) are twin brothers whose story tells of the events that led to the founding of the city of Rome and the Roman Kingdom by Romulus, following his fratricide of Remus. The image of a she-wolf suckling the twins in their infancy has been a symbol of the city of Rome and the ancient Romans since at least the 3rd century BC. Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome in 753 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. Possible historical bases for the story, and interpretations of its local variants, are subjects of ongoing debate.\nOverview.\nRomulus and Remus were born in Alba Longa, one of the many ancient Latin cities near the seven hills of Rome. Their mother Rhea Silvia, also known as Ilia, was a Vestal Virgin and the daughter of former king Numitor, who had been displaced by his brother Amulius. In some sources, Rhea Silvia conceived them when the god Mars visited her in a sacred grove dedicated to him.\nSeeing them as a possible threat to his rule, King Amulius ordered them to be killed and they were abandoned on the bank of the river Tiber to die. They were saved by the god Tiberinus, Father of the River, and survived with the care of others at the site of future Rome. In the best-known episode, the twins were suckled by a she-wolf in a cave now known as the Lupercal. Eventually, they were adopted by Faustulus, a shepherd. They grew up tending flocks, unaware of their true identities. Over time, they became natural leaders and attracted a company of supporters from the community.\nWhen they were young adults, they became involved in a dispute between supporters of Numitor and Amulius. As a result, Remus was taken prisoner and brought to Alba Longa. Both his grandfather and the king suspected his true identity. Romulus, meanwhile, had organized an effort to free his brother and set out with help for the city. During this time, they learned of their past and joined forces with their grandfather to restore him to the throne. Amulius was killed and Numitor was reinstated as king of Alba. The twins set out to build a city of their own.\nAfter arriving back in the area of the seven hills, they disagreed about the hill upon which to build. Romulus preferred the Palatine Hill, above the Lupercal; Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. When they could not resolve the dispute, they agreed to seek the gods' approval through a contest of augury. Remus saw 6 auspicious birds, but Romulus saw 12 and claimed to have won divine approval. They disputed the result; Remus insulted Romulus' new city and was killed, either by Romulus or by one of his supporters. Romulus then went on to found the city of Rome, its institutions, government, military, and religious traditions. He reigned for many years as its first king.\nPrimary sources.\nThe origins of the different elements in Rome's foundation myth are a subject of ongoing debate. They may have come from the Romans' own Italic origins, or from Hellenic influences that were included later. Definitively identifying those original elements has so far eluded classicists. Roman historians dated the founding of Rome around 753 BC, but the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. There is an ongoing debate about how and when the \"complete\" fable came together.\nSome elements are attested earlier than others, and the storyline and the tone were variously influenced by the circumstances and tastes of the different sources as well as by contemporary Roman politics and concepts of propriety. Whether the twins' myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development is the subject of an ongoing debate. Sources often contradict one another. They include the histories of Livy, Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Tacitus as well as the work of Virgil and Ovid.\nQuintus Fabius Pictor's work became authoritative to the early books of Livy's \"History of Rome\", Dionysius of Halicarnassus's \"Roman Antiquities\", and Plutarch's \"Life of Romulus\".\nThese three works have been among the most widely read versions of the myth. In all three works, the tales of the lupercal and the fratricide are overshadowed by that of the twins' lineage and connections to Aeneas and the deposing of Amulius. The latter receives the most attention in the accounts. Plutarch dedicates nearly half of his account to the overthrow of their uncle.\n\"Roman Antiquities\" (Dionysius).\nDionysius cites, among others, the histories of Pictor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Cato the Elder, Lucius Cincius Alimentus.\nThe first book of Dionysius' twenty-volume history of Rome does not mention Remus until chapter 71. After spending another 8 chapters discussing the background of their birth in Alba, he dedicates a total of 9 chapters to the tale (79\u201387). Most of that is spent discussing the conflict with Amulius.\nHe goes on to discuss the various accounts of the city's founding by others, and the lineage and parentage of the twins for another 8 chapters until arriving at the tale of their abandonment by the Tiber River. He spends the better part of the chapter 79 discussing the survival in the wild. Then the end of chapters 79 through 84 focuses on the account of their struggle with Amulius. Chapter 84 is an alternate, non-fantastical account of their survival; the augury and fratricide are discussed in chapters 85 to 88.\n\"Ab Urbe Condita\" (Livy).\nLivy discusses the myth in chapters 4, 5, and 6 of his work's first book. p.\u00a07 parentage 4 p.\u00a08 survival. p.\u00a08 the youth. 5 9\u201310 the struggle with Amulius. 6 p.\u00a011 (the beginning only) the augury and fratricide.\nLife of Romulus (Plutarch).\nPlutarch relates the legend in chapters 2\u201310 of \"the Life of Romulus\". He dedicates the most attention, nearly half the entire account, to conflict with Amulius.\n\"Fasti\" (Ovid).\n\"Fasti\", the epic Latin poem by Ovid from the early 1st century AD, contains a complete account of the twins' tale. Notably, it relates a tale wherein the ghost of Remus appears to Faustulus and his wife, whom the poet calls \"Acca\". In the story, Remus appears to them while in bed and expresses his anger at Celer for killing him and his own, as well as Romulus' unquestioned fraternal love.\n\"Roman History\" (Dio).\n\"Roman History\" by Cassius Dio survives in fragments from various commentaries. They contain a more-or-less complete account. In them, he mentions an oracle that had predicted Amulius' death by a son of Numitor as the reason the Alban king expelled the boys. There is also a mention of \"another Romulus and Remus\" and another Rome having been founded long before on the same site.\n\"Origo Gentis Romanae\" (unknown).\nThis work contains a variety of versions of the story. In one, there is a reference to a woodpecker bringing the boys food during the time they were abandoned in the wild. In one account of the conflict with Amulius, the capture of Remus is not mentioned. Instead, Romulus, upon being told of his true identity and the crimes suffered by him and his family at the hands of the Alban king, simply decided to avenge them. He took his supporters directly to the city and killed Amulius, afterwards restoring his grandfather to the throne.\nModern scholarship.\nModern scholarship approaches the various known stories of Romulus and Remus as cumulative elaborations and later interpretations of Roman origin myth. Particular versions and collations were presented by Roman historians as an authoritative, official history trimmed of contradictions and untidy variants, to justify contemporary developments, genealogies and actions in relation to Roman morality. Other narratives appear to represent popular or folkloric tradition; some of these remain inscrutable in purpose and meaning. Wiseman sums the whole as the mythography of an unusually problematic foundation and early history.\nThe three canonical accounts of Livy, Dionysius, and Plutarch provide the broad literary basis for studies of Rome's founding mythography. They have much in common, but each is selective to its purpose. Livy's is a dignified handbook, justifying the purpose and morality of Roman traditions of his own day. Dionysius and Plutarch approach the same subjects as interested outsiders, and include founder-traditions not mentioned by Livy, untraceable to a common source and probably specific to particular regions, social classes or oral traditions. A Roman text of the late Imperial era, \"Origo gentis Romanae\" (The origin of the Roman people), is dedicated to the many \"more or less bizarre\", often contradictory variants of Rome's foundation myth, including versions in which Remus founds a city named Remuria, five miles from Rome, and outlives his brother Romulus.\nRoman historians and Roman traditions traced most Roman institutions to Romulus. He was credited with founding Rome's armies, its system of rights and laws, its state religion and government, and the system of patronage that underpinned all social, political and military activity. In reality, such developments would have been spread over a considerable span of time. Some were much older and others much more recent. To most Romans, the evidence for the veracity of the legend and its central characters seemed clear and concrete, an essential part of Rome's sacred topography. One could visit the Lupercal, where the twins were suckled by the she-wolf, or offer worship to the deified Romulus-Quirinus at the \"shepherd's hut\", or see it acted out on stage, or simply read the \"Fasti\".\nThe legend as a whole encapsulates Rome's ideas of itself, its origins and moral values. For modern scholarship, it remains one of the most complex and problematic of all foundation myths, particularly in the manner of Remus's death. Ancient historians had no doubt that Romulus gave his name to the city. Most modern historians believe his name a back-formation from the name Rome; the basis for Remus's name and role remain subjects of ancient and modern speculation. The myth was fully developed into something like an \"official\", chronological version in the Late Republican and early Imperial era; Roman historians dated the city's foundation to between 758 and 728 BC, and Plutarch reckoned the twins' birth year as 771 BC. A tradition that gave Romulus a distant ancestor in the semi-divine Trojan prince Aeneas was further embellished, and Romulus was made the direct ancestor of Rome's first Imperial dynasty. Possible historical bases for the broad mythological narrative remain unclear and disputed. The image of the she-wolf suckling the divinely fathered twins became an iconic representation of the city and its founding legend, making Romulus and Remus pre-eminent among the feral children of ancient mythography.\nHistoricity.\nCurrent scholarship offers little evidence to support any particular version of the Roman foundation myth, including a historical Romulus or Remus. Starting with Fabius Pictor, the written accounts must have reflected the commonly held history of the city to some degree. The archaeologist Andrea Carandini is one of very few modern scholars who accept Romulus and Remus as historical figures, and dates an ancient wall on the north slope of the Palatine Hill to the mid-8th century BC and names it the \"Murus Romuli\".\nIconography.\nAncient pictures of the Roman twins usually follow certain symbolic traditions, depending on the legend they follow: they either show a shepherd, the she-wolf, the twins under a fig tree, and one or two birds (Livy, Plutarch); or they depict two shepherds, the she-wolf, the twins in a cave, seldom a fig tree, and never any birds (Dionysius of Halicarnassus).\nThe twins and the she-wolf were featured on what might be the earliest silver coins minted in Rome.\nThe Franks Casket, an Anglo-Saxon ivory box (early 7th century AD), shows Romulus and Remus in an unusual setting, two wolves instead of one, a grove instead of one tree or a cave, four kneeling warriors instead of one or two gesticulating shepherds. According to one interpretation, and as the runic inscription (\"far from home\") indicates, the twins are cited here as the \"Dioscuri\", helpers at voyages such as Castor and Polydeuces. Their descent from the Roman god of war predestines them as helpers on the way to war. The carver transferred them into the Germanic holy grove and has Odin's second wolf join them. Thus the picture served\u2014along with five other ones\u2014to influence \"wyrd\", the fortune and fate of a warrior king.\nDepictions in art.\nThe myth has been an inspiration to artists throughout the ages. Particular focus has been paid to the rape of Ilia by Mars and the suckling of the twins by the she-wolf.\nPalazzo Magnani.\nIn the late 16th century, the wealthy Magnani family from Bologna commissioned a series of artworks based on the Roman foundation myth. The artists contributing works included a sculpture of Hercules with the infant twins by Gabriele Fiorini, featuring the patron's own face. The most important works were an elaborate series of frescoes collectively known as \"Histories of the Foundation of Rome\" by the Brothers Carracci: Ludovico, Annibale, and Agostino Carracci.\nFresco of Palazzo Trinci.\nThe \"Loggia di Romolo e Remo\" is an unfinished, 15th-century fresco by Gentile da Fabriano depicting episodes from the legend in the Palazzo Trinci.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60790", "revid": "50306187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60790", "title": "Castor and Pollux", "text": "Greek mythical twins\nCastor and Pollux (or Polydeuces) are twin half-brothers in Greek and Roman mythology, known together as the Dioscuri or Dioskouroi.\nTheir mother was Leda, but they had different fathers; Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, while Pollux was the divine son of Zeus, who seduced Leda in the guise of a swan. The pair are thus an example of heteropaternal superfecundation. Though accounts of their birth are varied, they are sometimes said to have been born from an egg, along with their twin sisters Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra.\nIn Latin, the twins are also known as the Gemini (\"twins\") or Castores, as well as the Tyndaridae or Tyndarids. Pollux asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with his twin to keep them together, and they were transformed into the constellation Gemini. The pair were regarded as the patrons of sailors, to whom they appeared as St. Elmo's fire. They were also associated with horsemanship, in keeping with their origin as the Indo-European horse twins.\nBirth.\nThere is much contradictory information regarding the parentage of the Dioscuri. In the Homeric \"Odyssey\" (11.298\u2013304), they are the sons of Tyndareus alone, but they were sons of Zeus in the Hesiodic \"Catalogue\" (fr. 24 M\u2013W). The conventional account (attested first in Pindar, Nemean 10) combined these paternities so that only Pollux was fathered by Zeus, while Leda and her husband Tyndareus conceived Castor. This explains why they were granted an alternate immortality. The figure of Tyndareus may have entered their tradition to explain their archaic name \"Tindaridai\" in Spartan inscriptions, or \"Tyndaridai\" in literature, in turn occasioning incompatible accounts of their parentage. Their other sisters were Timandra, Phoebe, and Philonoe.\nCastor and Pollux are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Pollux. In Homer's\" Iliad\", Helen looks down from the walls of Troy and wonders why she does not see her brothers among the Achaeans. The narrator remarks that they are both already dead and buried back in their homeland of Lacedaemon, thus suggesting that at least in some early traditions, both were mortal. Their death and shared immortality offered by Zeus was material of the lost \"Cypria\" in the Epic cycle.\nThe Dioscuri were regarded as helpers of mankind and held to be patrons of travellers and of sailors in particular, who invoked them to seek favourable winds. Their role as horsemen and boxers also led to them being regarded as the patrons of athletes and athletic contests. They characteristically intervened at the moment of crisis, aiding those who honoured or trusted them.\nClassical sources.\nAncient Greek authors tell a number of versions of the story of Castor and Pollux. Homer portrays them initially as ordinary mortals, treating them as dead in the \"Iliad\":\n \"...\u00a0there are two commanders I do not see,\n Castor the horse breaker and the boxer\n Polydeuces, my brothers\u00a0...\"\n \u2013 Helen, \"Iliad\"\nbut in the \"Odyssey\" they are described as both being alive, even though \"the grain-bearing earth holds them\". The author describes them as \"having honour equal to gods\", living on alternate days because of the intervention of Zeus. In both the \"Odyssey\" and in Hesiod, they are described as the sons of Tyndareus and Leda. In Pindar, Pollux is the son of Zeus, while Castor is the son of the mortal Tyndareus. The theme of ambiguous parentage is not unique to Castor and Pollux; similar characterisations appear in the stories of Herakles and Theseus. The Dioscuri are also invoked in Alcaeus' fragment\u00a034a, though whether this poem antedates the Homeric Hymn to the twins is unknown. They appear together in two plays by Euripides, \"Helen\" and \"Elektra\".\nCicero tells the story of how Simonides of Ceos was rebuked by Scopas, his patron, for devoting too much space to praising Castor and Pollux in an ode celebrating Scopas' victory in a chariot race. Shortly afterwards, Simonides was told that two young men wished to speak to him; after he had left the banqueting room, the roof fell in and crushed Scopas and his guests.\nAccording to the ancient sources the horse of Castor was named \"Cyllarus\".\nMythology.\nBoth Dioscuri were excellent horsemen and hunters who participated in the hunting of the Calydonian Boar and later joined the crew of Jason's ship, the \"Argo\".\nAs Argonauts.\nDuring the expedition of the Argonauts, Pollux took part in a boxing contest and defeated King Amycus of the Bebryces, a savage mythical people in Bithynia. After returning from the voyage, the Dioscuri helped Jason and Peleus to destroy the city of Iolcus in revenge for the treachery of its king Pelias.\nRescuing Helen.\nWhen their sister Helen was abducted by Theseus, the half-brothers invaded his kingdom of Attica to rescue her. In revenge they abducted Theseus's mother Aethra and took her to Sparta while setting his rival, Menestheus, on the throne of Athens. Aethra was then forced to become Helen's slave. She was ultimately returned to her home by her grandsons Demophon and Acamas after the fall of Troy.\nLeucippides, Lynceus, and death.\nCastor and Pollux aspired to marry the Leucippides (\"daughters of the white horse\"), Phoebe and Hilaeira, whose father was Leucippus (\"white horse\"). Both women were already betrothed to cousins of the Dioscuri, the twin brothers Lynceus and Idas of Messenia, sons of Tyndareus's brother Aphareus. Castor and Pollux carried the women off to Sparta wherein each had a son; Phoebe bore Mnesileos to Pollux and Hilaeira bore Anogon to Castor. This began a family feud among the four sons of the brothers Tyndareus and Aphareus.\nThe cousins carried out a cattle-raid in Arcadia together but fell out over the division of the meat. After stealing the herd, but before dividing it, the cousins butchered, quartered, and roasted a calf. As they prepared to eat, the gigantic Idas suggested that the herd be divided into two parts instead of four, based on which pair of cousins finished their meal first. Castor and Pollux agreed. Idas quickly ate both his portion and Lynceus' portion. Castor and Pollux had been duped. They allowed their cousins to take the entire herd, but vowed someday to take revenge.\nSome time later, Idas and Lynceus visited their uncle's home in Sparta. The uncle was on his way to Crete, so he left Helen in charge of entertaining the guests, which included both sets of cousins, as well as Paris, prince of Troy. Castor and Pollux recognized the opportunity to exact revenge, made an excuse that justified leaving the feast, and set out to steal their cousins' herd. Idas and Lynceus eventually set out for home, leaving Helen alone with Paris, who then kidnapped her. Thus, the four cousins helped set into motion the events that gave rise to the Trojan War.\nMeanwhile, Castor and Pollux had reached their destination. Castor climbed a tree to keep a watch as Pollux began to free the cattle. Far away, Idas and Lynceus approached. Lynceus, named for the lynx because he could see in the dark, spied Castor hiding in the tree. Idas and Lynceus immediately understood what was happening. Idas, furious, ambushed Castor, fatally wounding him with a blow from his spear \u2013 but not before Castor called out to warn Pollux. In the ensuing brawl, Pollux killed Lynceus. As Idas was about to kill Pollux, Zeus, who had been watching from Mount Olympus, hurled a thunderbolt, killing Idas and saving his son.\nReturning to the dying Castor, Pollux was given the choice by Zeus of spending all his time on Mount Olympus or giving half his immortality to his mortal brother. He opted for the latter, enabling the twins to alternate between Olympus and Hades. The brothers became the two brightest stars in the constellation Gemini (\"the twins\"): Castor (Alpha Geminorum) and Pollux (Beta Geminorum). As emblems of immortality and death, the Dioscuri, like Heracles, were said to have been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. In some myths, Poseidon rewarded them with horses to ride and power to aid shipwrecked men.\nIconography.\nCastor and Pollux are consistently associated with horses in art and literature. They are widely depicted as helmeted horsemen carrying spears. The Pseudo-Oppian manuscript depicts the brothers hunting, both on horseback and on foot.\nOn votive reliefs they are depicted with a variety of symbols representing the concept of twinhood, such as the \"dokana\" (\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 \u2013 two upright pieces of wood connected by two cross-beams), a pair of amphorae, a pair of shields, or a pair of snakes. They are also often shown wearing felt caps, sometimes with stars above. They are depicted on metopes (an element of a Doric frieze) from Delphi showing them on the voyage of the \"Argo\" (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03ce) and rustling cattle with Idas. Greek vases regularly show them capturing Phoebe and Hilaeira, as Argonauts, as well as in religious ceremonies and at the delivery to Leda of the egg containing Helen. They can be recognized in some vase-paintings by the skull-cap they wear, the \"pilos\" (\u03c0\u1fd6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), which was already explained in antiquity as the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.\nThey were described by Dares Phrygius as \"blond haired, large eyed, fair complexioned, and well-built with trim bodies\".\nDokana.\nDokana were ancient symbolical representation of the Dioscuri. It consisted of two upright beams with others laid across them transversely. The Dioscuri were worshipped as gods of war, and their images accompanied the Spartan kings whenever they took the field against an enemy. But when in the year 504 B.C. the two kings, during their invasion of Attica, failed in their undertaking on account of their secret enmity towards each other, it was decreed at Sparta, that in future only one king should command the army, and in consequence should only be accompanied by one of the images of the Dioscuri. It is not improbable that these images, accompanying the kings into the field, were the ancient \u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1, which were now disjointed, so that one-half of the symbol remained at Sparta, while the other was taken into the field by one of the kings.\nThe name \u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 seems that it comes from \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 which meant beam, but Suda and the Etymologicum Magnum state that \u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 was the name of the graves of the Dioscuri at Sparta, and derived from the verb \u03b4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9.\nShrines and rites.\nThe Dioskouroi were worshipped by the Greeks and Romans alike; there were temples to the twins in Athens, such as the Anakeion, and Rome, as well as shrines in many other locations in the ancient world.\nThe Dioskouroi and their sisters grew up in Sparta, in the royal household of Tyndareus; they were particularly important to the Spartans, who associated them with the Spartan tradition of dual kingship and appreciated that two princes of their ruling house were elevated to immortality. Their connection there was very ancient: a uniquely Spartan aniconic representation of the Tyndaridai was as two upright posts joined by a cross-bar; as the protectors of the Spartan army the \"beam figure\" or \"d\u00f3kana\" was carried in front of the army on campaign. Sparta's unique dual kingship reflects the divine influence of the Dioscuri. When the Spartan army marched to war, one king remained behind at home, accompanied by one of the Twins. \"In this way the real political order is secured in the realm of the Gods\".\nTheir \"her\u014don\" or grave-shrine was on a mountain top at Therapne across the Eurotas from Sparta, at a shrine known as the \"Menel\u00e1eion\" where Helen, Menelaus, Castor and Pollux were all said to be buried. Castor himself was also venerated in the region of Kastoria in northern Greece.\nThey were commemorated both as gods on Olympus worthy of holocaust, and as deceased mortals in Hades, whose spirits had to be propitiated by libations. Lesser shrines to Castor, Pollux and Helen were also established at a number of other locations around Sparta. The pear tree was regarded by the Spartans as sacred to Castor and Pollux, and images of the twins were hung in its branches. The standard Spartan oath was to swear \"by the two gods\" (in Doric Greek: \u03bd\u03ac \u03c4\u03ce \u03b8\u03b5\u1f7c, \"n\u00e1 t\u014d the\u014d\", in the Dual number).\nThe rite of \"theoxenia\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1), \"god-entertaining\", was particularly associated with Castor and Pollux. The two deities were summoned to a table laid with food, whether at individuals' own homes or in the public hearths or equivalent places controlled by states. They are sometimes shown arriving at a gallop over a food-laden table. Although such \"table offerings\" were a fairly common feature of Greek cult rituals, they were normally made in the shrines of the gods or heroes concerned. The domestic setting of the \"theoxenia\" was a characteristic distinction accorded to the Dioskouroi.\nThe image of the twins attending a goddess are widespread and link the Dioskouroi with the male societies of initiates under the aegis of the Anatolian Great Goddess and the great gods of Samothrace. During the Archaic period, the Dioscuri were venerated in Naukratis. The Dioscuri are the inventors of war dances, which characterize the Kuretes.\nAnakeia (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) or Anakeion (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) was a festival held at Athens in honor of the Dioscuri who also had the name Anakes (\u1f0c\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2).\nPausanias writes that the people of Amphissa celebrated mystery rites in honor of the so-called Anaktes Boys (Boy Kings). However, there was no agreement on their identity, some believed they were the Dioscuri, others thought they were the Curetes, and some identified them as the Cabeiri.\nCity of Dioscurias.\nThe ancient city of Dioscurias or Dioskurias (\u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) on the Black Sea coast, modern Sokhumi, was named after them. In addition, according to legend the city was founded by them. According to another legend, the city was founded by their charioteers, Amphitus and Cercius of Sparta.\nIsland of Dioscuri.\nThe island of Socotra, located between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea, was called by the Greeks \"Dioskouridou\" (\u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"the island of the Dioscuri\".\nAhenobarbus/Aenobarbus.\nThe name Ahenobarbus/Aenobarbus (\u1f08\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2) comes from a plebeian family of the Domitia gens, known for their distinctive red hair which many of this family had. The origin of the name, meaning \"Brazen-bearded,\" is explained through a myth that ties the family to the Dioscuri. According to the legend, one of the family's ancestors was informed by the Dioscuri of the Roman victory over the Latin League at the Battle of Lake Regillus. To prove the truth of their message, the Dioscuri allegedly stroked his black hair and beard, which then turned red.\nIndo-European analogues.\nThe heavenly twins appear in Indo-European tradition as the effulgent Vedic brother-horsemen called the Ashvins, Lithuanian A\u0161vieniai, and possibly Germanic Alcis.\nEtruscan Kastur and Pultuce.\nThe Etruscans venerated the twins as \"Kastur\" and \"Pultuce\", collectively as the \"tinas cliniiaras\", \"Sons of Tinia\", Etruscan counterpart of Zeus. They were often portrayed on Etruscan mirrors. As was the fashion in Greece, they could also be portrayed symbolically; one example is seen in the Tomb of the Funereal Bed at Tarquinia where a \"lectisternium\" is painted for them. Another is symbolised in a painting depicted as two pointed caps crowned with laurel, referring to the Phrygian caps.\nItaly and the Roman Empire.\nFrom the 5th century BCE onwards, the brothers were revered by the Romans, probably as the result of cultural transmission via the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. An archaic Latin inscription of the 6th or 5th century BCE found at Lavinium, which reads \"Castorei Podlouqueique qurois\" (\"To Castor and Pollux, the Dioskouroi\"), suggests a direct transmission from the Greeks; the word \"qurois\" is virtually a transliteration of the Greek word \"\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2\", while \"Podlouquei\" is effectively a transliteration of the Greek \"\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2\".\nThe construction of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, located in the Roman Forum at the heart of their city, was undertaken to fulfill a vow \"(votum)\" made by Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis in gratitude at the Roman victory in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 495 BCE. The establishment of a temple may also be a form of \"evocatio\", the transferral of a tutelary deity from a defeated town to Rome, where cult would be offered in exchange for favor. According to legend, the twins fought at the head of the Roman army and subsequently brought news of the victory back to Rome. The Locrians of Magna Graecia had attributed their success at a legendary battle on the banks of the Sagras to the intervention of the Twins. The Roman legend could have had its origins in the Locrian account and possibly supplies further evidence of cultural transmission between Rome and Magna Graecia.\nThe Romans believed that the twins aided them on the battlefield. Their role as horsemen made them particularly attractive to the Roman \"equites\" and cavalry. Each year on July 15, Feast Day of the Dioskouroi, 1,800 equestrians would parade through the streets of Rome in an elaborate spectacle in which each rider wore full military attire and whatever decorations he had earned.\nCastor and Pollux are also represented in the Circus Maximus by the use of eggs as lap counters.\nIn translations of comedies by Plautus, women generally swear by Castor, and men by Pollux; this is exemplified by the slave-woman character Staphyla in \"A Pot of Gold\" (act i, ll. 67\u201371) where she swears by Castor in line 67, then the negative prefix in line 71 denotes a refutation against swearing by Pollux.\nPhotius wrote that Polydeuces was a lover of Hermes, and the god made him a gift of Dotor (), the Thessalian horse.\nChristianization.\nEven after the rise of Christianity, the Dioskouroi continued to be venerated. The 5th century pope Gelasius I attested to the presence of a \"cult of Castores\" that the people did not want to abandon. In some instances, the twins appear to have simply been absorbed into a Christian framework; thus 4th century CE pottery and carvings from North Africa depict the Dioskouroi alongside the Twelve Apostles, the Raising of Lazarus or with Saint Peter. The church took an ambivalent attitude, rejecting the immortality of the Dioskouroi but seeking to replace them with equivalent Christian pairs. Saints Peter and Paul were thus adopted in place of the Dioskouroi as patrons of travelers, and Saints Cosmas and Damian took over their function as healers. Some have also associated Saints Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Melapsippus with the Dioskouroi.\nThe New Testament scholar Dennis MacDonald identifies Castor and Pollux as models for James son of Zebedee and his brother John in the Gospel of Mark. MacDonald cites the origin of this identification to 1913 when J. Rendel Harris published his work Boanerges, a Greek version probably of an Aramaic name meaning \"Sons of Thunder\", thunder being associated with Zeus, father of Pollux, in what MacDonald calls a form of early Christian Dioscurism.\nMore directly, the Acts of the Apostles mentions the Dioskouroi in a neutral context, as the figurehead of an Alexandrian ship boarded by Paul in Malta (Acts 28:11).\nGallery.\nThe iconography of Castor and Pollux influenced or has close parallels with depictions of divine male twins in cultures with Greco-Roman relations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60795", "revid": "50714500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60795", "title": "Council Bluffs, Iowa", "text": "American midwest city\nCouncil Bluffs is a city in and the county seat of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. Located on the east bank of the Missouri River, it sits across from Omaha, Nebraska. The city had a population of 62,799 at the 2020 census, making it the tenth-most populous city in Iowa and the largest in Southwest Iowa. Council Bluffs is also a principal city in the Omaha\u2013Council Bluffs metropolitan area.\nUntil about 1853, Council Bluffs was known as Kanesville. Kanesville was the historic starting point of the Mormon Trail. Kanesville is also the northernmost anchor town of the other emigrant trails because there was a steam-powered boat which ferried the settlers' wagons and cattle across the Missouri River. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad to California was connected to the existing U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs.\nHistory.\n1804\u20131843: Pottawattamie reservation and Caldwell's Camp.\nThe first Council Bluff (which is singular) was on the Nebraska side of the river at Fort Atkinson, about northwest of the city of Council Bluffs. It was named by Lewis and Clark for a bluff where they met the Otoe people on August 2, 1804.\nThe Iowa side of the river became an Indian Reservation in the 1830s for members of the Council of Three Fires of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi who were forced to leave the Chicago area under the Treaty of Chicago. This cleared the way for the city of Chicago to incorporate.\nThe largest group of Native Americans who moved to the area were the Pottawatomi, who were led by their chief Sauganash (\"one who speaks English\"), the son of British loyalist William Caldwell and a Pottawatomi woman. The senior Caldwell founded Canadian communities on the south side of the Detroit River.\nSeeking to avoid confrontation with the Sioux, who were natives of the Council Bluffs area, the 1,000 to 2,000 Pottawattami initially had settled east of the Missouri River in Indian territory between Leavenworth, Kansas and St. Joseph, Missouri. When the area was bought from Ioway, Sac and Fox tribes in the Platte Purchase and part of Missouri in 1837, Sauganash and the Pottawatomi were forced to move to their assigned reservation in Council Bluffs.\nSauganash's English name was Billy Caldwell, and his village was called Caldwell's Camp. The tribe were sometimes called the Bluff Indians. U.S. Army dragoons built a small fort nearby.\nIn 1838\u201339, the missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet founded St. Joseph's Mission to minister to the Potawatomi. De Smet was appalled by the violence and brutality caused by the whiskey trade and tried to protect the tribe from unscrupulous traders. However, he had little success in persuading tribal members to convert to Christianity and resorted to secret baptisms of Indian children.\nDuring this time, De Smet contributed to Joseph Nicollet's work in mapping the upper midwest. De Smet produced the first European-recorded, detailed map of the Council Bluffs area; it detailed the Missouri River valley system, from below the Platte River to the Big Sioux River.\nDe Smet wrote an early description of the Potawatomi settlement:\nImagine a great number of cabins and tents, made of the bark of trees, buffalo skins, coarse cloth, rushes and sods, all of a mournful and funereal aspect, of all sizes and shapes, some supported by one pole, others having six, and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable, and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion, and you will have an Indian village.\nAs more Native Americans were pushed into the Council Bluffs area by pressure of European-American settlement to the east, intertribal conflict increased, fueled by the illegal whiskey trade. The US Army built Fort Croghan in 1842, to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the Missouri River. However, the fort was destroyed in a flood later in the same year.\nBy 1846 the Pottawatomi were forced to move again to a new reservation at Osawatomie, Kansas.\n1844\u20131851: Mormon community of Kanesville.\nIn 1844, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party crossed the Missouri River here, on their way to blaze a new path into California across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Beginning in 1846, a large influx of Latter-day Saints entered the area, although in the winter of 1847\u20131848 most Latter-day Saints crossed to the Nebraska side of the Missouri River. Initially, the area was called \"Miller's Hollow\", after Henry W. Miller; a settler, he was the first member of the Iowa State Legislature to be from this area. Miller also was the foreman for the construction of the Kanesville Tabernacle.\nBy 1848, the town had become known as Kanesville, named for benefactor Thomas L. Kane. He had helped negotiate federal permission in Washington, D.C. for the Mormons to use Indian land along the Missouri as their winter encampment of 1846\u201347. Built next to or at Caldwell's Camp, Kanesville became the main outfitting point for the Mormon Exodus to Utah; it is the recognized head of the Mormon Trail.\nEdwin Carter, who would become a noted naturalist in Colorado, worked here from 1848 to 1859 in a dry goods store. He helped supply Mormon wagon trains.\nSettlers who departed west from Kanesville into the sparsely settled, unorganized parts of the Territory of Missouri traveled to the Oregon Country and the newly conquered California Territory. They traversed the (eventual) Nebraska Territory traveling in wagon trains along the much-storied Oregon, Mormon, or California Trails into the newly expanded United States western lands.\nAfter the first large organized wagon trains left Missouri in 1841, the annual migration waves began in earnest by the spring of 1843. They built up thereafter, with the opening of the Mormon Trail (1846) and peaked in the later 1860s. After that, news of the progress of railroads constructed across the west reduced the number of travelers who endured the wagon trains.\nBy the 1860s, virtually all migration wagon trains passed near the town now named Council Bluffs. The wagon train trails became less important with the advent of the first complete transcontinental railway in 1869, but while trail use diminished after that, their use continued on at lesser rates until late in the nineteenth century.\nThe Mormon Battalion began its march from Kanesville to California during the Mexican\u2013American War, which began This area was where Mormons first began to openly practice plural marriage. Orson Hyde began to publish \"The Frontier Guardian\" newspaper, and Brigham Young was named as the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). The community was transformed by the California Gold Rush, and the majority of Mormons left for Utah by 1852.\n1852\u20131900: Beginning of the railroad era.\nBy 1852, the number of Mormons was declining due to their further westward movement. The town took the name Council Bluffs after a cliff called Council Bluff that was 20 miles to the north. Fort Atkinson was built there in 1820. That cliff, or bluff, was named after the so-called Otoe council. This was an August 1804 meeting of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with senior members of the Otoe and Missouria Native American tribes.\nCouncil Bluffs continued as a major outfitting point on the Missouri River for the Emigrant Trail and Pike's Peak Gold Rush. A river port, it had a lively steamboat trade. In 1863 an anonymous soldier on his way to fight the Dakota Uprising passed through Council Bluffs. He described it as a hardscrabble town:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At Council Bluffs our arrival was greeted by a few rounds from the old six pounder, while the streets were lined with a curiosity-seeking class of humanity, among which could easily be traced the physiognomy of bipeds of almost every clime\u2014all here to make money. The cute Yankee whittling out wooden hams to sell to Pikes' Peak emigrants, the Chatham Street peddler, with his stock of \"oht clo's,\" ready to swear that he had them manufactured expressly for his western trade; the mock auctioneer, the jeweler with his pinchback jewelry of all kinds; horse and mule jockeys, gamblers, thieves, assassin\u2014and the mischief knows what not, rather than what is\u2014all congregated in this little 7\u00d79 city, stuck in a great ravine, 3 miles from the Missouri River. When you understand that this is the great entrepot for emigration across the Plains, you will readily comprehend that this is a good point at which to \"take (a) stranger in,\" and it is done almost every day. Our stay at Council Bluffs was very short (two days) and I think no one was sorry to leave it.\u2014\u200a\nCouncil Bluffs (rather than Omaha) was designated by President Abraham Lincoln as the official starting point of the transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869. The official \"Mile 0\" start is at 21st Street and 9th Avenue. It is now marked by a gold spike monument, which was erected to promote the movie \"Union Pacific.\" Council Bluffs' physical connection to the Transcontinental Railroad was delayed until 1872, when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge opened. (Before that, railroad cars had to be ferried across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs to Omaha in the early days of the Transcontinental).\nThe Chicago and North Western Transportation Company arrived in 1867. Other railroads operating in the city were the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, Chicago Great Western Railway, Wabash Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as well as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.\n1901\u2013present.\nIn 1926, the portion of Council Bluffs west of the Missouri River seceded to form Carter Lake, Iowa. Carter Lake had been cut off by a change in the course of the Missouri River.\nBy the 1930s, Council Bluffs had grown into the country's fifth largest rail center. The railroads helped the city become a center for grain storage, and in grain elevators continue to mark the city's skyline. Other industries in the city included Blue Star Foods, Dwarfies Cereal, Frito-Lay, Georgie Porgie Cereal, Giant Manufacturing, Kimball Elevators, Mona Motor Oil, Monarch, Reliance Batteries, Woodward's Candy, and World Radio. During the 1940s Meyer Lansky operated a greyhound racing track in Council Bluffs.\nRestructuring of the railroad industry caused the loss of many jobs after the mid-20th century, as did the restructuring of heavy industry. Many jobs moved offshore. By the late 20th century, the city and region were suffering economic stagnation and a declining population, as they struggled to develop a new economy. Downtown urban renewal was undertaken to create a new future while emphasizing the strengths of heritage.\nCouncil Bluffs was prominently featured on an episode of Bar Rescue, when Jon Taffer visited the O'Face Bar. This would also be the first ever instance of Taffer walking out on a bar in the series.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nCouncil Bluffs covers a unique topographic region originally composed of prairie and savanna in the Loess Hills with extensive wetlands and deciduous forest along the Missouri River. Excellent vistas can be had from KOIL Point at Fairmont Park, the Lincoln Monument, Kirn Park, and the Lewis and Clark Monument. Lake Manawa State Park is located at the southern edge of the city.\nNeighborhoods.\nDowntown Council Bluffs.\nDowntown Council Bluffs historically was the area along West Broadway and adjacent streets from Old Town west to the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company Railroad passenger depot at 11th Street. The downtown area developed as the economic rival of Old Town after the 1853 opening of the Pacific House Hotel by Samuel S. Bayliss and until the 1867 completion of the Chicago and Northwestern. In 1899, the Illinois Central passenger depot opened at 12th St. and West Broadway.\nDowntown declined as the city's primary retail center after the 1955 completion of the Broadway Viaduct, 1970s urban renewal, and the 1984 opening of the Kanesville Boulevard U.S. Route 6 bypass. Remaining buildings of note include the 1959 Council Bluffs Post Office and Federal Building at 6th Street, the 1986 \"Red\" Nelson Building, the 501 Main Building, the substantially altered 1909 City National Bank Building, and the 1968 First Federal Building. The 1947 State Savings Bank Building at 509 West Broadway and the seven-story 1924 Bennett Building at 405 West Broadway are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 100 Block of West Broadway is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the 1892 Broadway United Methodist Church at West Broadway and 1st St. remains a prominent community landmark.\nOld Town Council Bluffs.\nOld Town Council Bluffs was adjudged by Judge Frank Street in the 1850s to be the area between West Broadway and Glen Avenue and East Broadway and Frank Street from Harmony Street south to Pierce Street. Today the area encompasses Billy Caldwell's settlement of Potawatomi on Indian Creek during the 1830s and Kanesville established by the Mormons as Miller's Hollow in 1848. Kanesville was the home of Mormon leaders Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, and Ezra T. Benson and was a major outfitting point on the Mormon Trail during the California Gold Rush. The reconstructed Kanesville Tabernacle in the 300 block of East Broadway is operated as a museum by the LDS Church.\nThe West End.\nThe West End is a geographically large area on the flood plain east of the Missouri River and downtown Omaha, Nebraska, west of 10th St. and the Broadway Viaduct, and north of 9th Ave. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards. These neighborhoods of long, tree-shaded avenues are divided by the commercial corridor of West Broadway (U.S. Route 6), once part of the Lincoln Highway. This stretch of West Broadway has traditionally had several drive-in fast food restaurants and automobile dealerships with several grain elevators adjacent along 1st Avenue. West Broadway ends at the Interstate 480 bridge to downtown Omaha. Iowa Highway 192 follows North 16th St. from West Broadway to Interstate 29. Neighborhood landmarks include the 1890s Illinois Central Railroad Missouri River bridge, Stan Bahnsen Park, the Golden Spike Monument, the Narrows River Park, Big Lake Park, the site of Dodge Park Playland, the Dodge Christian Church (built with the N.P. Dodge Memorial funds and now known as Citylight West Council Bluffs), and many examples of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture. The West End was used as a location by film director Alexander Payne in the movies \"Citizen Ruth\" and \"About Schmidt\".\nCasino Row.\nCasino Row is located on and near the Missouri River south of West Broadway and Interstate 480, west of South 35th St. and Interstate 29, and north of Interstate 80 along 23rd Avenue west of South 24th St. The opening of the Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986, now the Horseshoe Council Bluffs, was followed in the mid-1990s by riverboat casinos operated by Ameristar and Harvey's Casino Hotel (now Harrah's Council Bluffs). New development in this previously industrial area has included the Mid-America Center, several restaurants and hotels, and other businesses. The appearance of legalized gambling in Council Bluffs became a major issue in neighboring Omaha where Mayor Hal Daub had declared Iowa an \"XXX state\" in 1995 as horse-racing came to an end at Ak-Sar-Ben.\nTwin City.\nTwin City is located south of where Interstate 29 splits from Interstate 80, east of South Omaha, Nebraska, west of Indian Creek, and north of the South Omaha Bridge Road (U.S. Route 275 and Iowa Highway 92). This neighborhood developed mostly during the 1960s for workers in nearby Omaha factories and at Offutt Air Force Base. The Interstate 80 Exit at 1-B at South 24th Street includes two large truck stops along with several motels, the Western Historic Trails Center, the Bluffs Acres manufactured home development, and The Marketplace shopping area. The Willows on the South Omaha Bridge Road is an example of mid-20th century roadside motel architecture and Bart's Motel further east at South 24th St featured prominent neon signage, was used as a location in the motion picture \"The Indian Runner\", and has since been demolished.\nManawa.\nManawa is the portion of Council Bluffs from the combined Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the city limits between Mosquito and Indian Creeks. The area was developed as a trolley park by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company after the former channel of the Missouri River was \"cut-off\" during an 1881 flood to become modern Lake Manawa State Park. Later development followed the establishment of U.S. Route 275 and the completion of Interstate 80 with additional growth during the 1990s. A variety of fast food restaurants, motels, big-box stores, automobile dealerships, a large truck stop and other businesses are located between Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the state park. The Lake Manawa Inn hosts early examples of roadside cabin architecture. In February and March, bald eagles and red-tailed hawks can frequently be seen at Lake Manawa, particularly along the southwest shore.\nThe South End.\nThe South End is bordered by 12th Avenue on the north, South 16th St. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards on the west, Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 on the south, and the South Expressway (Iowa Highway 192) on the east. This neighborhood developed during the late 19th century with the railroads, especially the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In the early 20th century much of the area was dubbed \"Dane Town\" or \"Little Copenhagen\" for the large number of Danish immigrants with several Croatian and Mexican families closer to the Union Pacific railyards at \"Little Vienna\". Neighborhood landmarks include Peterson Park, Longfellow School, and the 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific passenger depot, now the RailsWest Railroad Museum.\nOakland-Fairview.\nOakland-Fairview developed during the 1890s and features a wealth of 19th-century architecture, including the Judge Finley Burke mansion at 510 Oakland built in 1893 out of Minnesota granite. The neighborhood is also home to the Lincoln Monument. Located at the western end of Lafayette Avenue, the monument was erected in 1911 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution that, according to folklore, commemorates the spot where Abraham Lincoln decided on the location of the transcontinental railroad in 1859. The monument offers expansive views across the West End in the Missouri River Valley to Omaha, Nebraska. Nearby is the entrance to Fairview Cemetery, situated on the north side of Lafayette Avenue, which predates the establishment of the present city and includes the Kinsman Monument and the burial place of many early settlers, including Amelia Bloomer. At the east end of Lafayette Avenue where it intersects with North Second Street stands the Ruth Anne Dodge Memorial, the \"Black Angel\" designed by Daniel Chester French, although the wife of Grenville Dodge is actually buried elsewhere in Council Bluffs.\nMadison Avenue.\nMadison Avenue is the area of Council Bluffs adjacent to Exit 5 of Interstate 80 along Madison and Bennett avenues, Valley View Drive, and the area between Iowa Highway 92 north to McPherson Avenue. Mosquito Creek flows through this area which was originally notable for the Potawatomi gristmill and now includes the usual roadside gas stations, fast food restaurants, motels, and the tracks of the Iowa Interstate Railroad. Plans for a shopping mall here first appeared in 1972 and construction finally began on the Mall of the Bluffs in 1985. Residential growth east of the railroad tracks towards State Orchard Road and the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport and north to U.S. Route 6 has included developments outside the Council Bluffs city limits.\nHuntington Avenue.\nHuntington Avenue consists of early 20th century Craftsman homes which wind along the top of the Loess Hills past the 1925 studio of radio station KOIL; the station is now apartments.\nThe historic \"Council Bluffs' Red-light district\" was formed during the late 19th century, when at least 10 separate brothels were located on Pierce Street east of Park Avenue with another three brothels down the block on the south side of West Broadway east of Park. One 1890 newspaper article referenced in Lt. RL Miller's \"Selected History of the Council Bluffs Police\" noted the \"places of vice and corruption on Pierce\" and Stella Long's above the Ogden House along with the \"terrible den at the corner of Market and Vine\" and Belle Clover's bagnio at 8th St. and West Broadway.\nEnvironmental problems.\nIn 2010, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources found that air in central Council Bluffs measured above the national air quality standard for lead, most likely due to lead emissions in this area by Griffin Pipe Products Company. In 2011, EPA found numerous violations of the Clean Water Act, because the plant's contaminated stormwater commingled with treated process wastewater and was pumped out to the storm sewer, which discharged into the Missouri River.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCouncil Bluffs is the primary city of the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Area.\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 62,799 people, 25,271 households, and 15,302 families residing in the city.

By 2005, Council Bluffs was the 19th largest casino market in the United States, with revenue equaling nearly $434 million. Casinos include Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs, Harrah's Council Bluffs, and the Horseshoe Council Bluffs.\nCouncil Bluffs industry includes \"frozen foods, robotics, dairy products, plastics, railroading, electrical products, and pork and beef packaging\" per the city's website. American Games (a manufacturer of lottery gaming products), Barton Solvents, Con-Agra, Grundorf, Katelman Foundry, Omaha Standard Palfinger (a truck body manufacturer established in 1926), Red Giant Oil, and Tyson Foods have manufacturing plants in the city.\nGriffin Pipe Products, established in 1921, closed its plant employing about 250 people in March 2014, when it was bought by U.S. Pipe and Foundry, based in Birmingham, Alabama. Griffin Wheels, a part of American Steel Foundries, was one of the largest US manufacturers of iron railroad-car wheels until it switched to pipes in the 1960s.\nMid-American Energy built a new coal-fired plant in 2007; the billion dollar investment was the single largest private investment in Iowa's history up until then.\nIn 2007, Google began construction of a server farm on the former site of the Council Bluffs drive-in theater on Veterans Memorial Highway. This first phase, completed in 2009, was to create \"200 high quality jobs\". The second Google campus, on Bunge Avenue, had an open house in October 2013, employing 50 people who are \"installing and upgrading Google servers and providing maintenance on equipment\". In March 2014, a third phase, the Southlands expansion, was announced, creating 35 additional jobs and bringing Google's investment up to $1.5 billion, the largest private investment in Iowa's history to date. The state increased its tax abatement of sales and use tax for Google from $9.6 million to $16.8 million. As of July 2014[ [update]] Google stated it created 130 jobs and as of June 2016 \"over 300 jobs\" on site. In particular, the server farms are backing the entire \"us-central1\" region of the Google Cloud Platform.\nArts and culture.\nCouncil Bluffs is the location of the Pottawattamie County \"Squirrel Cage\" Jail, in use from 1885 until 1969, which is one of three remaining examples of a Rotary Jail. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was built as a rotary jail with pie-shaped cells on a turntable. To access individual cells, the jailer turned a crank to rotate the cylinder until the desired cell lined up with a fixed opening on each floor. According to the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County, the Squirrel Cage Jail is the only three-story rotary jail constructed. Although the rotary mechanism was disabled in 1960, the building remained the county jail for another 9 years. Similar, smaller examples of the concept can be seen in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Gallatin, Missouri.\nThe city's strong ties to the railroad industry are commemorated by three local museums. The Union Pacific Museum is located in the former Council Bluffs Free Public Library (a Carnegie library), at Pearl Street and Willow Avenue; the Grenville Dodge Home is on Third Street; and the RailsWest Railroad Museum is at South Main Street and Sixteenth Avenue. RailsWest is housed in an 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad passenger depot later shared with the Milwaukee Road, which was used by the \"Rocky Mountain Rocket\", the \"Arrow\", and the \"Midwest Hiawatha\". RailsWest features an outdoor display of historic train cars, including a Railway Post Office car, two steam locomotives, two cabooses, a Burlington Lounge car, and a 1953 switcher produced by the Plymouth Locomotive Works.\nThe Iowa West Foundation, the charitable wing of the local gambling industry, funded a public art planning process for Council Bluffs in 2004 which emphasized a 2015 goal for the city to become \"a prosperous urban area known for its cultural enlightenment and public art collection.\" To this end the city renovated Bayliss Park in downtown, which was re-dedicated in early 2007 with a new fountain dubbed Wellspring. Its performance pavilion, known as Oculus, was designed by sculptor Brower Hatcher. This was the first installation of the Iowa West Public Art, a foundation established during the Public Art Master Planning process. The Iowa West Foundation then established http:// along with a http://.\nIn 2008 a -tall Molecule Man sculpture by Jonathan Borofsky was installed at the Mid-America Center; nearby sculptures were designed by William King and Jun Kaneko. Albert Paley designed elements of the nearby South 24th Street bridge at Exit 1B of the combined Interstate 29 and Interstate 80 at Council Bluffs and Ed Carpenter designed Gateway for the West Broadway viaduct. Artist Dan Corson and the Big Mo by Mark di Suvero are featured at Tom Hanfan's River's Edge Park along the banks of the Missouri River.\nCouncil Bluffs is also home to the Chanticleer Community Theater, TVI Filtration Corporation (a major supplier of discount automotive products), and Hamilton College (Iowa) which is now part of Kaplan University \u2013 Council Bluffs.\nThe black squirrel is the city's mascot. John James Audubon wrote about these squirrels in 1843, along the Missouri River at Council Bluffs.\nFor one week in late July/early August, the annual Pottawattamie County Fair is held at Westfair grounds. There are carnival rides, concerts, gun shows, tractor races, and a queen contest.\nSports.\nThe Iowa Blackhawks (later known as the Council Bluffs Express) of the American Professional Football League played at the Mid-America Center from 2004 until 2012. The Mid-America Center was also home to the Omaha Lancers from 2002 until 2008. \nIowa Rampage Arena Football to kick-off in 2024 with relaunch of Arena Football League \nCouncil Bluffs hosted two minor league baseball teams. The Council Bluffs Rails played in 1935 and were preceded by the 1903 Council Bluffs Bluffers. The Bluffers played as members of the Class D level Iowa-South Dakota League in 1903 and the 1935 Rails were members of the Class A level Western League. The teams hosted minor league home games at Broadway Park in 1935 and the Lake Manawa Ballpark in 1903.\nEducation.\nPublic education in the city of Council Bluffs is provided by two school districts: Council Bluffs Community School District and Lewis Central Community School District. Most of the city is located within the Council Bluffs Community School District which operates these public schools: 10 elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools (Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson), Tucker Career &amp; College Center, Anne E. Nelson Early Learning Center, and Kanesville Alternative Learning Center. As of the 2008\u20132009 school year, the district had a total enrollment of 9,246. The Lewis Central Community School District (one high school, one middle school, and two elementary schools) serves the southern portion of Council Bluffs and enrolled 3,047 students as of the 2008\u20132009 school year.\nThere are several private schools in Council Bluffs including Community Christian School, http://, Liberty Christian School, Saint Albert Catholic Schools (of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines), and Trinity Lutheran Interparish School.\nThe Iowa School for the Deaf moved to the south edge of Council Bluffs in 1870 along what is now Iowa Highway 92. It is open to all students in both Iowa and Nebraska who are younger than 21 and whose hearing loss places them at a disadvantage in the public schools.\nIowa Western Community College is located on the eastern edge of Council Bluffs near the intersection of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 6 and is the home of the radio station KIWR. Buena Vista University also has a location in Council Bluffs and partners with Iowa Western Community College to offer bachelor's degree completion programs to IWCC graduates.\nTransportation.\nThe city is well served by Interstate 80, Interstate 29, U.S. Route 6, and the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway. The Union Pacific, BNSF, Iowa Interstate, and Canadian National Railroads all connect in Council Bluffs and carry important freight traffic. MidAmerican Energy has a large coal-burning power plant near the southern city limits.\nAn extensive system of off-street paved trails aids in walking and bicycling around the city, including the currently under construction FIRST AVE trail spanning the city's West End. Walking, bicycling, and other active transportation access across the Missouri River into Omaha currently exists at two points: the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge and a trail connection across the South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge on US-275.\nTransit access around Council Bluffs is available via two Metro bus lines, the blue and yellow routes. Each route originates in downtown Omaha and provides access across the Missouri River as well as between various points around Council Bluffs. According to city plans it is possible that a streetcar line may be constructed along the First Avenue right-of-way. The streetcar line would terminate near Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital in the east and in downtown Omaha in the west; it would have a connection to the planned Omaha Streetcar. In order to facilitate streetcar access across the Missouri River, plans call for a new multimodal bridge to be constructed just south of the existing I-480 bridge. The multimodal bridge would be built approximately where the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge once stood and carry multimodal traffic between Council Bluffs and Omaha.\nCommercial air travel for Council Bluffs occurs primarily out of Omaha's Eppley Airfield. The Council Bluffs Municipal Airport also serves the general aviation needs of Council Bluffs and surrounding areas.\nSister cities.\nCouncil Bluffs' sister cities are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 59,667 at the 2020 United States census. The city lies along the Mississippi River at the junction of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin, a region locally known as the Tri-State Area. It serves as the main commercial, industrial, educational, and cultural center for the area. Geographically, it is part of the Driftless Area, a portion of North America that escaped all three phases of the Wisconsin Glaciation, resulting in a hilly topography unlike most of the Midwestern United States.\nDubuque is a regional tourist destination featuring the city's unique architecture, casinos, and riverside location. It is home to five institutions of higher education. While Dubuque has historically been a center of manufacturing, the local economy also includes health care, publishing, and financial service sectors.\nHistory.\nSpain gained control of the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River following the 1763 defeat of the French; the British took over all territory to the east. The first permanent European settler in what is now Dubuque was Quebecois pioneer Julien Dubuque, who arrived in 1785. In 1788, he received permission from the Spanish government and the local Meskwaki people to mine the area's rich lead deposits. Control of Louisiana and Dubuque's mines shifted briefly back to France in 1800, then to the United States in 1803, following the Louisiana Purchase. The Meskwaki continued to mine with the full support of the U.S. government until 1830 when the Meskwaki were illegally pushed out of the mine region by American prospectors.\nThe current City of Dubuque was named after Julien Dubuque, who settled at the southern end of a large flat plain adjacent to the Mississippi River. The city was officially chartered in 1833, located in unorganized territory of the United States. The region was designated as the Iowa Territory in 1838 and was included in the newly created State of Iowa in 1846. After the lead resources were exhausted, the city became home to numerous industries. Dubuque became a center for the timber industry because of its proximity to forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and was later dominated by various mill working businesses. Also important were boat building, brewing, and later, the railroad industry. In 1874, the Diamond Jo Line moved its company headquarters to Dubuque. Diamond Jo Line established a shipyard at Eagle Point in 1878. Just two years later, the company was the largest employer in Dubuque, putting 78 people to work, 75 of whom worked at the shipyard earning their collective $800\u2013$1,000 per week in wages.\nBetween 1860 and 1880, Dubuque was one of the 100 largest urban areas in the United States. Iowa's first church was built by Methodists in 1833.\nBeginning in the mid-19th century and into the early 20th century, thousands of poor German, Luxembourgish and Irish Catholic immigrants came to the city to work in the manufacturing centers. The city's large Roman Catholic congregations led to its designation as the seat of the newly established Archdiocese of Dubuque. Numerous convents, abbeys, and other religious institutions were built. The ethnic German and Irish descendants maintain a strong Catholic presence in the city. Nicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892), a Catholic immigrant from Pfaffenthal in Luxembourg, founded the Catholic Publishing Company of Dubuque, Iowa. His son Nicholas E. Gonner Jr. (1870\u20131922) took over in 1892, editing two German-language weeklies, an English-language weekly, and the \"Daily Tribune,\" the only Catholic daily newspaper ever published in the United States.\nEarly in the 20th century, Dubuque was one of several sites of a brass era automobile company, Adams-Farwell; like most others, it folded. Subsequently, Dubuque grew significantly, and industrial activity remained its economic mainstay until the 1980s.\nA series of changes in manufacturing and the onset of the Farm Crisis in the 1980s led to a large decline in the sector and the city's economy as a whole. In the 1990s, the economy diversified rapidly, shifting away from heavy industry. Tourism, technology, and publishing are now among the largest and fastest-growing businesses. Dubuque attracts over 2 million tourists annually.\nAt the start of the 21st century, the city focused its efforts on revitalizing the Port of Dubuque, which now includes the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium, Grand Harbor Resort and Waterpark, Grand River Event Center, Diamond Jo Casino, the nearly-mile long Mississippi Riverwalk, and Stone Cliff Winery, which is housed in the former Dubuque Star Brewery building.\nAlso revitalized in recent years is Chaplain Schmitt Island, located near the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge. Q Casino, as of 2025, is undergoing an expansion, including the addition of arcade complex Island Social, as well as the building of an amphitheater and new hotel.\nIn the early-to-mid 2010s, a large portion of the Dubuque Millworking Historic District was renovated. It is now home to several restaurants, stores, offices and apartments, as well as a monthly summertime night market.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are covered by water. Lake Peosta Channel separates Chaplain Schmitt Island from the mainland.\nNeighborhoods.\nDowntown Dubuque is the city's central business district, housing many government and cultural institutions. It serves as the transportation and commercial hub, located along the Mississippi River in east-central Dubuque. Notable neighborhoods include Fenelon Place Residential Historic District, Jackson Park, Old Main Street and the Dubuque Millworking Historic District. The Port of Dubuque features the Grand Harbor Resort, Alliant Energy Amphitheater, and Grand River Center. Historic landmarks like the Shot Tower and the Dubuque County Courthouse reflect the city's regional importance.\nThe North End, settled by German immigrants in the late 19th century, remains a working-class area with factories and key sites including Bee Branch Creek, Eagle Point Park, Holy Ghost Catholic Church, Linwood Cemetery, Lock and Dam No. 11, Mathias Ham House and Sacred Heart Catholic Church. The South End, historically Irish American, features Irish pubs, churches, and neighborhoods with \"old money\" homes, including St. Pius X Seminary, St. Raphael's Cathedral, Mines of Spain State Recreation Area and the Wartburg Theological Seminary.\nThe West End, developed after World War II, is a suburban area that grew with the baby boom, featuring shopping centers like Plaza 20 and Kennedy Mall. It includes middle-class neighborhoods, parks, schools, and industrial areas, extending into the suburbs of Asbury and Peosta. Notable sites include the Dubuque Arboretum and Botanical Gardens and Emmaus University.\nClimate.\nDubuque has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\"), which gives it four distinct seasons. Spring is usually wet and rainy, summers are sunny and warm, autumn is mild, and winters are typically cloudy and snowy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, the population was 59,667.

Many important Catholic religious leaders have lived in Dubuque, including its first bishop Mathias Loras, Fr. Samuel Mazzuchelli, Clement Smyth, and Mother Mary Frances Clarke, BVM. Catholic parishes around the city include Saint Raphael's, Saint Mary's,\nSacred Heart, Holy Ghost, Saint Patrick's, Saint Joseph the Worker, Resurrection, Saint Columbkille's, and Saint Anthony's.\nIn 2010, Catholic adherents who regularly attended services made up about 53-percent of Dubuque County residents.

UNI offers more than 90 majors across five colleges. The fall 2025 total enrollment was 9,204 students.\nThe university was initially founded in 1876 as the Iowa State Normal School with the purpose of training school teachers and educators. The University of Northern Iowa is one of three public universities in Iowa, all of which are governed by the Iowa Board of Regents.\nHistory.\nThe University of Northern Iowa was founded as a result of two influential forces of the nineteenth century. First, Iowa wanted to care for orphans of its Civil War veterans, and secondly, Iowa needed a public teacher training institution. In 1876, when Iowa no longer needed an orphan home, legislators Edward G. Miller and H. C. Hemenway started the Iowa State Normal School.\nThe school's first building opened in 1867 and was known as Central Hall. The building contained classrooms, common areas, and a living facility for most of the students. It was also a home to the college's first principal, James Cleland Gilchrist. The building was the heart and soul of the school, allowing students to study courses of two-year, three-year, and four-year degrees. In 1965, a fire destroyed Central Hall, and school faculty and Cedar Falls citizens donated over $5,000 to start building Gilchrist Hall.\nThe school has been known under the following names:\nFrom 2014 through 2018 the UNI hosted the \"Midwest Summer Institute: Inclusion and Communication for All\", a two-day conference on facilitated communication sponsored by the Inclusion Connection and Syracuse University's Institute on Communication and Inclusion. Facilitated Communication is a discredited practice, and in 2018 UNI decided to discontinue the conference at the urging of multiple nationwide academics.\nPresidents.\nSince its founding, the university has had eleven presidents.\nAcademics.\nUniversity of Northern Iowa colleges include:\nStudy Abroad Center.\nUNI provides an opportunity for the students to study in 25+ countries and select from over 40 programs. It is also available to all students attending the university. The mission of the Study Abroad Center at the University of Northern Iowa is to provide service and leadership in international education to UNI students, faculty, staff, the community and the State of Iowa.\nCulture and Intensive English Program.\nThe Culture and Intensive English Program (CIEP) is an intensive program in English for non-native speakers. It is designed to prepare students for academic work at the undergraduate or graduate degree level. University of Northern Iowa students are also encouraged to participate in the Conversation Partner Program to help foreign students with their English ability and foster cross-cultural relationships while gaining mutual understanding.\nNorth American Review.\nThe university is the publisher of \"The North American Review\" (called the NAR), a celebrated literary magazine that began originally in Boston in 1815. Its past editors have included James Russell Lowell, Charles Eliot Norton, and Henry Adams; while among its past contributors are Mark Twain, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Walt Whitman, Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates, Guy Davenport and Margaret Atwood. In 1968, when the magazine was purchased by UNI, Robley Wilson was appointed editor, a position he continued in until his retirement in 2000. The current editors are Rachel Morgan, Jeremy Schraffenberger, Grant Tracey, and Brooke Wonders.\nTeaching and Research Greenhouse.\nThe University of Northern Iowa Teaching and Research Greenhouse is a greenhouse complex incorporating botanical gardens for research and education. It is located on the campus of the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\nThe greenhouse contains plants from many ecotypes, including 250 tropical plants, two live birds, an extensive collection of arid climate plants, and the Aquatic Learning Center.\nInternational collaboration.\nThe university is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.\nAthletics.\nThe school's mascot is the Panther, represented as a sibling pair of mascots known as TC (The Cat) and his sister TK. They participate in the NCAA's Division I, in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) for most sports, the Big 12 Conference for wrestling, and the Missouri Valley Football Conference \u2013 in Division I's Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) \u2013 for football. \nThe major arena on campus is the UNI-Dome, currently the home of the football team. The Dome also serves as a venue for many local concerts, high school football playoffs, trade shows, and other events. In 2006, the university opened a new arena, the McLeod Center, to serve as the home for several athletic programs that had previously played in the UNI-Dome, including the volleyball and men's and women's basketball teams.\nThe UNI athletics program has enjoyed recent success, with the men's basketball team competing in the NCAA tournament three consecutive times in 2004, 2005, 2006, again in 2009 and 2010 and in 2015 and 2016. On March 20, 2010, the men's basketball team defeated the heavily favored, top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks to advance to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. It was the school's first appearance in the Sweet Sixteen. The Jayhawks were favored to win the NCAA championship. Their Cinderella potential ended with a loss to Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen, 59\u201352. The win over Kansas earned them the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Upset.\nJacqui Kalin helped lead the women's basketball team to consecutive NCAA Tournament berths, as the team won back-to-back MVC Tournament titles. In 2010-11 she was named the Jackie Stiles MVC Player of the Year. In 2012-13 she led the league in scoring (19.5 ppg; a school record), had the fourth-highest season free throw percentage in NCAA Division 1 history-and the highest of any senior (95.5%), and was again named the Jackie Stiles MVC Player of the Year. For her career Kalin was first all-time at UNI in scoring (2,081), 3-point field goals made (265), free throws made (484), and free throw percentage (.920) the NCAA Division 1 career record.\nThe football team has been ranked in the I-AA (FCS) top 25 almost every year for the last two decades. The team appeared in the I-AA championship game in 2005, only to lose a close game to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. During 2007, the team was ranked #1 in the country by the TSN FCS poll for several weeks. The football team went undefeated in 2007 with an 11\u20130 record, a first for any school in the 23-year history of the Gateway conference. In 2001 and 2002 the volleyball team reached the NCAA Sweet 16 round, and in 2006 made it to the second round, and has competed in the tournament numerous times. The track team is also very successful (usually ranked in the top 25), as are the wrestling and volleyball teams.\nThe University of Northern Iowa wrestling team won the NCAA Division I national championship as ISTC in 1949 and NCAA Division II national championships in 1975 and 1978. They competed in the Western Wrestling Conference until 2012, when UNI became an associate member of the Mid-American Conference since the MVC is a non-wrestling conference. In 2017, UNI wrestling joined the Big 12 Conference. In 1977 the women's softball team won the AIAW national championship.\nBryce Paup won the Defensive Player of Year Award by the Associated Press in 1995. In 1999 and 2001, UNI alumnus Kurt Warner was named NFL MVP by the AP.\nDuring the 2014\u20132015 season, the men's basketball team ended the regular season ranked #11 by the AP Poll, the highest ranking in school history, and #9 by USA Today.\nStudent life.\nTransportation.\nUNI students may ride public transportation provided by the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Black Hawk County for $0.75 a ride with a student ID. Routes 6, 7, 9, and 10 connect campus to downtown Cedar Falls, downtown Waterloo and various other destinations.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The day is also marked by war remembrances in several other non-Commonwealth countries. In most countries, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November to recall the end of First World War hostilities. Hostilities ended \"at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month\" of 1918, in accordance with the armistice signed by representatives of Germany and the Entente between 5:12 and 5:20 that morning. (\"At the 11th hour\" refers to the \"passing\" of the 11th hour, or 11:00\u00a0am.) The First World War formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919.\nThe tradition of Remembrance Day evolved out of Armistice Day. The initial Armistice Day was observed at Buckingham Palace, commencing with King George V hosting a \"Banquet in Honour of the President of the French Republic\" during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day was subsequently held on the grounds of Buckingham Palace the following morning. During the Second World War, many countries changed the name of the holiday. Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations adopted Remembrance Day, while the US chose Veterans Day.\nObservance in the Commonwealth.\nThe common British, Canadian, South African, and ANZAC tradition includes a one or two-minute silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00\u00a0am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when the armistice became effective.\nThe Service of Remembrance in many Commonwealth countries generally includes the sounding of the \"Last Post\", followed by the period of silence, followed by the sounding of \"Reveille\" or sometimes just \"The Rouse\". The Service of Remembrance is finished by a recitation of the \"Ode of Remembrance\". The \"Flowers of the Forest\", \"O Valiant Hearts\", \"I Vow to Thee, My Country\" and \"Jerusalem\" are often played during the service. Services also include wreaths laid to honour the fallen, blessings, and national anthems.\nThe central ritual at cenotaphs throughout the Commonwealth is a stylised night vigil. \"The Last Post\" was the common bugle call at the close of the military day, and \"The Rouse\" was the first call of the morning. For military purposes, the traditional night vigil over the slain was not just to ensure they were indeed dead and not unconscious or in a coma, but also to guard them from being mutilated or despoiled by the enemy, or dragged off by scavengers. This makes the ritual more than just an act of remembrance but also a pledge to guard the honour of war dead. The act is enhanced by the use of dedicated cenotaphs (literally Greek for \"empty tomb\") and the laying of wreaths\u2014the traditional means of signalling high honours in ancient Greece and Rome.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle. Some institutions observe two-minutes' silence at 11\u00a0am through a program named Read 2 Remember, children read the \"Pledge of Remembrance\" by Rupert McCall, and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times. Services are held at 11\u00a0am at war memorials and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the \"Last Post\" is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed. When Remembrance Day falls on a normal working day in Melbourne and other major cities, buglers from the Australian Defence Force often play the \"Last Post\" at major street corners in the CBD. While this occurs, the majority of passers-by stop and observe a moment of silence while waiting for the bugler to finish the recital.\nHistory in Australia.\nIn interwar Australia, Remembrance Day (then often referred to as Armistice Day) was a popular public commemoration. But from 1946 to the 1970s, Australians observed Remembrance Sunday following the British pattern. It is only in the 1980s and 1990s that Remembrance Day was once again systematically observed on 11 November. The resurgence of Remembrance Day became official on 30 October 1997, when the Governor-General, under the Howard government, proclaimed that \"(a) 11 November in each year shall be known and observed as Remembrance Day; and (b) all Australians are urged to observe, unless impractical, a minute's silence at 11:00 on Remembrance Day each year\".\nIn recent decades, Remembrance Day has been largely eclipsed as the national day of war commemoration by ANZAC Day (25 April), which is a public holiday in all states. Attendance at Anzac Day services boomed, while that of Remembrance Day services continued to decline. Historian Romain Fathi explains, \"In Australia, ANZAC Day has addressed the question of the meaning of the war far better than Remembrance Day or Remembrance Sunday. It can acknowledge loss and suffering with a nod to the sacred, while simultaneously representing imagined distinct national values such as mateship, laconic humour and stoicism. This capacity to connect the national community to the numinous explains Anzac Day's primacy over Remembrance Day.\"\nBarbados.\nIn Barbados, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. It is recognised as 11 November, but the parade and ceremonial events are carried out on Remembrance Sunday.\nThe day is commemorated to recognise the Barbadian soldiers who died fighting in the First and Second World Wars. The parade is held at National Heroes' Square, where an interdenominational service is held. The Governor-General and Barbadian Prime Minister are among those who attend, along with other government dignitaries and the heads of the police and military forces. During the main ceremony a , wreaths, and prayers are also performed at the war memorial Cenotaph at the heart of Heroes' Square in Bridgetown.\nBelize.\nIn Belize, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November. It is not a public holiday.\nBermuda.\nIn the British Overseas Territory and former Imperial fortress of Bermuda, which sent the first colonial volunteer unit to the Western Front in 1915, and which had more people per capita in uniform during the Second World War than any other part of the Empire, Remembrance Day is still an important holiday. The parade in Hamilton had historically been a large and colourful one, as contingents from the Royal Navy, British Regular Army and Territorial Army units of the Bermuda Garrison, the Canadian Forces, the US Army, Air Force, and Navy, and various cadet corps and other services all at one time or another marched with the veterans. Since the closing of British, Canadian, and American bases in 1995, the parade has barely grown smaller. In addition to the ceremony held in the City of Hamilton on Remembrance Day itself, marching to the Cenotaph (a smaller replica of the one in London), where wreaths are laid and orations made, the Royal Navy and the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps held a parade the same day at the memorial in Hamilton, and a smaller military parade is also held in St. George's on the nearest Sunday to Remembrance Day before the Royal Garrison Artillery memorial in the King's Square.\nCanada.\nVeterans Affairs Canada states that Remembrance Day () is intended for \"remembrance for the men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country during times of war, conflict and peace\"; particularly the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, and all conflicts since then in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces have participated. The department runs a program called Canada Remembers, with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, \"come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict, and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country.\"\nRemembrance Day is a statutory holiday for federally regulated employees and a provincial and territorial statutory holiday in six of the 10 provinces and all three territories. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador recognize the day under separate legislation. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec are the only three provinces where the day is not a statutory holiday. The Royal Canadian Legion is officially against making the day a national statutory holiday, in part because its leadership believes the time free from work or school would eventually overtake the memorial purpose of the occasion, whereas, having schools in regular session on that day would be an opportunity for children to be taught the day's true significance in a mandatory fashion. In a more informal manner, there has been opinion voiced against the trend of Christmas creep, so that the conclusion of Remembrance Day should be the earliest acceptable time in which to mark the beginning of the Christmas holidays.\nHistory in Canada.\nCanadians began to commemorate their veterans and war dead as early as 1890, when Decoration Day began to be observed on 2 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866. A further observance was, from 1900 to 1918, held on 27 February to mark the Canadian victory over the Boers at the Battle of Paardeberg.\nThe first Armistice Day commemoration was in 1919, when King George V called on all countries in the British Empire to observe it. It was later placed on a statutory footing in 1921, after the Parliament of Canada provided that Thanksgiving and Armistice Day would both be held on the Monday of the week in which 11 November fell. Charles Dickie, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Nanaimo, campaigned to change the name from Armistice Day to Remembrance Day, which was approved in 1931, when Parliament accordingly amended the act, with its observance fixed on 11 November.\nSeveral other days of remembrance for veterans were also created, including the National Aboriginal Veterans Day, inaugurated in 1994 to recognise the contribution of Aboriginal soldiers. In 2001, Merchant Navy Remembrance Day was created by the Canadian Parliament, designating 3 September as a day to recognise the contributions and sacrifice of Canadian merchant mariners.\nCeremonies.\nThe national ceremonies organized by the federal government are held at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. These are presided over by the governor general of Canada (who acts as commander-in-chief in the monarch's name) and attended by the prime minister, other dignitaries, the Silver Cross mother, and public observers. Occasionally, a member of the Canadian royal family may also be present (such as Prince Charles in 2009 and Princess Anne in 2014).\nEnglish and French languages were used throughout the ceremony because Ottawa is officially bilingual, and the Ottawa-Gatineau census metropolitan area is a mix of anglophones and francophones.\nThe Ottawa Children's Choir serves as the official choir of the ceremony while the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces serves as the official band of the ceremony.\nBefore the start of the event, four sentries and three sentinels (two flag sentinels and one nursing sister) are posted at the foot of the cenotaph. The commemoration then typically begins with the tolling of the carillon in the Peace Tower, during which current members of the Armed Forces arrive at Confederation Square, followed by the Ottawa diplomatic corps, ministers of the Crown, special guests, the RCL, the royal party (if present), and the viceregal party. The arrival of the governor general is announced by a trumpeter sounding the \"Alert\", whereupon the viceroy is met by the dominion president of the RCL and escorted to a dais to receive the \"Vice Regal Salute\", after which the national anthem, \"O Canada\", is played and sung in English and French.\nThe moment of remembrance begins with the bugling of \"Last Post\", immediately before 11:00 am, when the 21-gun salute fires and the bells of the Peace Tower toll the hour. Two minutes pass between the first and second volleys of the gun salute to maintain silence for that period, as instituted across the Commonwealth by King George V. The cessation of the two minutes of silence is cued by the playing of a lament, the bugling of \"The Rouse\", and the reading of the \"Act of Remembrance\". A flypast of Royal Canadian Air Force craft then occurs, upon the completion of which a choir sings \"In Flanders Fields\".\nThe various parties then lay their wreaths at the base of the memorial. By tradition, the Governor General always lays the first wreath followed by the Silver Cross mother (a recent recipient of the Memorial Cross) on behalf of all mothers whose children died in conflicts in which Canada participated. The viceregal and royal group return to the dais to receive the playing of the Canadian royal anthem, \"God Save the King\", sung in French and English, prior to the assembled armed forces personnel and veterans performing a march past in front of the viceroy and any royal guest, bringing about the end of the official ceremonies. A tradition of paying a more personal tribute has emerged since the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was installed at the Canadian National War Memorial in 2000: after the official ceremony, the general public place their poppies atop the tomb.\nSimilar ceremonies take place in provincial capitals across the country, officiated by the relevant lieutenant governor, as well as in other cities, towns, and even hotels or corporate headquarters. Schools will usually hold special assemblies for the first half of the day or on the school day prior, with various presentations concerning the remembrance of the war dead. The ceremony participants include veterans, current members of the Canadian forces, and sea, army, and air cadet units.\nIndia.\nIn India, the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments. There are memorial services in some churches such as St. Mark's Cathedral and St. John's Church in Bangalore. At Kohima and Imphal in the remote hillsides of Northeast India, services of remembrance supported by the Indian Army are observed at Kohima and Imphal War Cemeteries (maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The day is also marked at the Delhi War Cemetery. In 2013, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked the day in Mumbai's St. John the Evangelist Church.\nKenya.\nIn Kenya, the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the ex-servicemen of the First and Second World Wars. The KAFOCA and Kenyan Government recognise Remembrance Day.\nNew Zealand.\nArmistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day. As in other countries, New Zealand's Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II. However, by the mid-1950s, the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans' organisations.\nAs a result, New Zealand's national day of remembrance is Anzac Day, 25 April. Poppy Day\" usually occurs on the Friday before Anzac Day. The reason for New Zealand having their remembrance on Anzac Day happened in 1921. The paper Poppies for Armistice that year arrived by ship too late for 11 November 1921, so an RSA branch distributed them at the next commemoration date (25 April 1922, which happened to be Anzac Day) and that date stuck as the new Poppy Day in New Zealand.\nSaint Lucia.\nLike Barbados, Saint Lucia does not recognise Remembrance Day as a public holiday. Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday. The parade is held at the central square, namely the Derek Walcott Square, where the Cenotaph is located. There, members of the Royal St Lucia Police Force and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St. Lucian men and women who fought in the war.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the \"Last Post\" is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence. Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the Cenotaph in Cape Town, and in Pretoria at the Voortrekker Monument cenotaph and the War Memorial at the Union Buildings. Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the Border War. In addition, the South African Legion of Military Veterans holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans.\nUnited Kingdom.\nWreath-laying ceremonies, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion, are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11\u00a0am on 11 November, with two minutes of silence observed; a custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the early 1990s. The silence is also broadcast as a special programme on BBC with a voice over usually saying \"This is BBC One. Now on the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month. The traditional two-minute silence for Armistice Day.\" The programme starts with a close up of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and then the programme shows different parts of the world observing the silence. The programme ends with a bugler sounding \"The Rouse\" and then normal programming is resumed.\nMany employers and businesses invite their staff and customers to observe the two minutes' silence at 11:00\u00a0am. The beginning and end of the two minutes' silence is often marked in large towns and cities by the firing of field artillery gun, often provided by the local Royal Artillery battery.\nThe first two-minute silence held in London (11 November 1919) was reported in \"The Manchester Guardian\" on 12 November 1919:\nThe first stroke of eleven produced a magical effect.\nThe tram cars glided into stillness, motors ceased to cough and fume, and stopped dead, and the mighty-limbed dray horses hunched back upon their loads and stopped also, seeming to do it of their own volition.\nSomeone took off his hat, and with a nervous hesitancy the rest of the men bowed their heads also. Here and there an old soldier could be detected slipping unconsciously into the posture of 'attention'. An elderly woman, not far away, wiped her eyes, and the man beside her looked white and stern. Everyone stood very still ... The hush deepened. It had spread over the whole city and become so pronounced as to impress one with a sense of audibility. It was a silence which was almost pain ... And the spirit of memory brooded over it all.\nRemembrance Sunday.\nIn the United Kingdom, the main observance is Remembrance Sunday, held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November. There is a National Service of Remembrance in London, as well as other services and ceremonies in the regions. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army. A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.\nBritish diplomatic missions also organise services on Remembrance Sunday. Services organised by British missions in Israel include one at the Jerusalem British War Cemetery, organised by the British Consul in Jerusalem; and another at Ramleh Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, organised by the British embassy in Tel Aviv. The Ramleh ceremony is the larger and is also attended by veterans of the Second World War.\nCommemorative coins and exhibitions.\nIn 2014, the Royal Mint issued a colour-printed Alderney \u00a35 coin, designed by engraver Laura Clancy, to commemorate Remembrance Day.\nAlso in 2014, to commemorate the outbreak of World War I a huge display called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, consisting of 888,246 ceramic poppies was installed in the moat of the Tower of London, each poppy representing a British Empire fatality.\nOn 5 November 2018 and set to continue for 4 months, about 10,000 torches were lit at the foot of the Tower's walls, in its dry moat to mark the centenary of the end of the World War I.\nNorthern Ireland.\nRemembrance Day is officially observed in Northern Ireland in the same way as in the rest of United Kingdom, although it tends to be associated more with the unionist community. Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organised by the Royal British Legion. This is mainly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The bombing was widely condemned and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years. The Republic of Ireland has a National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who have died in war.\nRelated observances elsewhere.\nAlongside Commonwealth countries, several other countries also commemorate their war dead on 11 November, the anniversary of the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne. Several other countries observe the anniversary of other notable events in World War I to commemorate the war dead from that conflict, such as the date of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which went into effect on 4 November.\nBelgium and France.\nRemembrance Day (11 November) is a national holiday in France and Belgium. It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compi\u00e8gne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, which took effect at 11:00\u00a0am\u2014the \"eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.\" Armistice Day is one of the most important military commemorations in France, since it was a major French victory, and the French paid a heavy price in blood to achieve it. The First World War was considered in France as the \"Great Patriotic War\". Almost all French villages feature memorials dedicated to those fallen during the conflict. In France the blue cornflower \"(Bleuet de France)\" is used symbolically rather than the poppy.\nHong Kong.\nRemembrance Day was formerly observed in British Hong Kong, although it has not been a public holiday since the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in July 1997.\nHowever, members of the Hong Kong Ex-Servicemen's Association continue to organise a Remembrance Sunday multi-faith memorial service at the Cenotaph in Central, Hong Kong. The service has been attended by various government officials and the representatives of religious groups. The memorial service resembles the services performed in other Commonwealth countries. The service includes the sounding of \"Last Post\", two minutes of silence, the sounding of \"Reveille\", the laying of wreaths, and prayers, and ends with a recitation of the \"Ode of Remembrance\". The Hong Kong Police Band continues to perform their ceremonial duty at the service. Members of the Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps (including the Ceremonial Squadron), Hong Kong Adventure Corps, Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps and scouting organisations are also in attendance.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, the National Unity and Armed Forces Day is observed on 4 November to commemorate the country's victory in World War I, and the completion of the unification of Italy. The date is the anniversary of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which effectively ended combat between the Allies of World War I and Austria-Hungary in 1918.\nSince 1977, this day has not been a public holiday; now, many services are held on the first Sunday in November.\nRussia.\nIn Russia, the Russian Day of Remembrance of Victims of World War I is observed on 1 August to honour Imperial Russian Army soldiers from that conflict. The date is the anniversary of the German declaration of war on the Russian Empire in 1914, resulting in the Russian entry into World War I.\nSerbia.\nSerbia has observed Armistice Day on 11 November since 2012. The statutory holiday was created to commemorate the victims of World War I. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear Natalie's ramonda as a symbol of remembrance.\nUnited States.\nVeterans Day is observed in the United States on 11 November and is both a federal holiday and a state holiday in all states. In the United States, and some other allied nations, 11 November was formerly known as Armistice Day; in the United States it was given its new name in 1954 at the end of the Korean War to honour all veterans. Veterans Day is observed with memorial ceremonies, salutes at military cemeteries, and parades. However, the function of the observance elsewhere is more closely matched by Memorial Day, another commemorative holiday held in May.\nSimilar holidays commemorating veterans.\nCroatia.\nIn Croatia, Day of Remembrance for the Victims of the Homeland War and Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Vukovar and \u0160kabrnja is a national public holiday and a non-working day in memory of all victims of the Homeland War in Croatia. The holiday is celebrated on November 18, the day of the fall of the city of Vukovar in the 1991 Homeland War, when the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbian paramilitaries committed the two most massive crimes in Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence in two Croatian towns, Vukovar and \u0160kabrnja. These events are known as Vukovar massacre and \u0160kabrnja massacre. In memory of these events, the Croatian Parliament in 2019 adopted a new law which introduced a new holiday, a day of remembrance for all victims of the Croatian War of Independence.\nDenmark.\nIn 2009 the Danish government established Veterans' Day with early events on 5 September where past and present members of the armed forces, who have done service in armed conflict, are remembered.\nGermany.\nThe German national day of mourning is the secular public holiday of Volkstrauertag, which since 1952 has been observed two Sundays before the first Sunday of Advent; in practice this is the Sunday closest to 16 November. The anniversary of the Armistice itself is not observed in Germany.\nIreland.\nThe Republic of Ireland holds a National Day of Commemoration in July for Irish men and women who have died in war. The national day is typically held close to the anniversary date of when the truce for the Irish War of Independence went into effect in 1921.\nRemembrance Sunday itself is marked by a ceremony in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, which the President of Ireland attends, although it is not a recognised holiday in Ireland. It is estimated that some 200,000 Irish soldiers fought on the British side in the First World War with up to 35,000 killed. Additionally, some 70,000 citizens of the then independent state of Ireland served in the British armed services during the Second World War and the Roll of Honour in Trinity College Dublin lists 3617 of those who died on active service.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, Remembrance of the Dead is commemorated annually on 4 May. It is not a public holiday. Throughout the country, military personnel and civilians fallen in various conflicts since World War II are remembered. The main ceremonies are at the Waalsdorpervlakte near The Hague, the Grebbeberg near Wageningen and Dam Square in Amsterdam. Two minutes of silence are observed at 8:00\u00a0pm. Remembrance Day is followed by Liberation Day on 5 May.\nNorway.\nIn Norway the Norwegian Armed Forces commemorate Veteran's Day. The Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, decreed that Veteran's Day would be observed on the same day as Victory in Europe Day, in Norway known as \"Frigj\u00f8ringsdagen\", or Liberation Day. The ceremonies are held annually in Akershus Fortress, with the King of Norway, Harald V, present. The first of such ceremonies was held on 8 May 2011, with two Norwegian Special Forces Operators being awarded the War Cross for deployments in the recent War in Afghanistan. The ceremonies are observed with memorials and military salutes.\nPoland.\nPolish Independence Day is celebrated on 11 November, and is a public holiday. Although the holiday occurs on the same day as Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth, the holiday is intended to celebrate the independence of Poland and the regaining of freedom and unity for the Polish people after 123 years of partitioning.\nHowever, some commemorations for war dead do occur on Polish Independence Day, as the independence of Poland was caused by the end of the First World War. Major events include laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by members of the government and highest authorities, other public ceremonies and church services and school commemorations.\nRomania.\nSince 2007, the War Veterans Day is commemorated on 29 April in Romania. The date was chosen as 29 April 1902 was the date when King Carol I established the title of \"war veteran\" for soldiers that fought in the War of Independence. Since 2014, Romania also commemorates Veterans' Day on 11 November, known as the Combat Theatre Veterans Day, marking both the armistice of Compi\u00e8gne and the end of World War I, as well as the day when the first Romanian soldier was killed during the war in Afghanistan \u2013 11 November 2003. Since 2015, the Romanian peony is worn on both occasions similarly to the remembrance poppy.\nSouth Korea.\nThe \"Turn to Busan\" remembrance ceremony has occurred at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery on 11 November annually since 2007. The ceremony commemorates veterans and war dead from 22 countries that fought under the United Nations Command during the Korean War. The ceremony was conceived by Vincent Courtenay, a Canadian veteran of the conflict. At Seoul Anglican Cathedral and Busan Anglican Cathedtal, the Eucharist to honour Korean War Veterans are held.\nSri Lanka.\nRemembrance Day in Sri Lanka, also known as the National War heroes commemoration day, marks the capitulation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the end to the Sri Lankan Civil War on 18 May 2009. The day is a war heroes commemoration day as well as a remembrance day for civilians who died in the war from both sides. The celebrations are marked by speeches and a moment of silence. From its inception, under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2010 the day was known as Victory Day and originally included a military parade, but in 2015 the day was renamed Remembrance Day by President Maithripala Sirisena.\nSimilarly named holidays.\nMarshall Islands.\nIn the Marshall Islands, Nuclear Victims' Day and Nuclear Survivors' Day occurs on March 1 and is a national holiday. The day honours the victims and survivors of nuclear testing done in the area in the 1950s.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Immanuel\u2019s most well-known work is his Hebrew-language \"maqama\" collection, the \"Mahberot Immanuel\".\nBiography.\nImmanuel was born in Rome in 1261 to the Zifroni family. His cousin, Judah ben Moses Romano, was an author and translator employed by the King of Naples, Robert of Anjou.308 Immanuel served as the head of correspondence for Rome\u2019s Jewish community and likely occupied another prominent position during his lifetime. \nHe left Rome in 1321, perhaps in response to a papal edict of that year which ordered the expulsion of Jews from Rome. After this, he travelled around Italy, possibly residing in Gubbio. Immanuel likely died around 1335.\nWorks.\nImmanuel wrote in both in Hebrew and Italian. He is the only Jewish author from this time with surviving Italian-language works. Apart from the \"Mahberot Immanuel\", his most-known composition, he authored biblical commentaries, a work of Hermeneutics, a treatise on the esoteric aspects of the Hebrew alphabet (not extant), and five poems in Italian. He is the first poet to author a sonnet in a language other than Italian.\nMahberot Immanuel.\nImmanuel is most celebrated for the \"Mahberot Immanuel\", a Hebrew collection of \"maqamat\". The \"maqama\", also referred to in Hebrew as \"mahberet\", is a genre of rhymed prose that originated in Arabic but flourished in both Arabic and Hebrew in medieval Iberia. In his introduction to the \"Mahberot Immanuel\", Immanuel references Judah al-Harizi\u2019s \"Takhemoni\". Hebrew was not a spoken language in either medieval Iberia or 14th-century Italy, so authors re-worked Biblical Hebrew to suit their literary exploits.\n\"Mahberot Immanuel\" consists of 28 chapters that each deal with various subjects and inter-weave rhymed prose and metered verse. It reflects elements of Hebrew literary tradition as well as contemporary Italian literary trends. Immanuel\u2019s sonnets employ motifs characteristic of Dante and Cecco Angiolieri, two contemporaries of Immanuel. The beloved is referred to both as a \u201cgazelle,\u201d typical of Arabic and Hebrew literary heritage, and as a \u201clady,\u201d Immanuel\u2019s translation of the Italian \"donna\".\nThis \"maqama\" collection includes thirty-eight sonnets. Immanuel employs a meter that combines both Hebrew quantitative meter (itself an Andalusian adaptation from Arabic) and Italian syllabic meter. These sonnets were included amongst the 28 stories of the Mahberot. For example, in the third chapter, lovers exchange sonnets with each other.\nImmanuel\u2019s \"Mahberot Immanuel\" was a highly popular work amongst Hebrew readers. It was one of the early Hebrew works printed after the advent of the printing press, particularly since Italy was a center for Hebrew printing. Further proof of its notoriety is attested by its prohibition for reading on the Sabbath according to the 16th century legal code Shulchan Aruch.\nTwo of the most-known stories of the \"Mahberot\" Immanuel are the \"Scroll of Love\" (\"megilat ha-hesheq\") and the \"Tale of Hell and Paradise\" (\"Mahberet ha-Tophet veha-'Eden\").\nThrough a series of rhymed letters, the \"Scroll of Love\" recounts the story of Immanuel whose patron entices him to romantically pursue a nun who he has never seen. The pair exchange ten letters, four of them sonnets. Immanuel\u2019s poetic chops convince the nun to run away with him however the tale turns sour when Immanuel discovers she is his patron\u2019s half-sister. His patron threatens to cut off his support of Immanuel and so Immanuel is forced to end the budding romance. Heartbroken and humiliated, the woman stops eating and drinking and quickly dies. Immanuel mourns her death with a sonnet\nThe \"Tale of Hell and Paradise\" is an account of hell and heaven delivered by Immanuel\u2019s literary persona who was guided by Daniel. Daniel is either a reference to the biblical prophet or to Dante. He includes a description of a sinner bound to a post crowned with thorns, possibly an allusion to Jesus. Notably, this man is being punished for his heretical and sexually improper acts. Daniel and Immanuel meet other biblical and contemporary people in hell and heaven. Scholars have pointed to similarities between Immanuel\u2019s story and Dante\u2019s \"Divine Comedy\". Immanuel, unlike Dante, does not include Purgatory, as it is not part of Jewish theology. Interestingly, this section is the lone story cast exclusively in rhymed prose without any sections of metered verse.\nItalian poems.\nImmanuel is the only Jewish poet from this period with extant Italian poetry. Immanuel authored five poems in Italian \u2013 four sonnets and \"Bisbidis\". \"Bisbidis\" was well-received and included in poetic anthologies from this time. \"Bisbidis\" has received scholarly attention for its inventiveness and rich onomatopoeia."}

{"id": "60815", "revid": "40888199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60815", "title": "Otaniemi", "text": "Otaniemi (Finnish), or Otn\u00e4s (Swedish), is a district of Espoo, Finland. It is located near the border with Helsinki, the capital of Finland.\nOtaniemi is located on the southern shore of the Laajalahti bay, next to the district of Tapiola near the border to Helsinki. It is part of the Greater Tapiola major district. Otaniemi and Tapiola are separated by the Ring I beltway. The Aalto University metro station, located in Otaniemi, was put into service in 2017.\nOtaniemi is the home of Aalto University's campus, thus \"Otaniemi\" is often used as a synonym for Aalto. However, several research and business facilities are also located in Otaniemi. The most prominent institutions for science and engineering in Otaniemi are the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). Business is represented in the area by the business incubator Technopolis. In 2010, Otaniemi became home to Aalto University, formed from the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and the Helsinki School of Economics.\nHistory.\nThe oldest signs of human activity in the Otaniemi area can be found in front of the courtyard of what is now J\u00e4mer\u00e4ntaival 1 (the so-called summer hotel): a pile of rocks dating from the Bronze Age (also called \"the grave of the primordial teekkari\"), about 3000 years old. Graves of this kind have apparently also been built as memorial for the disappeared, because no bones of the dead were found from this pile. The graves were apparently built on islets, which the J\u00e4mer\u00e4ntaival hill also used to be. Ancient fishermen were active in the area because the main course of the Vantaa river used to flow into the Iso Huopalahti bay at the bottom of Laajalahti at the time.\nThe etymology of the name \"Otaniemi\" is not certain. It is thought to have come from the Finnish word \"oka\" meaning the point of a spear, because of the sharp shape of the peninsula, or from \"ohto\" meaning a bear, which is also supported by the names of nearby places such as Otsolahti and Karhusaari, or from the S\u00e1mi word \"outa\" meaning a forested lowland. The latter might well be the correct etymology, because in late medieval sources the name Otaniemi also appears as Outn\u00e4s, Owttenes or Outenesby (later Otn\u00e4s). Because of the diphthong \"ou\" which is rarely used in Swedish, it can be deduced that there have been southern S\u00e1mi people or Tavastians in the ara in ancient times. There are also other place names of S\u00e1mi ancestry in Espoo, the most notable of which is probably Nuuksio.\nThe village of Otaniemi, which according to tax documents from 1540 included three houses, originally belonged to Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4, where the masters of the village often served as jurors in court sessions. During the Russo-Swedish War, on the icy cold winter of 1577 the Tatars attacked the coast of Espoo over the Gulf of Finland and burned the entire village of Otaniemi to the ground. In 1602 the lands were given to the experienced war hero, ensign Daniel Golovachev. The lord of the Turku Castle, Anders Nilsson (Hyttner) received control of the houses in Otaniemi in the 1630s and at that time they formed a unified farmstead for the first time in their history, a manor exempt from equipping cavalry.\nThe mayor of Helsinki Gabriel Tavast bought Otaniemi in 1653 and almost ten years later in 1662 it was transferred to the state as a manor of the crown. Otaniemi was accepted as a farmstead required to equip cavalry in 1695. The area had already become part of Espoo before this. After the Great Wrath, the lands of Otaniemi were bought by colonel Henrik Wright who had served in the army of King Charles XII of Sweden. This took place in 1734, and thus two new crofts were formed, Bj\u00f6rnholm (Karhusaari) at the eastern shore of the Otsolahti bay and Lak\u00f6r at the point of the Otaniemi peninsula. When the immense construction work of Sveaborg started, the farmstead of Otaniemi was transferred to the ownership of Karl von Numers in 1746.\nThe construction workers and garrison men of Sveaborg required large amounts of accommodation space, and new residential buildings were built also in the Otaniemi area. One of these so-called military crofts later developed into the Hagalund manor, which still remains at its place, near the Otaniemi water tower. In 1810 the farmstead was split in two between the grandsons of Karl von Numers. One of them received the lands of the Hagalund manor and the other received the farmstead proper with its main building. The Otaniemi manor was later sold in 1832 to banker Johan Norrman, who himself sold the entire property to beer merchant Pavel Sinebrychoff 25 years later. Sinebrychoff then expanded his property and also bought the Hagalund manor in 1859.\nAfter the death of Pavel Sinebrychoff in 1883 the entire area was transferred to his older son Nikolai, who travelled abroad three years later to take care of his health. Control of the area was taken by Nikolai's younger brother Paul, who had married actress Fanny Grahn. The couple moved to the Otaniemi manor in 1904. Their marriage did not result in children. Paul died in 1917 and Fanny died four years later. According to their will, the area was split in 1922. The smaller part (consisting of the current university campus and the Teekkarikyl\u00e4 student residence) was given to director Carl af Forselles, the husband of Fanny's niece, and the larger part, including the Hagalund manor, was given to Fanny's nephew, doctor and tennis player Arne Grahn, also known as the \"father\" of the district of Westend.\nIn 1927 the Af Forselles family sold Otaniemi to three private persons, who founded the company Ab Otn\u00e4s G\u00e5rd in the area. In the 1930s ownership of the company was transferred to Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and it was renamed Otaniemi Oy. In 1949 the state of Finland bought an area of about 107 hectares north of Lehtisaarentie from the company, on the initiative of the Helsinki University of Technology. At the same time, the student body of the university acquired about two hectares of land at Otaniemi for the construction of the Teekkarikyl\u00e4 student residence.\nThe Otaniemi manor and its surroundings make an appearance in Nyrki Tapiovaara's film \"The Stolen Death\" (1938), which contains a scene where the cossacks pursue activists and ride right into the courtyard of the manor.\nAs late as the 1940s, Otaniemi was part of the Hagalund manor and used as a park and farmland, from where an old linden all\u00e9e survives. In 1949, the Government of Finland purchased the lands of Hagalund Manor for use as the campus of the Helsinki University of Technology and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. First to be built was the student campus of the Helsinki University of Technology, which also served as one of the Olympic Villages in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Several thousand students currently live in Otaniemi. The region has since been built up around TKK and VTT, and is at the core of Finnish scientific and technological activities.\nPreparations for the move of the Helsinki University of Technology from the Hietalahdentori square in Helsinki started in the turn of the 1940s and 1950s. Construction of the Teekkarikyl\u00e4 student residence started in 1950. Its first houses, designed by Heikki and Kaija Siren were built in May 1952. Construction materials included bricks that had been taken from the ruins of the embassy of the Soviet Union, which had been destroyed in the bombing of Helsinki during World War II. The Otaniemi Chapel, designed by the same architects, was built 1957. As soon as the houses in Teekkarikyl\u00e4 were completed, they served to accommodate athletes in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Construction of Teekkarikyl\u00e4 and the prominent actions of the teekkari students in 1956 sped up the university's move to Otaniemi from its old, cramped premises in the Helsinki city centre. Construction of the main building of the university started in 1961, when the old manor located at the same time, dating from the late 18th or early 19th century, was dismantled. The main building was completed in 1964 and officially inaugurated in 1966. The VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland moved from Helsinki to Otaniemi at the same time as the university.\nThe Teekkarikyl\u00e4 residence in Otaniemi also served as accommodation in the 1983 and 2005 World Championships in Athletics. Because of the 2005 championships, construction of new student apartments sped up and right before the event, six new buildings were built into Teekkarikyl\u00e4 at J\u00e4mer\u00e4naukio and Otaranta.\nThe Haukilahti gymnasium moved to Otaniemi in autumn 2016. During the autumn semester 2019 the Otaniemi gymnasium with 800 students also started operating in Otaniemi, transferred over from the Pohjois-Tapiola and Olari gymnasiums, which were discontinued.\nArchitecture.\nThe area is architecturally unique, boasting buildings designed by leading Finnish architects including Alvar Aalto, Heikki and Kaija Siren, and Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4. Alvar Aalto was an alumnus of the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), one of the three merger schools that later formed Aalto University, and the designer of both the city plan for the Otaniemi area and the main building of TKK.\nDemographics.\nOtaniemi hosts a student community especially concentrated in the several blocks of student housing called Teekkarikyl\u00e4 (, literally \"technology students' village\"). Some buildings of Teekkarikyl\u00e4 are owned by the student association of Aalto University AYY; others are owned by HOAS. There are very few non-student apartments in Otaniemi, as almost all inhabitants are students. Due to the nature of its demographic, Otaniemi is also the poorest postal code area in Finland: according to an investigation made by Statistics Finland in 2015, the median income per resident was reported to be only 11 062 euros.\nPolitics.\nIn the 2017 municipal elections, the Liberal Party won one council seat in Espoo; in there, the party's support was greatest in Otaniemi, where it received 6.6 percent of the vote.\nEducation.\nOn 1 January 2010, Otaniemi became home to Aalto University, formed from the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and the Helsinki School of Economics. Art and business teaching has been gradually moved from Aalto's Helsinki locations to Otaniemi. The name is a tribute to Alvar Aalto, a prominent architect known for his achievements in technology, economics, and art.\nOtaniemi is also the location of the Border and Coast Guard Academy. Until 2008, the officer school of the Police College of Finland was also located there.\nResearch and development.\nOtaniemi is home to many of Finland's research and development organizations: The most prominent institutions for science and engineering in Otaniemi are the Finnish Innovation Center, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, the Micronova Center of Micro and Nanotechnology, the KCL pulp and paper research center, the CSC IT Center for Scientific Computing, the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK), and the National Bureau of Measures (MIKES). Helsinki University of Technology's 10 national centers of excellence create most of Finland's hi-tech patents within this small area.\nOtaniemi has gained international recognition in information and communication technologies thanks largely to Nokia, but it also contains a host of other cutting-edge technology clusters, including mobility-based software and web-ware, as well as nanotechnology, microelectronics and quantum technology. Major companies that have sites in Otaniemi are for instance Tieto and P\u00f6yry.\nThe Finnish Customs laboratory is located in Otaniemi.\nThe district of Otaniemi also includes the area of Keilaniemi, which contains the head offices of Fortum, Neste and Kone. In December 2007 the fifth building of Swing life Center was built in Keilaniemi, making the construction of the centre complete. The Swing Life Center complex currently houses about thirty companies in four interconnected buildings.\nOther features.\nOtaniemi was home to the Border and Coast Guard Academy, Finland, which was discontinued in Otaniemi in 2014 when its activity was concentrated to Imatra. The officer school of the Police University College was located in Otaniemi until 2008.\nA new fire station will be constructed in Otaniemi next to the planned students' house as it is not possible to reach the area from elsewhere quickly enough. The new fire station will require a change in the zoning plan and dismantling the current Neste self-service petrol station. The projected price of the building is 5.3 million euro. The city council of Espoo still needs to accept the plan.\nOtaniemi has three daycares, a stadium, an indoor arena, and a small shopping mall called A Bloc. The Fat Lizard Brewing Company has had its brewery in Otaniemi since 2017.\nTransport.\nThe Ring I beltway goes past Otaniemi, and the area is located at its end near the L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4 highway. The most direct car connection from the Helsinki city centre to Otaniemi goes via L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and the western end of Ring I. Additionally, the street Kuusisaarentie leads from Munkkiniemi in Helsinki to Otaniemi via a chain of islands.\nMany Espoo internal bus lines have their terminus stops at Teekkarikyl\u00e4 in Otaniemi, and many regional bus lines also travel past the area.\nOtaniemi has been connected to the Helsinki Metro since 2017. The Aalto University metro station of the L\u00e4nsimetro line is located in Otaniemi to the southwest of the main building of the university. \nIn October 2023, the Raide-Jokeri light rail line (Line 15) opened, connecting Otaniemi directly to both Keilaniemi in Espoo and It\u00e4keskus in Helsinki, with three stops within Otaniemi. This new light rail line, which replaced the previously busiest bus route in the Helsinki region, has significantly enhanced public transportation accessibility in the area and provides efficient cross-town links for local residents, students, and commuters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was located in Otaniemi, Espoo in the Helsinki metropolitan area, and it was one of the three universities from which the modern day Aalto University was founded. The university was founded in 1849 by Grand Duke of Finland, Emperor Nicholas I and received university status in 1908. It moved from Helsinki to Otaniemi campus area in 1966. The merger of HUT with two other schools created the Aalto University in 2010, and HUT briefly held the name Aalto University School of Science and Technology before being split into four schools in 2011. \nMuch of the university's Otaniemi campus was designed by Alvar Aalto.\nHistory.\nIn 1849, TKK was established in Helsinki by the decree of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Grand Duke of Finland as a \"manufacture and handicraft school\", with the name \"Helsingin teknillinen reaalikoulu/Helsingfors tekniska realskola\", along with two other similar schools, situated in Vaasa and Turku. The school started its function in the Domus Litonii (\"Litonius house\") building located at Aleksanterinkatu 50, which had been designed by Gustaf Paulus Leander and completed in 1847, and remains in use and in ownership by the Litonius family to this day.\nIn 1872, the school's name was changed to \"Polyteknillinen koulu/Polytekniska skolan\" (\"Polytechnical School\") and in 1878, to \"Polyteknillinen opisto/Polytekniska institutet\" (\"Polytechnical Institute\"), while the two other manufacture and handiwork schools were demoted to institutions of lower level. In 1877 the school moved to larger premises to a new building near the Hietalahdentori market square. As the proportion of matriculation diploma holders in the student intake gradually increased, the school gained more social respectability. In 1908, TKK was given university status along with its present name, thus becoming the second university to be founded in Finland. In 1955, building of the new campus area started with the housing village. In 1966, TKK moved from Helsinki to the new campus in Otaniemi, Espoo.\nIn the past, the university was also known by the abbreviations HUT and TH, from its English- and Swedish-language names, but in 2005 a decision was made officially to use the abbreviation TKK exclusively, for branding reasons.\nIn 2010, TKK was merged with Helsinki School of Economics and University of Art and Design Helsinki into Aalto University. After brief existence in the new university as own institution, \"Aalto University School of Science and Technology\", it was split into four schools, corresponding to four old faculties, School of Engineering, School of Science, School of Electrical Engineering, and Aalto University School of Chemical Technology. In 2012, the Department of Architecture of the School of Engineering, formerly of Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, was merged with Aalto University School of Art and Design into Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture.\nResearch and teaching.\nStudies.\nAll engineering programmes offered by TKK led to the degree of \"diplomi-insin\u00f6\u00f6ri\" (\"engineer with university diploma\"), a five-year master's degree. The only exceptions to this were the architecture programmes that lead to the master's degrees of architecture and landscape architecture. From 2005, according to the Bologna process, all students might also complete an intermediate degree (\"tekniikan kandidaatti\", \"TkK\") before the DI or architect's degree. This degree is considered a bachelor's degree and enables enrollment in foreign universities where a bachelor's degree is required. TKK did not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student might only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. TKK required a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies were offered completely in English.\nApart from numerous programs in Finnish, various international Masters programs were offered exclusively for studies in English.\nFaculties and research.\nThe university was organized in four faculties, each consisting of departments and separate laboratories, and separate units not operating under any faculty.\nAdditionally, TKK participated in various joint units with other Finnish universities and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland:\nTKK participated in 12 Centres of Excellence (\"huippuyksikk\u00f6\"), selected by the Academy of Finland to represent the top research in the country and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy.\nResearchers at TKK have achieved notability in, among other things, low temperature physics (holding the current world record for the lowest temperature achieved), the development of devices and methods for magnetoencephalography, mobile communications, wood processing, and neural networks, with professor Teuvo Kohonen initiating research in self-organizing maps. Additionally, the first commercialised total synthesis, the synthesis of camphor, was invented by Gustaf Komppa, the first professor of chemistry at TKK and the Nobel laureate (chemistry, 1945) Artturi Virtanen held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest cleanroom facility in Northern Europe and of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe.\nThe Nokia Research Center has operated a \"lablet\" on university premises since 2008, in order to establish joint research programs and daily interaction between Nokia and university researchers, who would share the same facilities.\nCampus.\nTKK was located in Otaniemi, Espoo. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and business incubators Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated there. It is also directly adjacent to Keilaniemi, with Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as Nokia and Fortum. The area is connected by a 15-minute bus ride to the center of Helsinki.\nCulture and student life.\nTKK was known for its active student community and technology students (\"teekkari\"s) are highly noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat and often brightly colored overalls to many of their public events. The community has also organised important charity events (\"tempaus\" in local language). TKK students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, student pranks (\"j\u00e4yn\u00e4\"), similar in principle to MIT hacks. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of Paavo Nurmi onto the 300-year-old wreck of Regalskeppet \"Vasa\" just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.\nStudent Union.\nThe Student Union of Helsinki University of Technology (\"TKY\", , ) was the interest group for the students of the university. In 2006 it had 11,187 members, which included all the students of the university, as is stipulated by Finnish law. It was founded in 1872.\nStudent Nation.\nTKK was also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more \"nations\", a Finnish type of student corporation. The only nation at TKK was Teknologf\u00f6reningen (TF) and its goal was to unite Swedish-speaking students at TKK. Teknologf\u00f6reningen was founded in 1872, prior to the student union. Teknologf\u00f6reningen also has its own building opposite to Dipoli called \"Urdsgjallar\", completed in 1966. The Finnish-speaking student nation \"Tekniikan Ylioppilaat\" was disbanded in 1972 and its functions given to the university student union, since a separate Finnish-speaking nation in a university with an overwhelming Finnish-speaking majority was considered unnecessary. The regional Finnish-speaking nations at the University of Helsinki also accepted TKK students as members.\nStudent housing.\nThe housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as Teekkarikyl\u00e4 (technology student village), was owned mostly by the student union and partly by HOAS (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing was characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offered housing for approximately 2,600 students.\nConstruction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during World War II, as a result of bombings by Soviet Union itself. Later the student housing has been used for housing athletes again in a number of athletics events, sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.\nThe campus contains the former student union building and convention centre \"Dipoli\", named as the second \"Poli\", the second building of the polytechnic students. The original first building being located formerly in the Helsinki centre. Dipoli was designed by Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4 and was completed in 1966. However, in 1993 the building was transformed into a training centre of the university. The ownership of the property was later transferred from the student union to the university itself, due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.\nAssociations.\nIn addition to the student union TKK students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. In 2007, there were some 150 associations maintained by university students. In 2006, two-thirds of the student union members were members of \"the guilds\", which are student associations uniting students inside their department, e.g. the Guild of Electrical Engineers.\nList of student associations of Helsinki University of Technology.\nCurrently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.\nNotable people and alumni.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the Bega River, Timi\u0219oara is considered the informal capital city of the historical Banat region. From 1848 to 1860 it was the capital of the Serbian Vojvodina and the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. With 250,849 inhabitants at the 2021 census, Timi\u0219oara is the country's fifth most populous city. It is home to around 400,000 inhabitants in its metropolitan area, while the Timi\u0219oara\u2013Arad metropolis concentrates more than 70% of the population of Timi\u0219 and Arad counties. Timi\u0219oara is a multicultural city, home to 21 ethnic groups and 18 religious denominations. Historically, the most numerous were the Swabian Germans, Jews and Hungarians, who still make up 6% of the population in Timi\u0219oara.\nConquered in 1716 by the Austrians from the Ottoman Turks, Timi\u0219oara developed in the following centuries behind the fortifications and in the urban nuclei located around them. During the second half of the 19th century, the fortress began to lose its usefulness, due to many developments in military technology. Former bastions and military spaces were demolished and replaced with new boulevards and neighborhoods. Timi\u0219oara was the first city in the Habsburg monarchy with street lighting (1760) and the first European city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884. It opened the first public lending library in the Habsburg monarchy and built a municipal hospital 24 years ahead of Vienna. Also, in 1771 it published the first German newspaper in Southeast Europe (). In December 1989, Timi\u0219oara was the starting point of the Romanian Revolution.\nTimi\u0219oara is one of the most important educational centers in Romania, with about 40,000 students enrolled in the city's six universities. Like many other large cities in Romania, Timi\u0219oara is a medical tourism service provider, especially for dental care and cosmetic surgery. Several breakthroughs in Romanian medicine have been achieved in Timi\u0219oara, including the first in vitro fertilization (IVF), the first laser heart surgery and the first stem cell transplant. As a technology hub, the city has one of the most powerful IT sectors in Romania alongside Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Ia\u0219i, and Bra\u0219ov. In 2013, Timi\u0219oara had the fastest internet download speed in the world.\nNicknamed the \"Little Vienna\" or the \"City of Roses\", Timi\u0219oara is noted for its large number of historical monuments and its 36 parks and green spaces. The spa resorts Buzia\u0219 and B\u0103ile C\u0103lacea are located at a distance of from the city, respectively, mentioned since Roman times for the properties of healing waters. Along with Oradea, Timi\u0219oara is part of the Art Nouveau European Route. It is also a member of Eurocities. Timi\u0219oara has an active cultural scene due to the city's three state theaters, opera, philharmonic and many other cultural institutions. In 2016, Timi\u0219oara was the first Romanian Youth Capital, and in 2023 it held the title of European Capital of Culture, along with the cities of Veszpr\u00e9m in Hungary and Elefsina in Greece.\nEtymology.\nThe Hungarian name of the city, \"Temesv\u00e1r\", was first recorded as \"Temeswar\" in 1315. It refers to a castle (\"v\u00e1r\") on the Timi\u0219 River (\"Temes\"). Timi\u0219 belongs to the family of hydronyms derived from the Indo-European radical \"thib\" \"swamp\". The Romanian and German oikonyms (Timi\u0219oara and Temeschburg, respectively) derived from the Hungarian form. The Habsburg/Austrian authorities also used \"Temeschwar\", \"Temeswar\" or \"Temeschburg\", names that have become commonplace in current usage. The name of the city comes from the river which passes the city, Timi\u0219ul Mic (; ), hydronym which was in use until the 18th century when it was changed to Bega or Beghei.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Kingdom of Hungary (1212\u20131526) Eastern Hungarian Kingdom (1526\u20131551) Kingdom of Hungary (1551\u20131552) Ottoman Empire (1552\u20131716) Habsburg Monarchy (1718\u20131779) Kingdom of Hungary (1779\u20131849) Austrian Empire (1849\u20131867) Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918) Banat Republic (1918) Kingdom of Serbia (1918) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918\u20131919) Kingdom of Romania (1920\u20131947) Romanian People's Republic (1947\u20131965) Socialist Republic of Romania (1965\u20131989) Romania (1989\u2013present)\nEarly history.\nThe southeastern part of the Pannonian Basin is bounded by the Mure\u0219, the Tisza and the Danube; the region was very fertile and already offered favorable conditions for food and human livelihood in 4000 BC. Archeological remains attested the presence of a population of farmers, hunters and artisans, whose existence was favored by mild climate, fertile soil and abundant water and forests.\nThe first identifiable civilization in Banat were the Dacians who left traces of their past. Several Romanian historians have advanced the idea that the current location of Timi\u0219oara corresponds to the Dacian settlement of Zurobara. Although its location is unknown, the coordinates given by geographer Ptolemy in \"Geographike Hyphegesis\" place it in the northwest of Banat.\nMiddle Ages.\nIt is assumed that in the 9th century, Knyaz Glad ruled over these lands, accepting Hungarian sovereignty, though no contemporary accounts exist. Timi\u0219oara was first officially mentioned in 1212 as the Roman castrum \"Temesiensis\" or \"castrum regium Themes\". This year is disputed by historians of the opinion that the city's first documentary mention comes from 1266, when heir apparent Stephen V of Hungary donates part of the \"Tymes\" fortress, built by his father, B\u00e9la IV, to Count Parabuch. The city was destroyed by the Tatars in the 13th century, but the city was rebuilt and grew considerably during the reign of Charles I of Hungary, who, upon his visit there in 1307, ordered the strengthening of the fortress with stone walls and the building of a royal palace. The palace was built by Italian craftsmen and was organized around a rectangular court having a main body provided with a dungeon or a tower. He even moved the royal seat from Buda to Timi\u0219oara between 1316 and 1323. Timi\u0219oara's importance also grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain.\nBy the middle of the 14th century, Timi\u0219oara was at the forefront of Western Christendom's battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks. In 1394, the Turks led by Bayezid I passed Nagybecskerek (present-day Zrenjanin) and Timi\u0219oara on their way to Wallachia where they were defeated by Voivode Mircea the Elder in the battle of Rovine. Timi\u0219oara once again served as a concentration point for the Christian armed forces, this time for the battle of Nicopolis. After the Christians' defeat, the Ottomans devastated Banat to Timi\u0219oara, from where they were expelled by Count Istv\u00e1n Losonczy. Appointed Count of Timi\u0219 in 1440, John Hunyadi moved with his family to Timi\u0219oara, which he would turn into a permanent military camp. John Hunyadi would come to be known throughout the region for his victory in Belgrade over the Ottomans, considered at that time a defender of Christianity. An important event in the city's history was the peasant uprising led by Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa. On 10 August 1514 he tried to change the course of Bega River to be able to enter more easily into the city, but he was defeated by attacks from both inside and outside the city.\nOttoman rule (1552\u20131716).\nThe fall of Belgrade in 1521 and the defeat at Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 caused the division of the Hungarian Kingdom in three parts, and Banat became the object of contention between the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and Ottomans. After a failed siege in 1551, the Turks regrouped and returned with a new strategy. On 22 July 1552, a 160,000-strong army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha conquered the city and transformed it into a provincial capital in the newly established province of (Teme\u015fvar Eyalet). The Eyalet included most of Banat and southern Cri\u0219ana. Local military commander, Istv\u00e1n Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate. After the death of John Z\u00e1polya, Habsburgs tried to obtain Transylvania and Banat, including Timi\u0219oara, with mixed results; Transylvania even entered into dual vassalage for a time.\nTimi\u0219oara remained under the Ottoman rule for 164 years, controlled directly by the Sultan and enjoying a special status, similar to other cities in the region, such as Budapest and Belgrade. During this period, Timi\u0219oara was transformed into an Ottoman fortification, with mosques, minarets, Quran schools, Turkish baths, and bazaars being built. Timi\u0219oara became home to a large Islamic community and was predominantly populated by Muslims.\nThe Ottoman period of Timi\u0219oara produced famous historical figures, such as Osman A\u011fa of Teme\u015fvar and Ali of Teme\u015fvar.\nExcept for a period in the late 16th century, the city did not suffer sieges until the end of the 17th century. In 1594, Gregory Paloti\u0107, Ban of Lugos and Kar\u00e1nsebes, started an anti-Ottoman uprising in Banat, with its starting point in Nagybecskerek. Following a strong Transylvanian offensive led by Gy\u00f6rgy Borb\u00e9ly, the Christian army conquered several towns, but Timi\u0219oara remained untouched. Another attempt to retake the city took place in 1596, when an army of Sigismund B\u00e1thory began the siege of the city. After 40 days of futile efforts, the besiegers drew back.\nHabsburg rule (1716\u20131860).\nAfter the victory at Petrovaradin on 5 August 1716, the Austrian army led by Prince Eugene of Savoy decided to conquer Timi\u0219oara. The Ottoman military, the kuruc and the Turkish civilian population were forced to leave the city after a 48-day siege marked by repeated bombings that destroyed much of the city's buildings. After the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), the Banat of Temeswar became the province of the Habsburg monarchy and was proclaimed \"possession of the Crown\" with a military administration which ruled Timi\u0219oara until 1751 when it was replaced by a civil one.\nAfter the conquest of Banat, the imperial authorities in Vienna began an extensive process of colonization, inviting especially German Catholics from W\u00fcrttemberg, Swabia, Nassau, etc. who would become known as Banat Swabians. In Timi\u0219oara, the Swabians settled mainly in Fabric, where they strongly developed craftsmanship. The main function of Timi\u0219oara during this period was that of a military fortress. The existing fortifications could not cope with the new military techniques, so the entire fortress was rebuilt in a late, flat and inconsistent adaptation of the Vauban style. It had an area 10 times larger than the medieval Turkish fortress. Between 1728 and 1732, Bega River was regulated, creating a navigable canal.\nUnder the political pressure of the Hungarian Diet, the Viennese Imperial Court accepted that the three counties of Banat to be reincorporated into the Hungarian Kingdom, in 1779. In 1781 Joseph II declared Timi\u0219oara free from the county authority and, to prevent the nobles from interfering with the administration of the city, he raised it to the rank of a \"free royal city\". This status would secure Timi\u0219oara's internal self-government, the right to have representatives in the Diet and that of disposing its own revenues. The city was under siege in 1848 for 107 days. The Hungarians unsuccessfully tried to capture the fortress in the battle of Temesv\u00e1r. It was the last major battle in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. By the March Constitution, the region was incorporated to the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, which became a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The new imperial province, the existence of which had also been consecrated by the imperial decree of 18 November 1849, was ruled both militarily and civilly. Timi\u0219oara was designated as the residence of the governor, and the city maintained its privileges as a free royal city.\n19th\u201320th centuries.\nIn 1860, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, after the establishment of the dual monarchy. As part of Austria-Hungary, the city experienced a fast economic and demographic growth. Credit institutions invested large sums in the development of local industry; at the turn of the 20th century there were many enterprises here: two breweries, an iron foundry, a match factory, a brick factory, a gas factory, a chain factory, a hat factory, a chocolate factory, etc. In this period horse-drawn tram, telephone and street lighting were introduced and roads were paved.\nIn 1892, Emperor Franz Joseph I decided to abolish the fortress status of Timi\u0219oara. The demolition of the fortifications began in 1899. The main functions of the city thus became the economic ones, especially the commercial and banking ones.\nAfter World War I.\nOn 31 October 1918, local military and political elites established the Banat National Council, together with representatives of the region's main ethnic groups: Germans, Hungarians, Serbs and Romanians. On 1 November, they proclaimed the short-lived Banat Republic. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918 and 1919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King Ferdinand I awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Center, and the interwar years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of anti-fascist and anti-revisionist demonstrations also took place during this time.\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\nAfter the war, the People's Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietisation and, later, Systematisation. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialized both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture, etc.\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the Romanian Revolution. On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.\nGeography.\nTimi\u0219oara is located at the intersection of the 45th parallel north with the 21st meridian east. As a mathematical position, it is in the Northern Hemisphere, almost equally distant from the North Pole and the equator, and in the Eastern Hemisphere, using Central European Time. The local time of the city (considered after the meridian) is 1 h 25' 8\" ahead of the Greenwich Mean Time, but it is 34' 52\" behind the official time of Romania (Eastern European Time).\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of 90 meters on the southeast edge of the Banat Plain, part of the Pannonian Plain, near the divergence of the Timi\u0219 and Bega rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time and favored a wet and insalubrious climate, which spread plague and cholera and kept the number of inhabitants relatively low, preventing civic development. With time, these rivers were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to the hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the Timi\u0219 River, but on the Bega Canal. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. The city lies only 0.5 to 5 meters above the water table, which disallows the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.\nTaken as a whole, the relief of Timi\u0219oara appears as a relatively flat, monotonous surface, the smoothness of the surface interrupted only by the Bega riverbed. Researched in detail, the relief of the city and its surroundings presents a series of local peculiarities, represented mainly by deserted meanders, micro-depressions and ridges (generally made of coarse materials). These are the result of the deposits in the area of the Timi\u0219 and Bega rivers, before their drainage, regularization and damming (concretized altimetrically by modest bumps, which do not exceed anywhere, the interval of 2\u20133 m).\nSeismicity.\nTimi\u0219oara is a fairly active seismic center, but of the many earthquakes observed, few have exceeded magnitude 6 on the Richter scale. There are two active seismic faults that cross the western part of the city. The earthquakes recorded in the region are normal earthquakes, of crustal type, with depths of foci between .\nFlora and fauna.\nIn the past, there were extensive oak forests between the Tisza and Timi\u0219. Over time, they were cleared to obtain the wood needed to build the fortress and houses, as well as to gain arable land. Today, except for the areas forested with Turkey oak and Hungarian oak (Green Forest, Bistra Forest, Timi\u0219eni\u2013\u0218ag Forest), the territory falls within the anthropogenic forest steppe that characterizes the entire Pannonian Basin. The landscape is diversified by meadow vegetation, along the main rivers, in which softwood trees predominate: willows, poplars, alders. Within the city limits is the Green Forest (), a forest massif with an area of about , systematically arranged in squares of . The forest is man-made; first organization plans were carried out in 1860 by the Hungarian Forest Service. About southeast of Timi\u0219oara is the Bazo\u0219 Dendrological Park, a forest reserve which since 1994 has the status of protected area. The first trees of the reserve were brought in 1909 from the Harvard University nursery. Today, the reserve includes 800 different species of trees and shrubs and is part of the International Association of Botanical Gardens.\nThe fauna of Timi\u0219oara includes few mammals, represented only by a few insectivores and rodents. The birds, on the other hand, are numerous, some of which are of hunting importance (the pheasant). The urban wildlife, although less varied than the forest wildlife, has a higher number of species of hunting interest (rabbit, deer, quail, partridge, pheasant, hedgehog, etc.) and reptiles. In the parks of Timi\u0219oara there are hedgehogs, moles, tree frogs and a lot of birds. Regarding the piscifauna, the dominant species is the carp, along with which live breams, bleaks, roaches, zieges, pikes, natural support for sport fishing. Timi\u0219oara used to have the only zoo in western Romania, Timi\u0219oara Zoological Garden, but it was closed.\nHydrography.\nThe main watercourse is the Bega River, the southernmost tributary of the Tisza. Springing from the Poiana Rusc\u0103 Mountains, Bega is canalized, and from Timi\u0219oara to its outflow it was arranged for navigation (). The Bega Canal was built between 1728 and 1760, but its final arrangement was made later. The Bega Canal was designed for the access of barges of 600\u2013700 tons and an annual transport capacity of three million wagons.\nFrom the multitude of arms that existed before the canalization of Bega, only Bega Moart\u0103 (Dead Bega; in the Fabric neighborhood) and Bega Veche (Old Bega; to the west, flowing through S\u0103c\u0103laz) are preserved inside the city.\nIn addition to permanent courses and those that dry out, often during the summer, on the territory of Timi\u0219oara there are a number of lakes: either natural, formed instead of the old meanders or subsidence areas, such as those near Kuncz, Giroc, P\u0103durea Verde, etc., or of anthropic origin, such as those from Fratelia, Freidorf, Ciarda Ro\u0219ie, \u0218trandul Tineretului, etc. Timi\u0219oara's drinking water is provided by Lake Surduc, an anthropic lake (1976), the largest in Timi\u0219 County, located from the city.\nClimate.\nLike parts of Romania, Timi\u0219oara exhibits a transitional humid continental (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfb\") and humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\"), characteristic of the southeastern part of the Pannonian Basin, with some sub-Mediterranean influences.\nThe dominant air masses, during spring and summer, are the temperate ones, of oceanic origin, which bring significant precipitations. Frequently, even in winter, humid air masses arrive from the Atlantic, bringing significant rains and snows, less often cold waves. From September to February there are frequent penetrations of continental polar air masses, coming from the east. In Banat, the influence of cyclones and hot air masses from the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea is also strongly felt, which in winter generate complete thawing and in summer impose periods of stifling heat.\nThe average annual temperature was between 1991 and 2020. The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of . The lowest temperature recorded in Timi\u0219oara was , on 24 January 1963, while the highest temperature was , recorded in August 2017. The average number of frost days (with minimum temperatures below ) is 80, and the average number of winter days (with maximum temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0C) is 17. The average number of tropical days (with maximum temperatures above ) is 45.\nPredominantly under the influence of the maritime air masses from the northwest, Timi\u0219oara receives a higher amount of precipitation than the cities in the Wallachian Plain. The average amount of precipitation for the year in Timi\u0219oara is , falling on 87 days. The month with the most precipitation on average is June with 80.8\u00a0mm of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is February with an average of .\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom a demographic point of view, Timi\u0219oara is defined, according to the Zipf's law, as a second-tier city, along with Ia\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Cluj-Napoca and Bra\u0219ov, with extensive macro-territorial functions and having the second largest functional urban area, after Bucharest, of over . In 2013, Bucharest and Timi\u0219oara were also the only metropolitan European growth areas (MEGAs) in Romania. Nationally, Timi\u0219oara has been recognized as the largest polarizing center in western Romania.\nAccording to the 2021 census, the population of Timi\u0219oara amounted to 250,849 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2011, when 319,279 inhabitants were registered. However, these figures are questioned by local authorities and sociologists due to the defective way in which the census was conducted. According to the mayor's office and local population records, Timi\u0219oara numbers over 309,000 inhabitants as of 2023. The population of the city represents roughly 38% of the population of Timi\u0219 County, 15% of the population of the West development region and 1.3% of the total population of Romania. As defined by Eurostat, the Timi\u0219oara functional urban area has a population of 364,325 inhabitants (as of 2018).\nAccording to a study conducted by the World Bank, Timi\u0219oara was between 2001 and 2011 the regional city in Romania that attracted the highest number of in-migrants. Timi\u0219oara serves as an important polarizer of the labor force for other regions of the country, with a demographic surplus, especially for the counties in northern Moldavia, northwestern Transylvania and Oltenia. Timi\u0219oara manages to attract about 8,000 new inhabitants annually, most coming mainly from Timi\u0219 County, but also from smaller cities in neighboring counties \u2013 Cara\u0219-Severin, Hunedoara and Arad. In fact, 46.2% of the current population of Timi\u0219oara is made up of people who have moved here from elsewhere. In 2017, the former mayor Nicolae Robu stated that the city of Timi\u0219oara has an additional population of over 100,000 people compared to the officially registered residents. This includes students, workers, and other categories of floaters, who are not included in the statistical reports as they no longer acquire a residence visa.\nEthnic minorities.\nTimi\u0219oara has stood out since ancient times as an ethnically diverse city. In 1910, the largest community was represented by Germans, followed by Hungarians, Romanians, Jews, Serbs and many other smaller communities, such as Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Romas, Bulgarians, Poles, etc. The figures and percentage ratios are much changed today, but the multiethnic aspect of the city persists. Nowadays, 85% of the inhabitants are Romanians, while the minorities are much more diverse due to the presence of Asians, Italians, Muslims, and fewer Germans and Hungarians. Yet, in Timi\u0219oara live most Germans in Romania as share in the population of a city. The decline of German and Hungarian communities is mainly due to assimilation (for instance, 64% of Hungarians in Timi\u0219oara live in mixed marriages), migration and low birth rates. Timi\u0219oara is also home to an important Serb community, which in 2011 numbered almost 5,000 people. Many of them use Serbian as a second language, preferring Romanian. Serbian is more common among older generations educated in it.\nIn 2018, according to official data, over 7,000 foreigners lived in Timi\u0219oara. The actual figure is higher, given that many foreigners living in Timi\u0219oara do not apply for permanent residence, while spending most of their time in the city.\nLanguages.\nTimi\u0219oara's linguistic landscape is shaped by its complex historical, cultural, and demographic evolution. Romanian is the official and predominant language, spoken by the vast majority of the population. Reflecting the city's ethnic diversity, several minority languages continue to be present, including Hungarian, German, and Serbian, particularly within older generations and specific ethnic communities. Beyond these, languages such as Slovak, Bulgarian, and Romani have also been part of the city's linguistic fabric for centuries. While Yiddish, once widely spoken among the Jewish population, has nearly vanished, German dialects \u2013 especially those of the Swabian (\"Schw\u00e4bisch\") variety \u2013 remain in use in some communities. In recent decades, the city has experienced increased linguistic diversity due to new waves of migration. Additionally, foreign languages play a significant role in education and daily life: English is widely spoken by younger generations and in professional settings, while French, German, Italian, and Spanish are commonly taught in schools.\nReligion.\nAlthough much changed throughout its history, the religious composition of Timi\u0219oara is diverse. If in 1910 most of the inhabitants were Roman Catholics, in 2011 75% declared themselves Romanian Orthodox.\nIn Timi\u0219oara there are 80 churches, 12 of which were built after 1989; 41 belong to the Orthodox Church, eight to the Roman Catholic Church and three to the Greek Catholic Church. In addition, there are three synagogues in Cetate, Fabric and Iosefin neighborhoods, all three built before World War I, when Jews accounted for 10% of the city's population; the Orthodox synagogue in Iosefin and the central Neolog synagogue still hold regular religious services.\nTimi\u0219oara is the seat of the Archiepiscopate of Timi\u0219oara, the see of the Metropolis of Banat, as well as the seat of the Diocese of Timi\u0219oara, one of the six Roman Catholic dioceses in Romania.\nLaw and government.\nAdministration.\nThe first free local elections in post-communist Timi\u0219oara took place in 1992. The winner was Viorel Oancea, of the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), which later merged with the National Liberal Party (PNL). He was the first officer who spoke to the crowd of revolutionaries gathered in Opera Square. The 1996 elections were won by Gheorghe Ciuhandu, of the Christian Democrats (PN\u021a-CD). He had four terms, also winning elections in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Meanwhile, Ciuhandu took over the Christian Democratic Party and ran for president of Romania in 2004. Nicolae Robu (PNL) was elected mayor in 2012 and again in 2016. In 2020, Dominic Fritz, a native of Germany, was elected mayor on behalf of the USR with support from the FDGR. He won a new mandate in 2024 on behalf of the United Timi\u0219oara Alliance (USR\u2013PMP\u2013FD\u2013UDMR).\nThe Local council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population. Decisions are discussed and approved by the Local Council () made up of 27 elected councilors. After the 2024 local elections, the Local Council has the following composition by political parties:\nAdditionally, as Timi\u0219oara is the capital of Timi\u0219 County, the city hosts the Administrative Palace, the headquarters of the County Council () and the prefect, who is appointed by Romania's central government. The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of national development plans and governing programs at the local level.\nIn 2003, neighborhood advisory councils were set up as a measure to improve local government consultation with citizens on local public policies. As of 2013, Timi\u0219oara had 20 neighborhood advisory councils.\nTimi\u0219oara is the informal capital of the West development region, which is equivalent to NUTS-II regions in the European Union and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and coordination of regional development projects. The West development region is not an administrative entity. Timi\u0219oara is also the largest economic, social and commercial center of the DKMT Euroregion.\nDistricts.\nTraditionally, Timi\u0219oara was divided into ten constituencies () that today have no administrative function:\nIn addition to the above, a number of new neighborhoods have emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries:\n\"Listed alphabetically\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMetropolitan area.\nThe Timi\u0219oara metropolitan area was outlined in 2008 following the collaboration of the local authorities from Timi\u0219oara and 14 neighboring communes (Becicherecu Mic, Bucov\u0103\u021b, Dude\u0219tii Noi, Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Ghiroda, Giarmata, Giroc, Mo\u0219ni\u021ba Nou\u0103, Or\u021bi\u0219oara, Pi\u0219chia, Remetea Mare, S\u0103c\u0103laz, S\u00e2nmihaiu Rom\u00e2n and \u0218ag). The Timi\u0219oara metropolitan area is part of the Federation of Metropolitan Areas and Urban Agglomerations in Romania (FZMAUR). As of 2016, the metropolitan area groups over 410,000 inhabitants on an area eight times larger than the city proper.\nSeveral localities neighboring Timi\u0219oara have experienced a significant development in recent years. Ghiroda, Giroc, Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Chi\u0219oda, Mo\u0219ni\u021ba Nou\u0103 and Utvin became suburbs of Timi\u0219oara due to the development of facilities, utilities and infrastructure, territorially joining the city. In the last 20 years, Timi\u0219oara has expanded its borders by about 8%, which means about 1,000 hectares, due to the construction of new neighborhoods or residential complexes. The city limits were moved outwards in 2006 by almost . The largest expansion took place towards \u0218ag.\nTimi\u0219oara\u2013Arad metropolis.\nIn August 2016, mayors Nicolae Robu and Gheorghe Falc\u0103 signed the deed of establishment of the Timi\u0219oara\u2013Arad metropolis, the first of its kind in Romania, part of the integrated development strategy \"Timi\u0219oara Vision 2030\", carried out with the support of the World Bank, ADR Vest and FZMAUR. The project has been under discussion since 2006 and involved the unification of the metropolitan areas of Timi\u0219oara and Arad. In 2018, the population of the metropolis was 805,000 and is expected to exceed one million by 2030.\nJustice system.\nTimi\u0219oara has a complex judicial structure due to its role as the capital of Timi\u0219 County. The local judicial body is the Timi\u0219oara Court of Justice, which operates under the authority of the Timi\u0219 County Tribunal. This tribunal also oversees the courts in Lugoj, Deta, S\u00e2nnicolau Mare, and F\u0103get. Appeals and more serious cases from these courts are handled by the Timi\u0219oara Court of Appeals. Additionally, the city is home to the county's commercial and military tribunals.\nTimi\u0219oara maintains its own municipal police force, \"Poli\u021bia Municipiului Timi\u0219oara\", which is responsible for law enforcement throughout the city and operates several specialized divisions. The headquarters is located on Andrei Mocioni Street near the city center, with five precincts distributed across the city. The municipal police operate under the authority of the County Police Inspectorate, based on Take Ionescu Boulevard. Additionally, the City Hall runs its own community police force, \"Poli\u021bia Prim\u0103riei\", which focuses on local community matters. Timi\u0219oara is also home to the County Gendarmerie Inspectorate.\nAlthough the Romanian Police reported a relatively high local crime rate of 799 incidents in 2024, Timi\u0219oara nevertheless continues to rank among the safest urban areas in Romania.\nEconomy.\nTimi\u0219oara is one of the most dynamic economic centers in Romania. Based on its proximity to the western border, Timi\u0219oara has managed to attract many foreign investments in recent years, forming, together with Arad, the second largest area in Romania in terms of economic mass. By the mid-2000s, the foreign investments in Timi\u0219oara amounted to \u20ac753 per capita, compared to \u20ac450 per capita at county level. Most of these investments come from the EU countries, especially from Italy, Germany and France. Similar to other growth poles in Romania, the services sector has developed significantly in recent years, accounting for half of the revenues.\nAfter the fall of communism and the transition to a market economy, the private sector grew steadily. In the first decade of the 21st century, Timi\u0219oara has experienced an economic boom as the amount of foreign investment, especially in high-tech sectors, has risen. In an article in late 2005, French magazine \"L'Expansion\" called Timi\u0219oara Romania's economic showcase, and referred to the increased number of foreign investments as a \"second revolution\". In 2016, Timi\u0219oara was awarded by Forbes as the most dynamic city and the best city for business in Romania. Between 2000 and 2013, Timi\u0219oara had the highest growth rate of GDP per capita, surpassing even Bucharest. The local economic development has been reflected accordingly in the unemployment figures. For instance, in December 2019, the unemployment rate in Timi\u0219oara was among the lowest in the country, with only 0.8%.\nIndustrial sector.\nAfter 1989, major changes took place in the structure of industrial activities in Timi\u0219oara due to the restructuring and retrofitting processes, industrial production currently including both traditional sub-branches and new, modern and dynamic ones. Unlike cities such as Cluj-Napoca, Ia\u0219i or Bucharest, the localization of industry within the city is specific to Timi\u0219oara. The main industrial groups in the city can be structured in three types: urban industrial areas, with large area and complex profile (Calea Buzia\u0219ului, Freidorf, pericentral area along the railway, Calea \u0218agului, etc.), industrial platforms with unitary profile (UMT and Solventul) and dispersed industrial units, respectively. In recent decades, industrial areas have developed along major road or rail arteries, with a tendency to group units by industrial profiles.\nThere are eight industrial zones in Timi\u0219oara where factories and plants cover several sectors from electronics, chemical and automotive to food processing and textile industries.\nBuzia\u0219ului industrial area concentrates units for chemical industry and production of automotive and electronic components. The area has seen an important development in recent years, attracting major investments from Procter &amp; Gamble, Continental, Dr\u00e4xlmaier, Elbromplast, AEM, Saguaro, etc. In 2013 Optica Business Park was inaugurated here. Developed on the old buildings of the former lens factory, Optica Business Park offices have attracted tenants such as Microsoft, Linde or ZTE. \u0218agului industrial area includes warehouses of construction materials (Arabesque, Arthema, Lipoplast, Mobexpert, etc.), as well as a significant number of showrooms and car dealers (Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Citro\u00ebn, Opel, etc.). An important role in the development and diversification of the profile of the area is played by the Incontro Industrial Park, where construction companies are mainly located. Calea \u0218agului has also become an important commercial area, with hypermarkets such as Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t, Auchan, Jysk, Metro or Leroy Merlin. Stretched on a usable area of 63 ha, Freidorf Industrial Park is an important area for attracting foreign investment, encouraging business development and creating new jobs. The automotive components industry predominates in the area (Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ContiTech, ELBA, etc.). In the UMT industrial area are located mainly chemical and automotive industry units (Continental, Linde, Hella, etc.), but also warehouses. Torontalului industrial area includes units for manufacturing industry (Flex, Coca-Cola, SCA, etc.). The Timi\u0219oara Technology and Industrial Park was arranged here, with the aim of supporting the development of SMEs in fields such as software, IT and communications or electronics and electrical engineering. Aradului industrial area is the newest industrial area, with various locations for storage and provision of services. Like Calea \u0218agului, the Aradului area has become an important commercial hub, retailers like Selgros, Hornbach, Altex or Auchan operating here.\nThe main industrial branches, which have experienced an important growth in Timi\u0219oara, are the automotive industry, the chemical and petrochemical industry, as well as the electronics industry. The automotive components industry has registered a strong development in recent years, as a consequence of the need for technological development within existing industrial units, in Timi\u0219oara concentrating renowned companies in this field (Dr\u00e4xlmaier, Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ContiTech, TRW Automotive, Mahle, Hella, Dura, Valeo, Autoliv, Honeywell, etc.). In 2016, a competence center for automotive engineering \u2013 CERC \u2013 was inaugurated in the Freidorf area. This economic branch has old traditions. Between 1988 and 1991, the Romanian car model Dacia 500 L\u0103stun was made in the Tehnometal factories.\nThe electronics and electrical engineering industry is a successful branch of Timi\u0219oara's industry, especially due to the investments of large companies with activities in high tech production (Flex, Bosch, ABB, AEM, ELBA, Ericsson, etc.), which determined a development of local companies, suppliers or subcontractors.\nThe chemical and petrochemical industry, traditional in Timi\u0219oara, has developed especially through the investments made by Continental, Procter &amp; Gamble and Azur.\nAlong with large investors from the top industries mentioned above, in Timi\u0219oara are concentrated a large number of companies, especially small and medium enterprises, in traditional fields such as textile and clothing industry, textile manufacturing and leather and footwear industry, foreign investors interested in these sectors mainly due to low production costs.\nOffice sector.\nThe office sector has boomed in the last decade, the stock of class A offices available for rent reaching 290,000 m2 in 2020, almost 10% of Bucharest's stock. The return on investment in office buildings exceeds the level in Bucharest (7%), standing at around 8.25%. The city has the lowest vacancy rate of class A office spaces, 5% in 2014.\nCity Business Center is the main office park in Timi\u0219oara, located in the city center. Completed in 2015, the complex is fully leased, with tenants including international companies such as Accenture, SAP, Deloitte, Wipro, IBM, Visma, Hella, etc. Named the greenest office project in Romania by BREEAM, Vox Technology Park was completed in early 2018. Bega Business Park is located near the historic center. The first two buildings were completed in 2015 and early 2018, respectively, and are fully occupied by Nokia's campus. Under construction are ISHO Offices, part of a larger project, and United Business Center. The latter will include the tallest office building in Romania (155 m).\nIT&amp;C sector.\nAt national level, Timi\u0219oara is one of the poles of the most intense activities in the IT industry. Well-known companies such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Siemens, Nokia, Huawei, Atos, Accenture, Endava, Bitdefender or Visteon have offices in the city, supporting \u2013 through the hubs and the digital workshops created \u2013 start-ups and SMEs in the field. Before the rapid expansion of Cluj-Napoca, Timi\u0219oara concentrated the most IT professionals after Bucharest. In 2014, Timi\u0219oara had 7,000 employees in the field. In the same year, the Incuboxx cluster was inaugurated. Incuboxx is the largest IT&amp;C business incubator in Romania, which includes 54 office spaces addressed to entrepreneurs and companies with local capital in the field.\nTimi\u0219oara ranks 394th in the 2019 Innovation Cities Index, an annual list of the world's most innovation-friendly cities. Bucharest and Timi\u0219oara are the only Romanian cities on the list published by the World Economic Forum.\nReal estate sector.\nThe real estate market in Timi\u0219oara, supported by the upward economic trend, has been booming lately. In 2017, about 4,000 living spaces were delivered to the market, an increase of almost 60% compared to the previous year, most of the projects representing high-rise residential complexes, addressed to the mass and mid-market segments. In the first nine months of 2016, according to the National Agency for Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising, over 32,000 sale/purchase transactions were concluded, making Timi\u0219 County the largest real estate market in Romania after Bucharest\u2013Ilfov. 87% of them took place in Timi\u0219oara and neighboring communes. Among the largest residential complexes in Timi\u0219oara are ISHO, Adora Forest, Vivalia Grand, XCity Towers, Vox Vertical Village, Ateneo and City of Mara.\nAfter 1989 the rural areas within the city became \"hot spots\" for housing investors, and the emergence of the middle class after 2000 changed both the landscape and the prices of houses and land. In 2020, for example, the price of an apartment reached 1,300 euros/m2, the third-highest among Romanian big cities, after Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest. On the other hand, the phenomenon of gentrification renewed a part of the underused housing stock.\nCommercial sector.\nBega Shopping Center is the only shopping center in the center of Timi\u0219oara and the first in the city. Bega Shopping Center is structured on six levels and has a leasable area of 7,500 m2, of which 1,300 are allocated to a Carrefour supermarket. Bega Group, the holding company that owns Bega Shopping Center, has opened three other retail parks in Buzia\u0219ului, Circumvala\u021biunii and Lipovei.\nIulius Mall was inaugurated in October 2005. Following an investment by Iulius Group and Atterbury Europe, Iulius Mall has been integrated into a large urban regeneration project \u2013 Iulius Town, complementing it with retail, office and entertainment functions. Iulius Town has the largest shopping area in Romania (120,000 m2), a space that brings together over 450 stores. The estimated annual traffic for Iulius Town is over 20 million visitors.\nThe second mall, Shopping City, opened in March 2016. The shopping center has a leasable area of 70,000 m2, covering almost 20 ha and comprising 110 stores on two levels. Within Shopping City, the largest Cinema City multiplex outside Bucharest was opened in April 2016, with 13 3D rooms, an IMAX room and a 4DX room. In the first year since its opening, Shopping City had a traffic of over nine million visitors.\nThe first strip mall in the city, Funshop Park, opened in 2022. Built on the former industrial platform of Azur, Funshop Park has a leasable area of 10,800 m2 and is provided with an outdoor food court area.\nAlong with the existing stores in the central area, new supermarkets have been opened by national and international concerns such as Selgros, Metro, Auchan, Kaufland, Carrefour, Lidl, Penny, Mega Image or Profi. On the bricolage and DIY market are present the stores of Dedeman, Hornbach, Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t, Arabesque, Leroy Merlin, Mobexpert, M\u00f6max, Jumbo and Decathlon, among others, part of local and international chains.\nTourism.\nTimi\u0219oara is the central point of tourism in the region, attracting 80% of its tourists. In the first half of 2017, Timi\u0219oara and its surroundings attracted just over 50,000 foreign tourists to the third most visited region in Romania, after Bucharest\u2013Ilfov and Bra\u0219ov. Recreational tourism (such as city breaks and visits to friends and relatives) accounts for the largest share, followed by business and study tourism. The majority of tourists are young, well-educated individuals, primarily from Romania and other European countries.\nIn 2013, in Timi\u0219oara there were 107 accommodation units (comprising 49 hotels, seven hostels, 50 pensions, and an international campsite) totaling 5,547 accommodation places.\nEducation.\nPre-university education.\nPreschool education takes place in 70 kindergartens; the primary education in 47 schools; the secondary education in 36 high schools; the post-secondary education in 11 post-secondary schools; and the master workman education in six foreman schools. The school network also includes two special high schools for students with disabilities, three schools of inclusive education, five seminaries, a special school for students with amblyopia, two educational assistance centers and a Waldorf high school. The private education system includes an international school and high school with teaching according to the British curriculum, an English-language kindergarten and primary school, as well as a nursery and kindergarten with teaching according to the Finnish curriculum.\nThe specificity of pre-university education in Timi\u0219oara is the diversity of teaching languages. The city's rich multiethnic tradition has been maintained by the schools with teaching in Hungarian (B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k High School), German (Nikolaus Lenau High School), English (William Shakespeare High School), French (Jean-Louis Calderon High School) and Serbian (Dositej Obradovi\u0107 High School).\nAccording to a ranking made by the \"AdmitereLiceu.ro\" portal in 2020, five high schools in Timi\u0219oara are among the top 100 high schools in Romania: Grigore Moisil High School, Constantin Diaconovici Loga National College, National College of Banat, Carmen Sylva National Pedagogical College and Nikolaus Lenau High School.\nHigher education.\nHigher education has a tradition of over 100 years, with the establishment of the Polytechnic University in 1920. From then until today, Timi\u0219oara has become the most important university and academic center in western Romania, with about 40,000 students enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate study programs in four public and two private universities. There are branches of the National Alliance of Student Organizations in Romania and AIESEC. Student organizations are very active, known for events such as StudentFest, the largest international student art and culture festival in Southeast Europe or the ten-day International Student Week.\nThe Polytechnic University is one of the largest and most famous technical universities in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2011 it was classified by the Ministry of Education in the category of universities of advanced research and education, the highest position that a university in Romania can reach. In the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings, the Polytechnic University is on the third place among the Romanian universities with research activity. Established by royal decree in 1944, the West University is the largest university in the city in terms of student numbers. The West University is one of the five members of the Universitaria Consortium, the group of elite Romanian universities. In 2018, the West University was present in 19 international rankings of universities, one of the top-ranked in Romania. One of the six medical universities in Romania is located in Timi\u0219oara \u2013 the Victor Babe\u0219 University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The fourth public university in Timi\u0219oara, specialized in life sciences and veterinary medicine, is the King Michael I University of Life Sciences.\nThe student campuses are located in Complexul Studen\u021besc\u2013Medicinei (25 dormitories), Lipovei\u2013Tipografilor (six dormitories) and Bla\u0219covici (two dormitories), offering a total of about 13,000 accommodation places. Complexul Studen\u021besc in particular is known for its nightlife, with several pubs, bistros, nightclubs and themed bars concentrated here.\nThere are several public libraries, municipal or university, most importantly:\nScientific research.\nSeveral institutes operate within the Timi\u0219oara branch of the Romanian Academy: the National R&amp;D Institute for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter, the National R&amp;D Institute for Welding and Materials Testing, the Titu Maiorescu Institute of Banat Studies, the Coriolan Dr\u0103gulescu Institute of Chemistry and the Astronomical Observatory.\nIn the patrimony of the West University there are several research centers, such as: the Institute of Advanced Environmental Research, the Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen Interdisciplinary Training and Research Platform, the Creation Center of Contemporary Visual Arts, the Research Laboratory in Structural and Computational Chemistry\u2013Physics for Nanosciences and QSAR, the Research Center in Criminal Sciences, the East European Center for Research in Economics and Business, the Center for Romance Studies, the Research Center in Computer Sciences, the Center for Social Research and Development, the Institute of Socio-Political Research, etc. Also in Timi\u0219oara there are branches of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academy of Technical Sciences, respectively.\nThe first computer built in Romania (1961) was put into operation within the Polytechnic Institute of Timi\u0219oara, nowadays the Polytechnic University. It was called MECIPT, an acronym for \"Electronic Computing Machine of the Polytechnic Institute of Timi\u0219oara\" (). Its design was started in 1956 by a team led by mathematician Iosif Kaufmann, electronic engineer Wilhelm L\u00f6wenfeld and student Vasile Baltac.\nOut of the 1,700 members of the Romanian Academy, from 1866 until 2016, 102 members come or have worked in Banat and the surrounding areas. Among them are Traian Vuia, the inventor of the first tractor monoplane, Traian Lalescu, one of the fathers of integral equations, Dumitru Prunariu, the first Romanian to fly in space and Stefan Hell, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nIn the second half of May, biannually, the Timi\u0219oara branch of the Romanian Academy organizes, collaborating and involving the local academic, cultural and scientific community, the Timi\u0219oara Academic Days.\nHealthcare.\nDue to the specialized university programs, Timi\u0219oara is a research center in the fields of medicine and public health; there are branches of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Student Society of Surgery, the headquarters of the Romanian Hemophilia Association, the Romanian Society of Medical Informatics and the Romanian Society of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology, as well as the regional training center in emergency medicine, operated by SMURD.\nIn Timi\u0219oara there are eight hospitals, seven publicly owned and one private:\nThere are also: six integrated specialized outpatient clinics (four public and two private); three ambulance services (one public and two private); 494 dental offices; 229 family medicine offices; 138 specialized offices; seven medical expertise offices and 24 work capacity recovery offices; 39 school dispensaries; 11 student dispensaries; a sports dispensary; 63 pharmacies and 32 pharmaceutical warehouses.\nTransport.\nTimi\u0219oara is an important regional road and railway hub, connecting the city to Bucharest and other major cities, as well as Romania to Hungary and Serbia, and further to Western Europe. It is located along the Pan-European Corridor IV linking Germany to Turkey and has access, thanks to the Bega Canal, to the Pan-European Corridor VII. Furthermore, Timi\u0219oara is crossed by two TEN-T core network corridors: Orient/East\u2013Med and Rhine\u2013Danube (waterway focus).\nRoad transport.\nThe street plot of Timi\u0219oara is composed of 1,278 streets totaling almost . The street network is based on a radial model, consolidated by a series of five concentric rings, none of them completely built. Unlike other cities of similar size, there is no predominant corridor in terms of loading, with traffic volumes distributed fairly evenly across a series of radial and circular arteries. The shape of the road network outside the city is web-like, all the main roads in the county converging towards the capital city.\nIn the northern part of the city there is a bypass; its southern extension is currently under construction. The city is crossed in the northeast by the A1 motorway, a segment that continues with the M43 motorway in Hungary. The A1 is connected near Lugoj to the A6 motorway, which is under construction.\nTimi\u0219oara is connected to the European and national road network by the following roads:\nLocally, car transport experienced a boom after 1990, so that in 2017 the degree of motorization in Timi\u0219oara was among the highest in Romania, with one car for every 2.66 inhabitants. Timi\u0219oara has one of the most extensive infrastructures for charging electric cars and plug-in hybrids in Romania, with 16 stations located throughout the city and a hub in 700 Square.\nPublic transport.\nTimi\u0219oara's public transport network consists of nine tram lines, eight trolleybus lines and 31 bus lines and is operated by STPT (Societatea de Transport Public Timi\u0219oara). The network covers all the important areas of the city and it also connects Timi\u0219oara with some of the communes of the metropolitan area. 45% of urban public transport is served by trams, 22% by trolleybuses, 18% by buses and the remaining 15% by water buses and alternative means of transport. In 2019, Timi\u0219oara became the second city in Romania to introduce public school transport, after Cluj-Napoca; as of 2020, it is served by 14 lines.\nTimi\u0219oara has a well-developed market for taxi services. There are also several car rental companies. Alternatively, short- and long-distance carpooling platforms operate in Timi\u0219oara, such as Uber, Bolt or BlaBlaCar.\nFor internal coach transport there are several coach stations, most located around the Timi\u0219oara North railway station and on Stan Vidrighin Way. There are also daily coach trips to destinations in Europe, served by private passenger transport companies, such as Atlassib, Eurolines or Flixbus.\nRail transport.\nTimi\u0219oara has the oldest and the densest railway network in Romania, with over of lines for of territory, although some of the components are no longer operational due to low demand and lack of maintenance. Therefore, Timi\u0219oara is the most important rail hub in Timi\u0219 County and in western Romania. Most of the railway lines that intersect in Timi\u0219oara are secondary lines; the most important are line 900 from Bucharest, with international connections to Serbia and the main line Timi\u0219oara\u2013Arad\u2013Oradea, which ensures the connection with line 200 (Bra\u0219ov\u2013Sibiu\u2013Arad\u2013Curtici) and, implicitly, with Hungary.\nThe city has five stations (Timi\u0219oara North, Timi\u0219oara West, Timi\u0219oara South, Timi\u0219oara East and Timi\u0219oara CET) and a triage station (Rona\u021b Triaj). The main passenger station is Timi\u0219oara North, built in 1897 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation since 2021. The old station building, built in neoclassical style, was badly damaged by the Allied bombing of 1944, so it was rebuilt in socialist classical style. Timi\u0219oara North is one of the busiest stations in Romania, with an average of 174 passenger trains/day and a flow of 5,530 passengers/day.\nAlthough the nature of freight traffic has changed, decreasing the requirement for maneuvering and recomposing trains, Timi\u0219oara is an important center for rail freight transport; there are several large industrial concerns that receive and ship goods by train.\nAir transport.\nLocated from Timi\u0219oara, in the northeastern part of the city, Traian Vuia International Airport is the fourth-busiest Romanian airport in terms of passenger numbers (~1.2 million in 2022) and the most important air hub in the DKMT Euroregion. In 2017, it became the first airport in Romania certified by EASA. In 2018, Traian Vuia International Airport attracted 15.1% of the total number of passengers embarked at Romanian airports, 32.8% of the total tons of goods loaded and 13.2% of the total number of flights. Traian Vuia International Airport serves as an operational base for Wizz Air. As of 2021, the airport is undergoing expansion works, by adding two terminals \u2013 internal arrivals and external departures \u2013 and creating an intermodal center for freight transport.\nThe city's first airport, the Cioca Airfield, had remained in use for recreational and utility aviation.\nWater transport.\nThe Bega Canal is the first navigable canal built in Romania, connecting Timi\u0219oara with the Serbian town of Titel. Its total navigable length was , of which on the Romanian territory. In 2018, repair works were started on the navigation infrastructure of the Bega Canal, which would allow the resumption of naval traffic between Timi\u0219oara and Serbia, halted in 1967.\nSince 2018, Timi\u0219oara is the first Romanian city with urban public transport by water, made with vaporetto-like boats on a single line with six stations.\nCycling and micromobility.\nTimi\u0219oara has the most developed integrated cycling system in Romania. Cyclists have access to more than of bike lanes, including outside the city via the Bega Canal cycle path, which connects Romania with Serbia, providing a direct connection to the European network of cycling routes \u2013 EuroVelo. Timi\u0219oara is the first city in Romania with a public bike-sharing system, VeloTM, inaugurated in 2015. The system has 440 bicycles in the 25 stations in the city and, depending on the season, is accessed by 1,000\u20131,500 people daily.\nIn 2019, Timi\u0219oara introduced public transport with electric scooters.\nArchitecture.\nTimi\u0219oara has the largest architectural ensemble of historic buildings in Romania (around 14,500), consisting of the urban patrimony of the neighborhoods of Cetate, Fabric, Iosefin and Elisabetin. Most of these buildings are part of the imperial heritage, a period of economic prosperity that left its mark on the city. The architectural diversity, represented by baroque, historicism, neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Wiener Secession, earned Timi\u0219oara the nickname \"Little Vienna\". The oldest building in Timi\u0219oara is Huniade Castle, which today houses the Museum of Banat. Destroyed during the siege of 1849, the castle was later rebuilt, but still retains elements of the former castle built by John Hunyadi between 1443 and 1447, but also elements from the period of Charles I of Hungary.\nTimi\u0219oara is a city with a polynuclear urban structure. The current urban structure, the result of historical evolution, is relatively clear: in the middle of the urban agglomeration is the historic center (Cetate neighborhood) around which the other neighborhoods revolve. Due to their independent development, they have distinct features both functionally and architecturally. The center of today's Timi\u0219oara is the \"successor\" of the Austrian military fortress built mostly between 1732 and 1761. Today, only a few parts of the old city wall remain standing, namely the Theresia Bastion in the east and a few others which are located on the western limit of the old city wall. These were later listed as part of the architectural heritage of Timi\u0219oara.\nTimi\u0219oara is regarded as a city with strong potential for densification, thanks to its numerous vacant lots and buildable areas located right in the city center\u2014an advantage that other cities of similar size in the country lack. As a result, the city experienced few major demolitions during the communist era and has largely retained its original radial-concentric urban structure.\nHistoric neighborhoods.\nCetate.\nThe Cetate neighborhood, the political, administrative and cultural center of Timi\u0219oara, is divided into two distinct urban areas. The first area is the \"inner city\" of the 18th and 19th centuries. The whole area has the status of heritage site. The area houses the oldest buildings of the city, dating from the 18th century. The second area was established after 1900 on the lands liberated by the demolition of the fortifications. Construction in this area followed the trend at the time, the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\" style. The Secessionist school of Banat was influenced by both Austrian and Hungarian styles, resulting from the direct participation of some architects from Budapest on various representative buildings. This style underwent two different stages: the first occurred approximately between 1900 and 1908 and was similar to Art Nouveau, with floral and curvilinear decorations, while the second, which continued until World War I, saw simpler, larger buildings with geometrical designs, similar to Viennese architecture at the time. Due to the fact that secessionism existed in Timi\u0219oara only between 1900 and 1914, its influence on more modest buildings was not as strong as that of eclecticism. If eclecticism became a true art of the masses, used in all buildings, secessionism remained a style of the elites, which penetrated Banat through cult architecture.\nThe historic center of Timi\u0219oara has a system consisting of three urban squares, unique in Romania, each square presenting different sizes, plastic solutions and architectural styles. Union Square (), built in baroque style, is the oldest square in Timi\u0219oara. It is also called Dome Square (), because it houses the Roman Catholic Dome, built in 1774. The middle of the square is dominated by the Plague Column. On the southern side of the square is the Baroque Palace, designed after the Palais Kinsky in Vienna, which today houses the Art Museum. On the western side are the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral and the Serbian Orthodox Episcopal Palace, representative of the neo-Serbian style.\nVictory Square (), also known as the Opera Square (), is the central square of Timi\u0219oara. The entire square was designed by the then chief architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00e9kely, educated in Budapest, but a great admirer of Austrian architecture. The square was completely pedestrianized in the late 1980s, with the removal of tram rails. Spatially, the square stretches between the Metropolitan Cathedral and the Palace of Culture which houses the National Theater and Opera. Although built around the same time, the two belong to diametrically opposed styles. The Opera building was built in Renaissance style. Today, only its sides retain this style, the facade rebuilt after a fire in the neo-Byzantine style characteristic of Romanian interwar architecture. The Metropolitan Cathedral is the largest religious building in Timi\u0219oara and the second tallest church in Romania, after the People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest. It stands out for its massiveness, having no less than 11 bell towers and architectural style, unusual for a 20th-century building, inspired by the architecture of Moldavian monasteries. The promenade side from the Opera to the cathedral is called Corso and houses several 1900s style palaces (Lloyd, Neuhaus, Merbl, Dauerbach, Hilt and Sz\u00e9chenyi); the opposite side, Surogat, houses two palaces (L\u00f6ffler and Chamber of Commerce) and several modernist blocks of flats. In the middle of the square are the statue of the Capitoline Wolf and the fountain with fish.\nTo the north of Victory Square is Liberty Square (). Formerly called the Parade Square (), the square houses several buildings with military functions: the Garrison Command, former Chancellery of War, the Military Casino, etc. The Military Casino is built in baroque style with some Rococo influences. The other buildings are in the classic style, in the 1900s style \u2013 szecesszi\u00f3 movement and in other styles. Liberty Square is the pedestrian link between Union Square and Victory Square. In the extension of the Liberty Square there is a smaller square, St. George Square (), known in the past as Seminar Square (). Its eastern side was formed by the Jesuit Church, transformed into a mosque during the Ottoman occupation and demolished during the modernization works provided in the urbanistic plan of 1911 (in its place was built the Szana Bank). The walls of the former church were brought to the surface in 2014. The square is dominated by the equestrian statue of Saint George fighting the dragon, built in 1996. It is one of several monuments erected in the 1990s in parts of the city where people were killed during the Romanian Revolution. In this square, the first horse-drawn tram was set in motion in July 1869.\nFabric.\nThe Fabric neighborhood has earned its name from the many manufactories, workshops and guilds established here. The neighborhood is bordered by the Neptune Baths, the Timi\u0219oara East railway station, the waterworks and the Timi\u0219oreana breweries. In the center of the neighborhood is Trajan Square (). This is a smaller replica of the Union Square; both are rectangular and flanked on the eastern side by a religious building. The oldest building in Trajan Square is the Serbian Orthodox Church, built between 1745 and 1755 in the classicist style. Most of the buildings in the square were built at the end of the 19th century and belong to different movements of the Art Nouveau style. In Romans' Square () is the Millennium Church, a historicist building with neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque elements.\nIosefin.\nAt the beginning, the Iosefin neighborhood had a rural character, with isolated houses, similar to the Banat Swabians plain villages. The houses had only one level and, for the most part, had facades decorated with pediments. The rural character of the neighborhood is maintained until 1857, when Timi\u0219oara is connected to the railway system of Central Europe. Then, in the northern part of Iosefin, the first railway station of the city was built. Apart from the St. Mary Catholic Church, which was built between 1774 and 1775, all the buildings in Iosefin are built after 1868, most of which were built around 1900. Thus, in this area, there are numerous buildings in eclectic historicist style, specific to the second half of the 19th century, as well as several architectural ensembles in the 1900s style with its specific stylistic derivations \u2013 Art Nouveau, Jugendstil or Secession. Representative for this style are the historical monuments from urban ensembles IV and V: the Water Palace, the D\u00e9lvid\u00e9ki Casino, the former House of Savings, the Anchor Palace, the twin palaces of N\u00e1ndor and Tam\u00e1s Cserm\u00e1k, the Notre Dame Church, the Water Tower, etc.\n16 December 1989 Boulevard forms the traditional historical border between the Iosefin and Elisabetin neighborhoods. Along it are a series of Art Nouveau palaces (Besch\u2013Piffl, Kuncz, Menczer, etc.), as well as the 1900s-style Fire Station. The boulevard divides Alexandru Mocioni Square () into two unequal parts, the triangular one (formerly called K\u00fcttl Square and Sinaia Square) belonging to Iosefin. The square is flanked by the Orthodox Church, built in neo-Byzantine style and inspired by Hagia Sophia, in contrast to the Art Nouveau architecture of the surrounding buildings.\nElisabetin.\nLike the Iosefin neighborhood, Elisabetin had a rural appearance for a long time. Only after 1892, with the dismantling of the military fortress, Elisabetin experienced a strong development. Only two buildings have been preserved in Elisabetin since the 18th century: Dissel House and the Orthodox Church in the Church Square, the oldest Romanian church in Timi\u0219oara. Although it is a protected historical area, the urban ensemble I of Elisabetin is affected by the so-called urban sprawl. Many ground floor houses, typical of the historical urban morphology of the neighborhood, have been transformed into multi-story buildings. The buildings in the urban ensemble VIII date from 1890 to 1900. Some belong to the classicist style, while others fall into the eclectic historicist style, especially the neo-baroque movement.\nOne of Elisabetin's squares of historical importance is Mary Square (), dominated by the neo-Romanesque monument of St. Mary. According to tradition, Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa, the leader of the peasant uprising of 1514, was martyred in this place. Other squares in Elisabetin are the Nicolae B\u0103lcescu Square () with its 57-meter-high Catholic Church and the smaller Pleven Square (), surrounded by an ensemble of Art Nouveau residential buildings (the House with Peacocks, the Szil\u00e1rd House, the House with Beautiful Gate, etc.).\n1919\u20131947: Neo-Romanian architecture.\nThe neighborhoods of individual villas, the houses with several apartments and the religious and socio-cultural endowments dating from the first half of the 20th century, especially from the interwar period, predominate in the interstitial spaces between the historic neighborhoods, giving the respective areas the aspect of a garden city.\nThe architecture of the new buildings erected in the interwar period kept some decorative elements widespread at the beginning of the 20th century, but the neo-Romanian style, then the modernist and cubist ones, became more and more popular. More and more projects have been entrusted to Romanian architects, from Timi\u0219oara or Bucharest. Outside the former walls of the fortress and in Elisabetin, numerous villas were built in which the influence of the modern style, of the Br\u00e2ncovenesc style as well as the French influences are predominant, but also public buildings, emblematic for the new architectural line. In the interwar years, important buildings of the city were built according to the plans of the Bucharest architect Duiliu Marcu: the new facade of the Theater, the main building, the student dormitory and the laboratories of the Polytechnic Institute, the Capitol cinema, etc.\nThe neo-Romanian style was consciously promoted by the state. Like secessionism, the neo-Romanian style remained a style of elites that did not influence in any way the architecture of the more modest buildings that were built in large numbers in the interwar period.\n1947\u20131989: Socialist classicism.\nDuring the communist period, like other cities in Romania, Timi\u0219oara strictly followed the Soviet style. The architects did not have creative freedom, because the ministry imposed a firm control and an austerity regime, with small budgets. The evolution of the postwar architecture of the city was strongly influenced by the activity of the architect Hans Fackelmann, who designed, among others, the West University, one of the first modern constructions in Romania and the Ion Vidu National Art College.\nDespite the central policy of urban systematization, which saw entire historic neighborhoods demolished, such as the Uranus neighborhood in Bucharest, the Timi\u0219oara authorities did not demolish old buildings, but only \"filled in\", where there were no buildings. Thus were built the two blocks that close the front of Victory Square, on its eastern side, towards the Metropolitan Cathedral. In the late 1960s, the Communist Party called for the construction of a number of commercial venues, hotels, houses of culture, stadiums and sports halls in major cities. It was the period when the Bega store, the Continental and Timi\u0219oara hotels, the Youth House, the Modex fashion house, the Olimpia hall and others were built in Timi\u0219oara.\nThe communist era also meant the growth of the population of Timi\u0219oara, by moving the workers brought from all over the country. Thus arose the need for new neighborhoods. Between 1974 and 1988, huge bedroom neighborhoods were built, consisting of blocks of flats with four, eight or ten floors, made of large prefabricated panels. At the end of the 1980s, over two thirds of the population of Timi\u0219oara lived in such suburbs: Circumvala\u021biunii, \u0218agului, Lipovei, etc. The blocks had the technical-municipal installations necessary for housing, but they were poorly executed in the conditions of a pronounced economic decline.\nPost-revolution architecture (1990\u2013present).\nThe reconnection, after 1989, of the Romanian architecture to the European architectural culture proved to be very difficult. Most of the projects and constructions did not yet have enough substance or inertially continued the decorativism of the previous period. Re-established in 1990 as a department within the Faculty of Constructions, the Timi\u0219oara school of architecture brought together architects from the late 1980s who, embracing the theoretical discourse of postmodernism, perpetuated the arts and crafts philosophy of the previous generation, either by a subtle return to historical tradition (\u0218erban Sturdza, Mihai Botescu or Radu Radoslav), or through a critical regional approach (Vlad Gaivoronschi, Ioan Andreescu or Florin Iona\u0219iu). Constructions such as Austria House (Mihai Botescu), BRD Tower (Radu Radoslav), City Business Center (Vlad Gaivoronschi) or Reghina Blue Hotel (Ioan Andreescu) are linked to their names.\nSimilar to other Romanian cities, Timi\u0219oara underwent large-scale de-/reindustrialization and tertiarization after 1989, which shaped its current urban landscape. The 2008\u20132009 real estate crisis led to a change in the economic behavior of both investors and home buyers. Post-crisis, a number of peripheral real estate projects have been abandoned, and investors and home buyers have shifted their interest to the available plots within the city. As a result of the economic restructuring process during the 2000s, many industrial areas or isolated factories were demolished and their place was taken by residential complexes and shopping malls.\nThe 2010s represented a decade in which the city acquainted a period of urban development rebirth. Projects such as Iulius Town and ISHO were put on the map under the form of edge cities indicating the growth of the urban tissue and implicitly of the facilities of the city.\nCulture.\nVisual arts.\nIn Timi\u0219oara there are eight contemporary art galleries, five of which are publicly funded: the Pygmalion Gallery (House of Arts), the geamMAT Gallery of the Art Museum, the Helios Gallery (Fine Artists' Union), the Mansarda Gallery (Faculty of Arts and Design) and the City Hall Gallery.\nPerforming arts.\nTimi\u0219oara is the only city in Europe that has three state theaters in three different languages \u2013 the Mihai Eminescu National Theatre, the German State Theatre and the Csiky Gergely Hungarian State Theatre. The three theaters and the National Opera are housed in the Palace of Culture, built between 1871 and 1875 according to the plans of the Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, who designed, among others, the Stadttheater in Vienna, the N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z in Budapest and the Opera Theater in Odesa. In 2012, the National Theater built and put into operation the Set Factory, the first professional production line of stage props and theater equipment in Romania. Since 2019, the Serbian language theater has been operating within the Merlin Puppet and Youth Theater.\nThe Romanian National Opera as an institution in its current form has existed since 1947, when the Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Aida\" opened its first season, on 27 April.\nLiterature.\nLiterary life has been revitalized in Timi\u0219oara over the last decade: open, public readings of prose and poetry have turned into social-literary experiments and two new literary festivals have been launched \u2013 LitVest and Timi\u0219oara International Literature Festival.\nThe literary society \"Aktionsgruppe Banat\", founded by German-speaking authors of the Banat Swabian minority, was active in Timi\u0219oara between 1972 and 1975. Many of its members also activated in the \"Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn\" circle, which included, among others, Herta M\u00fcller, Horst Samson and Werner S\u00f6llner. A recognized literary figure of the underground in Timi\u0219oara in the 1980s, Herta M\u00fcller was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2009.\nMusic.\nBefore having a proper musical society, in Timi\u0219oara there was the choral association \"Temeswarer M\u00e4nnergesangverein\", founded in 1845. The repertoire of this choir included works of great popularity, belonging mainly to German romantic music. The Philharmonic Society was founded later, in 1871, as a men's choral society. The inaugural concert took place on 8 December and included the ballads \"Die Frithjof-Saga\" by Max Bruch and \"Der Taucher\" by Heinrich Weidt. Over the years, guest musicians of the Philharmonic Society were invited to perform in Timi\u0219oara, among them Franz Liszt, Johann Strauss II, Joseph Haydn, Pablo de Sarasate, Henryk Wieniawski, Johannes Brahms and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. The current Banatul Philharmonic was founded in 1947 by royal decree. The Philharmonic has been organizing the Timi\u0219oara Muzical\u0103 International Festival since 1968, the longest-running cultural festival in Timi\u0219oara.\nGastronomy.\nThe cuisine of Timi\u0219oara has been greatly shaped by Austro-Hungarian traditions, as well as by Greek, Italian, Turkish and French influences. In Banat, dishes are typically made with pork, chicken, beef, lamb, or fish, accompanied by vegetable sides fried in lard or oil. Flour-based sauces like r\u00e2nta\u0219 are often used to thicken the dishes, which are generously seasoned with a variety of spices such as pepper, salt, thyme, paprika, rosemary, cumin, or aromatic herbs.\nThe cuisine of Banat as a whole is characterized by fatty, nutritious, and tasty dishes. Rasol with bone, steaks, papricache, tochituri, goulash, aspic, stuffed peppers, fish brine, plachie, drob, soups, broths, sarmale, fresh pork prepared and semi-prepared foods (barbeque, schnitzel, sausage, caltabo\u0219, pastrami, ham, sl\u0103nin\u0103, jum\u0103ri, salami, tob\u0103, or cracklings), cheeses (ca\u0219, telemea, or urda), and desserts (gombo\u021bi, cozonac, crempita, crofne, dobo\u0219, scovergi, pl\u0103cint\u0103 or papana\u0219i) are just some of the traditional dishes that are consumed on holidays, at special events, but also on ordinary days.\nThe presence of Hungarian, Serbian, German, Slovenian, and Turkish minorities, as well as other ethnic groups over time, has ensured the continuity of international cuisine in the city. There are bars, cafes, and restaurants, serving dishes such as \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i, pljeskavica, goulash, Viennese schnitzel, bigos, sp\u00e4tzle or fisherman's soup, desserts such as vargab\u00e9les, baklava, kadayif, pala\u010dinka, cremeschnitte, tiramisu, apple strudel or plum dumplings, and pastries such as pretzel, chebureki, pirozhki, halva, burek, kifli, poga\u010da, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, or l\u00e1ngos.\nDue to the fast pace of urban life and easy access to a wide range of delivery and catering services, many Timi\u0219oara residents also show a notable preference for fast food. This trend is highlighted by the presence of restaurant chains and establishments offering quick dishes, from shawarma, kebab, burgers, fries, rice, or noodles to pizza, hot dog, grill, salads, sandwiches, or pastries and confectionery, consumed alongside juices, energy drinks, or soft drinks.\nEvents such as \"Banat Brunch\" or \"Mic Dejun la Margina\" (\"Breakfast at Margina\"), which celebrate the culinary richness and traditions of Banat cuisine, are popular events in the local gastronomic landscape.\nMuseums.\nThe Art Museum is housed in the Baroque Palace, a Late Baroque building in the Union Square. The exhibition space includes collections of contemporary, decorative and European art. Founded in 1877 and housed in the Huniade Castle, the National Museum of Banat has as fields of activity history and archeology. On the ground floor of the museum there is a reconstruction of the Par\u021ba Neolithic Sanctuary dating from the 6th millennium BC. \nThe Banat Village Museum is conceived as a traditional village from Banat, a living museum and open-air folk architecture reserve located in the Green Forest; it includes rustic households belonging to various ethnic groups in Banat, buildings with social function of the traditional village (town hall, school and church), technical installations and workshops. The Corneliu Miklosi Public Transport Museum is subordinated to the local public transport company.\nVarious types of trams are on display, including the first horse-drawn tram and the first electric tram in the city, as well as buses, trolleybuses and vehicle maintenance equipment. There are plans to integrate the museum into a center for art, technology and experiment \u2013 MultipleXity. Founded in 1964, the Military Museum operates in the Military Casino in Liberty Square. The museum's patrimony consists of over 2,000 exhibits: maps, documents, models of historical monuments, photographs, weapons and military uniforms. In the museum collections owned by the Metropolis of Banat, the Serbian Orthodox Episcopate and the Roman Catholic Diocese there are objects of worship, icons on wood and glass from the 16th\u201319th centuries, books, manuscripts and old church objects. A future museum dedicated to the Romanian Revolution will be arranged in the building of the former Military Garrison. At present, there is a Memorial of the Revolution, in the collection of which there is written, audio and video information about the events of 1989.\nIn addition, there are several independent museums in Timi\u0219oara, including the Museum of the Communist Consumer, arranged as a typical house of the Golden Age, the museum dedicated to the Romanian cartoonist Popa's and the Kindlein Museum, a reenactment of Peter Kindlein's jewelry and clock shop and workshop.\nFestivals.\nIn 2013, around 400 cultural manifestations and events (shows, concerts, exhibitions, art and literature salons, festivals, etc.) were organized in Timi\u0219oara. Some of these include the music festivals Codru, DISKOteka (largest 1980s and 1990s music festival in Europe), Flight (largest music festival in western Romania), JAZZx, Plai and Vest Fest, the film festivals Ceau, Cinema!, European Film Festival and Festival du Film Fran\u00e7ais, the theater festivals Eurothalia, FEST-FDR and TESZT, LitVest (literature festival), the Medieval Festival, the Festival of Hearts (festival of world folklore) and Timi\u0219oara Pride Week. The latter was first organized in 2019; it has since become one of the best-attended public events among young people in Timi\u0219oara.\nParks and green spaces.\nTimi\u0219oara is known as the \"city of parks\" for its parks and green spaces. These are mainly located around the old town, forming a green belt along the Bega Canal. At the end of 2009, the area of the city parks was 117.57 ha. In 2015, Timi\u0219oara had 16 m2 of green spaces per capita, under the EU recommendation of 26 m2.\nOne of the most famous parks in Timi\u0219oara is the Anton Scudier Central Park, founded in 1850. Since 2009, the park has an Alley of Personalities with 24 bronze statues of local personalities. In 2019 the park was redesigned in the style of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Gardens in Vienna. Also close to the city center is the Rose Park, which at the beginning of the 20th century earned Timi\u0219oara the nickname \"city of roses\". The park was inaugurated in 1891 on the occasion of an agro-industrial exhibition, and all the arrangements were made by landscape architect Wilhelm M\u00fchle. The English- and French-style garden stretched over 9 ha and was visited by Emperor Franz Joseph I on 16 September 1891. The current park was arranged between 1928 and 1934, when it was the largest rosary in Southeast Europe, with 1,200 species and varieties of roses. In the park there is also the stage of the summer theater where several festivals, concerts and shows take place. Opposite the Rose Park is the Ion Creang\u0103 Children's Park. It was inaugurated in the same year as the Rose Park. The delimitation of the two parks was made later, when the area was crossed by the current Michelangelo Street. In 2012 it was redesigned as the largest children's playground in the city.\nQueen Marie Park, formerly known as the People's Park, is the oldest park in Timi\u0219oara, established at the initiative of the governor of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, Count Johann von Coronini-Cronberg, in 1852. The Botanical Park, improperly called by the locals the Botanical Garden, is thought of as a dendrological park and was inaugurated in 1986, after a project by the architect Silvia Grumeza. The park contains collection species grouped in eight sectors, depending on the region of origin of the plant. One of the newest parks, the Civic Park was arranged over the former military barracks, demolished between 1956 and 1959. The main attraction of the park is the floral clock, built in 1971.\nSports.\nThe amateur and performance sports activity has an old tradition in Timi\u0219oara through sports associations and clubs. The first football game in Timi\u0219oara took place on 25 June 1899. Three years later, CA Timi\u0219oara \u2013 the first football club in Romania \u2013 was founded. Traditional teams have been active between the two world wars. Ripensia Timi\u0219oara, founded in 1928 and dissolved in 1948, was the first Romanian club to turn professional. In its short history, the club has won four national titles and two national cups. Ripensia Timi\u0219oara was re-established in 2012 and currently plays in Liga 2. Chinezul Timi\u0219oara (), active between 1910 and 1946, was one of the most successful teams in the history of Romanian football, winning between 1921 and 1927 six consecutive titles of champion of Romania. There are four football clubs: ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara, ASU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara, CFR Timi\u0219oara and Ripensia Timi\u0219oara. SCM Timi\u0219oara, a multi-sport club, was founded in 1982 and includes sections for basketball (BC Timi\u0219oara), handball (SCM Politehnica Timi\u0219oara), rugby (Saracens Timi\u0219oara), motorcycling and tennis.\nWith a capacity of 32,000 seats, Dan P\u0103ltini\u0219anu Stadium, home stadium of ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara, is the second largest stadium in Romania, after Arena Na\u021bional\u0103 in Bucharest. The current stadium will be demolished in 2021; a multifunctional sports complex with a 36,000-seat arena and a 16,000-seat multipurpose hall will be built in its place. There are three other smaller stadiums: CFR's CFR Stadium near Timi\u0219oara North railway station, ASU Politehnica's \u0218tiin\u021ba Stadium on the campus of the Polytechnic University and Ripensia's Electrica Stadium near the Green Forest.\nThere are many sports centers in the city as well. Most of these facilities are sports halls and swimming pools, many of them built by the municipality in the past several years. The main indoor venue is Constantin Jude Sports Hall, formerly known as Olimpia Hall. Used as a local base for men's and women's basketball, volleyball, handball and futsal teams in the city, the hall hosted matches of EuroBasket Women 2015.\nMass media.\nPrint media.\nThe first newspaper printed in Timi\u0219oara in 1771, edited by typographer Matthias Joseph Heimerl, was called \"Temeswarer Nachrichten\" and appeared in 13 editions. Between 1830 and 1849, \"Temeswarer Wochenblatt\" appeared, whose editor was Joseph Klapka, the founder of the first circulating library in the Habsburg monarchy (1815) and mayor of Timi\u0219oara between 1819 and 1833. Between 1872 and 1918 the Hungarian-language newspapers \"D\u00e9lmagyarorsz\u00e1g\" and \"Temesv\u00e1ri hirlap\" appeared. The Serbian minority first appeared on the local media market in 1829 with the \"Banatski almanah\" (). The first Romanian-language newspapers published in Banat were printed in Vienna and then in Pest, as happened with \"Luminatorul\" led by Vincen\u021biu Babe\u0219. During the mid-19th century, there was a branch of the state printing house in Vienna, and in 1878 Prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, fleeing from Serbia, opened a printing house in Iosefin, which he used exclusively for political purposes. The printing activity was boosted at the end of the century, when the manual printing machines, driven by a distribution wheel, were replaced by those driven by electricity, after the establishment of the power plant. The first machine of this kind in Timi\u0219oara was a Druckmaschine belonging to the episcopal printing house in the Diocese of Cenad, which was inaugurated in 1891. The outbreak of World War I led to a stagnation of printing activity, but, after the city was taken over by the Romanian authorities, it was revived; in 1920 no less than nine printing houses were known in Timi\u0219oara.\nThe interwar years were marked by numerous political, humorous, medical, cultural, economic, religious, agricultural, commercial or almanac weeklies. Also in the interwar period, numerous bilingual or even trilingual publications appeared. The first publication in Romanian, German and Hungarian was the monthly \"Apicultorul \u2013 Bienenz\u00fcchter \u2013 M\u00e9h\u00e9sz\". In addition to the publications in the languages spoken in Timi\u0219oara, between 1930 and 1936 the Esperanto quarterly \"Urmiginta Statoj de Europe\" appeared, edited by Josef Zauner, and in 1932 the publication \"Tel-Chaj\" (\u05d8\u05dc \u05e6\u05f3\u05d2) was registered, a Jewish bimonthly in Hungarian, but no number appeared. From a catalog prepared by Florian Moldovan and Alexander Krischan, in the documentary fund of the County Library of Timi\u0219oara were registered in the early 1970s no less than 143 newspaper and magazine titles, of which 60 were Romanian, 39 Hungarian and 40 German.\nAfter 1945, but especially since 1948, the number of newspapers and magazines was reduced to a few, all published or under the political control of the Communist Party. There were the following papers in Timi\u0219oara between 1970 and 1977: \"Drapelul ro\u0219u\", \"Neue Banater Zeitung\" (German language), \"Szabad sz\u00f3\" (Hungarian language), \"Banatske novine\" (magazine, Serbian language) and the literary revue \"Orizont\", all of them with an important circulation. Even if the years of 1965\u20131971 are better known as providing a relative political freedom, press in Romania went away with the PCR control. Media was obliged both to put in light the socialist reality in Romania and to combat the ideological bourgeois influences and retrograde mentality. The cultural revues had to promote the \"involved\" militant socialist arts and literature and criticize the tendencies to separate the artistic creation from the socialist realities; it was the way the Romanian press became an instrument of the PCR.\nApart from the publications previously censored under communist rule, which quickly changed their orientation under new names, in the first months after the Romanian Revolution, the number of newspaper and magazine titles on the local press market increased dramatically.\nCurrently, in Timi\u0219oara appear:\nIn recent years, more and more publications have given up the printed version, continuing their activity only in the online version.\nAudiovisual media.\nRadio stations.\nRadio Timi\u0219oara, a public station, is part of Radio Rom\u00e2nia Regional, the network of local and regional public radios of the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company. The idea of building a radio station in Timi\u0219oara was advanced for the first time in July 1930. The first broadcast of Radio Timi\u0219oara dates from 5 May 1955, with Andrei D\u00e2ng\u0103 and Emilia Culea as broadcasters. Today, Radio Timi\u0219oara broadcasts in 10 languages on four frequencies that cover a large part of the counties in western Romania. West City Radio has been broadcasting since 1995, when it received the first broadcasting license in western Romania. The station is addressed to an audience aged between 24 and 48 years. Another local private radio station is Radio Europa Nova, founded in July 1995. Its broadcasting area covers around the city.\nIn recent years, numerous local stations of some national stations have appeared, such as Digi FM, Europa FM, Virgin Radio, Radio Impuls, Radio ZU, RFI Rom\u00e2nia, Pro FM, Kiss FM, Radio Guerrilla, etc.\nTelevision stations.\nTVR Timi\u0219oara is one of the four territorial studios of the Romanian Television Society. It broadcasts since 17 October 1994 and covers the western part of Romania (Timi\u0219, Arad, Cara\u0219-Severin and Hunedoara counties), as well as the Romanian communities in Vojvodina (Serbia) and southeastern Hungary. TVR Timi\u0219oara is a member of CIRCOM Regional and has collaborated over the years with regional public televisions in Novi Sad (Serbia), Szeged (Hungary) and Uzhhorod (Ukraine). Teleuniversitatea (Teleuniversity) has the status of a department within the Polytechnic University, obtaining a broadcasting license in 1994. Teleuniversitatea is a television station with educational objectives, which operates on a non-profit basis, without a budget allocation. TV Europa Nova is the only local private television station. It first aired on 1 May 1994.\nNotable people.\nHonorary citizens.\nAmong the recipients of the honorary citizenship of Timi\u0219oara are:\nInternational relations.\nTimi\u0219oara hosts two general consulates, representing Germany and Serbia. The German consulate is situated in the Flavia Palace on Splaiul Tudor Vladimirescu, whereas the Serbian consulate is located at 4 Remus Street.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nTimi\u0219oara is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60818", "revid": "14231332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60818", "title": "Freidorf", "text": "Freidorf (German for \"free village\"; ; ) was one of the first German settlements in Temes County in the Banat, Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, it became part of Romania; since 1950 it is a district of the city of Timi\u0219oara, located on the southwest outskirts of the city. Freidorf maintains historic architecture, old Banat Swabian houses, and many green spaces.\nHistory.\nTraces of Eneolithic habitation have been discovered here since the second half of the 19th century. More recent research has attributed them to the Tiszapolg\u00e1r and Baden cultures with Co\u021bofeni influences.\nAccording to Hungarian historian Dezs\u0151 Cs\u00e1nki, there would have been another village here in the Middle Ages, first mentioned as \"Zabadfalua\" in 1369, when it was in the possession of a certain Nexa family from D\u00e9lvid\u00e9k and the B\u00e9s\u00e1ns of Belin\u021b.\nGerman colonization.\nThe current Freidorf was originally a German settlement, founded in 1723 and exempt from taxes, which gave it the name Freidorf (\"free village\" in German). The first settlers came from Alsace, from a village also called Freidorf. They built here a church (1735), a school and a windmill. Initially it was a rather small village, built on the estate of Count Franz Paul von Wallis, commander of the Timi\u0219oara Fortress (1716\u20131729) after the capitulation of the Ottomans following the siege of 1716, with about 500 inhabitants and little arable land. In 1730, Wallis was transferred to Transylvania, on which occasion the tax office bought back the count's estates and Freidorf was obliged to pay taxes.\nAlthough the place was not attractive, being surrounded by swamps, and the living conditions were precarious, the authorities' plans for Freidorf were increasingly ambitious. Colonization continued in 1732, when silk craftsmen from Italy were brought here. A significant enlargement also took place in 1764, under the Temesv\u00e1r district chief Knoll.\n1848 revolution.\nFreidorf also played an important role during the Hungarian Revolution (1848\u20131849). The city of Timi\u0219oara was besieged by Hungarian troops, but its military leadership remained loyal to the Austrian emperor. The leader of the Hungarian army, J\u00f3zef Bem, set up camp in Freidorf. He settled in the parish house, while his aides stayed in other houses in the village. Among them was Hungarian national poet, S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi, who was promoted to major in the military camp between Timi\u0219oara and Freidorf. In 1889, a monument dedicated to S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi was unveiled. The park that exists today bears his name, and every year, on 15 March, hundreds of Hungarians gather to lay wreaths at the monument.\nDemographic evolution.\nBy 1741, 37 families lived in Freidorf. In 1836, the population was decimated by a cholera epidemic, and starting with 1850, Hungarian and Romanian families began to move into the village. They mainly focused on growing vegetables, raising animals and producing bricks, all production being destined for the expanding nearby city.\n20th century.\nThe initial efforts to annex Freidorf to Timi\u0219oara began during the interwar period. In 1928, Freidorf was linked to the city's electricity network, and on 1 December of the same year, Timi\u0219oara decided to assume responsibility for the \"sanitary and police measures, as well as sewerage and lighting\" of the suburban communes located within a 5 km radius, including Freidorf.\nThe village was officially annexed to Timi\u0219oara in 1950. During the communist period, a large industrial platform was built in the area, towards Utvin, which included the Sugar Factory, the Oil Factory and Comtim, and around it several blocks for workers. Also here is the wastewater treatment plant, which was built according to the plans of architect Stan Vidrighin and is still in operation today, since 1912.\nTransport.\nRail transport.\nRail transport is over a century old in Freidorf. Timi\u0219oara\u2013Modo\u0219 railway line was inaugurated on 31 July 1897. At that time, it was very important because it connected Timi\u0219oara and Zrenjanin, the largest city in Serbian Banat. The first station that Freidorf had (the one put into use in 1897, in the same year as the railway), and which still exists today, is located 340 m southwest of the new station and was built during the 1970s. Currently, the railway that passes through Freidorf is the Timi\u0219oara\u2013Cruceni railway (CFR Line 926).\nOver time, the station has had several names, depending on the political-historical context. Thus, at the time of the inauguration of the line, the station was called \"Szabadfalu\" (this being the official name of the locality at that time). In the interwar period, the station in Freidorf was called \"S\u00e2mb\u0103ta Station\", as appears in the Romanian Railways Maps of 1921 and 1938. After World War II, it was known as \"Freidorf\"; this name was later changed to the current form \u2013 \"Timi\u0219oara West\".\nShipping.\nThe first record of the Bega Canal section at Freidorf dates back to 1796. The condition of the canal is described by the pontoon corporal, Franz Ulrichsberger, in a report of 20 October 1796, written in Timi\u0219oara following an inspection carried out by order of the Banat General Military Command: \"From Temeswar to Freidorf you can navigate the canal with full load. From Freidorf to Deutschsanktmichael, the fully loaded vessels cannot pass, only if they will be partially unloaded, the cause of the slightly lower water level being that in several places the canal has up to 86 embankments.\"\nNaval transport, although currently very poorly developed, is still practiced on the Bega Canal. In the past, heavy beet barges came to the canal for the Banat Sugar Factory. The peasants were also brought from the villages on the Bega by various ships to trade the fruits and vegetables in Timi\u0219oara. Currently, the works that were started at the Bega Canal, aim to reopen the navigation.\nDuring the interwar period, a small shipyard also operated in Freidorf.\nRoad transport.\nThe car transport is very developed, Freidorf being crossed by the county road 526 that connects the Timi\u0219oara with Utvin and S\u00e2nmihaiu Rom\u00e2n, then continuing to the border with Serbia.\nIn the past, public transport was provided by tram line 3, which was dismantled in November 2009. Today, Freidorf has the E7 and E7b bus lines.\nFreidorf Industrial Park.\nFreidorf Industrial Park was established in 1999 by a decision of the Local Council. Developed on a total area of 63 ha, the park has attracted over the years companies such as ContiTech, Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ELBA, Smithfield, etc.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are produced and stored in the pituitary gland of the brain. Endorphins are endogenous painkillers often produced in the brain and adrenal medulla during physical exercise or orgasm and inhibit pain, muscle cramps, and relieve stress.\nHistory.\nOpioid peptides in the brain were first discovered in 1973 by investigators at the University of Aberdeen, John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz. They isolated \"enkephalins\" (from the Greek ) from pig brain, identified as Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin. This came after the discovery of a receptor that was proposed to produce the pain-relieving analgesic effects of morphine and other opioids, which led Kosterlitz and Hughes to their discovery of the endogenous opioid ligands. Research during this time was focused on the search for a painkiller that did not have the addictive character or overdose risk of morphine.\nRabi Simantov and Solomon H. Snyder isolated morphine-like peptides from calf brain. Eric J. Simon, who independently discovered opioid receptors, later termed these peptides as endorphins. This term was essentially assigned to any peptide that demonstrated morphine-like activity. In 1976, Choh Hao Li and David Chung recorded the sequences of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-endorphin isolated from camel pituitary glands for their opioid activity. Li determined that \u03b2-endorphin produced strong analgesic effects. Wilhelm Feldberg and Derek George Smyth in 1977 confirmed this, finding \u03b2-endorphin to be more potent than morphine. They also confirmed that its effects were reversed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist.\nStudies have subsequently distinguished between enkephalins, endorphins, and endogenously produced true morphine, which is not a peptide. Opioid peptides are classified based on their precursor propeptide: all endorphins are synthesized from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC), encoded by proenkephalin A, and dynorphins encoded by pre-dynorphin.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"endorphin\" is derived from / meaning \"within\" (endogenous, / , \"proceeding from within\"), and morphine, from Morpheus (), the god of dreams in the Greek mythology. Thus, endorphin is a contraction of 'endo(genous) (mo)rphin' (morphin being the old spelling of morphine).\nTypes.\nThe class of endorphins consists of three endogenous opioid peptides: \u03b1-Endorphin, \u03b2-endorphin, and \u03b3-endorphin. The endorphins are all synthesized from the precursor protein, proopiomelanocortin, and all contain a Met-enkephalin motif at their N-terminus: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. \u03b1-endorphin and \u03b3-endorphin result from proteolytic cleavage of \u03b2-endorphin between the Thr(16)-Leu(17) residues and Leu(17)-Phe(18) respectively. \u03b1-endorphin has the shortest sequence, and \u03b2-endorphin has the longest sequence.\n\u03b1-Endorphin and \u03b3-endorphin are primarily found in the anterior and intermediate pituitary. While \u03b2-endorphin is studied for its opioid activity, \u03b1-endorphin and \u03b3-endorphin both lack affinity for opiate receptors and thus do not affect the body in the same way that \u03b2-endorphin does. Some studies have characterized \u03b1-endorphin activity as similar to that of psychostimulants and \u03b3-endorphin activity to that of neuroleptics separately.\nSynthesis.\nEndorphin precursors are primarily produced in the pituitary gland. All three types of endorphins are fragments of the precursor protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC). At the trans-Golgi network, POMC binds to a membrane-bound protein, carboxypeptidase E (CPE). CPE facilitates POMC transport into immature budding vesicles. In mammals, pro-peptide convertase 1 (PC1) cleaves POMC into adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin (\u03b2-LPH). \u03b2-LPH, a pituitary hormone with little opiate activity, is then continually fragmented into different peptides, including \u03b1-endorphin, \u03b2-endorphin, and \u03b3-endorphin. Peptide convertase 2 (PC2) is responsible for cleaving \u03b2-LPH into \u03b2-endorphin and \u03b3-lipotropin. Formation of \u03b1-endorphin and \u03b3-endorphin results from proteolytic cleavage of \u03b2-endorphin.\nRegulation.\nNoradrenaline has been shown to increase endorphins production within inflammatory tissues, resulting in an analgesic effect; the stimulation of sympathetic nerves by electro-acupuncture is believed to be the cause of its analgesic effects.\nMechanism of action.\nEndorphins are released from the pituitary gland, typically in response to pain, and can act in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the PNS, \u03b2-endorphin is the primary endorphin released from the pituitary gland. Endorphins inhibit transmission of pain signals by binding \u03bc-receptors of peripheral nerves, which block their release of neurotransmitter substance P. The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In turn, inhibition of GABA increases the production and release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward learning.\nFunctions.\nEndorphins play a major role in the body's inhibitory response to pain. Research has demonstrated that meditation by trained individuals can be used to trigger endorphin release. Laughter may also stimulate endorphin production and elevate one's pain threshold.\nEndorphin production can be triggered by vigorous aerobic exercise. The release of \u03b2-endorphin has been postulated to contribute to the phenomenon known as \"runner's high\". However, experimental blockade of the mu opioid receptor has shown that endorphins are not strictly necessary for the development of exercise-induced euphoria. It has been suggested that other neurotransmitters, namely endocannabinoids, are more likely contributors. Endorphins may partially mediate exercise-induced analgesia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean, which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336\u2013323 BC).\nBorn in Alexandria, Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes, who named her his heir before his death in 51 BC. Cleopatra began her reign alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII, but a falling-out between them led to a civil war. Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt after losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus against his rival Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, in Caesar's civil war. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII had him ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy XIII's forces besieged Cleopatra and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers, and maintained a private affair with Cleopatra which produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44\u00a0BC, where she stayed at Caesar's villa. After Caesar's assassination, followed shortly afterwards by the sudden death of Ptolemy XIV (possibly murdered on Cleopatra's order), she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.\nIn the Liberators' civil war of 43\u201342\u00a0BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar's heir Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41\u00a0BC, the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. Antony became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various territories under Antony's authority. Octavian portrayed this event as an act of treason, forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32\u00a0BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31\u00a0BC Battle of Actium, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30\u00a0BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. After his death, Cleopatra reportedly killed herself, probably by poisoning, to avoid being publicly displayed by Octavian in Roman triumphal procession.\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include Roman busts, paintings, and sculptures, cameo carvings and glass, Ptolemaic and Roman coinage, and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art, she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, burlesque satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning \"glory of her father\", from (, \"glory\") and (, \"father\"). The masculine form would have been written either as () or (). Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister Cleopatra of Macedonia, as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology, Cleopatra Alcyone. Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra's adopted title () means \"goddess who loves her father\".\nBackground.\nPtolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis, but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria, established by Alexander the Great. They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language. In contrast, Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language. Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian, the language of the \"Troglodytes\", Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, the \"Syrian language\" (perhaps Syriac), Median, and Parthian, and she could apparently also speak Latin, although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek. Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\nRoman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra. When her grandfather Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III. With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II, an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla. Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination. Ptolemy XI, and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I, willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans, giving the Romans legal grounds to take over Egypt, their client state, after the assassination of Ptolemy XI. The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX, bestowing Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes and Cyprus on another namesake son.\nBiography.\nEarly childhood.\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia. Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC. The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.\nReign and exile of Ptolemy XII.\nIn 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected. Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC. However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.\nIn 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos. Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which, along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans, damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies. Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force, traveling first to Rhodes, then Athens, and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills, near Praeneste, Italy.\nPtolemy XII spent roughly up to a year there on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra, then about 11. Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy, an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters. When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.\nThe Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power. Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius, the Roman governor of Syria, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000 talents for the proposed mission. Although it put him at odds with Roman law, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea, where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean, father of Herod the Great, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies. As a young cavalry officer, Mark Antony was under Gabinius's command. He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion, and for rescuing the body of Archelaos, the husband of Berenice IV, after he was killed in battle, ensuring him a proper royal burial. Cleopatra, then 14 years of age, would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.\nGabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority, for which he was acquitted. However, his second trial, for accepting bribes, led to his exile. He was recalled from exile seven years later, in 48 BC, by Caesar. Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt, but Crassus was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties. He allowed Gabinius's largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison, the Gabiniani, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.\nWithin a year, Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources. Despite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera, and stabilized the economy. On 31 May 52 BC, Cleopatra was made a regent to Ptolemy XII, as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII's debt by the time of the latter's death, and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.\nReign.\nAccession to the throne.\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt. Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5\u00a0million drachmas.\nIn 50 BC, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt, most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians. The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate. Bibulus, siding with Pompey in Caesar's Civil War, failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece, which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.\nBy 29 August 51 BC, official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler. She had probably married him, but there is no record of this. The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II. A long-held royal Egyptian practice, it was loathed by contemporary Greeks. By the reign of Cleopatra, however, it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.\nDespite Cleopatra's rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies, notably the eunuch Potheinos, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas, a prominent military commander, and Theodotus of Chios, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.\nAssassination of Pompey.\nIn the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome. Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes. By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt. She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.\nIn Greece, Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to Tyre, Lebanon. Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces. Ptolemy XIII's advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war. In a scheme devised by Theodotus, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC. Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's head, severed and embalmed, sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace. Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.\nRelationship with Julius Caesar.\nPtolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit. Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.\nWhen Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot, but he was arrested by Caesar, who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd. Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria, where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII\u2014previously possessed by Pompey\u2014naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs. Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.\nJudging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20,000, including the Gabiniani, could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4,000 unsupported troops, Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra. After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos, Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen, but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army. Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV. The resulting siege of the palace, with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside, lasted into the following year of 47 BC.\nSometime between January and March of 47 BC, Caesar's reinforcements arrived, including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean. Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile, where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat, but it capsized, and he drowned. Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia, by Marcus Junius Brutus, and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar's child since September 48 BC.\nCaesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC. However, Antony, an officer of his, helped to secure Caesar's appointment as dictator lasting for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt. Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra's sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler, Caesar appointed the 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar. The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC.\nCaesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments, although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event. The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of \"Thalamegos\", the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV, which during his reign measured in length and in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and promenades along its two decks, resembling a floating villa. Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas, and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.\nCaesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC, allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus, the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia. It is possible that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia, also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son. He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the freedman Rufio, to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position, but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.\nCaesarion, Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar, was born sometime in 47, possibly on 23 June 47 BC if stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara that mentions \"King Caesar\" refers to him. Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private). Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage, naming Caesar as the father.\nCleopatra and Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion, and were given lodging in Caesar's villa within the Horti Caesaris. As with their father Ptolemy XII, Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of \"friend and ally of the Roman people\" (), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome. Cleopatra's visitors at Caesar's villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero, who found her arrogant. Sosigenes of Alexandria, one of the members of Cleopatra's court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar, put into effect 1January 45 BC. The Temple of Venus Genetrix, established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess Venus, mother of the Romans. The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.\nCleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesar's assassination. Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesar's head, but Caesar refused in what was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship. Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred. Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir. However, Caesar's will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir, and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.\nIt is suggested, based on Cicero's letter, that Cleopatra might have been pregnant at that time with her and Caesar's second child; if so, this pregnancy ended in the loss of the baby. A few months later, Ptolemy XIV died\u2014allegedly poisoned by Cleopatra\u2014and she elevated her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.\nLiberators' civil war.\nOctavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice. Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.\nWhile Serapion, Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships, Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm, and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting. By the autumn of 42 BC, Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece, leading to the suicides of Cassius and Brutus.\nBy the end of 42 BC, Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized. In the summer of 41 BC, Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters, which she rebuffed until Antony's envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come. The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant, but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen. Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in \"Thalamegos\", hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship. Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria, and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister, Arsinoe IV, executed at Ephesus. Cleopatra's former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.\nRelationship with Mark Antony.\nCleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.\nCleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise. With his powers as a triumvir, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands, which were currently in Roman hands, to Cleopatra. While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatra's control by 19 November 38 BC, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41\u201340 BC, during her time spent with Antony.\nBy the spring of 40 BC, Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus, a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire. Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. She would not see Antony again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence, and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp. By the end of 40 BC, Cleopatra had given birth to twins, a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children. Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.\nMark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War (41\u201340 BC), initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra, but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos. Fulvia and Antony's brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia (modern Perugia, Italy) and then exiled from Italy, after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC. Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the Ionian Sea, it also stipulated that he concede Italia, Hispania, and Gaul, and marry Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a potential rival for Cleopatra.\nIn December 40 BC, Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea. Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty. Antigonus had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea. This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.\nRelations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but also sired her two children, Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC, and moved his headquarters to Athens. However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure. Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra. Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum, where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC.\n With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Antony traveled to Antioch, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.\nAntony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign. Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future. In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain, he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him, yet would ultimately outlast him.\nIn this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant, including nearly all of Phoenicia (Lebanon) minus Tyre and Sidon, which remained in Roman hands. She also received Ptolemais Akko (modern Acre, Israel), a city that was established by Ptolemy II. Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids, she was granted the region of Coele-Syria along the upper Orontes River. She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod. At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I (a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, including Ailana (modern Aqaba, Jordan). To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast, as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete. Although still administered by Roman officials, these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating her coinage in 36 BC.\nAntony's enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian, who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic. Octavian, fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia, granted both her and Livia, his own wife, extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity. Some 50 years before, Cornelia Africana, daughter of Scipio Africanus, had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her. She was now followed by Octavia and Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's, erected by Caesar.\nIn 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire. She then returned to Egypt, perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy. By the summer of 36 BC, she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus, her third child and second son with Antony.\nAntony's Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons, in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia, who defected to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men, more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus (modern Beirut, Lebanon) in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.\nDonations of Alexandria.\nAs Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass Antony for his military losses. Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome, Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household. Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.\nDellius was sent as Antony's envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian king's daughter to Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra. When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated their forces and captured the king and the Armenian royal family. Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph, dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra, who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais. News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.\nIn an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion, King of Kings, while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia, Media, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphus was declared king of Syria and Cilicia. Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene. Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony. Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view.\nIn late 34 BC, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years. Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy, while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian. The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war has shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustan-period literature through to various media in modern times. Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homer's Helen of Troy in destroying civilization. Pliny the Elder claims in his \"Natural History\" that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet. The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.\nA papyrus document dated to February 33 BC, later used to wrap a mummy, contains the signature of Cleopatra, probably written by an official authorized to sign for her. It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassus, a former Roman consul and Antony's confidant who would command his land forces at Actium. A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads \"make it happen\" or \"so be it\" (); this is likely the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.\nBattle of Actium.\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Before Antony and Octavian's joint \"imperium\" expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls. Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.\nAntony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire. Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian. Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch. Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt. Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans, such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.\nDuring the spring of 32 BC, Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens, where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce. This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will, invested with the Vestal Virgins. Although a violation of sacred and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta, and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian highlighted parts of the will, such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic. In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius. Octavian's legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC. With Antony's will made public, Octavian had his \"casus belli\", and Rome declared war on Cleopatra, not Antony. The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired.\nAntony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian, but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained; some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force. Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium, but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly. Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece, and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium, on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.\nCleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings, but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod, and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign. They also lost the support of Malichus I, which would prove to have strategic consequences. Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC, while defections to Octavian's camp continued, including Antony's long-time companion Dellius and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia. While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland, Cleopatra urged a naval confrontation to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt.\nOn 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium. Cleopatra, aboard her flagship, the \"Antonias\", commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet, in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle. Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy, which Cleopatra, ever concerned about defending Egypt, used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.\nBurstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible. Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship, identified by its distinctive purple sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron. Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her. The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3September, and was followed by massive defections of officers, troops, and allied kings to Octavian's side.\nDownfall and death.\nWhile Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt. The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory. She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion. It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.\nLucius Pinarius, Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court. Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian's side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain. Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this, but was stopped by his staff officers. In Alexandria, he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the \"Timoneion\", after the philosopher Timon of Athens, who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy. Herod, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony. Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.\nCleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion. Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him, take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea, and then set sail to a foreign port, perhaps in India, where she could spend time recuperating. However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I, as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria, Quintus Didius, managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated. Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian. Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported that at this time, Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.\nCleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the \"ephebi\", which, along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt. In a show of solidarity, Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus, his son with Fulvia, enter the \"ephebi\" at the same time. Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra. Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt, offered Octavian money in the future, and immediately sent him lavish gifts. Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction. Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared, but when Antony suspected foul intent, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.\nAfter lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC, stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia, where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies. Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while Cornelius Gallus, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion. Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria, but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's hippodrome. However, on 1 August 30 BC, Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by Antony's cavalry.\nCleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide. In despair, Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53. According to Plutarch, he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb, telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian's companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage. It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures. Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.\nOctavian entered Alexandria, occupied the palace, and seized Cleopatra's three youngest children. When she met with Octavian, Cleopatra told him bluntly, \"I will not be led in a triumph\" (), according to Livy, a rare recording of her exact words. Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom. When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. It is unclear if Cleopatra's suicide on 12 August 30 BC, at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb. It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion, who also took their own lives.\nOctavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb. Cleopatra's physician, Olympos, did not explain her cause of death, although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her. Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (, , 'spine, cheese-grater') was used to introduce the toxin by scratching; Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (, ), and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind. Horace corroborates the common belief that it was a venomous snake, but instead states that it was several (, 'serpents'). Vergil agrees that it was several serpents. Both this and Horace's account suggest that this belief stemmed from Octavian's propaganda. No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.\nCleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia, Ethiopia, or India. Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would live for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian around 29 August 30 BC, after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Roman province of Egypt was established, marking the end of the Hellenistic period. In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus (\"the revered\") and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.\nCleopatra's kingdom and role as a monarch.\nFollowing the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom. She was the chief religious authority in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths. She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.\nCleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain, tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign. A study suggested that volcanic eruptions caused the unfavourable climate and that this contributed to Cleopatra's demise, although others expressed skepticism about this hypothesis. Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality, the government attempted to impose price controls, tariffs, and state monopolies for certain goods, fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons. Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage, which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.\nLegacy.\nChildren and successors.\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian. Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC. The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point. Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey.\nThe emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, after their wedding in 25 BC, as the new rulers of Mauretania, where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital, renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell, Algeria). Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars, artists, and advisers from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea, now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture. She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania, in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.\nCleopatra Selene II died c.\u20095\u00a0BC, and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy. However, Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD, perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor. Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, although Queen Zenobia, of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century, claimed descent from Cleopatra. A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe, an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis, explained that he \"overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold.\"\nRoman literature and historiography.\nAlthough almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies. Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the \"Life of Antonius\" written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life. Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources, such as Philotas of Amphissa, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra\u2014which became canonical for his period\u2014as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports.\nThe Jewish Roman historian Josephus, writing in the 1st century AD, provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great. However, this work relies largely on Herod's memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus, the tutor of Cleopatra's children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod's court. The \"Roman History\" published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD, while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra's reign.\nCleopatra is barely mentioned in , the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar. The writings of Cicero, who knew her personally, provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra. The Augustan-period authors Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime, although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama. Horace also viewed Cleopatra's suicide as a positive choice, an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.\nThe historians Strabo, Velleius, Valerius Maximus, Pliny the Elder, and Appian, while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch, Josephus, or Dio, provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records. Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatra's point of view, but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works. The fragmentary \"Libyka\" commissioned by Cleopatra's son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra's perspective.\nCleopatra's gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient, medieval, and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman world. For instance, the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree. Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress, she had only two known sexual partners, Caesar and Antony, the two most prominent Romans of the time period, who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty. Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.\nCultural depictions.\nDepictions in ancient art.\nStatues.\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles. Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, as well as ancient carved cameos, such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin. Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple. It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.\n was found near the Tomba di Nerone, Rome, along the , and is now housed in the , part of the Vatican Museums. Plutarch, in his \"Life of Antonius\", said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus, but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2,000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.\nSince the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the \"Esquiline Venus\"\u2014discovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the of the Capitoline Museums\u2014is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue's , apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base. Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite). However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis, while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite. She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos. The \"Esquiline Venus\" is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD Roman copy of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.\nCoinage portraits.\nSurviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign includes specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC. Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins. Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency. Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband. These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple.\nHer strong, almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother, softer, and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles. Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II (316\u2013260 BC) and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti. It is likely, due to political expediency, that Antony's visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek, but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins, in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones. These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture, and perhaps also a statement to their subjects, however ambiguous to modern scholars, about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other. Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra, in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony, made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler. Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony, such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant, which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.\nVarious coins, such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatra's marriage with Antony in 37 BC, depict her wearing a royal diadem and a 'melon' hairstyle. The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads. This hairstyle, with hair braided back into a bun, is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage. After her visit to Rome in 46\u201344 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles, but it was abandoned for a more modest, austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.\nGreco-Roman busts and heads.\nOf the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, the sculpture known as the \", located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the \", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose. Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.\nBoth heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy, the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose.\nA third accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell, Algeria. This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads, but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Cleopatra. A possible Parian-marble wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums. Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC, it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.\nOther possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum, London, made of limestone, which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome. The woman in has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose), but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle. However, the British Museum head, once belonging to a full statue, could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome. Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head, along with those in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, the Capitoline Museums, and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen, while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem, most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra's popular hairstyle.\nPaintings.\nIn the at Pompeii, Italy, a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion. The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra. This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as .\nThe wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra, which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid's arm may have been torn off. The room with the painting was walled off by its owner, perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian, when public depictions of Cleopatra's son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.\nBehind her golden diadem, crowned with a red jewel, is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the \"melon\" hairstyle favored by the queen. Her ivory-white skin, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities. Roller affirms that \"there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.\"\n, dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II, contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion, both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide. The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba, who, toward the end of the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC), drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa, King of Numidia. Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family, Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates, and Cleopatra's own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.\nSophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made, while Cleopatra's suicide was far more famous. An asp is absent from the painting, but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite. A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting, positioned very high above the people in it, suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria. A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile (possibly an elaborate tray handle), while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.\nIn 1818, a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrian's Villa, near Tivoli, Lazio, Italy, that with an asp biting her bare chest. A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third wax and two-thirds resin. The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra's bare flesh and her drapery was reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits. A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period, as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers, as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns. After Cleopatra's suicide, Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake, parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome. The portrait painting of Cleopatra's death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa, where it was found in an Egyptian temple.\nA Roman panel painting from Herculaneum, Italy, dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra. In it she wears a royal diadem, red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun, pearl-studded hairpins, and earrings with ball-shaped pendants, . Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage. A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery, such as a Greek-style sphinx, and may have been created by the same artist.\nPortland Vase.\nThe Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony. In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs, Eros floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom. The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus. The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.\nNative Egyptian art.\nThe \"Bust of Cleopatra\" in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style. Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt. The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art. The Dendera Temple complex, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods. Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.\nA large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring in height, now in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, is thought to represent Arsinoe II, wife of Ptolemy II, but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress, an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt. The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided, double cornucopia (\"dikeras\"), which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra. In his (2006), Bernard Andreae contends that this basalt statue, like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance. Adrian Goldsworthy writes that, despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style, Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only \"perhaps for certain rites\" and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch, which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.\nMedieval and early modern reception.\nIn modern times, Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture, a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films. This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existing historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter. The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, in \"The Legend of Good Women\", contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages. His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining knight engaged in courtly love, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.\nChaucer highlighted Cleopatra's relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in and , Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio. The Renaissance humanist Bernardino Cacciante, in his 1504 \"Libretto apologetico delle donne\", was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works. Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra, such as the 10th-century \"Meadows of Gold\" by Al-Masudi, although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra's suicide.\nCleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts, such as a lying in a Gothic-style tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 1409. In the visual arts, the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria. Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo, as well as 15th-century woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccio's works.\nIn the performing arts, the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra, inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play \"Cleopatra\" in 1607. He was followed by William Shakespeare, whose \"Antony and Cleopatra\", largely based on Plutarch, was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England's own Virgin Queen. Cleopatra was also featured in operas, such as George Frideric Handel's 1724 \"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\", which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra; Domenico Cimarosa wrote \"Cleopatra\" on a similar subject in 1789.\nModern depictions and brand imaging.\nIn Victorian Britain, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, lithographs, postcards and cigarettes. Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggard's \"Cleopatra\" (1889) and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's \"One of Cleopatra's Nights\" (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers's \"Cleopatra\" (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy. The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra, while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnand's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.\nShakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" was considered canonical by the Victorian era. Its popularity led to the perception that by Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus, although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria. Also based on Shakespeare's play was Samuel Barber's opera \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1966), commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House. In his unfinished 1825 short story \"\", Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian Aurelius Victor, previously largely ignored, that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives. Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East, as the Qing-dynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's \"Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb\" (), an 1899 French silent horror film, was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra. Hollywood films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media, which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in \"Cleopatra\" (1917), Claudette Colbert in \"Cleopatra\" (1934), and Elizabeth Taylor in \"Cleopatra\" (1963). In addition to her portrayal as a \"vampire\" queen, Bara's Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century Orientalist painting, such as despotic behavior, mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality. Colbert's character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s, targeting female moviegoers. In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra, women's magazines of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup, clothes, jewelry, and hairstyles to achieve the \"Egyptian\" look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti. By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three films, two hundred plays and novels, forty-five operas, and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.\nWritten works.\nWhereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD. Ingrid D. Rowland, who highlights that the \"Berenice called Cleopatra\" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra. Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by Galen, including remedies for hair disease, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes. A\u00ebtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra, while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.\nAncestry.\nCleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, their European origins tracing back to northern Greece. Through her father, she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia. While Cleopatra's paternal line can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain. She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena, the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.\nCleopatra I Syra was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry. Her mother Laodice III was a daughter born to King Mithridates II of Pontus, a Persian of the Mithridatic dynasty, and his wife Laodice who had a mixed Greek-Persian heritage. Cleopatra I Syra's father Antiochus III the Great was a descendant of Queen Apama, the Sogdian Iranian wife of Seleucus I Nicator. It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians. Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and \"would have described herself as Greek\".\nStacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress. Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship), but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most. Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman \"but as a civilized Greek\".\nClaims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her. Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate. Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife. The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.\nThe family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband, Ptolemy XII, but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead. The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII's wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII's exile in Rome).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60828", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60828", "title": "Lepton", "text": "Class of elementary particles\nIn particle physics, a lepton is an elementary particle of half-integer spin (spin ) that does not undergo strong interactions. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons or muons), including the electron, muon, and tauon, and neutral leptons, better known as neutrinos. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best known of all leptons is the electron.\nThere are six types of leptons, known as \"flavours\", grouped in three \"generations\". The first-generation leptons, also called \"electronic leptons\", comprise the electron () and the electron neutrino (); the second are the \"muonic leptons\", comprising the muon () and the muon neutrino (); and the third are the \"tauonic leptons\", comprising the tau () and the tau neutrino (). Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high-energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators).\nLeptons have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, spin, and mass. Unlike quarks, however, leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, but they are subject to the other three fundamental interactions: gravitation, the weak interaction, and to electromagnetism, of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.\nFor every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be their own antiparticle. It is not currently known whether this is the case.\nThe first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in the mid-19th century by several scientists and was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. The next lepton to be observed was the muon, discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936, which was classified as a meson at the time. After investigation, it was realized that the muon did not have the expected properties of a meson, but rather behaved like an electron, only with higher mass. It took until 1947 for the concept of \"leptons\" as a family of particles to be proposed. The first neutrino, the electron neutrino, was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain certain characteristics of beta decay. It was first observed in the Cowan\u2013Reines neutrino experiment conducted by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. The muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 by Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger, and the tau discovered between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl and his colleagues from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The tau neutrino remained elusive until July 2000, when the DONUT collaboration from Fermilab announced its discovery.\nLeptons are an important part of the Standard Model. Electrons are one of the components of atoms, alongside protons and neutrons. Exotic atoms with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, as well as lepton\u2013antilepton particles such as positronium.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"lepton\" comes from the Greek \"lept\u00f3s\", \"fine, small, thin\" (neuter nominative/accusative singular form: \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \"lept\u00f3n\"); the earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek , \"re-po-to\", written in Linear B syllabic script. \"Lepton\" was first used by physicist L\u00e9on Rosenfeld in 1948:\nFollowing a suggestion of Prof. C. M\u00f8ller, I adopt\u2014as a pendant to \"nucleon\"\u2014the denomination \"lepton\" (from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, small, thin, delicate) to denote a particle of small mass.\nRosenfeld chose the name as the common name for electrons and (then hypothesized) neutrinos. Additionally, the muon, initially classified as a meson, was reclassified as a lepton in the 1950s. The masses of those particles are small compared to nucleons\u2014the mass of an electron () and the mass of a muon (with a value of ) are fractions of the mass of the \"heavy\" proton (), and the mass of a neutrino is nearly zero. However, the mass of the tau (discovered in the mid-1970s) () is nearly twice that of the proton and \u200d times that of the electron.\nHistory.\nThe first lepton identified was the electron, discovered by J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists in 1897. Then in 1930, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the electron neutrino to preserve conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum in beta decay. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the initial and observed final particles. The electron neutrino was simply called the neutrino, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours (or different \"generations\").\nNearly 40 years after the discovery of the electron, the muon was discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936. Due to its mass, it was initially categorized as a meson rather than a lepton. It later became clear that the muon was much more similar to the electron than to mesons, as muons do not undergo the strong interaction, and thus the muon was reclassified: electrons, muons, and the (electron) neutrino were grouped into a new group of particles\u2014the leptons. In 1962, Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the muon neutrino, which earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize, although by then the different flavours of neutrino had already been theorized.\nThe tau was first detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his colleagues at the SLAC LBL group. Like the electron and the muon, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino. The first evidence for tau neutrinos came from the observation of \"missing\" energy and momentum in tau decay, analogous to the \"missing\" energy and momentum in beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab, making it the second-to-latest particle of the Standard Model to have been directly observed, with Higgs boson being discovered in 2012.\nAlthough all present data is consistent with three generations of leptons, some particle physicists are searching for a fourth generation. The current lower limit on the mass of such a fourth charged lepton is , while its associated neutrino would have a mass of at least .\nProperties.\nSpin and chirality.\nLeptons are spin\u00a0 particles. The spin-statistics theorem thus implies that they are fermions and thus that they are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle: no two leptons of the same species can be in the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.\nA closely related property is chirality, which in turn is closely related to a more easily visualized property called helicity. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its momentum; particles with spin in the same direction as their momentum are called \"right-handed\" and they are otherwise called \"left-handed\". When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is the same in every reference frame, whereas for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by choosing a faster-moving reference frame; in the faster frame, the helicity is reversed. Chirality is a technical property, defined through transformation behaviour under the Poincar\u00e9 group, that does not change with reference frame. It is contrived to agree with helicity for massless particles, and is still well defined for particles with mass.\nIn many quantum field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, left- and right-handed fermions are identical. However, the Standard Model's weak interaction treats left-handed and right-handed fermions differently: only left-handed fermions (and right-handed anti-fermions) participate in the weak interaction. This is an example of parity violation explicitly written into the model. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital subscript (e.g. the normal electron e) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital subscript (e.g. a positron e).\nRight-handed neutrinos and left-handed anti-neutrinos have no possible interaction with other particles (see \"Sterile neutrino\") and so are not a functional part of the Standard Model, although their exclusion is not a strict requirement; they are sometimes listed in particle tables to emphasize that they would have no active role if included in the model. Even though electrically charged right-handed particles (electron, muon, or tau) do not engage in the weak interaction specifically, they can still interact electrically, and hence still participate in the combined electroweak force, although with different strengths (\"Y\"W).\nElectromagnetic interaction.\nOne of the most prominent properties of leptons is their electric charge, Q. The electric charge determines the strength of their electromagnetic interactions. It determines the strength of the electric field generated by the particle (see Coulomb's law) and how strongly the particle reacts to an external electric or magnetic field (see Lorentz force). Each generation contains one lepton with \"Q\" = \u22121 \"e\" and one lepton with zero electric charge. The lepton with electric charge is commonly simply referred to as a \"charged lepton\" while a neutral lepton is called a \"neutrino\". For example, the first generation consists of the electron with a negative electric charge and the electrically neutral electron neutrino .\nIn the language of quantum field theory, the electromagnetic interaction of the charged leptons is expressed by the fact that the particles interact with the quantum of the electromagnetic field, the photon. The Feynman diagram of the electron\u2013photon interaction is shown on the right.\nBecause leptons possess an intrinsic rotation in the form of their spin, charged leptons generate a magnetic field. The size of their magnetic dipole moment \u03bc is given by\n formula_1\nwhere m is the mass of the lepton and g is the so-called \"g\u00a0factor\" for the lepton. First-order quantum mechanical approximation predicts that the g\u00a0factor is 2 for all leptons. However, higher-order quantum effects caused by loops in Feynman diagrams introduce corrections to this value. These corrections, referred to as the \"anomalous magnetic dipole moment\", are very sensitive to the details of a quantum field theory model, and thus provide the opportunity for precision tests of the Standard Model. The theoretical and measured values for the \"electron\" anomalous magnetic dipole moment are within agreement within eight significant figures. The results for the \"muon\", however, are problematic, hinting at a small, persistent discrepancy between the Standard Model and experiment.\nWeak interaction.\nIn the Standard Model, the left-handed charged lepton and the left-handed neutrino are arranged in doublet that transforms in the spinor representation () of the weak isospin SU(2) gauge symmetry. This means that these particles are eigenstates of the isospin projection \"T\"3 with eigenvalues and respectively. In the meantime, the right-handed charged lepton transforms as a weak isospin scalar () and thus does not participate in the weak interaction, while there is no evidence that a right-handed neutrino exists at all.\nThe Higgs mechanism recombines the gauge fields of the weak isospin SU(2) and the weak hypercharge U(1) symmetries to three massive vector bosons (, , ) mediating the weak interaction, and one massless vector boson, the photon (\u03b3), responsible for the electromagnetic interaction. The electric charge Q can be calculated from the isospin projection T3 and weak hypercharge \"Y\"W through the Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima formula,\nTo recover the observed electric charges for all particles, the left-handed weak isospin doublet (\u03bdeL, e) must thus have \"Y\"W \n \u22121, while the right-handed isospin scalar e must have . The interaction of the leptons with the massive weak interaction vector bosons is shown in the figure on the right.\nMass.\nIn the Standard Model, each lepton starts out with no intrinsic mass. The charged leptons (i.e. the electron, muon, and tau) obtain an effective mass through interaction with the Higgs field, but the neutrinos remain massless. For technical reasons, the masslessness of the neutrinos implies that there is no mixing of the different generations of charged leptons as there is for quarks. The zero mass of neutrino is in close agreement with current direct experimental observations of the mass.\nHowever, it is known from indirect experiments\u2014most prominently from observed neutrino oscillations\u2014that neutrinos have to have a nonzero mass, probably less than . This implies the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called seesaw mechanism, which would explain both why the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why we have not yet seen any right-handed neutrinos.\nLepton flavor quantum numbers.\nThe members of each generation's weak isospin doublet are assigned leptonic numbers that are conserved under the Standard Model. Electrons and electron neutrinos have an \"electronic number\" of , while muons and muon neutrinos have a \"muonic number\" of , while tau particles and tau neutrinos have a \"tauonic number\" of . The antileptons have their respective generation's leptonic numbers of\u00a0\u22121.\nConservation of the leptonic numbers means that the number of leptons of the same type remains the same, when particles interact. This implies that leptons and antileptons must be created in pairs of a single generation. For example, the following processes are allowed under conservation of leptonic numbers:\n \u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u00a0 + ,\nbut none of these:\n \u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u00a0 + ,\nHowever, neutrino oscillations are known to violate the conservation of the individual leptonic numbers. Such a violation is considered to be smoking gun evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. A much stronger conservation law is the conservation of the total number of leptons (L with \"no\" subscript), conserved even in the case of neutrino oscillations, but even it is still violated by a tiny amount by the chiral anomaly.\nUniversality.\nThe coupling of leptons to all types of gauge boson are flavour-independent: The interaction between leptons and a gauge boson measures the same for each lepton. This property is called lepton universality and has been tested in measurements of the muon and tau lifetimes and of boson partial decay widths, particularly at the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) and Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider (LEP) experiments.138\nThe decay rate () of muons through the process \u2192 + + is approximately given by an expression of the form (see muon decay for more details)\n formula_2\nwhere K2 is some constant, and GF is the Fermi coupling constant. The decay rate of tau particles through the process \u2192 + + is given by an expression of the same form\n formula_3\nwhere K3 is some other constant. Muon\u2013tauon universality implies that . On the other hand, electron\u2013muon universality implies\n formula_4\nThe branching ratios for the electronic mode (17.82%) and muonic (17.39%) mode of tau decay are not equal due to the mass difference of the final state leptons.\nUniversality also accounts for the ratio of muon and tau lifetimes. The lifetime formula_5 of a lepton formula_6 (with formula_6 = \"\u03bc\" or \"\u03c4\") is related to the decay rate by\n formula_8,\nwhere formula_9 denotes the branching ratios and formula_10 denotes the resonance width of the process formula_11 with x and y replaced by two different particles from \"e\" or \"\u03bc\" or \"\u03c4\".\nThe ratio of tau and muon lifetime is thus given by\n formula_12\nUsing values from the 2008 \"Review of Particle Physics\" for the branching ratios of the muon and tau yields a lifetime ratio of ~\u00a0, comparable to the measured lifetime ratio of ~\u00a0. The difference is due to K2 and K3 not \"actually\" being constants: They depend slightly on the mass of leptons involved.\nRecent tests of lepton universality in meson decays, performed by the LHCb, BaBar, and Belle experiments, have shown consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions. However the combined statistical and systematic significance is not yet high enough to claim an observation of new physics.\nIn July 2021 results on lepton flavour universality have been published testing W decays, previous measurements by the LEP had given a slight imbalance but the new measurement by the ATLAS collaboration have twice the precision and give a ratio of formula_13, which agrees with the standard-model prediction of unity. In 2024 a preprint by the ATLAS collaboration has published a new value of formula_14 the most precise ratio so far testing the lepton flavour universality.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was Egypt's second confirmed woman who ruled in her own right, the first being Sobekneferu/Neferusobek in the Twelfth Dynasty. \nHatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and Great Royal Wife, Ahmose. Upon the death of her husband and half-brother Thutmose II, she had initially ruled as regent to her stepson, Thutmose III, who inherited the throne at the age of two. Several years into her regency, Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh and adopted the full royal titulary, making her a co-ruler alongside Thutmose III. In order to establish herself in the Egyptian patriarchy, she took on traditionally male roles and was depicted as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male garb. She emphasized both the qualities of men and women to convey the idea that she was both a mother and father to the realm. Hatshepsut's reign was a period of great prosperity and general peace. One of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, she oversaw large-scale construction projects such as the Karnak Temple Complex, the Red Chapel, the Speos Artemidos and most famously, the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari. \nHatshepsut probably died in Year 22 of the reign of Thutmose III. Towards the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son Amenhotep II, an attempt was made to remove her from official accounts of Egyptian historiography: her statues were destroyed, her monuments were defaced, and many of her achievements were ascribed to other pharaohs.\nEarly life.\nHatshepsut was born between 1505 and 1495 BC as eldest daughter of Thutmose I and his great royal wife, Ahmose. After her father's death, Hatshepsut was then married to Thutmose II, her half-brother and father's heir, when she was fourteen or fifteen years old. Thutmose II was of a similar age.\nReign.\nUpon the death of Thutmose II, the underage Thutmose III became the pharaoh of Egypt. Hatshepsut was thought of by early modern scholars to have only served as regent alongside him. However, modern scholars agree that, while she initially served as regent for young Thutmose\u00a0III from his accession in c.\u20091479\u00a0BC, Hatshepsut eventually assumed the position of pharaoh alongside him by Year 7 of his reign, c.\u20091472\u00a0BC; becoming queen regnant, Hatshepsut shared Thutmose\u00a0III's existing regnal count, effectively back-dating her accession as pharaoh to Year 1, when she had been merely regent. As a result, Thutmose III was relegated to junior coregent (Horus), while Hatshepsut became senior coregent (Osiris). Although queen Sobekneferu and - possibly - Nitocris, have previously assumed the role of pharaoh, Hatshepsut was the only female ruler to do so in a time of prosperity, and she arguably had more powers than her female predecessors.\nRetrospectively, Hatshepsut was described by ancient authors as having reigned for about 21\u201322 years, which included both her regency and her reign as queen regnant. Josephus and Julius Africanus follow the earlier testimony of Manetho (3rd century BC), mentioning a queen regnant called Amessis or Amensis, specified by Josephus as having been the sister of her predecessor. This woman was later identified by historians as Hatshepsut. In Josephus's text, her reign is described as lasting for 21\u00a0years and 9\u00a0months, while Africanus states it as 22 years, apparently rounding up. The latest attestation of Hatshepsut in contemporary records comes from Year 20 of the regnal count of Thutmose\u00a0III; she is no longer mentioned in Year 22, when he undertook his first major foreign campaign. This is compatible with the 21\u00a0years 9\u00a0months recorded by Manetho and Josephus, which would place the end of Hatshepsut's reign in Year 22 of Thutmose\u00a0III.\nDating the beginning of her reign is more difficult. Her father, Thutmose\u00a0I, began his reign in either 1526\u00a0BC or 1506\u00a0BC according to the high and low estimates of her reign, although the length of the reigns of Thutmose\u00a0I and Thutmose\u00a0II cannot be determined with certainty. With short reigns, Hatshepsut would have ascended the throne 14 years after her father's coronation; longer reigns would put her accession 25 years after his coronation.\nThe earliest attestation of Hatshepsut as pharaoh occurs in the tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer, where a collection of grave goods contained a single pottery jar or amphora from the tomb's chamber, stamped with the date \"Year 7\". Another jar from the same tomb, discovered \"in situ\" by a 1935\u201336 Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition on a hillside near Thebes, was stamped with the seal of the \"God's Wife Hatshepsut\", and two jars bore the seal of \"The Good Goddess Maatkare\". The dating of the amphorae, \"sealed into the [tomb's] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut's own tomb\", is undisputed, meaning that Hatshepsut was acknowledged as pharaoh of Egypt\u2014and no longer merely regent\u2014by Year 7 of her reign. She was certainly pharaoh by Year 9, the date of the Punt expedition, c.\u20091471\u00a0BC; her last dated attestation as pharaoh is Year 20, c.\u20091460\u00a0BC, and she no longer appears in Year 22, c.\u20091458.\nMajor accomplishments.\nTrade routes.\nHatshepsut re-established a number of trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt.\nHatshepsut's delegation returned from Punt bearing 31 live myrrh trees and other luxuries such as frankincense. Hatshepsut would grind the charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.\nHatshepsut had the expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahari, which is also famous for its realistic depiction of Queen Ati of the Land of Punt. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and the Sinai Peninsula shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.\nBuilding projects.\nHatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Many of these building projects were temples to build her religious base and legitimacy beyond her position as God's Wife of Amun. At these temples, she performed religious rituals that had hitherto been reserved for kings, corroborating the evidence that Hatshepsut assumed traditionally male roles as pharaoh. She employed the great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward Senenmut. The extant artifacts of the statuary provide archaeological evidence of Hatshepsut's portrayals of herself as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male Ancient Egyptian garb, such as a false beard and ram's horns. These images are seen as symbolic, and not evidence of cross-dressing or androgyny.\nFollowing the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak. She also restored the original Precinct of Mut, the great ancient goddess of Egypt, at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their own projects. The precinct awaits restoration. She had twin obelisks erected at the entrance to the temple which at the time of building were the tallest in the world. Only one remains upright, which is the second-tallest ancient obelisk still standing, the other having toppled and broken in two. The official in charge of those obelisks was the high steward Amenhotep. Another project, Karnak's Red Chapel, or Chapelle Rouge, was built as a barque shrine.\nLater, she ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction, and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it remains. Known as the Unfinished Obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.\nHatshepsut built the Temple of Pakhet at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile, was admired and called the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess, Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the Hyksos that James P. Allen has translated. This temple was altered later, and some of its insides were altered by Seti I of the Nineteenth Dynasty in an attempt to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.\nFollowing the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahari. The identity of the architect behind the project remains unclear. It is possible that Senenmut, the Overseer of Works, or Hapuseneb, the High Priest, was responsible. It is also likely that Hatshepsut provided input to the project. Located opposite the city of Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture. The complex's focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or \"the Holy of Holies\".\nOfficial lauding.\nHyperbole is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.\nHatshepsut assumed all the regalia and symbols of the Pharaonic office in official representations: the Khat head cloth, topped with the uraeus, the traditional false beard, and shendyt kilt. Hatshepsut was ambiguous and androgynous in many of her statues and monuments. She would create a masculine version of herself to establish herself in the Egyptian patriarchy.\nOsirian statues of Hatshepsut\u2014as with other pharaohs\u2014depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity.\nTo further lay her claim to the throne, priests told a story of divine birth. In this myth, Amun goes to Ahmose in the form of Thutmose I. Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. Khnum, the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and \"ka\", or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. Heket, the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a place where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.\nThe Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Welcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands.\nOnce she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then his majesty said to them: \"This daughter of mine, Khnumetamun Hatshepsut\u2014may she live!\u2014I have appointed as my successor upon my throne... she shall direct the people in every sphere of the palace; it is she indeed who shall lead you. Obey her words, unite yourselves at her command.\" The royal nobles, the dignitaries, and the leaders of the people heard this proclamation of the promotion of his daughter, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare\u2014may she live eternally.\nIrregular Heb Sed.\nLike the future 18th dynasty king Akhenaten who celebrated a heb sed jubilee after only 4 years on the throne, Hatshepsut announced her first heb sed jubilee in the 15th year of her rule as pharaoh unlike the traditional 30th year for other Egyptian kings. In theory, an Egyptian ruler:\n \"was entitled to celebrate his first jubilee thirty years after his coronation and thereafter as frequently as he desired...Hatchepsut, atypical as always, announced her jubilee during regnal Year 15. This was by no means the first royal tradition to be broken by Hatchepsut...\"\nSome Egyptologists, such as J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath in his book \"Chronology of the Egyptian Pharaohs\", speculate that Hatshepsut may have celebrated her first Sed jubilee rather to mark the passing of 30 years from the death of her father, Thutmose I, from whom she derived all of her legitimacy to rule Egypt. If true, this would imply that her late husband, Thutmose II, had a reign of 13-14 years. On other hand, Kara Cooney suggests Hatshepsut was commemorating 30 years of her father's dynasty (11 years for Thutmose I, 3 years for Thutmose II and 16 for Thutmose III) which would suggest short reign for her husband. Alternatively, Cooney proposed that Hatshepsut might have celebrated 30 years of her own life.\nDeath, burial, and mummification.\nHatshepsut's last dated attestation as pharaoh is Year 20, III Peret, Day 2, c.\u200922 May 1459 BC, but the reign length of 21 years and 9 months for her by Manetho in Josephus's book \"Contra Apionem\" indicates that she ceased to reign in Year 22, c.\u20091458 BC. The precise date of the beginning of Thutmose III's reign as sole ruler of Egypt\u2014and presumably of Hatshepsut's death\u2014is considered to be Year 22, II Peret, Day 10, recorded on a single stela erected at Armant, corresponding to 16 January 1458 BC. This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho's king list records since Hatshepsut's known accession date was I Shemu, Day 4.\nHatshepsut began constructing a tomb when she was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II. Still, the scale of this was not suitable for a pharaoh, so when she ascended the throne, preparation for another burial started. For this, KV20, originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished her father's burial and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. Therefore, it is likely that when she died (no later than the 22nd year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.\nHowever, during Thutmose III's reign, a new tomb (KV38), was constructed along with fresh burial equipment for Thutmose I. Thus, Thutmose I was relocated from his original tomb and reburied elsewhere. There is a possibility that at the same time, Hatshepsut's mummy was moved into the tomb of her nurse, Sitre In, in KV60. These actions could have been motivated by Amenhotep II, Thutmose III's son from a secondary wife, in an effort to secure his own uncertain claim to the throne.\nBesides what was recovered from KV20 during Egyptologist Howard Carter's clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness throne or bedstead, a senet game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial shabti figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at DB320, a wooden canopic box featuring an ivory knob was found, bearing the name of Hatshepsut and containing a mummified liver or spleen, along with a molar tooth. There was also a royal lady with the same name from the 21st dynasty, leading to initial speculation that the artifacts may have belonged to her instead.\nProposed mummy.\nIn 1903, Howard Carter had discovered tomb KV60 in the Valley of the Kings. It contained two female mummies: one identified as Hatshepsut's wet nurse and the other unidentified. In spring 2007, the unidentified body, called KV60A, was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and taken to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 \"canopic box\". Based on this, Hawass concluded that the KV60A mummy is very likely Hatshepsut.\nWhile the mummy and the tooth could be DNA tested to see if it belonged to the same person and confirm the mummy's identity, Hawass, the Cairo Museum and some Egyptologists have refused to do it as it would require destroying the tooth to retrieve the DNA. Her death has since been attributed to a benzopyrene carcinogenic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having bone cancer. Other members of the queen's family are thought to have suffered from inflammatory skin diseases that tend to be genetic. Assuming that the mummy is that of Hatshepsut, it is likely that she inadvertently poisoned herself while trying to soothe her itchy, irritated skin. It also would suggest that she had arthritis and bad teeth, which may be why the tooth was removed.\nHowever, in 2011, the tooth was identified as the molar from a lower jaw, whereas the mummy from KV60 was missing a molar from its upper jaw, thus casting doubt on the supposed identification.\nLegacy.\nExclusion from the historical record.\nToward the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son, an attempt was made to remove Hatshepsut from certain historical and pharaonic records. Her cartouches and images were chiselled off stone walls. Erasure methods ranged from full destruction of any instance of her name or image to replacement, inserting Thutmose I or II where Hatshepsut once stood. There were also instances of smoothing, patchwork jobs that covered Hatshepsut's cartouche; examples of this can be seen on the walls of the Deir el-Bahari temple. Simpler methods also included covering, where new stone was added to fully cover reliefs or sacred stone work.\nAt the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's many statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, an attempt was made to wall up her monuments. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than as a manifestation of the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps to save money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III, and instead using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.\nAmenhotep II, the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father's reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut's accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God's Wife of Amun. Some of these titles would be restored in the reign of his son Thutmose IV.\nFor many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman \"damnatio memoriae\". Egyptologist Donald Redford says that this was not borne out of hatred but was a political necessity to assert his own beliefs. Redford added:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But did Thutmose remember her? Here and there, in the dark recesses of a shrine or tomb where no plebeian eye could see, the queen's cartouche and figure were left intact ... which never vulgar eye would again behold, still conveyed for the king the warmth and awe of a divine presence.\nIt has long been assumed statuary of Hatshepsut was abased by Thutmose III in an\nact of iconoclasm but later research has suggested that it was a simple case of\nroutine ritual deactivation of the statuary.\nModern assessment.\nHatshepsut is, according to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, \"the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.\" In some ways, Hatshepsut's reign was seen as going against the patriarchal system of her time. She managed to rule as regent for a son who was not her own, going against the system which had previously only allowed mothers to rule on behalf of their biological sons. She used this regency to create her female kingship, constructing extensive temples to celebrate her reign, which meant that the public became used to seeing a woman in such a powerful role. This ensured that when the oracle declared her king, the Egyptian public readily accepted her status.\nHowever, as with other female heads of state in ancient Egypt, this was only done through the use of male symbols of kingship; hence the description of Hatshepsut and others as female kings rather than queens.\nEgyptologist Kara Cooney states that Hatshepsut was essentially given power by the elite class, who nominally served her, to further their own interests. She was raised to power due to her previous, successful record as a High Priestess (and during the succession crisis leading up to her regency), and during her rule, the elites gained significant power and wealth.\nHistorian Joyce Tyldesley stated that Thutmose III may have ordered public monuments to Hatshepsut and her achievements to be altered or destroyed in order to place her in a lower position of co-regent, meaning he could claim that royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt. This was supported by Thutmose III's officials, and as Hatshepsut's officials either died or were no longer in the public eye, there was little opposition to this. Tyldesley, along with historians Peter Dorman and Gay Robins, say that the erasure and defacement of Hatshepsut's monuments may have been an attempt to extinguish the memory of female kingship (including its successes, as opposed to the female pharaoh Sobekneferu, who failed to rejuvenate Egypt's fortunes and was therefore more acceptable to the conservative establishment as a tragic figure) and re-legitimise his right to rule.\nThe \"Hatshepsut Problem\" is a direct link to gender normatives in regards to ancient Egyptian social structures. Although she did hold Queen status, her reign, especially after, was disregarded and even erased. Her reign could be considered more successful than some pharaohs' reigns, for example with expanding borders, which can be seen as a threat to traditional gender roles. This raises questions about the conflict between power and traditional gender roles, and to what extent modernism and conservatism overlap.\nThe erasure of Hatshepsut's name\u2014by the men who succeeded her for whatever reason\u2014almost caused her to disappear from Egypt's archaeological and written records. When 19th-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahari temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, the French decoder of hieroglyphs, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I felt somewhat surprised at seeing here, as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris [Thutmose III], adorned with all the insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe [Hatshepsut], for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find upon reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question. I found the same peculiarity everywhere...\nThis problem was a major issue in late 19th-century and early 20th-century Egyptology, centering on confusion and disagreement on the order of succession of early 18th Dynasty pharaohs. The dilemma takes its name from confusion over the chronology of the rule of Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmose I, II, and III.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her keel was laid down in the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen as yard number 908 on 11 November 1935. After about nine months of construction, she was launched on 24 June 1936 and commissioned into the \"Kriegsmarine\" as the second Type VIIA submarine, (after , which was commissioned a few months earlier), on 12 August under the command of \"Korvettenkapit\u00e4n\" Hans Ibbeken.\nDesign.\nLike all Type VIIA submarines, \"U-27\" displaced on the surface and submerged. She was in overall length and had a pressure hull. \"U-27\"'s propulsion consisted of two MAN 6-cylinder 4-stroke M 6 V 40/46 diesel engines that totaled at maximum between 470 and 485 rpm giving a maximum speed of on the surface and a range of at .

She left Wilhelmshaven on her first war patrol on 23 August 1939. For a period of 24 days, she traveled down the coast of Germany and neutral Belgium and the Netherlands, through the English Channel and out into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland. Here, the boat sank two British trawlers, totaling 624 GRT. The first attack took place at 2:55 on 13 September, northwest of Tory Island, when the trawler \"Davara\" was shelled by \"U-27\"'s deck gun. Following the sinking of \"Davara\", her captain and 11 other crew members were picked up by the steam merchant ship \"Willowpool\". The second vessel to be sunk was the trawler \"Rudyard Kipling\". The attack took place at 3:53 on 16 September, west of the west coast of neutral Ireland, with the ship being sunk by scuttling charges from \"U-27\".

The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of daytime television's most popular characters. \"All My Children\" was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1970. The series started with half-hour episodes before expanding to a full hour on April 25, 1977. The show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which \"Ryan's Hope\" premiered.\nFrom 1970 to 1990, \"All My Children\" was recorded at ABC's TV18 at 101 West 67th Street, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC's Studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in Manhattan, New York City, New York. In December 2009, taping moved from Manhattan to less costly Los Angeles, California, at Stages 1 and 2 of the Andrita Studios, from 2010 to 2011. Taping then moved to the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, Connecticut. \"All My Children\" started taping in high definition on January 4, 2010, and began airing in high definition on February 3, 2010. \"All My Children\" became the third soap opera to be produced and broadcast in high definition.\nAt one point, the program's popularity positioned it as the most widely recorded television show in the United States. In the mid-1970s, its audience was estimated to be 30% male, which was unusual at the time. The show ranked first in the daytime Nielsen ratings in the 1978\u201379 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, \"All My Children\" was the number-two daytime soap opera on the air. However, like the rest of the soap operas in the United States, \"All My Children\" experienced unprecedented declines in its ratings during the 2000s. By 2010, it had become one of the least-watched soap operas in daytime television.\nOn April 14, 2011, ABC announced that it was canceling \"All My Children\" after a run of 41 years. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of \"All My Children\" to third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the Internet as a series of webisodes. The series aired its final episode on ABC on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. On November 23, 2011, Prospect Park suspended its plan to revive the series, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews.\nOn January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore \"All My Children\" as a web series on a platform named TOLN. The revival series would premiere on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run. On November 11, 2013, several \"All My Children\" cast members announced that Prospect Park had closed production and canceled the series again. The rights to the show returned to ABC in December 2016.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAgnes Nixon, then head writer for \"The Guiding Light\", first came up with the idea for \"All My Children\" in the 1960s. When writing the story bible, she designed the show as a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love. She unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter &amp; Gamble. When Procter &amp; Gamble was unable to make room for the show in its lineup, Nixon put \"All My Children\" on hold.\nNixon became head writer for \"Another World\" in 1965, and decided to use a few ideas from her \"All My Children\" bible. In particular, she used the model of the Erica Kane character to create a brand new \"Another World\" character named Rachel Davis. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive\", Nixon said.\nCreation.\nABC later approached Nixon to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program, \"One Life to Live\", debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked Nixon for another program, and she revived her \"All My Children\" bible and the Erica Kane character.\nNixon wrote a poem to include in the photo album shown in the series' title credits: \n\"The great and the least, the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, in sickness and in health, in joy and sorrow, in tragedy and triumph, you are all my children.\"\n1970s.\n\"All My Children\" debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show \"Dream House\". Rosemary Prinz was signed on to be the \"special guest star\" for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on \"As the World Turns\" in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Wisner Washam. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching \"Loving\" in 1983. \nNixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience. She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional \"Pine Valley\" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called Pine Valley in western New York. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and also near \"One Life to Live\"'s Llanview. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)\nThe show's first action takes place around several families and characters. Phoebe Tyler (Ruth Warrick), who fashions herself as \"Queen of Pine Valley\", was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, Mona Kane (Frances Heflin), and her spoiled daughter, Erica (Susan Lucci) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable Martin family, headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of \"All My Children\". Destined to break up the young romance of classmates Tara Martin (Karen Lynn Gorney) and Phil Brent (Richard Hatch), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted, but instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler (Rosemary Prinz) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.\n\"All My Children\"'s first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that. The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.\nThe show was unique for its use of the Vietnam War. Before \"All My Children\" debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won Mary Fickett the first Emmy Award given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.\nNurse Caroline Murray, played by Patricia Dixon, was a Vietnam veteran who overcame her chilling flashbacks to the war with the help of Dr. Frank Grant (John Danelle) in 1976. Dr. Frank Grant, first seen in Pine Valley in 1972, his wife Nancy (played by Lisa Wilkinson and first seen in 1973), and Caroline (debuting in 1976) were the first Black leading characters on \"All My Children\".\nIn May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.\nMaking the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case. The storyline has been credited for boosting the show's ratings, as well as helping establish Erica Kane as a central character who would dominate the show for its entire run.\nPhoebe's husband Charles (Hugh Franklin) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked paralysis. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorc\u00e9e and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.\nWhen Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (William Mooney). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing plastic surgery and its psychological effects.\nIn June 1976, character Brooke English showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over Tom Cudahy and Mark Dalton. In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced Myrtle Lum Fargate (Eileen Herlie).\nBy the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic Palmer Cortlandt (aka Peter Cooney) (James Mitchell), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock (Elizabeth Lawrence), and his overprotected daughter Nina (Taylor Miller), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances Dr. Cliff Warner (Peter Bergman). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt (Gillian Spencer), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. \"All My Children\" also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle (Matthew Cowles) and Ray Gardner (Gil Rogers).\n\"All My Children\" had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on kinescope in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special \"A Daytime To Remember\", which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.\nNixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to \"All My Children\" in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them. However, that promise was broken, because different sources point out that most of them were either lost in a warehouse fire or were erased. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.\n1980s.\nThe early 1980s is considered a \"golden period\" for the show and the \"Golden Age\" for supercouples. Younger characters, such as Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner (Laurence Lau and Kim Delaney), Liza Colby (Marcy Walker), Liza's best friend Amanda (Amanda Bearse), Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter (Darnell Williams and Debbi Morgan), and a now-grown-up Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight), who was now legally Ruth and Joe's son, enter the scene.\nThe storyline involving Liza plotting to win Greg back after he leaves her for Jenny became a fan favorite, as was the Greg and Jenny and Jesse and Angie pairings. Jesse and Jenny's summer in New York City became regarded as one of the greatest storylines in the history of the series. Meanwhile, the legend of \"Tad the Cad\" is born when Tad takes Liza's virginity, then simultaneously begins having sex with her mother, socialite Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey), who eventually is sent to prison.\nFor older appeal, Jenny and Tad's natural mother Opal (Dorothy Lyman) was also added to the canvas, where she opens the Glamorama salon and spa. Opal greatly showcased \"All My Children\"'s attempt at humor and satire. Also introduced in the 1980s were powerful businessman Adam Chandler and his identical twin brother Stuart (both played by David Canary), the first arrival of members of the Chandler family. Adam became cited as one of the \"most powerful male figures in television\", which was contrasted by Stuart's kind, generous, and honest personality.\nErica began to take on a larger-than-life role by the 1980s, writing an autobiography, \"Raising Kane\", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses Erica of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, Erica goes on the run. She does all this while posing as a sister named 'Christine'. \nThe show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. Tricia Pursley portrayed the divorced Devon McFadden, who believes she is falling in love with her lesbian psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (portrayed by Donna Pescow). Lynn acknowledges that she is a lesbian, and Devon admits her crush, but Lynn rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.\nThe show tackled the issue of drug use when Mark La Mura's character, Mark Dalton, becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a tough love policy that requires Mark's admission of his addiction.\nControversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), who later fell in love with Stuart. Cindy was revealed to have AIDS. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison, who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, Skye Chandler. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most-watched episodes.\nFelicia Minei Behr was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on Ryan's Hope, Behr was familiar with \"All My Children\", having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie (Cady McClain). By this time, the show had also found a \"hit couple\" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by Rosa Nevin and Maurice Benard), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.\nABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera \"Generations\" in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to \"Soap Opera Digest\" that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired Jill Larson. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.\n1990s.\nAt the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. ABC chose Megan McTavish, a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's (Genie Francis') incest, Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included \"Natalie in the Well,\" the \"Who Killed Will Cortlandt?\" mystery, \"Willow Lake Acres\" (a humorous-but-serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane.\nMcTavish was also instrumental in a major, but still popular retroactive continuity (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was revealed as Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and seeks revenge against her mother. Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. Gellar was proclaimed by some \"as the second coming of Erica\" in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993 to 1995, but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities.\nThe Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 1990s as well. Also, the Tad and Dixie pairing had become especially popular. Other prominent couples were Dimitri and Erica (Michael Nader), Trevor (James Kiberd) and Natalie (Kate Collins), Hayley (Kelly Ripa) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, Matt Borlenghi, Brian L. Greene), and Brooke English and Edmund Grey (Julia Barr, John Callahan).\nSome of McTavish's storytelling ultimately received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the O. J. Simpson trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and \"All My Children\" was no different. When McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.\nBroderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning \"All My Children\" to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the Betty Ford Center), and also the story of homophobia over a gay high school boy and a history teacher. However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in Francesca James (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a voodoo arc with the popular Noah and Julia (Keith Hamilton Cobb and Sydney Penny), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the \"real\" Santa Claus, and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.\nDespite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on \"All My Children\", Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled, Bianca Montgomery's anorexia, was created by Broderick. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish's tales were plot-driven and made implausible alterations to the show's history such as the resurrection of Erica's lifetime love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998, the show again got a new executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, taking over from Francesca James.\nCady McClain, who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned, but other storylines\u2014involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch\u2014were all ill-received. By the start of 1999, with \"All My Children\" being voted as the \"Worst of 1998\" by \"Soap Opera Digest\", McTavish was once again fired. As ratings began to fall, ABC convinced Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as Michael Nader, James Kiberd, and Robin Mattson, left their roles.\n2000s.\nNixon decided to write a story that would rejuvenate the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica's daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Although initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics. Bianca emerged as a breakout character and lesbian icon. The show found additional success in the pairing of newcomers Leo and Greenlee (Josh Duhamel and Rebecca Budig).\nRichard Culliton wrote several of \"All My Children\"'s early 2000s (decade) storylines. He created popular characters Frankie and Maggie Stone, and said Frankie was already intended to be killed in a murder storyline after only three months on the series. Culliton and ABC executives were surprised when viewers became attached to the romance between Bianca and Frankie, developed by Culliton with Frankie's debut. These fans attributed Frankie's death to the show's fear to focus on a lesbian romance. Eventually, Culliton introduced the idea to bring back popular actress Elizabeth Hendrickson, who had portrayed Frankie, as Frankie's twin sister Maggie. Culliton continued to write for the show until late 2002.&lt;ref name=\"Www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2002\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter more staff turnover, McTavish again returned as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, which included the controversial rape of Bianca. Gone upon McTavish's latest return was Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, being replaced with Julie Hanan Carruthers. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who had been gone for long. She introduced star-crossed couple JR Chandler and Babe Carey upon writing JR's return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone's love story, and created fellow popular couple Zach Slater and Kendall Hart. Characters Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) and Janet Dillon (Kate Collins, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.\nOn July 26, 2006, Tanika Ray, Rihanna, as well as other celebrities, appeared on the show. During the Rihanna appearance, a controversial storyline involving Erica's thought-to-be-aborted son having come to Pine Valley under the name Josh Madden intensifies when Josh learns of how he truly came to exist. In August 2006, after months of speculation, it was confirmed that fan favorite Eden Riegel would be reprising her Emmy winning role as Bianca. She was a part of a controversial storyline centered on transgender character Zarf/Zoe.\nThe most notable return was Cady McClain's return as show heroine Dixie Cooney Martin. The news of her return spread just two weeks before she reappeared on the series. In an unpopular and controversial move by the series, the writers chose to kill off Dixie in January 2007 only a year after her return. The character's death was the result of the Satin Slayer storyline where she is unintentionally murdered in place of character Babe Carey.\nAnother prominent return to the series occurred on February 9, 2007, when Susan Pratt returned as Barbara Montgomery. Pratt made her last appearance in July of that year. That same month, McTavish was fired as head writer, reportedly due to viewer criticism about her storylines. On May 21, 2007, James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten were announced as the new head writers of \"All My Children\". The duo wrote for \"Guiding Light\", \"Days of Our Lives\", \"One Life to Live\", \"Dynasty\" and \"Port Charles\", and created and wrote for \"The City\".\nOn December 12, 2007, ABC revealed Rebecca Budig would be returning to the series as Greenlee Smythe; the return was one of the most widely reported in daytime television history, attracting mainstream media attention such as the \"Associated Press\" and \"New York Daily News\". Budig's return was overshadowed by controversy when news of Sabine Singh's reportedly unfair treatment as a Greenlee recast in order to bring Budig back incited viewer outrage.\nOn December 25, 2007, \"Soap Opera Digest\" reported the return of fan favorites Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams as Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter. Morgan returned on January 18, 2008, and Williams on January 25, 2008. In April 2008, it was announced that Laurence Lau would briefly reprise the role of Greg Nelson for Jesse and Angie's much anticipated wedding. On May 21, 2008, Charles Pratt, Jr., former co-head writer for \"General Hospital\", was announced as a replacement for Brown and Esensten amid record low ratings. On November 6, 2008, \"All My Children\" aired a special episode in which veterans share their stories unscripted. On November 12, 2008, the show celebrated its 10,000th show with a special appearance by Nixon and a special tribute to Myrtle Fargate (as portrayed by Eileen Herlie who had recently died). On December 19, 2008, a special episode ran for Herlie, showing clips from the past.\nOn February 16, 2009, \"All My Children\" made daytime history with the nuptials of Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery, the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime television. After departing the show in February 2005, Riegel continued to return to the series for limited guest appearances, but permanently left the role in 2010.\nOn November 20, 2009, Pratt was fired as head writer. Daytime Emmy-winning former head writer Lorraine Broderick was brought back to lead the writing team on an interim basis. Reportedly, Broderick returned at the request of show creator Agnes Nixon, but was not interested in remaining permanently as the team's top scribe. \n2010s.\nOn January 5, 2010, \"All My Children\" celebrated its 40th anniversary with an episode structured like a documentary and hosted by character Hayley Santos. It featured appearances by characters Palmer Cortlandt, Nina Warner, Maria Santos Grey, Brooke English, Greg Nelson, Bianca Montgomery, Mateo Santos and Lily Montgomery. It was also the final episode for characters Joe and Ruth Martin, who retired to Florida, and the final appearance for Palmer, since actor James Mitchell died shortly after the episode aired.\nOn January 13, 2010, ABC Daytime announced the appointment of David Kreizman and Donna Swajeski as the co-head writers of \"All My Children\", replacing interim head writer Lorraine Broderick, who in turn replaced Charles Pratt, Jr. Brian Frons, head of ABC daytime, stated, \"David and Donna are the perfect team to bring new ideas to \"All My Children\" while remaining true to its core by telling stories with a focus on the integrity of the show's history, its characters and families on the canvas.\" Prior to his appointment on \"All My Children\", Kriezman was the head writer of \"Guiding Light\" from 2004 to the final episode on September 18, 2009, and the co-head writer of \"As the World Turns\" from 2009 to the final episode on September 17, 2010. Swajeski's prior experience includes a head writing stint on \"Another World\" from 1988 to 1992.\nWith the death on January 22 of James Mitchell at age 89 (Palmer Cortlandt 1979\u20132010), the show aired a tribute episode to Palmer on Tuesday April 20, 2010. Gillian Spencer (Daisy Murdoch Cortlandt), Taylor Miller (Nina Cortlandt), and Cady McClain (Dixie Cooney Martin) returned for the episode. On February 8, Walt Willey returned as a contract cast member in the role of Jackson Montgomery, following numerous months away and dispute about his future on the show. On February 23, Julia Barr reprised the role of Brooke English; Brooke's return was timed to the retirement of David Canary (Adam Chandler) after more than 26 years on the show. Their final episode aired April 23, 2010. On July 17, 2010, Larry Keith, who was on the show from 1970 to 2005 as Nick Davis, and who gave Erica Kane the nickname \"Princess\", died. He was last seen on January 5, 2005, for the show's 35th anniversary episode.\nIn September 2010, Daytime Emmy winner Vincent Irizzary's character, David Hayward, was murdered. On the November 22, 2010, episode, David waltzed into the courtroom during Greenlee's trial (for which she was just sentenced to life in prison for murdering him) at the tail end of it, confirming rumors that he was going to return all along. \"Soap Opera Digest\" confirmed soon after that the show had planned this all along from the start. On September 16, 2010, Adam Mayfield (Scott Chandler) and Brittany Allen (Marissa Tasker) were announced to be leaving the show. ABC reports that they wanted to take both the characters in a different direction. On September 22, 2010, it was announced that Daniel Cosgrove (ex-Scott, \"All My Children\"; ex-Bill, \"Guiding Light\"; ex-Chris, \"As the World Turns\") would return to \"All My Children\" and replace Adam Mayfield (Scott) as Scott Chandler. On October 28, 2010, it was announced that Sarah Glendening (ex-Lucy, \"As the World Turns\") would be taking over the role of Marissa Tasker. Glendening debuted on December 27 and Cosgrove debuted on December 29.\nIn January 2011, Debbi Morgan said that she would take a leave of absence from the show. She said it was for personal reasons and on January 14, 2011, she released to the public that she has been diagnosed with Lyme disease. She returned during the second week of February and her first episode aired on March 8, 2011. On February 10, 2011, as part of her 25th (and farewell) season, Oprah Winfrey invited \"All My Children\"'s Susan Lucci, Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams, and Michael E. Knight, along with \"General Hospital\"'s Luke and Laura (Anthony Geary and Genie Francis) and \"The Young and the Restless\"' Mrs. Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) to \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". As a surprise, Winfrey shocked Lucci and the rest of the crowd by bringing back all of Erica's husbands. During February 2011, the TV Land sitcom \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"All My Children\" did a crossover event. On the 16th and the 23rd, Lucci, Michael E. Knight, and Darnell Williams made guest appearances on the show. On the 24th, Wendie Malick guest-starred.\nOn April 2, 2011, amid rumors of \"All My Children\"'s possible cancellation, \"Soaps in Depth\" broke the news via Twitter that longtime \"All My Children\" writer Lorraine Broderick had once again been named the show's head writer, replacing David Kreizman and Donna Swajeski.\nCancellation.\nOn April 14, 2011, ABC confirmed that it would not renew both \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" after 41 and 43 years respectively, starting with \"All My Children\" ending its run on September 23, 2011, and with \"One Life to Live\" ending its run on January 13, 2012. Reasons for both shows' cancellations cited \"extensive research into what today's daytime viewers want and the changing viewing patterns of the audience\". It would be replaced by a new lifestyle show, \"The Chew\", while its time slot on SOAPnet would be replaced by daily reruns of \"Days of Our Lives\". In response to the cancellation of this, vacuum cleaner manufacturer Hoover withdrew its advertising from all ABC programs in protest, going as far as running a campaign to get ABC to reverse its decision.\nOn April 25, Cady McClain (ex-Dixie Cooney Martin) announced that she would be returning to \"All My Children\" but could not report what her storyline would be. Other former cast members announced to be returning to the series are Ray MacDonnell (Dr. Joe Martin), Lee Meriwether (Ruth Martin), David Canary (Adam Chandler), Julia Barr (Brooke English), Thorsten Kaye (Zach Slater), Eva La Rue (Maria Santos), Jennifer Bassey (Marian Colby), Kate Collins (Janet Dillon), Esta TerBlanche (Gillian Andrassy-Lavery), Josh Duhamel (Leo du Pres), Melissa Claire Egan (Annie Lavery), Leven Rambin (Lily Montgomery), Carol Burnett (Verla Grubbs), Jason Kincaid (Sam Brady), and Sarah Michelle Gellar playing a young woman who claims to see vampires (an allusion to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer story Normal Again).\nOn July 7, 2011, the \"New York Post\" reported that ABC had sold the licensing rights of \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" to a TV-focused online channel being developed by TV, film and music production company Prospect Park. ABC confirmed this via press release; as a result of Prospect Park's acquisition of the two soaps, \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" would be the first soap operas to transition first-run broadcasts from traditional television to internet television. Since the deal between ABC and Prospect Park is a licensing agreement, both soaps would continue to remain the property of ABC.\nOn September 8, 2011, the original Ruth Martin, actress Mary Fickett, died at age 83. The episode on Wednesday, September 21, 2011, was dedicated to her. On September 23, 2011, the series finale aired on ABC with open-ended stories. The final week featured Dr. Joe and Ruth Martin relocating to Pine Valley to cover recently arrested David Hayward's hospital duties. The return of Adam Chandler and Brooke English coincided with the revelation that David had somehow resurrected Stuart Chandler. Jackson Montgomery dissolved his relationship with Erica after she admitted that she prefers not to remarry. Unresolved is JR Chandler's plunge into insanity as he drunkenly aims a gun at a crowd of \"All My Children\" regulars during a welcome-home party for Stuart. The screen darkened before revealing the victim, leaving the story open for an eventual continuation with Prospect Park. On April 29, 2013, the revived series moved five years into the future after the original series finale on ABC. On November 11, 2013, it was confirmed by some of its actors that the series had once again been cancelled, this time by its online revival team.\nProspect Park's revival plan.\nUnsuccessful attempt.\nIn August 2010, Prospect Park announced that it was shopping for a cable network to air \"All My Children\" in complementary to its future internet television channel. Prospect Park officially began negotiations with the actors of \"All My Children\" on September 15, 2011. On September 19, 2011, Cameron Mathison and Lindsay Hartley became the only actors that had agreed to continue the show with Prospect Park.\nProspect Park initially intended for \"All My Children\" to begin its run on the internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of \"All My Children\". On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that \"All My Children\" along with its sister soap \"One Life to Live\" would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch \"All My Children\" and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated \"One Life to Live\". Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park not being able to sign enough cast members from \"All My Children\".\nOn November 23, 2011, Prospect Park confirmed that it had officially suspended its attempt to produce both shows. Reasons given by Prospect Park for this decision included funding problems and poor negotiations with the unions representing the cast of both soaps. WGA and AFTRA, which respectively represented the writer and the actors, both expressed disappointment over Prospect Park's announcement.\n2013 revival.\nOn December 17, 2012, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that revival plans for \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" had resurfaced. A few days later, it was reported that Prospect Park had secured studio place in Stamford, Connecticut, where both shows would be filmed. The show had been filmed in New York City from 1970 to 2010, and in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2011.\nWithin the weeks following the reports, Lindsay Hartley, Vincent Irizarry, Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams, Jordi Vilasuso, Jill Larson, Thorsten Kaye, Cady McClain, David Canary, Julia Barr, and Ray MacDonnell were reported and/or confirmed to be returning to the show's revival, while Susan Lucci would reportedly return for one episode, Eden Riegel would return for a guest-arc, Cameron Mathison might return to the revival in the future, and Alicia Minshew would return for one episode with the possibility of returning in the future. Along with the returning stars, a number of new actors were cast, including Ryan Bittle as JR Chandler, Robert Scott Wilson as Pete Cortlandt, Eric Nelsen as an aged AJ Chandler, Denyse Tontz as an aged Miranda Montgomery, Sal Stowers as Cassandra Foster, and Jordan Lane Price as a newly created character, Celia Fitzgerald.\nOn January 7, 2013, Prospect Park released an official statement confirming plans to revive \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" on The Online Network, their internet production company. Prospect Park signed deals with SAG-AFTRA and DGA for the soap opera's production.\nFormer \"All My Children\" writer and producer Ginger Smith returned as the new executive producer and creator Agnes Nixon served as consultant. The new episodes were 30 minutes long and aired on Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Initially, 220 episodes of the show were ordered. The production company planned to shop the reboot to cable distributors beginning September 2013. The show schedule was four days a week (Monday-Thursday) with a Friday recap show, \"MORE All My Children\", to feature behind the scenes footage as well as interviews with the cast and to be hosted by Leslie Miller. The revival show began on April 29, 2013, and production began on February 25, 2013, in Connecticut, with \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" taping in five-week rotations for 17 weeks.\nOn May 17, 2013, The Online Network announced that \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" would no longer air five days a week together, due to viewer ratings that reflect online viewing patterns rather than those of traditional television. Starting May 20, 2013, \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Life\" will be presented in a new schedule, with AMC airing on Mondays and Wednesdays and OLTL airing Tuesdays and Thursdays. The recap shows \"MORE All My Children\" and \"MORE One Life to Life\" will also combine as one show airing on Fridays. The following day on May 18, 2013, both shows were noticeably missing from the FX Canada website and schedule, and although they subsequently became available on iTunes Canada, it was later revealed that FX Canada dropped \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" due to the reduction of episodes, as the carriage agreement had specifically called for the airing of four episodes per week of both shows. Due to the reduction, FX Canada stated that \"the agreement is no longer valid\". On May 20, 2013, the first episodes of the new \"All My Children\" and \"One Life To Live\" were available worldwide on The Online Network's YouTube page, \"TOLNSoaps\".\nOn May 24, 2013, in a press release Prospect Park announced through Agnes Nixon that Snyder and McPherson will be out as co-head writers of \"All My Children\" and replaced by current script writers Lisa Connor and Chip Hayes.\nOn June 5, 2013, due to a labor dispute with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" were forced into an early hiatus with the writers, directors and editors still working; there were talks of production being moved out of state, but those plans were later shelved.\nOn June 20, 2013, a deal was reached between Prospect Park and the Union, and taping will resume on August 12, 2013. On June 25, 2013, TOLN stated that there will be a scheduling switch for \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\". Starting July 1, 2013, all episodes of the week for both shows would be released on Mondays.\nBeginning July 15, 2013, \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" aired for a 10-week limited engagement on the Oprah Winfrey Network, Monday through Thursday at 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM. \"All My Children\" aired a season finale on September 2, 2013.\nIn November 2013, Prospect Park indicated it was suspending further production of both shows. No new episodes have been made since that time. In total, only 40 of each program were produced in the new online format.\nABC regained the rights to \"All My Children\" in December 2016 following the dismissal of a lawsuit from Prospect Park against the broadcast network.\nAftermath primetime spin-offs.\nOn December 17, 2020, \"Variety\" reported a primetime revival of \"All My Children\" was in early development at ABC, under the executive production of Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa. Leo Richardson\u2014who previously worked on British soap opera \"EastEnders\"\u2014is also attached as executive producer and writer of the project. Per the report, the primetime revival would center around a \"young journalist with a secret agenda comes to expose the dark and murderous history of a town named Pine Valley only to become entangled in a feud between the Kane and Santos families.\" In another report, \"Deadline Hollywood\" revealed the spinoff, \"Pine Valley\" was first proposed by Andrew Stern, who pitched the project to ABC via his deal with ABC Signature in 2019; he will serve as executive producer, alongside Consuelos, Richardson, Ripa and, Nixon's son, Robert Nixon. \"Deadline Hollywood\" further reported plans to invite former cast from the daytime incarnation to the spinoff, as well as potential appearances from Consuelos and Ripa themselves.\nOn September 11th, 2024, A&amp;E Networks announced that an \"All My Children\" holiday movie was in development for the Lifetime Network.\nSetting.\nSince the series began in 1970, the show has been set in Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia. The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as Llanview (\"One Life to Live\"), Port Charles (\"General Hospital\", \"Port Charles\", \"The Young Marrieds\"), New York City (\"Ryan's Hope\") and Corinth (\"Loving\").\nCrossovers.\nIn 2000, \"All My Children\" was featured in a major crossover event that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. Linda Dano brought her \"One Life to Live\" character Rae Cummings, to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother Myrtle Fargate. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing \"All My Children\" character Skye Chandler, was Rae's daughter. Skye, who had spent time on \"One Life to Live\" from 1999 to 2001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps \"General Hospital\" and \"Port Charles\", where she became a member of the Quartermaine family, and made appearances until 2012.\n\"All My Children\" has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 'baby switch' storyline with \"One Life to Live\" which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, ABC did a comedic crossover with the TV Land comedy \"Hot in Cleveland\", in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by Wendie Malick but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on ABC alongside Susan Lucci. In the \"Hot in Cleveland\" storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.\nIn 2017, \"All My Children\" character Alex Marick appeared on \"General Hospital\", where she masqueraded as her sister Anna Devane. She made further appearances in 2019 and 2020.\n\"All My Children\" also gets mentioned in the sitcom \"Friends\" where the character Joey Tribbiani goes up for the part of \"Nick the Boxer\" in \"All My Children\" and convinces one of his students in his acting class to portray Nick as homosexual in an attempt to put the casting directors off. Much to Joey's disgust, the student gets the part. In addition the manager of the Central Perk coffeehouse, Gunther, reveals that he played Bryce in \"All My Children\" until his character was killed off.\nRatings.\n\"For historical ratings information, see List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings\"\n1970s ratings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1980s ratings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1990s ratings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrimetime special.\nJanuary 15, 1995: \"AMC 25th Anniversary\" (#56, 10.3/15 rating/share and 16.0 million viewers) (Competition: \"Murder, She Wrote\" on CBS (#16, 14.5/21 rating/share and 20.8 million viewers) and \"seaQuest DSV\" on NBC (#61, 9.7/14 rating/share and 16.5 million viewers)).\n2000s ratings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010s ratings.\n2009\u20132010 Season\n2010\u20132011 Season\n2013\u20132014 Season\nRecord lows.\nThe show reached a record low of 1,931,000 viewers on August 22, 2008.

{"id": "60837", "revid": "1317379573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60837", "title": "Romaniote Jews", "text": "Greek-speaking Jewish community\nThe Romaniote Jews or the Romaniotes (, \"Rh\u014dmani\u00f4tes\"; ) are a Greek-speaking ethnic Jewish community. They are one of the oldest Jewish communities in existence and the oldest Jewish community in Europe. The Romaniotes have been, and even remain historically distinct from the Sephardim that have settled in Ottoman Greece after the expulsion of Jews from Spain and Portugal after 1492.\nTheir distinct language was Yevanic, a Greek dialect that contained Hebrew along with some Aramaic and Turkish words, but today's Romaniotes speak Modern Greek or the languages of their new home countries. Their name is derived from the endonym \"Rh\u014dman\u00eda\" (), which refers to the Eastern Roman Empire (\"Empire of the Romans\", ). Large Romaniote communities were located in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Arta, Preveza, Volos, Chalcis, Thebes, Corinth, Patras, and on the islands of Corfu, Crete, Zakynthos, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Rhodes, and Cyprus, among others. Additionally, the historically large community of Jews in Bulgaria was Romaniote until the arrival of Sephardim and Ashkenazim fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe.\nMost of the Jews of Greece were murdered in the Holocaust after the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II and the deportation of most of the Jews to Nazi concentration camps. After the war, a majority of the survivors emigrated to Israel, the United States, and Western Europe. Today there are still functioning Romaniote synagogues in Chalkis (which represents the oldest Jewish congregation on European soil), Ioannina, Veria, Athens, New York City, and Israel.\nName.\nThe name \"Romaniote\" refers to the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantium, which included the territory of modern Greece, which this Jewish group inhabited for centuries. Historically, the Empire was commonly referred to as \"Rh\u014dman\u00eda\" () and its Christian citizens as \"Rh\u014dma\u00eeoi\", \"Romans\" (), while the Greek-speaking Jews were called \"Rh\u014dmani\u00f4tes\" (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2), essentially meaning inhabitants of Rh\u014dman\u00eda.\nHistory.\nJews have lived in Greece since at least the Second Temple era (516 BCE \u2013 70 CE). Recorded Jewish presence in Greece dates back over 2,300 years to the time of Alexander the Great. The earliest reference to a Greek Jew is an inscription dated c.\u2009300\u2013250 BCE, found in Oropos, a small coastal town between Athens and Boeotia, which refers to \"Moschos, son of Moschion the Jew\", who may have been a slave.\nA Hellenistic Jewish synagogue was discovered in 1829 near the ancient military port of the capital of the island of Aegina by the Scottish-German historian Ludwig Ross, who was working for the court of King Otto of Greece. The floor was covered for protection and was studied again by Thiersch in 1901, Furtw\u00e4ngler in 1904, E. Sukenik in 1928 and Gabriel Welter in 1932 under the auspices of the National Archaeological Service. Based on the quality of the floor's mosaic, the building is believed to have been constructed in the 4th century CE (300\u2013350 CE) and used until the 7th century. The mosaic floor of the synagogue consists of multi-colored tesserae that create the impression of a carpet, in a geometric pattern of blue, gray, red and white. Two Greek inscriptions were found in front of the synagogue's entrance, on the western side of the building. Today, only part of the synagogue's mosaic floor is extant, and it has been moved from its original location to the courtyard of the island's Archaeological Museum.\nIn 1977 another ancient synagogue was discovered in Athens, the Synagogue in the Agora of Athens, which may be the synagogue in which Paul the Apostle preached. Inscriptions in the Samaritan and Greek alphabets found in Thessaloniki may originate from Samaritan synagogues. Concurrently the oldest synagogue found in the diaspora is also the oldest Samaritan synagogue: it is the Delos Synagogue, which has an inscription dated between 250 and 175 BCE\nThe Romaniotes are Greek Jews, distinct from both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, who trace back their history to the times of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Jews and can be subdivided in a wider sense in a Rabbanite community and in the Greco-Karaite community of the Constantinopolitan Karaites which still survives to this day. A Romaniote oral tradition says that the first Jews arrived in Ioannina shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Before the migration of the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi Jews into the Balkans and Eastern Europe, the Jewish culture in these areas consisted primarily of Romaniote Jews.\nThe Romaniote rites represent those of the Greek-speaking Jews of the Byzantine (or former Byzantine) Empire, ranging from southern Italy (in a narrower sense the Apulian, the Calabrian and the Sicilian Jewish communities) in the west, to much of Turkey in the east, Crete to the south, Crimea (the Krymchaks) to the north and the Jews of the early medieval Balkans and Eastern Europe.\nThe Sefer Yosippon was written down in the 10th century in Byzantine Southern Italy by the Greek-speaking Jewish community there. Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi, a Romaniote Jew from Achrida edited and expanded the Sefer Josippon later. This community of Byzantine Jews of southern Italy produced such prominent works like the Sefer Ahimaaz of Ahimaaz ben Paltiel, the Sefer Hachmoni of Shabbethai Donnolo, the Aggadath Bereshit and many Piyyutim. The liturgical writings of these Romaniote Jews, especially the piyyut were eminent for the development of the Ashkenazi Mahzor, as they found their way through Italy to Ashkenaz and are preserved to this day in the most Ashkenazi mahzorim.\nThe Jews of Southern Italy (where they were living together with their Greek-speaking Christian counterparts) continued to be Greek-speakers until the 15th century. When they were expelled and went to different regions of Greece, especially Corfu, Epirus and Thessaloniki, they could continue to speak their Greek language, even if this language was somewhat different from that of Greece.\nIn the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela travelled through the Byzantine Empire and recorded details about communities of Jews in Corfu, Arta, Aphilon, Patras, Corinth, Thebes, Chalkis, Thessaloniki, and Drama. The largest community in Greece at that time was in Thebes, where he found about 2000 Jews. They were engaged mostly in cloth dyeing, weaving, in the production of silverware and silk garments. At the time, they were already known as \"Romaniotes\".\nThe first Romaniote synagogue coming under Ottoman rule was \"Etz ha-Hayyim\" (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, lit. \"Tree of Life\", frequently a name of Romaniote synagogues) in Prousa in Asia Minor which passed to Ottoman authority in 1324. After the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, Sultan Mehmed II found the city in a state of disarray. The city had indeed suffered many sieges, a devastating conquest by Catholic Crusaders in 1204 and even a case of the Black Death in 1347, and now had been long cut off from its hinterland, so the city was a shade of its former glory. The event of the conquest of Constantinople was written down by a Romaniote Payetan in a lament hymn, composed with several phrases from the Old Testament in the \"shibusi style\".\nAs Mehmed wanted to make the city his new capital, he decreed its rebuilding. And in order to revivify Constantinople he ordered that Muslims, Christians and Jews from all over his empire be resettled in the new capital. Within months most of the Empire's Romaniote Jews, from the Balkans and Anatolia, were concentrated in Constantinople, where they made up 10% of the city's population. The forced resettlement, though not intended as an anti-Jewish measure, was perceived as an \"expulsion\" by the Jews. Nevertheless, the Romaniotes would remain the most influential Jewish community in the Empire for decades to come, determining the Chief Rabbis of the towns and the Hakham Bashi of the Ottoman Empire until their leading position was lost to a wave of new Jewish arrivals. These events initiated the first great numerical decline of the Romaniote community.\nThe number of Jews was soon bolstered by small groups of Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1421 and 1453. Waves of Sephardi Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492; many settled in Ottoman-ruled Greece. They spoke a separate language, Ladino. Thessaloniki had one of the largest (mostly Sephardi) Jewish communities in the world and a solid rabbinical tradition. On the island of Crete, the Jews historically played an important part in the transport trade. In the centuries following 1492 most of the Romaniote communities were assimilated by the more numerous Sephardim.\nThe status of Jewry in the Ottoman Empire often hinged on the whims of the sultan. Murad III for example ordered that the attitude of all non-Muslims should be one of \"humility and abjection\" and should not \"live near Mosques or in tall buildings\" or own slaves.\nAfter the liberation of Ioannina on February 21, 1913, the Rabbi and the Romaniote community of Ioannina welcomed at the New Synagogue of Ioannina the liberator of the city, Crown Prince Constantine, the future King of the Hellenes Constantine I.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Romaniote community of Ioannina numbered about 4,000 people, mostly lower-class tradesmen and craftsmen. Their numbers dwindled after that due to economic emigration; after the Holocaust and in the wake of World War II, there were approximately 1,950 Romaniotes left in Ioannina. Centered around the old fortified part of the city (or Kastro), where the community had been living for centuries, they maintained two synagogues, one of which, the Kehila Kedosha Yashan Synagogue still remains today.\nA strong Romaniote community was present in Corfu until the late 19th century, when a pogrom sparked by blood libel charges forced most of the Jewish community to leave the island.\nNusach and Minhag.\nThe Romaniote prayer rite (Nusach) as seen in the original \"Mahzor Romania\" and the Romaniote commentaries (Minhag) on Jewish exegesis and Jewish law, vary from those of the Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrachi Jews, and are closer to those of the Italian Jews: some of these are thought to have been based on the Jerusalem Talmud instead of the Babylonian Talmud (see Eretz-Yisrael minhag). This Minhag was once widespread in Southern Italy, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia and the Crimea.\nThe Romaniotes spoke Judaeo-Greek for a long time, and many of them still use the Greek language today. Tobiah ben Eliezer (\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8), a Greek-speaking Talmudist and poet of the 11th century, worked and lived in the city of Kastoria. He is the author of the \"Lekach Tov\", a midrashic commentary on the Pentateuch and the Five Megillot and also of some poems. Romaniote scholars translated the Tanakh into Greek. A polyglot edition of the Bible published in Constantinople in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) translation on one side, a Yevanic translation on the other and the Judaeo-Aramaic Targum at the bottom of the page.\nIn the early Romaniote rite the Torah was subdivided in Sedarim while the whole Torah was read in the Palestinian way of the Triennial cycle. The order for reading the Haftarah followed a specific custom, particular to the Romaniote rite. The Romaniote Torah scrolls are housed in \"tikim\" ('tik', from Greek \"th\u1e17k\u0113\", \u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 \"container\"), from which they are never completely taken out. Among the Romaniote Jews, tradition dictates, that the most holy Sefer Torah, the Law of Moses, be read with the scroll standing upright in its \"tik\"; it is considered improper to lay it flat.\nThe siddur (prayer book) for the Romaniote rite was known as the \"Mahzor Romania\". The Romaniote Jews have their own form of wedding blessing. Upon the betrothal, seven blessings are bestowed on the bride and groom to be, while wedding wreaths are covering the heads of the groom and the bride and are interchanged on their heads. At the end of a full year, the Ketubah was read at the wedding ceremony proper. This is different in that other Jews bless the bride and groom at the time of the actual wedding. In addition, there are ritual differences in the building of the Synagogue and in the building and the use of the mikve. It is a Romaniote tradition to write on the Ketubah the year since creation of the world and the year since the destruction of the Temple.\nThe Romaniotes traditionally gave to a child a mystical document known as an \"aleph\". This hand-painted \"birth and circumcision certificate\" was created by a family member and then handed down. The aleph was written in mystical codes for the purpose of warding off the wiles of Lillith, Adam's first wife.\nThe Romaniotes are well known for their hymns in Judaeo-Greek and Hebrew, for their special way of cantillation, based on the Byzantine melos and for their Jewish-Greek folksongs, based on regional melodies. Jewish immigrants from Sicily brought to Ioannina the celebration of the Sicilian Purim Katan. The Jews of Ioannina call this holiday \"Pourimopoulo\". They read the special \"Megillah for the Purim Katan of Syracuse\" and sing corresponding songs and hymns for this festivity.\nThe Mahzor of the Romaniote Kaffa Rite from the year 1735 gives the order to read the Megillat Antiochos in the Mincha of Shabbat Hanukkah. In the second half of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika. Today, the Romaniote Liturgy follows (with slight differences) the mainstream Sephardic usage, while the Romaniotes and the Jews of Corfu have preserved their old and own Judaeo-Greek and Hebrew \"piyyutim\", their own way of cantillation and their special customs. A custom, which is still followed in the Etz Hayyim Synagogue of Crete, is to read on Yom Kippur the Book of Jonah in Judaeo-Greek. Another custom was to chant the Song of Songs verse by verse by alternating from Hebrew to its paraphrasing Targum Jonathan translation after the morning service on the last two days of Pessach.\nRomaniote Synagogues have their own layout: the \"bimah\" (where the Torah scrolls are read out during services) is on a raised dais on the western wall, the Aron haKodesh (where the Torah scrolls are kept) is on the eastern wall and in the middle there is a wide interior aisle. Votive offerings made of silver as stars or tablets called \"shadayot\" were a thankful gift to the Synagogue of congregants who have received help, healing or salvation by God. The Romaniote term for the Passover ceremony (Seder) is \u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 (\"Hova\"), which means obligation. In 2004 the Jewish Museum of Greece published a Romaniote rite Pesach-Seder CD (\"The Ioannina Haggadah\"). In the years 2017 and 2018 the Romaniote rite Haggadah and the Romaniote rite prayer book (\"siddur\") have been published in a series, containing also Romaniote poetry, the haftarot according to the Romaniote custom and other texts. A Romaniote rite based reform \"siddur\" in Greek and Hebrew has also been published in 2018.\nLanguage and literature.\nThe intellectual pursuits of Romaniote Jews reflected in their history their geographical location within the Jewish and gentile world. Direct heir to Palestinian Jewish traditions on the one hand, they were also heir to the teachings of the Greco-Roman world. The Byzantine Jewish/Romaniote literature shows a rich blend of Hellenistic Jewish and Palestinian rabbinic traditions. Romaniote Jewry, throughout its history, expended great effort on religious poetry, which reached its peak during the period 1350\u20131550. The writing of piyyutim was clearly held as its own genre. In the twelfth century Hillel ben Eliakim wrote down his exegetical commentary, \"Sifre ve Sifra\". Shemarya HaIkriti who moved after 1328 to Negroponte prepared his supercommentary to Ibn Ezra and, circa 1346\u201347 wrote his \"Sefer Amasyahu\", a handbook of biblical apologetics. In tune with the intellectual currents among Romaniotes, Shemarya was trained in philosophy and was able to translate directly from Greek to Hebrew. The \"Sefer Yosippon\" was written by the Byzantine Jews of Southern Italy. R. Elnatan ben Moses Kalkes (from Kilkis) wrote a lengthy kabbalistic treatise entitled \"Eben Saphir\". Mordecai Komatiano has left a legacy of some fifteen works on astronomy, grammar (dikduk), biblical commentaries and piyyutim; some of the later have even been included in the Karaite prayerbook. Several manuscripts containing mystical works have survived. The question of an independent Romaniote mystical tradition, probably deriving directly from Palestinian antecedents, is proved. An abridgement of Aristotle's \"Logic\" by Yoseph HaYevani was made available to those Jews (Sephardi immigrants) who were less proficient in Greek. The Byzantine Karaites showed a knowledge of Greek philosophical terminology. Rabbinic authors spiced their comments with Greek phrases. The familiarity of Romaniote Jewry with the Greek language is well documented. Biblical translations, piyyutim, folksongs, Ketubbot, liturgical instructions, glossaries, mystical texts and the use of Greek words in commentaries in Judaeo-Greek are known.\nJudaeo-Greek.\nAfter World War II, the Judaeo-Greek language of Ioannina underwent a process of \"koinezation\". The only phonetic differences to Standard Modern Greek, which could be noted shortly after the war have been [x] &gt; [s] before front vowels, unusual intonation patterns and some peculiar lexical items, mostly of Hebrew-Aramaic provenance. Lexemes, such as Hebrew-Aramaic loans, were easily identified as \"ours\" and \"theirs,\" i.e., Sephardic vs. Romaniote. While composing texts on their religion, the Greek Jews followed the literary standards of Greek syntax and morphology, using a number of Hebrew-Aramaic loanwords. The Hebrew-Aramaic component would be written down in ways reflecting traditional Romaniote pronunciation, for example \"Shalom\", was spelled and written as \"Salom\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03bc).\nKrivoruchko states in her work \"Judeo-Greek in the era of globalization\" that Judaeo-Greek has always been interchangeable with the spoken variety of Greek, which was used by the surrounding Christian community, but had a few special features in its various geographical and chronological types (for example the Judaeo-Greek of Crete [\u2020 1945] and that of Constantinople). Besides the few phonetic differences between Judaeo-Greek and Standard Modern Greek the most common difference has been the use of Hebrew and Aramaic loanwords in Judaeo-Greek. Considerable are also the phonetic differences between Romaniote Hebrew (look downwards on paragraph \"Romaniote Hebrew\") and Sephardic Hebrew, for example Sephardic \"Shavuot\" was spelled as \"Sav\u00f3th\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03ce\u03b8) in Judaeo-Greek.\nSecond and third generation Romaniote immigrants in New York city have good knowledge of Greek. In the beginning of the 21st century 90% asserted that they understand Greek while 40% could speak Greek comfortably. Over a third could read Greek satisfactorily. The number of persons fluent in the Greek Language is much lower in the group of the Greek Sephardim outside of Greece.\nRomaniote Hebrew.\nThe Romaniote pronunciation of the Hebrew language is very close in its major features to the common Modern Hebrew pronunciation. The vowel-system is a simple five-vowel system without either quantitative or qualitative distinctions. Typical was the absence of distinction between: the Semitic velarized and non-velarized stops [t] and [\u1e6d], spelled [\u05ea/\u05d8], and [k/q], spelled [\u05db/\u05e7]. The distinction between [s] and [\u1e63] (\u05e1/\u05e6) is maintained as [s] vs. [ts], i. e., a voiceless alveolar fricative against a voiceless alveolar affricate, a pronunciation common to Byzantine and Ashkenazic pronunciation; \"strong\" and \"weak\" [t], spelled [\u05ea\u05bc/\u05ea] (t/\u03b8) preserved in Ashkenazic pronunciation as [t]/[s]; velar and pharyngeal [\u0127] and [\u03c7], spelled [\u05d7/\u05db], both of which are pronounced [\u03c7], as in Ashkenazic; the glottal and pharyngeal stops [\u0294] and [\u0295], spelled [\u05e2/\u05d0], both of which are weakened to the point of almost total absence in syllable-initial and syllable-final position, another characteristic shared with the Ashkenazic tradition. \u05e9\u05c1 was pronounced as [s] in the Romaniote tradition of Hebrew pronunciation. The loss of spirantization rule for postvocalic, non-geminated Old Hebrew b, d, g, p, t, k homorganic fricatives (this rule is not found now in either the Balkan or the North African Sephardic diaspora) may have been due Romaniote practice (it is observed partly in Yiddish Hebraisms and in the Ashkenazic pronunciation of monolingual Hebrew texts). The [\u05d6] was pronounced as and the [\u05d3] as [\u00f0] which are typical sounds of the Standard Modern Greek.\nThe Hebrew Paleography resp. the Hebrew Epigraphy recognises a specific \"Byzantine\" or \"Romaniote\" Handwriting system of the Hebrew alphabet, which has been developed among the Soferim of the Greek-speaking lands. In many cases manuscripts of Romaniote origin from the Byzantine Empire, or from later times can be recognised as \"Romaniote\", only with the science of Paleography, if they do not contain a Colophon (publishing) or other characteristics of identification.\nHolocaust and afterwards.\nDuring World War II, when Greece was occupied by Nazi Germany, 86% of the Greek Jews, especially those in the areas occupied by Nazi Germany and Bulgaria, were murdered. Some Greeks collaborated with the deportations or expropriated Jewish property; a few, encouraged by the Greek Orthodox Church, sheltered Jews. Roughly 49,000 Jews\u2014Romaniotes and Sephardim\u2014were deported from Thessaloniki alone and murdered. Many Greek Jews were forced to pay their own tickets to the death camps. Almost all Romaniote Jews of the island of Crete, together with some resistance fighters, died on the ship \"Tana\u1e2fs\" when it was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS \"Vivid\" on 9 June 1944.\nDuring the German occupation, the Romaniotes' ability to speak Greek enabled them to hide better from German deportations than Sephardi Jews who spoke Ladino.\nThe majority of Romaniotes who survived the Holocaust left for Israel or the United States at the end of the war. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948, combined with the violence and anarchy of the Greek Civil War (1946\u20131949), led to an immigration of a number of Romaniotes to Israel. The great earthquake on the island of Zakynthos in 1953 led the last remaining Romaniote Jews to leave the island towards Athens. The vast majority of Romaniotes have relocated to Israel and the United States, with the world's largest community located in New York.\nPresent day.\nToday approximately 4,500 to 6,000 Jews remain in Greece. Of these, only a small number are Romaniotes, who live mainly in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Chalkis and Athens. About 3,500 Jews now live in Athens, while another 1,000 live in Thessaloniki. A mixed community of Romaniote and Apulian Jews still lives on the Island of Corfu.\nGreece.\nAthens.\nThe Ioanniotiki Synagogue, situated above the Jewish Community of Athens offices at #8 Melidoni St., is the only Romaniote synagogue in Athens. Built in 1906, it now has services only during the High Holy Days, but can be opened for visitors upon request through the Jewish Community office.\nThe Jewish identity of another building found in the excavations of the ancient Agora in Athens, is questionable. It is believed that the Metroon, discovered in 1930 at the foot of the hill Hephaestion (Thesion) was used as a synagogue during its construction at the end of the 4th century CE (396\u2013400). This view was expressed by the archaeologist H. Thompson, from the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, but was not developed into a complete theory. The Jewish identity of the Metroon was based on a small piece of marble found near the Metroon that had two Jewish symbols carved on one side, and the resemblance of the building to the synagogue of Sardis in Asia Minor.\nChalkis.\nThe Romaniote Jewish Community of Chalkis is not the oldest one in Greece, but it is the only one in Europe that has been living in the same city for 2,500 years without interruption and the community is still active in the city's life. The community has a synagogue and a cemetery with important and old inscriptions. The Synagogue is on Kotsou Street. It is unknown when the first synagogue in Chalkis was constructed. In 1854, during the Holy Week a great fire destroyed the synagogue. In 1855 it was re-constructed in the same size with funds offered by Sophie de Marbois-Lebrun, Duchess of Plaisance. The Synagogue opens every Friday evening and occasionally on Shabbat morning.\nIoannina.\nIn Ioannina, the Romaniote community has dwindled to 50 mostly elderly people. The Kehila Kedosha Yashan Synagogue there is open primarily on the High Holidays, or in the case of the visit of a chazzan, or is opened for visitors on request. Immigrant Romaniotes return every summer to the old synagogue. After a long time a Bar Mitzvah (the Jewish ritual for celebrating the coming of age of a child) was held in the synagogue in 2000, and was an exceptional event for the community.\nThe synagogue is located in the old fortified part of the city known as \"Kastro\", at 16 Ioustinianou street. Its name means \"the Old Synagogue\". It was constructed in 1829, most probably over the ruins of an older synagogue. Its architecture is typical of the Ottoman era, a large building made of stone. The interior of the synagogue is laid out in the Romaniote way: the Bimah (where the Torah scrolls are read out during services) is on a raised dais on the western wall, the Aron haKodesh (where the Torah scrolls are kept) is on the eastern wall and in the middle there is a wide interior aisle. The names of the Ioanniote Jews who were killed in the Holocaust are engraved in stone on the walls of the synagogue. The Bet Chaim cemetery in Ioannina belongs to the community.\nVolos.\nIn the community of Volos many of the Romaniote pre-Sephardic traditions prevail. The community consists of Romaniotes as well as Sephardim (particularly from Larissa) and Corfiots. Ancient historic texts mention that Jews lived in the region of Magnesia, Thessaly and in particular in neighbouring Almyros as early as the 1st century AD. Historians argue that Jews have been living in ancient Demetrias since the 2nd century AD. Ancient Jewish tombstones dating back to 325\u2013641 AD, were also discovered in the neighbouring city of Phthiotic Thebes. Moshe Pesach was Rabbi of Volos who saved Greek Jews during the Holocaust and helped to consolidate the community of Volos after World War II.\nIsrael.\nMost Romaniotes in Israel live in Tel Aviv. There are two Romaniote synagogues in Israel: the Zakynthos Synagogue in Tel Aviv, and the Beit Avraham Ve'ohel Sarah liKehilat Ioanina in Nachlaot, Jerusalem. The former Romaniote Yanina Synagogue in the Christian Quarter, Jerusalem is no longer in use. In Beit Avraham Ve'ohel Sarah liKehilat Ioanina in Jerusalem, the prayers today follow the Sephardic rite, but they preserve a few piyyutim from the Romaniote rite.\nUnited States.\nOnly one Romaniote synagogue (from originally several Romaniote Synagogues in New York) is in operation in the entire Western Hemisphere: Kehila Kedosha Janina, at 280 Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where it is used by the Romaniote emigrant community. It maintains a mailing list of 3,000 Romaniote families, most of them living in the tri-state area. It is open for services every Saturday morning as well as all major Jewish holidays. The synagogue also houses a museum devoted to Greek Jewry and offers guided tours to visitors on Sundays. Like the community in Jerusalem, the prayers today follow the Sephardic rite, but they preserve a few piyyutim from the Romaniote rite.\nGenetics.\nDNA research and genealogical works based on the Romaniote communities of Ioannina and Zakynthos are in progress. Nearly 4/5th of the autosomal DNA of Ashkenazi Jews is related to that of Romaniote Jews. Romaniote Jewish men have been found to belong to various branches of Y-chromosomal haplogroups E1b1b1, G, J, Q, R1a, and R1b. In 2024, a team of researchers announced that a modern Romaniote Jewish man from Greece belongs to \"a previously undiscovered\" branch of the Y-chromosomal haplogroup J-P58 found to be \"dating straight back 7,000 years to the Neolithic era.\" Romaniote Jewish mitochondrial DNA haplogroups include HV1b2, U5b, and U6a3.\nNotable Romaniotes.\nByzantine times to the Ottoman Empire\nGreek-speaking Karaites of Constantinople\nModern times\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60839", "revid": "185457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60839", "title": "Ptolemy III Euergetes", "text": "3rd pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt (r. 246-222 BC)\nPtolemy III Euergetes (, \"Ptolemy the Benefactor\"; c. 280 \u2013 November/December 222 BC) was the third pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt from 246 to 222 BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom reached the height of its military and economic power during his kingship, as initiated by his father Ptolemy II Philadelphus.\nPtolemy III was the eldest son of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe I. When Ptolemy III was young, his mother was disgraced and he was removed from the succession. He was restored as heir to the throne in the late 250s BC and succeeded his father as king without issue in 246 BC. On his succession, Ptolemy III married Berenice II, reigning queen of Cyrenaica, thereby bringing her territory into the Ptolemaic realm. In the Third Syrian War (246\u2013241 BC), Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid empire and won a near total victory, but was forced to abandon the campaign as a result of an uprising in Egypt. In the aftermath of this rebellion, Ptolemy forged a closer bond with the Egyptian priestly elite, which was codified in the Canopus decree of 238 BC and set a trend for Ptolemaic power in Egypt for the rest of the dynasty. In the Aegean, Ptolemy III suffered a major setback when his fleet was defeated by the Antigonids at the Battle of Andros around 246 BC, but he continued to offer financial support to their opponents in mainland Greece for the rest of his reign. At his death, Ptolemy III was succeeded by his eldest son, Ptolemy IV.\nBackground and early life.\nPtolemy III was born some time around 280 BC, as the eldest son of Ptolemy II and his first wife Arsinoe I, daughter of King Lysimachus of Thrace. His father had become co-regent of Egypt in 284 BC and sole ruler in 282 BC. Around 279 BC, the collapse of Lysimachus' kingdom led to the return to Egypt of Ptolemy II's sister Arsinoe II, who had been married to Lysimachus. A conflict quickly broke out between Arsinoe I and Arsinoe II. Sometime after 275 BC, Arsinoe I was charged with conspiracy and exiled to Coptos. When Ptolemy II married Arsinoe II probably in 273/2 BC, her victory in this conflict was complete. As children of Arsinoe I, Ptolemy III and his two siblings seem to have been removed from the succession after their mother's fall. This political background may explain why Ptolemy III seems to have been raised on Thera in the Aegean, rather than in Egypt. His tutors included the poet and polymath Apollonius of Rhodes, later head of the Library of Alexandria.\nFrom 267 BC, a figure known as Ptolemy \"the Son\" was co-regent with Ptolemy II. He led naval forces in the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), but revolted in 259 BC at the beginning of the Second Syrian War and was removed from the co-regency. Some scholars have identified Ptolemy the Son with Ptolemy III. This seems unlikely, since Ptolemy III was probably too young to lead forces in the 260s and does not seem to have suffered any of the negative consequences that would be expected if he had revolted from his father in 259 BC. Chris Bennett has argued that Ptolemy the Son was a son of Arsinoe II by Lysimachus. Around the time of the rebellion, Ptolemy II legitimised the children of Arsinoe I by having them posthumously adopted by Arsinoe II.\nIn the late 250s BC, Ptolemy II arranged the engagement of Ptolemy III to Berenice, the sole child of Ptolemy II's half-brother King Magas of Cyrene. The decision to single Ptolemy III out for this marriage indicates that, by this time, he was the heir presumptive. On his father's death, Ptolemy III succeeded him without issue, taking the throne on 28 January 246 BC.\nReign.\nCyrenaica (246 BC).\nCyrene had been the first Ptolemaic territory outside Egypt, but Magas had rebelled against Ptolemy II and declared himself king of Cyrenaica in 276 BC. The aforementioned engagement of Ptolemy III to Berenice had been intended to lead to the reunification of Egypt and Cyrene after Magas' death. However, when Magas died in 250 BC, Berenice's mother Apame refused to honour the agreement and invited an Antigonid prince, Demetrius the Fair, to Cyrene to marry Berenice instead. With Apame's help, Demetrius seized control of the city, but he was assassinated by Berenice. A republican government, led by two Cyrenaeans named Ecdelus and Demophanes, controlled Cyrene for four years.\nIt was only with Ptolemy III's accession in 246 BC, that the wedding of Ptolemy III and Berenice seems to have actually taken place. Ptolemaic authority over Cyrene was forcefully reasserted. Two new port cities were established, named Ptolemais and Berenice (modern Tolmeita and Benghazi) after the dynastic couple. The cities of Cyrenaica were unified in a League overseen by the king, as a way of balancing the cities' desire for political autonomy against the Ptolemaic desire for control.\nThird Syrian War (246\u2013241 BC).\nIn July 246 BC, Antiochus II, king of the Seleucid empire, died suddenly. By his first wife Laodice I, Antiochus II had had a son, Seleucus II, who was about 19 years old in 246 BC. However, in 253 BC, he had agreed to repudiate Laodice and marry Ptolemy III's sister Berenice. Antiochus II and Berenice had a son named Antiochus, who was still an infant when his father died. A succession dispute broke out immediately after Antiochus II's death. Ptolemy III quickly invaded Syria in support of his sister and her son, marking the beginning of the Third Syrian War (also known as the Laodicean War).\nAn account of the initial phase of this war, written by Ptolemy III himself, is preserved on the Gurob papyrus. At the outbreak of war, Laodice I and Seleucus II were based in western Asia Minor, while the widowed Queen Berenice was in Antioch. The latter quickly seized control of Cilicia to prevent Laodice I from entering Syria. Meanwhile, Ptolemy III marched along the Levantine coast encountering minimal resistance. The cities of Seleucia and Antioch surrendered to him without a fight in late autumn. At Antioch, Ptolemy III went to the royal palace to plan his next moves with Berenice in person, only to discover that she and her young son had been murdered.\nRather than accept defeat in the face of this setback, Ptolemy III continued his campaign through Syria and into Mesopotamia, where he conquered Babylon at the end of 246 or beginning of 245 BC. In light of this success, he may have been crowned 'Great King' of Asia. Early in 245 BC, he established a governor of the land 'on the other side' of the Euphrates, indicating an intention to permanently incorporate the region into the Ptolemaic kingdom.\nAt this point however, Ptolemy III received notice that a revolt had broken out in Egypt and he was forced to return home to suppress it. By July 245 BC, the Seleucids had recaptured Mesopotamia. The Egyptian revolt is significant as the first of a series of native Egyptian uprisings which would trouble Egypt for the next century. One reason for this revolt was the heavy tax-burdens placed on the people of Egypt by Ptolemy III's war in Syria. Furthermore, papyri records indicate that the inundation of the Nile river failed in 245 BC, resulting in famine. Climate proxy studies suggest that this resulted from changes of the monsoon pattern at the time, resulting from a volcanic eruption which took place in 247 BC.\nAfter his return to Egypt and suppression of the revolt, Ptolemy III made an effort to present himself as a victorious king in both Egyptian and Greek cultural contexts. Official propaganda, like \"OGIS\" 54, an inscription set up in Adulis and probably the copy of an inscription in Alexandria, vastly exaggerated Ptolemy III's conquests, claiming even Bactria among his conquests. At the new year in 243 BC, Ptolemy III incorporated himself and his wife Berenice II into the Ptolemaic state cult, to be worshipped as the \"Theoi Euergetai\" (Benefactor Gods), in honour of his restoration to Egypt of statues found in the Seleucid territories, which had been seized by the Persians.\nThere may also have been a second theatre to this war in the Aegean. The general Ptolemy Andromachou, ostensibly an illegitimate son of Ptolemy II and the half-brother of Ptolemy III, captured Ephesus from the Seleucids in 246 BC. At an uncertain date around 245 BC, he fought a sea-battle at Andros against King Antigonus II of Macedon, in which the Ptolemaic forces were defeated. It appears that he then led an invasion of Thrace, where Maroneia and Aenus were under Ptolemaic control as of 243 BC. Ptolemy Andromachou was subsequently assassinated at Ephesus by Thracian soldiers under his control.\nThe only further action known from the war is some fighting near Damascus in 242 BC. Shortly after this, in 241 BC, Ptolemy made peace with the Seleucids, retaining all the conquered territory in Asia Minor and northern Syria. Nearly the whole Mediterranean coast from Maroneia in Thrace to the Syrtis in Libya was now under Ptolemaic control. One of the most significant acquisitions was Seleucia Pieria, the port of Antioch, whose loss was a significant economic and logistical set-back for the Seleucids.\nLater reign (241\u2013222 BC).\nThe conclusion of the Third Syrian War marked the end of military intervention in the Seleucid territories, but Ptolemy III continued to offer covert financial assistance to the opponents of Seleucus II. From 241 BC, this included Antiochus Hierax, the younger brother of Seleucus II, who rebelled against his brother and established his own separate kingdom in Asia Minor. Ptolemy III sent military forces to support him only when a group of Galatian mercenaries rebelled against him but is likely to have supported him more tacitly throughout his conflict with Seleucus II. He offered similar support to Attalus I, the dynast of Pergamum, who took advantage of this civil conflict to expand his territories in northwestern Asia Minor. When the Seleucid general Achaeus was sent in 223 BC to reconquer the territories in Asia Minor that had been lost to Attalus, Ptolemy III sent his son Magas with a military force to aid Attalus, but he was unable to prevent Attalus' defeat.\nPtolemy III maintained his father's hostile policy to Macedonia. This probably involved direct conflict with Antigonus II during the Third Syrian War, but after the defeat at Andros in c. 245 BC, Ptolemy III seems to have returned to the policy of indirect opposition, financing enemies of the Antigonids in mainland Greece. The most prominent of these was the Achaean League, a federation of Greek city-states in the Peloponnese that were united by their opposition to Macedon. From 243 BC, Ptolemy III was the nominal leader (\"hegemon\") and military commander of the League and supplied them with a yearly payment. After 240 BC, Ptolemy also forged an alliance with the Aetolian League in northwest Greece. From 238 to 234 BC, the two leagues waged the Demetrian War against Macedon with Ptolemaic financial support.\nHowever, in 229 BC, the Cleomenean War (229\u2013222 BC) broke out between the Achaean League and Cleomenes III of Sparta. As a result, in 226 BC, Aratos of Sicyon the leader of the Achaean League forged an alliance with the Macedonian king Antigonus III. Ptolemy III responded by immediately breaking off relations with the Achaean League and redirecting his financial support to Sparta. Most of the rest of the Greek states were brought under the Macedonian umbrella in 224 BC when Antigonus revived the Hellenic League of Philip II of Macedon under the name of the \"League of Leagues\". However Aetolia and Athens remained hostile to Macedon and redoubled their allegiance to Ptolemy III. In Athens, in 224 BC, extensive honours were granted to Ptolemy III to entrench their alliance with him, including the creation of a new tribe named Ptolemais in his honour and a new deme named Berenicidae in honour of Queen Berenice II. The Athenians instituted a state religious cult in which Ptolemy III and Berenice II were worshipped as gods, including a festival, the Ptolemaia. The centre of the cult was the Ptolemaion, which also served as the gymnasium where young male citizens undertook civic and military training.\nCleomenes III suffered serious defeats in 223 BC and Ptolemy III abandoned his support for him in the next year \u2013 probably as a result of an agreement with Antigonus. The Egyptian king seems to have been unwilling to commit actual troops to Greece, particularly as the threat of renewed war with the Seleucids was looming. Cleomenes III was defeated and forced to flee to Alexandria, where Ptolemy III offered him hospitality and promised to help restore him to power. However, these promises were not fulfilled, and the Cleomenian War would in fact be the last time that the Ptolemies intervened in mainland Greece.\nIn November or December 222 BC, shortly after Cleomenes' arrival in Egypt and Magas' failure in Asia Minor, Ptolemy III died of natural causes. He was succeeded by his son Ptolemy IV without incident.\nRegime.\nPharaonic ideology and Egyptian religion.\nPtolemy III built on the efforts of his predecessors to conform to the traditional model of the Egyptian pharaoh. He was responsible for the first known example of a series of decrees published as trilingual inscriptions on massive stone blocks in Ancient Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and demotic. Earlier decrees, like the Satrap stele and the Mendes stele, had been in hieroglyphs alone and had been directed at single individual sanctuaries. By contrast, Ptolemy III's Canopus decree was the product of a special synod of all the priests of Egypt, which was held in 238 BC. The decree instituted a number of reforms and represents the establishment of a full partnership between Ptolemy III as pharaoh and the Egyptian priestly elite. This partnership would endure until the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty. In the decree, the priesthood praise Ptolemy III as a perfect pharaoh. They emphasise his support of the priesthood, his military success in defending Egypt and in restoring religious artefacts supposedly held by the Seleucids, and his good governance, especially an incident when Ptolemy III imported, at his own expense, a vast amount of grain to compensate for a weak inundation. The rest of the decree consists of reforms to the priestly orders (\"phylai\"). The decree also added a leap day to the Egyptian calendar of 365 days, and instituted related changes in festivals. Ptolemy III's infant daughter Berenice died during the synod and the stele arranges for her deification and ongoing worship. Further decrees would be issued by priestly synods under Ptolemy III's successors. The best-known examples are the Decree of Memphis passed by his son Ptolemy IV in about 218 BC and the Rosetta Stone erected by his grandson Ptolemy V in 196 BC.\nThe Ptolemaic kings before Ptolemy III, his grandfather Ptolemy I and his father Ptolemy II, had followed the lead of Alexander the Great in prioritising the worship of Amun, worshipped at Karnak in Thebes among the Egyptian deities. With Ptolemy III the focus shifted strongly to Ptah, worshipped at Memphis. Ptah's earthly avatar, the Apis bull came to play a crucial role in royal new year festivals and coronation festivals. This new focus is referenced by two elements of Ptolemy III's Pharaonic titulary: his nomen which included the phrase \"Mery-Ptah\" (beloved of Ptah), and his golden Horus name, \"Neb khab-used mi ptah-tatenen\" (Lord of the Jubilee-festivals as well as Ptah Tatjenen).\nPtolemy III financed construction projects at temples across Egypt. The most significant of these was the Temple of Horus at Edfu, one of the masterpieces of ancient Egyptian temple architecture and now the best-preserved of all Egyptian temples. The king initiated construction on it on 23 August 237 BC. Work continued for most of the Ptolemaic dynasty; the main temple was finished in the reign of Ptolemy IV in 231 BC, and the full complex was only completed in 142 BC, during the reign of Ptolemy VIII, while the reliefs on the great pylon were finished in the reign of Ptolemy XII. Other construction work took place at a range of sites, including (from north to south):\nScholarship and culture.\nPtolemy III continued his predecessor's sponsorship of scholarship and literature. The Great Library in the Musaeum was supplemented by a second library built in the Serapeum. He was said to have had every book unloaded in the Alexandria docks seized and copied, returning the copies to their owners and keeping the originals for the Library. Galen attests that he borrowed the official manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides from Athens and forfeited the considerable deposit he paid for them in order to keep them for the Library rather than returning them. The most distinguished scholar at Ptolemy III's court was the polymath and geographer Eratosthenes, most noted for his remarkably accurate calculation of the circumference of the world. Other prominent scholars include the mathematicians Conon of Samos and Apollonius of Perge.\nRed Sea trade.\nPtolemy III's reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. In the 1930s, excavations by Mattingly at a fortress close to Port Dunford (the likely Nikon of antiquity) in present-day southern Somalia yielded a number of Ptolemaic coins. Among these pieces were 17 copper coins from the reigns of Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V, as well as late Imperial Rome and Mamluk Sultanate coins.\nMarriage and issue.\nPtolemy III married his half-cousin Berenice of Cyrene in 244/243 BC.

It grows up to tall and is cultivated for its aromatic resin, mainly on the Greek island of Chios, around the Turkish town of \u00c7e\u015fme and northern parts of Iraq.\nDescription.\nThe plant is evergreen, from high, with a strong smell of resin, growing in dry and rocky areas in North Africa and Mediterranean Europe. It resists mild to heavy frosts but prefers milder winters and grows on all types of soils, and can grow well in limestone areas and even in salty or saline environments, making it more abundant near the sea. It is also found in woodlands, dehesas (almost deforested pasture areas), Kermes oak woods, wooded areas dominated by other oaks, garrigues, maquis shrublands, hills, gorges, canyons, and rocky hillsides of the entire Mediterranean area. It is a typical species of Mediterranean mixed communities which include myrtle, Kermes oak, Mediterranean dwarf palm, buckthorn and sarsaparilla, and serves as protection and food for birds and other fauna in this ecosystem. It is a very hardy pioneer species dispersed by birds. When older, it develops some large trunks and numerous thicker and longer branches. In appropriate areas, when allowed to grow freely and age, it often becomes a tree of up to . However, logging, grazing, and fires often prevent its development.\nThe leaves are alternate, leathery, and paripinnately compound (i.e., pinnately compound without terminal leaflet) with five or six pairs of deep-green leaflets. It presents very small flowers, the male with five stamens, the female with a 3-part style. The fruit is a drupe, first red and then black when ripe, about in diameter. The fruit, although not commonly consumed, is edible and has a tart raisin-like flavour.\n\"Pistacia lentiscus\" is related to \"Pistacia terebinthus\", with which it hybridizes frequently in contact zones. \"Pistacia terebinthus\" is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate. The mastic tree does not reach the size of the \"Pistacia terebinthus\", but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish. The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets, i.e., the stalks are flattened and with side fins, whereas these stems in \"Pistacia terebinthus\" are simple. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, Canary Islands and Middle East, it can be confused with \"P. atlantica\".\nDistribution.\n\"Pistacia lentiscus\" is native throughout the Mediterranean region, from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and the Iberian Peninsula in the west through southern France and Turkey to Iraq and Iran in the east. It is also native to the Canary Islands.\nOrnamental use.\nIn urban areas near the sea, where \"palmitos\" or Mediterranean dwarf palms grow, and other exotic plants, it is often used in gardens and resorts, because of its strength and attractive appearance. Unlike other species of \"Pistacia\", it retains its leaves throughout the year. It has been introduced as an ornamental shrub in Mexico, where it has naturalized and is often seen primarily in suburban and semiarid areas where the summer rainfall climate, contrary to the Mediterranean, does not affect it.\nResin.\nThe aromatic, ivory-coloured resin, also known as mastic, is harvested as a spice from the cultivated mastic trees grown in the south of the Greek island of Chios in the Aegean Sea, where it is also known by the name \"Chios tears\". Originally liquid, it is hardened, when the weather turns cold, into drops or patties of hard, brittle, translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white and opaque gum.\nThe word mastic derives from the Latin word (to chew), in Greek: \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03c9 verb \"mastichein\" (\"to gnash the teeth\", the English word completely from the Latin masticate) or \"massein\" (\"to chew\").\nWithin the European Union, mastic production in Chios is granted protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication names.&lt;ref name=\"EU PDO/PGI registration\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although the tree is native to all of the Mediterranean region, it will release its resin only on selected places, most notably, around Cesme, Turkey and in the southern portion of the Greek island of Chios, the latter being the only place in the world where it is cultivated regularly. The island's mastic production is controlled by a co-operative of \"medieval\" villages, collectively known as the 'mastichochoria' (\u039c\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, lit. \"mastic villages\").\nCultivation history.\nThe resin is collected by bleeding the trees from small cuts made in the bark of the main branches, and allowing the sap to drip onto the specially prepared ground below. The harvesting is done during the summer between July and September. After the mastic is collected, it is washed manually and is set aside to dry, away from the sun, as it will start melting again.\nMastic resin is a relatively expensive kind of spice; it has been used principally as a chewing gum over centuries. The flavour can be described as a strong, slightly smoky, resiny aroma and can be an acquired taste.\nCulinary use.\nMastic gum is principally used either as a flavouring or for its gum properties, as in mastic chewing gum.\nAs a spice, it continues to be used in Greece to flavour spirits and liqueurs (such as Chios's native drink \"mastiha\"), chewing gum, and a number of cakes, pastries, spoon sweets, and desserts. Sometimes, it is even used in making cheese. Mastic resin is a key ingredient in \"dondurma\" and Turkish puddings, giving those confections their unusual texture and bright whiteness. In Lebanon and Egypt, the spice is used to flavour many dishes, ranging from soups to meats to desserts, while in Morocco, smoke from the resin is used to flavour water. In Turkey, mastic is used as a flavor of Turkish delight. In the Kurdish parts of Iraq, the fresh resin is used as a spice particularly used for Torshi.\nMastic resin is a key ingredient in Greek festival breads, for example, the sweet bread \"tsoureki\" and the traditional New Year's \"vasilopita\". Furthermore, mastic is also essential to \"myron\", the holy oil used for chrismation by the Orthodox Churches.\nFolk medicine.\nMastic has been used in the Mediterranean region with the belief it has folk medicine properties, as indicated by first-century Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides in the treatise \"De Materia Medica\" (\"About Medical Substances\").\nMiscellanea.\nMastic gum is used in the production of high-grade varnish.\nA related species, \"P.\u00a0saportae\", has been shown by DNA analysis to be a hybrid between maternal \"P.\u00a0lentiscus\" and paternal \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" (terebinth or turpentine). The hybrid has imparipinnate leaves, with leaflets semipersistent, subsessile terminal, and sometimes reduced. Usually, \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" and\" P.\u00a0lentiscus\" occupy different biotopes and barely overlap: Mastic appears at lower elevations and near the sea, while the \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" most frequently inhabits inland and mountainous areas such as the Iberian System.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Baden-Powell wrote \"Scouting for Boys\", which with his previous books \u2013 such as his 1884 \"Reconnaissance and Scouting\" and his 1899 \"Aids to Scouting for N.-C.Os and Men\", which was intended for the military, and \"The Scout\" magazine \u2013 helped the rapid growth of the Scout Movement.\nEducated at Charterhouse School, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. His books, written for military reconnaissance and scout training, were also read by boys and used by teachers and youth organisations. In August 1907, he held an experimental camp, the Brownsea Island Scout camp to test his ideas for training boys in scouting. He wrote \"Scouting for Boys\", published in 1908 by C. Arthur Pearson Limited, for boy readership. In 1910, Baden-Powell retired from the army and formed The Scout Association.\nIn 1909, a rally of Scouts was held at The Crystal Palace. Many girls in Scout uniform attended and, in front of the press, a small group told Baden-Powell that they were the \"Girl Scouts\". In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes started The Girl Guides Association. In 1912, Baden-Powell married Olave St Clair Soames. He gave guidance to The Scout Association and Girl Guides Association until retiring in 1937. Baden-Powell lived his last years in Nyeri, Kenya, where he died and was buried in 1941. His grave is a national monument.\nEarly life.\nBaden-Powell was the penultimate son of Baden Powell, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford and Church of England priest, and his third wife, Henrietta Grace n\u00e9e Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth. After his father died in 1860, his mother, to identify her children with her late husband's fame, styled the family name \"Baden-Powell\". The name was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902. Baden-Powell's father's family originated in Suffolk. His mother's earliest known Smyth ancestor was a Royalist American colonist; her mother's father Thomas Warington was the British Consul in Naples around 1800.\nBaden-Powell was born Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington, London, on 22 February 1857. He was called Stephe (pronounced \"Stevie\") by his family. He was named after his godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer, and his third name was his mother's surname. Baden-Powell had four older half-siblings from the second of his father's two previous marriages and was the fifth surviving child of his father's third marriage:\nThe three children immediately preceding Baden-Powell had all died very young before he was born, so there was a seven-year gap between him and his next older brother Frank; so he and his two younger siblings were almost like a separate family, of which he was the eldest. His father died when Baden-Powell was three, so he was raised by his single mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. In 1933, he said of her, \"The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother.\"\nBaden-Powell attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells, and was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school named after the ancient Carthusian monastery buildings it occupied in the City of London. While he was a pupil there, the school moved out to new purpose-built premises in the countryside near Godalming in Surrey. He played with dolls and learnt the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. Baden-Powell's first introduction to outdoor skills was through stalking and cooking games while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds.\nMilitary career.\nIn 1876, Baden-Powell joined the 13th Hussars in India with the rank of lieutenant. In 1880 he was charged with the task of drawing maps of the Battle of Maiwand. He enhanced and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal Province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was mentioned in dispatches. In 1890, he was brevetted Major as military secretary and senior aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. He was posted to Malta for three years, also working as an intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. He wrote that he once travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 he published \"Reconnaissance and Scouting\".\nBaden-Powell returned to Africa in 1896, and served in the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo. This was a formative experience for him not only because he commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e., Scoutcraft), and here that he was introduced to Montana Peaked version of a western cowboy hat, of which Stetson was a prolific manufacturer, and which also came to be known as a campaign hat and the many versatile and practical uses of a neckerchief.\nBaden-Powell was accused of illegally executing a prisoner of war in 1896, the Matabele chief Uwini, who had been promised his life would be spared if he surrendered. Uwini was sentenced to be shot by firing squad by a military court, a sentence Baden-Powell confirmed. Baden-Powell was cleared by a military court of inquiry, but the colonial civil authorities wanted a civil investigation and trial. Baden-Powell later claimed he was \"released without a stain on my character\".\nAfter Rhodesia, Baden-Powell served in the Fourth Ashanti War on the Gold Coast. In 1897, at the age of 40, he was brevetted colonel (the youngest colonel in the British Army) and given command of the 5th Dragoon Guards in India. A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled \"Aids to Scouting\", a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, much of it a written explanation of the lessons he had learned from Burnham, to help train recruits.\nMafeking.\nBaden-Powell returned to South Africa before the Second Boer War. Although instructed to maintain a mobile mounted force on the frontier with the Boer Republics, Baden-Powell amassed stores and established a garrison at Mafeking. The subsequent Siege of Mafeking lasted 217 days. Although Baden-Powell could have destroyed his stores and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of the siege, especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell the town or its forces, he remained in the town to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating their horses. The town had been surrounded by a Boer army, at times above 8,000 men.\nThe siege of the small town received much attention from both the Boers and international media because Lord Edward Cecil, the son of the British Prime Minister, was besieged in the town. The garrison held out until relieved, in part thanks to cunning deceptions, many devised by Baden-Powell. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers pretended to avoid non-existent barbed wire while moving between trenches. Baden-Powell did much reconnaissance work himself. In one instance, noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line, Baden-Powell loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and sent it down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a successful attack.\nA view expressed by historian Thomas Pakenham of Baden-Powell's actions during the siege argued that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians, including members of his own African garrison. Pakenham claimed that Baden-Powell drastically reduced the rations to the native garrison. By 2001, after subsequent research, Pakenham changed this view.\nDuring the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals and so on, freeing grown men to fight. Baden-Powell did not form the Cadet Corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege; however, he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of \"Scouting for Boys\".\nThe siege was lifted on 17 May 1900. Baden-Powell was promoted to major-general and became a national hero; however, British military commanders were more critical of his performance and even less impressed with his subsequent choices to again allow himself to be besieged. Ultimately, his failure to understand properly the situation, and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River Pakenham claimed led to his being removed from action.\nAfter Mafeking.\nBriefly back in the United Kingdom in October 1901, Baden-Powell was invited to visit King Edward VII at Balmoral, the monarch's Scottish retreat, and personally invested as Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). Baden-Powell was given the role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force; during this phase, Baden-Powell was sent to Britain on sick leave, so he was only in command for seven months.\nBaden-Powell returned to England to take up the post of Inspector-General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding this position, he was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving the force an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals. Baden-Powell was a career cavalryman but realised that cavalry was no match against the machine gun; however, his superiors, Kitchener and French, the latter also a career cavalryman, still regarded the cavalry as indispensable, with the result that cavalry was used in the First World War with little effect, yet the major item exported from Britain to Flanders during the War was horse fodder.\nIn 1907, Baden-Powell was promoted to Lieutenant-General but put on the inactive list. In October 1907, he was appointed to the command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Army. During this appointment, Baden-Powell selected the location of Catterick Garrison to replace Richmond Castle which was then the Headquarters of the Northumbrian Division. \nOn 19 February 1909, facing censure for his public comments about Germany as an enemy, Baden-Powell abruptly sailed in the SS \"Aragon\" via Portugal and Spain to South America. The \"Belfast Newsletter\" reported that when in March 1909 he visited Santiago de Chile for three days, \"He was given a warmer reception than had ever been afforded a foreigner in South America.\" He sailed back in the RMS Danube by 1 May 1909. In 1910, aged 53, Baden-Powell was retired from the Army. In 1915, Baden-Powell's book \"My Adventures as a Spy\" was published, lending to false suggestions he had been active as a spy during the war.\nScout Movement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Noitalic/styles.css\"/&gt;Pronunciation of Baden-Powell\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Noitalic/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMan, matron, maiden,\nPlease call it Baden.\nFurther for Powell,\nRhyme it with Noel&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014Verse by B-P\nOn his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, \"Aids to Scouting\", had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations, including Charlotte Mason's House of Education. Following his involvement in the Boys' Brigade as a Brigade vice-president and officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from Sir William Alexander Smith, Baden-Powell decided to re-write \"Aids to Scouting\" to suit a youth readership. In August 1907, he held a camp on Brownsea Island to test out his ideas. About twenty boys attended: eight from local Boys' Brigade companies, and about twelve public school boys, mostly sons of his friends.\nBaden-Powell was influenced by Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book \"The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" and they met in 1906. Baden-Powell's \"Scouting for Boys\" was published in six installments in 1908 and has sold approximately 150 million copies as the fourth best-selling book of the 20th century.\nBoys, as well as girls, spontaneously formed Scout troops. The Scout Movement had started by itself, first as a national, and soon an international phenomenon. A rally of Scouts was held at Crystal Palace in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell met some of the first Girl Scouts of whom 6,000 had already been registered as Scouts. In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, formed The Girl Guides Association. In 1912, Baden-Powell started a world tour with a voyage to the Caribbean. Another passenger was Juliette Gordon Low, an American who had been running a Guide Company in Scotland and was returning to the U.S.A. Baden-Powell encouraged her to found the Girl Scouts of the USA.\nIn 1929, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, he received as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007 and it has been purchased by a charity, B\u2013P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase the car. Baden-Powell also had impacts on youth education. By 1922, there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939, the number of Scouts was over 3.3 million.\nEarly Scout Association \"Thanks badges\" (from 1911) and The Scout Association \"Medal of Merit\" badge had a swastika symbol on them. This was undoubtedly influenced by the use by Rudyard Kipling of the swastika on the jacket of his published books, including \"The Jungle Book\", which was used by Baden-Powell as a basis for the Wolf Cubs. The swastika had been a symbol of luck in India long before being adopted by the Nazi Party in 1920, and when Nazi use of the swastika became more widespread, the Scouts stopped using it.\nNazi Germany banned Scouting, a competitor to the Hitler Youth, in June 1934, seeing it as \"a haven for young men opposed to the new State\". Based on the regime's view of Scouting as a dangerous espionage organisation, Baden-Powell's name was included in \"The Black Book\", a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom. A drawing by Baden-Powell depicts Scouts assisting refugees fleeing from the Nazis and Hitler. Tim Jeal, the author of the biography \"Baden-Powell\", gives his opinion that \"Baden-Powell's distrust of communism led to his implicit support, through na\u00efvet\u00e9, of fascism\", an opinion based on two of Baden-Powell's diary entries. Baden-Powell met Benito Mussolini on 2 March 1933, and in his diary described him as \"small, stout, human and genial. Told me about Balilla and workmen's outdoor recreations which he imposed through 'moral force'.\" On 17 October 1939, Baden-Powell wrote in his diary: \"Lay up all day. Read \"Mein Kampf\". A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc. \u2013 and ideals which Hitler does not practice himself.\"\nAt the 5th World Scout Jamboree in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to Scouting and retired from public Scouting life. 22 February, the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as Founder's Day by Scouts and World Thinking Day by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World. In his final letter to the Scouts, Baden-Powell wrote:I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have a happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. \"Be prepared\" in this way, to live happy and to die happy \u2013 stick to your Scout Promise always \u2013 even after you have ceased to be a boy \u2013 and God help you to do it.\nBaden-Powell died on 8 January 1941; his grave is in St Peter's Cemetery in Nyeri, Kenya. His gravestone bears a circle with a dot in the centre \"\u0298\", which is the trail sign for \"Going home\", or \"I have gone home\". His wife Olave moved back to England in 1942; after she died in 1977, her ashes were taken to Kenya by her grandson Robert and interred beside her husband. In 2001, the Kenyan government declared Baden-Powell's grave a national monument.\nWritings and publications.\nBaden-Powell published books and other texts during his years of military service both to finance his life and to generally educate his men.\nBaden-Powell was regarded as an excellent storyteller. During his whole life he told \"ripping yarns\" to audiences. After having published \"Scouting for Boys\", Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout movement and his ideas for its future. He spent most of the last two years of his life in Africa, and many of his later books had African themes.\nMost of his books (the American editions) are available online. Compilations and excerpts comprised:\nBaden-Powell contributed to various other books, either with an introduction or foreword, or being quoted by the author, including:\nA comprehensive bibliography of his original works has been published by Biblioteca Frati Minori Cappuccini.\nArt.\nBaden-Powell's father often sketched caricatures of those present at meetings, while his maternal grandmother was also artistic. Baden-Powell painted or sketched almost every day of his life, and with equal competence with either hand. Most of his works have a humorous or informative character. His books are scattered with his pen-and-ink sketches, frequently whimsical. He did a largely unknown number of pen-and-ink sketches; he always travelled with a sketchpad that he used frequently for pencil sketches and \"cartoons\" for later watercolour paintings. He also created a few sculptures. There is no catalogue of his works, many of which appear in his books, and twelve paintings hang in the British Scout Headquarters at Gilwell Park. There was an exhibition of his work at the Willmer House Museum, Farnham, Surrey, from 11 April \u2013 12 May 1967; a text-only catalogue was produced.\nPersonal life.\nIn January 1912, Baden-Powell was en route to New York on a world speaking tour, on the ocean liner , when he met Olave St Clair Soames. She was 23, and he was 55; they shared the same birthday, 22 February. They were engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell's fame. They married privately on 30 October 1912 to avoid press intrusion at St. Peter's Church, Parkstone. Roughly 100,000 Scouts had each donated a penny (1\"d\") to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift: a 20-horsepower Standard Motor Company car (not the Rolls-Royce they were presented in 1929). There is a display about their marriage inside St. Peter's Church, Parkstone. Baden-Powell began to suffer persistent headaches, considered by his doctor to be a psychosomatic illness and treated with dream analysis.\nBaden-Powell and his wife had three children: \nWhen Olave's sister, Auriol Davidson (n\u00e9e\u00a0Soames), died in 1919, Olave and Robert took her three daughters into their family and raised them.\nIn 1919, the couple moved to Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire, named as such as it was bought on Armistice Day (11 November 1918). The Bentley house was a gift from her father. \nIn 1939, they moved to a cottage he had commissioned in Nyeri, Kenya, near Mount Kenya, where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named \"Paxtu\", was located on the grounds of the Outspan Hotel, owned by Eric Sherbrooke Walker, Baden-Powell's first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors. Walker also owned the Treetops Hotel, approximately 10 miles (17 km) out in the Aberdare Range, often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the Happy Valley set. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small museum.\nThree of Baden-Powell's many biographers commented\u2014after his wife had died in 1977\u2014on his sexuality; the first two (in 1979 and 1986) focused on his relationship with his close friend Kenneth McLaren. Tim Jeal's 1989 biography discusses the relationship and finds no evidence that this friendship was erotic. Jeal then examines Baden-Powell's views on women, his appreciation of the male form, his military relationships, and his marriage, concluding that, in his personal opinion, Baden-Powell was a repressed homosexual. Jeal's arguments and conclusion are dismissed by Procter and Block (2009) as \"amateur psychoanalysis\", for which there is no physical evidence.\nRecognition.\nIn 1937, Baden-Powell was appointed to the Order of Merit, one of the most exclusive awards in the British honours system, and he was also awarded 28 decorations by foreign states, including the Grand Officer of the Portuguese Order of Christ, the Grand Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer (1920), the Commander of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur (1925), the First Class of the Hungarian Order of Merit (1929), the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark, the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion, the Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix, and the Order of Polonia Restituta.\nThe Scout Association's Silver Wolf Award was originally worn by Robert Baden-Powell. The World Organization of the Scout Movement's Bronze Wolf Award, for exceptional services to world Scouting, was first awarded to Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then \"International Committee\" on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. He was also the first recipient of the Boy Scouts of America's Silver Buffalo Award in 1926.\nIn 1927, at the Swedish National Jamboree, he was awarded by the \"\u00d6sterreichischer Pfadfinderbund\" with the \"\"Gro\u00dfes Dankabzeichen des \u00d6PB\". In 1931, Baden-Powell received the highest award of the First Austrian Republic (\"Gro\u00dfes Ehrenzeichen der Republik am Bande\") out of the hands of President Wilhelm Miklas. Baden-Powell was also one of the first and few recipients of the \"Goldene Gemse\", the highest award conferred by the \u00d6sterreichischer Pfadfinderbund.\nIn 1931, Major Frederick Russell Burnham dedicated Mount Baden-Powell in California to his friend from forty years before. Today, their friendship is honoured in perpetuity with the dedication of the adjoining peak, Mount Burnham. Baden-Powell was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize on numerous occasions, including 10 separate nominations in 1928. He was awarded the Wateler Peace Prize in 1937. In 2002, Baden-Powell was named 13th in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. As part of the Scouting 2007 Centenary, Nepal renamed Urkema Peak to Baden-Powell Peak.\nIn June 2020, following the George Floyd protests in Britain and the removal of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council (BCP Council) announced that a statue of Baden-Powell on Poole Quay would be removed temporarily for its protection, amid fears for its safety. Police believed it was on a list of monuments to be destroyed or removed, and that it was a target for protestors due to perceptions that Baden-Powell had held homophobic and racist views. The statue was installed by Poole Borough Council in 2008.\nFollowing opposition to its removal, including from residents, and past and present scouts, some of whom camped nearby to ensure it stayed in place, BCP Council had the statue boarded up instead. Mark Howell, deputy leader of BCP Council was quoted as saying, \"It is our intention that the boarding is removed at the earliest, safe opportunity.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They dwelt in Goshen up until the time of the Exodus, when they left Egypt. It is believed to have been located in the eastern Nile Delta, lower Egypt; perhaps at or near Avaris, the seat of power of the Hyksos kings.\nBiblical text.\nThe land of Goshen is mentioned in the biblical books of Genesis and Exodus. In the story of Joseph, which comprises the final chapters of Genesis, the patriarch Jacob is facing famine and sends ten of his sons to Egypt to buy grain. Joseph, another of Jacob's sons, is a high official in Egypt and allows his father and brothers to settle in Egypt. In Genesis 45:10, Goshen is treated as being close to Joseph, who lives at the pharaoh's court and in Genesis 47:5 Goshen is called \"the best part\" of the land of Egypt. But it is also implied to be somewhat set apart from the rest of Egypt, because Joseph tells his family to present themselves to the pharaoh as keepers of livestock, \"in order that you may settle in the land of Goshen, because all shepherds are abhorrent to the Egyptians.\" Genesis 47:11 interchanges the \"land of Ramesses\" with Goshen: \"Joseph settled his father and his brothers and granted them a holding in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Ramesses, as Pharaoh had instructed.\"\nIn Exodus, Jacob's descendants, the Israelites, continue to live in Egypt and grow numerous. The name of Goshen appears only twice in Exodus, in the narration of the Plagues of Egypt, in which Goshen as the dwelling place of the Israelites is spared the plague of flies and plague of hail that afflict the Egyptians.\nA place named Goshen is also mentioned in the Book of Joshua, where the Israelites are continuing with their conquest of the Promised Land. Joshua 11:16 states: \"So Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland.\" However, this Goshen is generally considered to refer to a region located in the east of Judah between the Negev and the Hill Country, rather than to the Egyptian Goshen.\nEtymology.\nSome Egyptologists have suggested a connection with the name \"gsm\" used in reference to a lake in \"Papyrus Anastasi IV\", as the name appears to have been used as a toponym in the W\u0101d\u012b \u1e6cum\u012bl\u0101t. This name \"gsm\" is considered by some scholars to have been most probably a Semitic loanword, possibly deriving from the Semitic root \"g\u0161m\" \"rain, storm\". Donald Redford, while not disputing the location of Goshen, gives a different origin for the name, deriving it from \"Gasmu,\" the rulers of the Bedouin Qedarites who occupied the eastern Delta from the 7th century BCE, but John Van Seters thinks this unlikely. Mark Janzen argues that the lack of references to the Land of Goshen in biblical texts from the 6th century BCE or later makes Redford's proposal unlikely.\nIdentification.\nIn 1885, \u00c9douard Naville identified Goshen as the 20th nome of Egypt, located in the eastern Delta, and known as \"Gesem\" or \"Kesem\" during the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt (672\u2013525 BCE). It covered the western end of the Wadi Tumilat, the eastern end being the district of Succoth, which had Pithom as its main town, extended north as far as the ruins of Pi-Ramesses (the \"land of Rameses\"), and included both crop land and grazing land.\nThe scholars Isaac Rabinowitz, Israel Eph\u02bfal, Jan Rets\u00f6, and David F. Graf identify the land of Goshen with the parts of the Qedarite kingdom of \"Arabia\" located to the east of the Nile Delta and around Pithom, and which became known to ancient Egyptians as () and to Jews as the (), that is the lit.\u2009'Land of Ge\u0161em', after either the Qedarite king Ge\u0161em or after his dynasty. Although the scholar John Van Seters has opposed the identification of \u02beEre\u1e63 G\u014d\u0161en with the Qedarite territories in eastern Egypt based on claims that the Qedarites never ruled the region of the W\u0101d\u012b \u1e6cum\u012bl\u0101t, the discovery in the W\u0101d\u012b \u1e6cum\u012bl\u0101t region of Qedarite remains, such as a shrine to the goddess al-L\u0101t, makes Van Seters's opposition to this identification untenable.\nThe scholars Sarah I. Groll, Manfred Bietak and Mark Janzen reject any connection between the Land of Goshen and the territories of the Qedarite king Ge\u0161em, proposing instead that the biblical placename is related to the lake \"gsm\" mentioned in \"Papyrus Anastasi IV\". In their view, the biblical land should be identified with the western part of the W\u0101d\u012b \u1e6cum\u012bl\u0101t with its large overflow lake.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The empty product, is a final object and the empty product in the case of an empty diagram, an initial object. Both being limits, they are not finite products nor coproducts. \nThus an additive category is equivalently described as a preadditive category admitting all finitary products and with the null object or a preadditive category admitting all finitary coproducts and with the null object\nVia semiadditive categories.\nWe give an alternative definition.\nDefine a semiadditive category to be a category (note: not a preadditive category) which admits a zero object and all binary biproducts. It is then a remarkable theorem that the Hom sets naturally admit an abelian monoid structure. A proof of this fact is given below.\nAn additive category may then be defined as a semiadditive category in which every morphism has an additive inverse. This then gives the Hom sets an abelian group structure instead of merely an abelian monoid structure.\nGeneralization.\nMore generally, one also considers additive R-linear categories for a commutative ring R. These are categories enriched over the monoidal category of R-modules and admitting all finitary biproducts.\nExamples.\nThe original example of an additive category is the category of abelian groups Ab. The zero object is the trivial group, the addition of morphisms is given pointwise, and biproducts are given by direct sums.\nMore generally, every module category over a ring R is additive, and so in particular, the category of vector spaces over a field K is additive.\nThe algebra of matrices over a ring, thought of as a category as described below, is also additive.\nInternal characterisation of the addition law.\nLet C be a semiadditive category, so a category having all finitary biproducts. Then every hom-set has an addition, endowing it with the structure of an abelian monoid, and such that the composition of morphisms is bilinear.\nMoreover, if C is additive, then the two additions on hom-sets must agree. In particular, a semiadditive category is additive if and only if every morphism has an additive inverse.\nThis shows that the addition law for an additive category is \"internal\" to that category.\nTo define the addition law, we will use the convention that for a biproduct, \"pk\" will denote the projection morphisms, and \"ik\" will denote the injection morphisms.\nThe \"diagonal morphism\" is the canonical morphism \u2206: \"A\" \u2192 \"A\" \u2295 \"A\", induced by the universal property of products, such that \"p\"\"k\"\u2009\u2218\u2009\u2206 = 1\"A\" for \"k\" = 1,\u20092. Dually, the \"codiagonal morphism\" is the canonical morphism \u2207: \"A\" \u2295 \"A\" \u2192 \"A\", induced by the universal property of coproducts, such that \u2207\u2009\u2218\u2009\"i\"\"k\" = 1\"A\" for \"k\" = 1,\u20092.\nFor each object A, we define:\nNext, given two morphisms \u03b1\"k\": \"A\" \u2192 \"B\", there exists a unique morphism \u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12: \"A\" \u2295 \"A\" \u2192 \"B\" \u2295 \"B\" such that \"p\"\"l\" \u2218 (\u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12) \u2218 \"i\"\"k\" equals \u03b1\"k\" if \"k\" = \"l\", and 0 otherwise.\nWe can therefore define \u03b11 + \u03b12 := \u2207 \u2218 (\u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12) \u2218 \u2206.\nThis addition is both commutative and associative. The associativity can be seen by considering the composition\nformula_1\nWe have \u03b1 + 0 = \u03b1, using that \u03b1 \u2295 0 = \"i\"1\u2009\u2218\u2009\u03b1\u2009\u2218\u2009\"p\"1.\nIt is also bilinear, using for example that \u2206 \u2218 \u03b2 = (\u03b2 \u2295 \u03b2) \u2218 \u2206 and that (\u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12) \u2218 (\u03b21 \u2295 \u03b22) = (\u03b11 \u2218 \u03b21) \u2295 (\u03b12 \u2218 \u03b22).\nWe remark that for a biproduct \"A\" \u2295 \"B\" we have \"i\"1\u2009\u2218\u2009\"p\"1 + \"i\"2\u2009\u2218\u2009\"p\"2 = 1. Using this, we can represent any morphism \"A\" \u2295 \"B\" \u2192 \"C\" \u2295 \"D\" as a matrix.\nMatrix representation of morphisms.\nGiven objects \"A\"1,\u2009...,\u2009\"An\" and \"B\"1,\u2009...,\u2009\"Bm\" in an additive category, we can represent morphisms \"f\": \"A\"1 \u2295 \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u2295 \"An\" \u2192 \"B\"1 \u2295 \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u2295 \"Bm\" as m-by-n matrices\nformula_2 where formula_3\nUsing that \u2211\"k\" \"i\"\"k\"\u2009\u2218\u2009\"p\"\"k\" = 1, it follows that addition and composition of matrices obey the usual rules for matrix addition and multiplication.\nThus additive categories can be seen as the most general context in which the algebra of matrices makes sense.\nRecall that the morphisms from a single object\u00a0A to itself form the endomorphism ring End\u2009\"A\".\nIf we denote the n-fold product of\u00a0A with itself by \"A\"\"n\", then morphisms from \"An\" to \"Am\" are \"m\"-by-\"n\" matrices with entries from the ring End\u2009\"A\".\nConversely, given any ring R, we can form a category\u00a0Mat(\"R\") by taking objects \"An\" indexed by the set of natural numbers (including 0) and letting the hom-set of morphisms from \"An\" to \"Am\" be the set of m-by-n matrices over\u00a0R, and where composition is given by matrix multiplication. Then Mat(\"R\") is an additive category, and \"A\"\"n\" equals the n-fold power (\"A\"1)\"n\".\nThis construction should be compared with the result that a ring is a preadditive category with just one object, shown here.\nIf we interpret the object \"A\"\"n\" as the left module\u00a0\"R\"\"n\", then this \"matrix category\" becomes a subcategory of the category of left modules over\u00a0R.\nThis may be confusing in the special case where m or n is zero, because we usually don't think of matrices with 0 rows or 0 columns. This concept makes sense, however: such matrices have no entries and so are completely determined by their size. While these matrices are rather degenerate, they do need to be included to get an additive category, since an additive category must have a zero object.\nThinking about such matrices can be useful in one way, though: they highlight the fact that given any objects A and B in an additive category, there is exactly one morphism from A to 0 (just as there is exactly one 0-by-1 matrix with entries in End\u2009\"A\") and exactly one morphism from 0 to B (just as there is exactly one 1-by-0 matrix with entries in End\u2009\"B\")\u00a0\u2013 this is just what it means to say that 0 is a zero object. Furthermore, the zero morphism from A to B is the composition of these morphisms, as can be calculated by multiplying the degenerate matrices.\nAdditive functors.\nA functor \"F\": C \u2192 D between preadditive categories is \"additive\" if it is an abelian group homomorphism on each hom-set in C. If the categories are additive, then a functor is additive if and only if it preserves all biproduct diagrams.\nThat is, if B is a biproduct of\u00a0\"A\"1,\u2009...\u2009,\u2009\"An\" in\u00a0C with projection morphisms \"pk\" and injection morphisms \"ij\", then \"F\"(\"B\") should be a biproduct of\u00a0\"F\"(\"A\"1),\u2009...\u2009,\u2009\"F\"(\"An\") in\u00a0D with projection morphisms \"F\"(\"p\"\"j\") and injection morphisms \"F\"(\"ij\").\nAlmost all functors studied between additive categories are additive. In fact, it is a theorem that all adjoint functors between additive categories must be additive functors (see here). Most of the interesting functors studied in category theory are adjoints.\nGeneralization.\nWhen considering functors between R-linear additive categories, one usually restricts to R-linear functors, so those functors giving an R-module homomorphism on each hom-set.\nSpecial cases.\nMany commonly studied additive categories are in fact abelian categories; for example, Ab is an abelian category. The free abelian groups provide an example of a category that is additive but not abelian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The organization opposes factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and other activities it considers to be exploitation of animals.\nThe organization's controversial campaigns have been credited with drawing media attention to animal rights issues, but have also been widely criticized for their disruptive nature. Its use of euthanasia has resulted in legal action and a response from Virginia lawmakers.\nHistory.\nIngrid Newkirk.\nIngrid Newkirk was born in England in 1949, and raised in Hertfordshire and later New Delhi, India, where her father\u2014a navigational engineer\u2014was stationed. Newkirk, now an atheist, was educated in a convent, the only British girl there. She moved to the United States as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead. She became an animal-protection officer for Montgomery County, Maryland, and then the District of Columbia's first woman poundmaster. By 1976 she was head of the animal disease control division of D.C.'s Commission on Public Health and in 1980 was among those named as \"Washingtonians of the Year\".\nIn 1980, after her divorce, she met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and they fell in love and began living together. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, \"Animal Liberation\" (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just \"five people in a basement\", as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the UK, Kim Stallwood, a British activist who went on to become the national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.\nSilver Spring monkeys.\nThe group first came to public attention in 1981 during the Silver Spring monkeys case, a dispute about experiments conducted by researcher Edward Taub on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal laboratory, triggered an amendment in 1985 to the United States Animal Welfare Act, and became the first animal-testing case to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld a Louisiana State Court ruling that denied PETA's request for custody of the monkeys.\nPacheco had taken a job in May 1981 inside a primate research laboratory at the institute, intending to gain firsthand experience of working inside an animal laboratory. Taub had been cutting sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, and legs\u2014a process called \"deafferentation\"\u2014so that the monkeys could not feel them; some of the monkeys had had their entire spinal columns deafferented. He then used restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food and water to force the monkeys to use the deafferented parts of their bodies. The research led in part to the discovery of neuroplasticity and a new therapy for stroke victims called constraint-induced movement therapy.\nPacheco went to the laboratory at night, taking photographs that showed the monkeys living in what the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research's \"ILAR Journal\" called \"filthy conditions\". He passed his photographs to the police, who raided the lab and arrested Taub. Taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to animals, the first such conviction in the United States of an animal researcher; the conviction, though, was overturned on appeal. Norm Phelps writes that the case followed the highly publicized campaign of Henry Spira in 1976 against experiments on cats being performed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and Spira's subsequent campaign in April 1980 against the Draize test. These and the Silver Spring monkey case jointly put animal rights on the agenda in the United States.\nThe 10-year battle for custody of the monkeys\u2014described by \"The Washington Post\" as a vicious mud fight, during which both sides accused the other of lies and distortion\u2014\u00a0transformed PETA into a national, then international, movement. By February 1991, it claimed over 350,000 supporters, a paid staff of over 100, and an annual budget of over $7\u00a0million.\nPETA India.\nPETA India was founded in 2000 and is based in Mumbai, India.\nPETA and the NGO Animal Rahat, authorized by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), participated in a nine-month investigation of 16 circuses in India. After it was said that \"animals used in circuses were subjected to chronic confinement, physical abuse, and psychological torment\", AWBI, in 2013, banned the registration of elephants for performance.\nPETA India put up billboards prior to a 2020 annual religious event Eid al-Adha where animals are ritualistically slaughtered. The billboards depicted goats with the words \"I am a living being and not just meat. Change your view towards us and become a vegan.\" and \"I am ME, Not Mutton. See the Individual. Go Vegan.\" Muslim clerics wanted to take down the billboards, saying that it was hurtful to their religious sentiments.\nIn July 2020, PETA put up billboards saying \"This Rakshabandhan, protect me: Go leather-free\".\nLocations.\nPETA was based in Rockville, Maryland, until 1996, when it moved to Norfolk, Virginia. It opened a Los Angeles division in 2006 and also has offices in Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. In addition, PETA has international affiliates.\nPhilosophy and activism.\nProfile.\nPETA is an animal rights organization that opposes speciesism, and the abuse of animals in any way, such as for food, clothing, entertainment, or research.\nIn 2025, PETA's website claimed they had 10.5 million supporters, and received donations of $80 million for 2024.\nCampaigns and consumer boycotts.\nThe organization is known for aggressive media stunts, combined with a solid base of celebrity support\u2014in addition to its honorary directors, Paul McCartney, Alicia Silverstone, Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Ellen DeGeneres, and many other notable celebrities have appeared in PETA ads. Every week, Newkirk holds what \"The New Yorker\" calls a \"war council\", with two dozen of her top strategists gathered at a square table in the PETA conference room, with no suggestion considered too \"kooky or unkind\". PETA also gives an annual prize, called the Proggy Award (for \"progress\"), to individuals or organizations dedicated to animal welfare or who distinguish themselves through their efforts within the area of animal welfare.\nMany of the campaigns have focused on large corporations. Fast food companies such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's \"modus operandi\" includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald's and Kraft Foods to exert influence. The campaigns have delivered results for PETA. McDonald's and Wendy's introduced vegetarian options after PETA targeted them; and Polo Ralph Lauren said it would no longer use fur. Avon, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Benetton, and Tonka Toy Co. all stopped testing products on animals, the Pentagon stopped shooting pigs and goats in wounds tests, and a slaughterhouse in Texas was closed down.\nAs part of its anti-fur action, PETA supporters have infiltrated hundreds of fashion shows in the U.S. and Europe and one in China, throwing red paint on the catwalks and unfurling banners. Celebrities and supermodels have posed naked for the group's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" campaign\u2014some men, but mostly women\u2014triggering criticism from some feminist animal rights advocates. \"The New Yorker\" writes that PETA activists have crawled through the streets of Paris wearing leg-hold traps and thrown around money soaked in fake blood at the International Fur Fair. They sometimes engage in pie-throwing\u2014in January 2010, Canadian MP Gerry Byrne compared them to terrorists for throwing a tofu cream pie at Canada's fishery minister Gail Shea in protest of the seal slaughter, a comment Newkirk called a silly chest-beating exercise. \"The thing is, we make them gawk\" she told \"Satya\" magazine, \"maybe like a traffic accident that you have to look at.\"\nPETA has also objected to the practice of mulesing (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.\nIn 2011, PETA named five orcas as plaintiffs and sued SeaWorld over the animals' captivity, seeking their protection under the Thirteenth Amendment. A federal judge heard the case and dismissed it in early 2012. In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it was building new orca tanks that would almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales. PETA responded that a \"larger prison is still a prison.\" In 2016, SeaWorld admitted that it had been sending its employees to pose as activists to spy on PETA. Following an investigation by an outside law firm, SeaWorld's Board of Directors directed management to end the practice.\nIn 2011, Patricia de Leon was the Hispanic spokesperson for PETA's anti-bullfighting campaign.\nSome campaigns have been particularly controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was blown up during an attack in Jerusalem.\nTo reduce milk consumption, it created the \"Got Beer?\" campaign, a parody of the dairy industry's series of Got Milk? ads, which featured celebrities with milk \"mustaches\" on their upper lips. When the mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, PETA ran a photograph of him with a white mustache and the words \"Got prostate cancer?\" to illustrate their claim that dairy products contribute to cancer, an ad that caused an outcry in the United States. After PETA placed ads in school newspapers linking milk to acne, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and strokes, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and college officials complained it encouraged underage drinking; the British Advertising Standards Authority asked that the ads be discontinued after complaints from interest groups such as The National Farmers' Unions.\nIn August 2011, it was announced that PETA will be launching a soft pornography website in the .xxx domain. PETA spokesperson Lindsay Rajt told the \"Huffington Post\", \"We try to use absolutely every outlet to stick up for animals,\" adding that \"We are careful about what we do and wouldn't use nudity or some of our flashier tactics if we didn't know they worked.\" PETA also used nudity in its \"Veggie Love\" ad which it prepared for the Super Bowl, only to have it banned by the network. PETA's work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women's rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying \"They're the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty.\"\nPETA has approached cities to pressure them to change their names, including Fishkill, New York in 1996, Hamburg, New York in 2003, and Commerce City, Colorado in 2007.\nPETA sometimes issues isolated statements or press releases, commenting on current events. After Lady Gaga wore a dress made of meat in 2010, PETA issued a statement objecting to the dress. After a fisherman in Florida was bitten by a shark in 2011, PETA proposed an advertisement showing a shark devouring a human, with the caption \"Payback Is Hell, Go Vegan\". The proposed ad drew criticism from relatives of the injured fisherman. After Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer admitted that he had killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015, PETA's president, Newkirk, issued a statement on behalf of PETA in which she said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hunting is a coward's pastime. If, as has been reported, this dentist and his guides lured Cecil out of the park with food so as to shoot him on private property, because shooting him in the park would have been illegal, he needs to be extradited, charged, and, preferably, hanged.\nUndercover work.\nPETA sends its staff undercover into industries and other facilities that use animals to document the alleged abuse of animals. Investigators may spend many months as employees of a facility, making copies of documents and wearing hidden cameras.\nAg-gag laws.\nVarious U.S. states have passed ag-gag laws to prevent animal rights and animal welfare groups from conducting undercover investigations of operations that use animals. In response, PETA has been involved with other groups bringing lawsuits, citing First Amendment protections for free speech.\nLegal proceedings.\nTwo PETA employees were acquitted in 2007 of cruelty to animals after at least 80 euthanized animals were left in dumpsters in a shopping center in Ahoskie, North Carolina, over the course of a month in 2005; the two employees were seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van. The animals had been euthanized after being removed from shelters in Northampton and Bertie counties. A Bertie County Deputy Sheriff stated that the two employees assured the Bertie Animal Shelter that \"they were picking up the dogs to take them back to Norfolk where they would find them good homes.\" During the trial, Daphna Nachminovitch, the supervisor of PETA's Community Animal Project, said PETA began euthanizing animals in some rural North Carolina shelters after it found the shelters killing animals in ways PETA considers inhumane, including by shooting them. She also stated that the dumping of animals did not follow PETA's policy.\nIn November 2014, a resident of Accomack County, Virginia, produced video evidence that two workers in a van marked with a PETA logo had entered his property in a trailer park and taken his dog, who was then euthanized. He reported the incident to the police, who identified and charged two PETA workers, but the charges were later dropped by the commonwealth attorney on the grounds that it was not possible to prove criminal intent. The trailer park's manager had contacted PETA after a group of residents moved out, leaving their dogs behind, which is why the workers were on the property. The state later determined that PETA had violated state law by failing to ensure that the Chihuahua, who was not wearing a collar or tag, was properly identified and for failing to keep the dog alive for five days before euthanizing the animal. Citing a \"severity of this lapse in judgment,\" the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued PETA a first-ever violation and imposed a $500 fine. The contract worker who had taken the dog was dismissed by PETA.\nIn 2015, PETA sued British nature photographer David Slater in US court as a next friend for a wild macaque monkey, whom they named Naruto. PETA argued that the monkey was entitled to the copyright of a selfie it had taken while handling Slater's camera, and naming themselves to be the administrator of any copyright revenue. The monkey selfie copyright dispute was originally dismissed by Judge Orrick who wrote there is no indication that the Copyright Act extends to animals and a monkey could not own a copyright. PETA appealed, but the Court of Appeals found in favor of Slater saying that \"PETA's real motivation in this case was to advance its own interests, not Naruto's.\" The decision cited \"Cetacean v. Bush (2004)\" that says animals cannot sue unless Congress makes it clear in the statute that animals can sue, and added that \"next friend\" representation cannot be applied to animals. The court also wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Puzzlingly, while representing to the world that 'animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way,' PETA seems to employ Naruto as an unwitting pawn in its ideological goals.\"\nVideo games.\nPETA has created a number of satirical video games with such names as \"How Green Is My Diet?\" and \"KKK or AKC? Spot the Difference\". PETA uses these games to spread attention about animal rights and animal welfare and to advocate vegetarian and vegan diets. PETA's head of online marketing Joel Bartlett said \"We've found that parody games are extremely popular. By connecting our message with something people are already interested in, we're able to create more buzz.\"\nIn 2017, Ingrid Newkirk sent a letter of complaint to Nintendo about their video game \"1-2-Switch\", during which players get to milk a cow. In her letter, Newkirk called the game \"unrealistic\" and wrote \"you've taken all the cruelty out of milking\". She also suggested that \"instead of sugarcoating the subject, Nintendo switch to simulating activities in which no animals suffer.\"\nIn March 2020, PETA issued a \"Vegan Guide to Animal Crossing\" for the video game \"\".\nPerson of the year.\nEach year, PETA selects a \"Person of the Year\" who has helped advance the cause of animal rights.\nLabels.\nPETA certifies beauty and cosmetics companies with bunny labels in two tiers. In the first tier (\"Animal Test-Free\"), the entire company does not use animal testing. The company may still produce non-vegan products. In the second tier (\"Cruelty-Free\"), the company may not produce non-vegan products. The company is animal test-free and also vegan, i.e. does not use any animal-derived ingredients. If a company carries the PETA \"animal test-free\" or \"cruelty-free\" label, it must also have signed agreements with its suppliers that they do not use animal testing.\nPETA also awards a \"vegan\" label to clothing and furniture products (instead of entire companies), which means that the products are free from animal-derived ingredients, but the companies can still produce non-vegan products.\nPositions.\nDirect action.\nNewkirk is outspoken in her support of direct action, writing that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without what she calls the militarism component: \"Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out.\" Newkirk is a strong supporter of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilities: \"When I hear of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, my heart sings.\" Newkirk was quoted in 1999, \"When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals' social needs, I find it small wonder that the laboratories aren't all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I'd light a match.\"\nEuthanasia.\nPETA is a strong proponent of euthanasia. They oppose the no-kill movement, and rather than adoption programs, PETA prefers to aim for zero births through spaying and neutering. They recommend not breeding pit bulls, and support euthanasia in certain situations for animals in shelters, such as those being housed for long periods in cramped cages.\nPet as a derogatory term.\nPETA considers the word pet to be \"derogatory and patronises the animal\", and prefers the term \"companion\" or \"companion animal\". \"Animals are not pets\", Newkirk has said.\nHearing-ear and seeing-eye dogs.\nPETA supports hearing dog programs when animals are sourced from shelters and placed in homes, but opposes seeing-eye dog programs \"because the dogs are bred as if there are no equally intelligent dogs literally dying for homes in shelters, they are kept in harnesses almost 24/7\".\nAnimal testing.\nPETA opposes animal testing\u2014whether toxicity testing, basic or applied research, or for education and training\u2014on both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the \"Vogue\" magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it. The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, and irrelevant to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including embryonic stem cell research and in vitro cell research.\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/White Coat Waste Project.\nThe White Coat Waste Project (WCWP), a group of activists that hold that taxpayers should not have to pay $20\u00a0billion every year for experiments on animals, said that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided $400,000 in taxpayer money to fund experiments in which 28 beagles were infected by disease-causing parasites. The WCWP found reports that said dogs taking part in the experiments were \"vocalizing in pain\" after being injected with foreign substances. Following public outcry, PETA made a call to action that all members of the National Institute of Health (NIH) resign effective immediately and that there is a \"need to find a new NIH director to replace the outgoing Francis Collins who will shut down research that violates the dignity of nonhuman animals.\" In 2019, the WCWP discovered a USDA funded lab in Beltsville, Maryland which conducted toxoplasmosis experiments on kittens resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 kittens over 36 years. This discovery led to the USDA banning all taxpayer funded kitten experiments. In 2024, the WCWP also reported that taxpayer money was used to fund beagle experiments in China, which drew widespread condemnation, including a call from PETA to end taxpayer-funded animal experiments globally.\nControversies.\nHigh euthanasia rates.\nPETA's euthanasia practices have drawn intense scrutiny from lawmakers and criticism from animal rights activists for years. The consistently high percentage of animals euthanized at PETA's shelter has been controversial.\nIn 2008, meat industry lobby group the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) said in a news release that \"[a]n official report filed by PETA itself shows that the animal rights group put to death nearly every dog, cat, and other pet it took in for adoption in 2006,\" with a kill rate of 97.4 percent. In 2012, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said that it had in the past considered changing PETA's status from \"shelter\" to \"euthanasia clinic\", citing PETA's willingness to take in \"anything that comes through the door, and other shelters won't do that.\" PETA acknowledged that it euthanized 95% of the animals at its shelter in 2011.\nPETA calls their shelter in Norfolk, Virginia a \"shelter of last resort\", claiming they only receive old, sick, injured, badly behaved, and otherwise unadoptable animals. Operating as open admission, they take in animals \"no one else will\", and consider death \"a merciful end\". In 2014, PETA euthanized over 80% of the shelter's animals and justified its euthanasia policies as \"mercy killings\".\nFueled by public outrage from a 2014 incident where PETA workers took a pet chihuahua from its porch and euthanized it the same day, along with documentation that of the 1,606 cats and 1,025 dogs accepted by the shelter that same year, 1,536 cats and 788 dogs were euthanized, the Virginia General Assembly passed Senate Bill 1381 in 2015 aimed at curtailing the operation of PETA's shelter. The bill defines a private animal shelter as \"a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.\"\nThough risking their legal access to euthanasia drugs, PETA has continued their practices. In the chihuahua case, PETA paid a fine and settled a civil claim with the family three years later.\nChild targeted messaging.\nPETA has also been criticized for aiming its message at young people. In the past the company has passed out pamphlets such as \"Your Daddy Kills Animals\", and \"Your Mommy Kills Animals\", both warning children from letting their \"addicted to killing\" parents have contact with their pets. The pamphlet was criticized by the Center for Consumer Freedom, who said \"There's going to be long-term psychological damage from these kids being exposed to the material that PETA puts in front of them on a regular basis.\"\nAs part of its 1999 \"McCruelty\" campaign, PETA attempted to distribute \"Unhappy Meals\" to young audiences: a parody of McDonald's Happy Meal. When describing the box, they explained that \"PETA's spoof of a McDonald's chicken sandwich box features the image of a knife-wielding Ronald McDonald, along with pictures of birds who have been mutilated and scalded alive. The inside of the Unhappy Meal box is stained with blood and contains a blood-filled packet urging McDonald's to \"Ketchup With the Times\", a paper cutout of a menacing Ronald McDonald with PETA's parody \"I'm Hatin' It\" logo, a bloody plastic chicken, and a \"Chicken McCruelty\" T-shirt wrapped up like a sandwich.\" The violent imagery was decried by parents who stated \"I don't want my son to be around something like this.\" As part of the same campaign, PETA attempted to place a large statue of a crippled, scalded chicken in front of a McDonalds's in Little Rock, but were denied, and released a short comic book titled Ronald McDonald Kills Animals, in which Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and the Hamburglar unite to kill Birdie's parents, feed them to her unknowingly, then eat her as well.\nA similar \"Kentucky Fried Cruelty\" campaign occurred in 2004, when PETA criticized KFC and distributed \"Buckets of Blood\" to children: the buckets (meant to mimic KFC's buckets of chicken) included a bag of fake blood, feathers, and bones; a bloody plastic chicken; and a cardboard caricature of a blood-spattered Colonel Sanders holding a butcher knife toward a terrified-looking chicken.\nA 2013 ad titled Traditional Thanksgiving Dinner from your Family Butcher, was developed using lenticular technology to show parents a benign Thanksgiving promo, but show their children a mother stabbing a live turkey while her children look on in shock.\n\"It's Still Going On\" campaign.\nPETA's \"It's Still Going On\" campaign features newspaper ads comparing widely publicized murder-cannibalization cases to the deaths of animals in slaughterhouses. The campaign has attracted significant media attention, controversy and generated angry responses from the victims' family members. Ads were released in 1991 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, in 2002 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Robert William Pickton, and in 2008 describing the killing of Tim McLean. In several cases, newspapers have refused to run the ads.\n\"Holocaust on Your Plate\" campaign.\nIn 2003 PETA composed the \"Holocaust on Your Plate\" exhibition\u2014eight panels juxtaposing images of Holocaust and concentration camp victims with scenes of factory farming, battery cages, animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter, along with captions stating that \"Like the Jews murdered in concentration camps, animals are terrorized when they are housed in huge filthy warehouses and rounded up for shipment to slaughter. The leather sofa and handbag are the moral equivalent of the lampshades made from the skins of people killed in the death camps.\"\nThe exhibition was quickly criticized by Abraham Foxman and the Anti-Defamation League, who said, \"the effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent\" and \"[r]ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a way to make sure such catastrophes never happen again.\" Alex Herschaft had made similar comparisons in the past, but criticized PETA's use as \"careless and reckless\" and impersonal. Elie Wiesel was appalled to find the campaign used his own image, calling it possibly the greatest disappointment of his life, and reiterating that \"I am not afraid of forgetfulness, I am afraid of banalization, of trivialization and this is part of it.\" Other detractors included the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Wesley Smith.\nAs a response to critics of the UK campaign asking for a ban or some form of censorship, PETA accused them of book burning to further imply Nazi mentality. In 2004 a complaint was made by Paul Spiegel and the Central Council of Jews in Germany, asking the German court to order PETA to halt the campaign and threatening to sue. In July 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity, and upheld the ban in 2012.\nThe exhibit had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: \"The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible\u2014that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior'\u2014is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms.\" In addition, PETA claimed a direct influence by the prominent Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, whose grandson, Stephen R. Dujack, supported the exhibition when it traveled to New York, and quotations for the exhibit also pulled from the writings of German philosopher Theodor Adorno. Karen Davis and Gary Yourofsky both voiced their support of the exhibition.\n\"Are Animals the New Slaves?\" exhibit.\nIn 2005, the NAACP criticized the \"Are Animals the New Slaves?\" exhibit, which showed images of African-American lynching victims and slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows. Lee Hall, the then director of Friends of Animals, supported the criticism, stating that, \"While African-Americans have been systematically degraded by being compared with nonhuman beings, are we to think that angry responses to the pairing of man and monkey were unanticipated?\"\nVakiya Courtney, then executive director of America's Black Holocaust Museum, was outraged; images from the exhibit included one taken at the site of the attempted lynching of the museum founder James Cameron, and the successful lynching of his two friends. \"How can you possibly compare the brutality that our ancestors experienced here, and the brutality that people like Dr. Cameron had to overcome, to animal cruelty?\" Cameron, himself, had a similar response: \"They may have treated us like animals back then, but there is no way we should be compared to animals today.\"\n\"Got Autism?\" campaign.\nIn 2008 and in 2014, PETA conducted an advertising campaign linking milk with autism. Their \"Got Autism?\" campaign, a play on words mocking the milk industry's Got Milk? ad campaign that began in 1993, stated \"Studies have shown a link between cow's milk and autism.\" PETA also claimed milk was strongly linked to cancer, Crohn's disease, and other diseases. When pressed, PETA cited two scientific papers, one from 1995 and one from 2002 using very small samplings of children (36 and 20), and neither showed a correlation nor a causation between milk and autism. Newer studies from 2010 and 2014 came to the same conclusion. Despite having been corrected, in 2014, PETA's Executive Vice President confirmed their position, and additionally stated that dairy consumption contributes to asthma, chronic ear infection, constipation, iron deficiency, anemia, and cancer.\nSteven Novella, a clinical neurologist and assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine, wrote \"This is clearly, in my opinion, a campaign of fear mongering based upon a gross distortion of the scientific evidence. The purpose is to advocate for a vegan diet, which fits [PETA's] ideological agenda. They are likely aware that it is easier to spread fears than to reassure with a careful analysis of the scientific evidence.\"\nPETA's campaign has received backlash from the autism community. A 2008 PETA billboard was taken down by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. In 2017, British food writer, journalist and hunger relief activist Jack Monroe, demanded PETA remove their recipes from their website \"with immediate effect coz I wrote them with my autism\". PETA removed their recipes, but did not remove the \"Got Autism?\" article from their website until 2021. It has been argued that the frowny face in the campaign image negatively stereotypes autistic people.\n\"KKK or AKC?\" controversy.\nIn 2009, PETA members dressed up in Ku Klux Klan (KKK) robes and protested at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show where they passed out brochures implying the Klan and American Kennel Club (AKC) have the same goal of \"pure bloodlines\". This protest was continued in the PETA video game \"KKK or AKC? Spot the Difference.\"\nCriticism of Steve Irwin.\nPETA has been critical of Australian wildlife expert and zookeeper Steve Irwin. In 2006, when Irwin died, PETA Vice President Dan Mathews said Irwin had made a career out of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott was disgusted by the comments and said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia, and \"Isn't it interesting ... how they [PETA] want to treat animals ethically, but cannot even think for a minute whether or not their outlandish comments are ethical towards their fellow human beings.\"\nIn 2019, PETA criticized Google for creating a slideshow Google Doodle of Steve Irwin posthumously honoring his 57th birthday. PETA started a Twitter campaign against Irwin, with several tweets criticizing Google for forwarding a dangerous message, and wrote that Irwin was killed while harassing a stingray and that he forced animals to perform. A \"Washington Post\" editor wrote \"PETA can add 'insulting a deceased cultural icon' to its infamous repertoire.\"\nAnti-carnivore sex strike.\nIn 2022, PETA's German division called for a sex strike in which women would refrain from sexual activities with men who ate meat, and also called for men who ate meat to be banned from procreating. When pressed on the ban, Laura Weyman-Jones (the Australian division's marketing manager) said that it was a \"conversation starter\", and not an actual request or threat. The company did not reverse its position that meat consumption was a form of toxic masculinity, harmful to the environment, increased male impotency, and should be sin-taxed at an additional 41%.\nHuman barbecue stunt protest.\nDuring Holy Week in the Philippines, a PETA Asia member stripped down to her underwear and laid down on a grill to depict a \"human barbecue\" in front of Quiapo Church in Quiapo, Manila, calling Filipinos to abstain from eating meat year-round, not just during Lent. The stunt protest drew attention and controversy from churchgoers, and a complaint was filed by the church with the Manila Police District. No formal complaint was made, and as such, the members involved were eventually released.\nDomain name disputes.\nIn February 1995, a parody website calling itself \"People Eating Tasty Animals\" registered the domain name \"peta.org\". PETA sued, claiming trademark violation, and won the suit in 2001; the domain is currently owned by PETA. While still engaged in legal proceedings over \"peta.org\", PETA themselves registered the domains \"ringlingbrothers.com\" and \"voguemagazine.com\", using the sites to accuse Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and Vogue of animal cruelty. PETA later surrendered the domains under threat of similar legal action over trademark infringement.\nPosition within the animal rights movement.\nThe more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grass-roots members, is soft on the idea of animal rights, that it should stop the use of media stunts and nudity in its campaigning, and stop \"hogging the spotlight at the expense of its allies in the movement\".\nRobert Garner of the University of Leicester has written that PETA has shaken up the animal rights movement, setting up new groups and radicalizing old ones. According to reviews at Philanthropedia, \"PETA paved the way for other national organizations to delve into what used to be controversial issues and are now more mainstream concerns.\" Michael Specter considers PETA to be the radical that helps the more mainstream message to succeed.\nBecause of PETA's euthanasia rates at their \"shelter of last resort\", attorney Nathan Winograd, advocate for the No Kill movement, calls Newkirk of PETA \"The Butcher of Norfolk\".\nGary L. Francione, professor of law at Rutgers Law School and a proponent of abolitionism, says that PETA is not an animal rights group because of their willingness to work with industries that use animals to achieve incremental change. Francione says PETA trivializes the movement with their \"Three Stooges\" theory of animal rights, making the public think progress is underway when the changes are only cosmetic. \"Their campaigns are selected more for media image than content.\" Francione has criticized PETA for having caused grassroots animal rights groups to close, groups that were essential for the survival of the animal rights movement, and rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione wrote that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest settlement and only city in Cumbria. In 2021 it had a population of 77,730.\nCarlisle's early history is marked by the establishment of a settlement called Luguvalium to serve forts along Hadrian's Wall in Roman Britain. Due to its proximity to Scotland (being located south of the current Anglo-Scottish border), Carlisle Castle and the city became an important military stronghold in the Middle Ages. The castle served as a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots in 1568 and currently hosts the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum. A priory was built in the early 12th century, which subsequently became Carlisle Cathedral in 1133 on the creation of the Diocese of Carlisle. As the seat of a diocese, Carlisle therefore gained city status. Carlisle also served as the county town of the historic county of Cumberland from the county's creation in the 12th century.\nIn the 19th century, the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle, which developed into a densely populated mill town. This, combined with its strategic position, allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town, with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station. Nicknamed the 'Great Border City',\nHistory.\nAncient Carlisle.\nThe ancient history of Carlisle is derived mainly from archaeological evidence and the works of the Roman historian Tacitus. The earliest recorded inhabitants in the area were the Carvetii tribe of Britons who made up the main population of ancient Cumbria and North Lancashire. According to Boethius and John of Fordun, writing in the 8th and 9th centuries, Carlisle existed before the arrival of the Romans in Britain and was one of the strongest British towns at the time. In the time of the emperor Nero, it was said to have burned down. The Roman settlement was named Luguvalium, based on a native name that has been reconstructed as Brittonic *Luguwaljon, \"[city] of Luguwalos\", a masculine Celtic given name meaning \"strength of Lugus\".\nExcavations undertaken along Annetwell Street in the 1970s dated the Roman timber fort constructed at the site of present Carlisle Castle to the winter of AD\u00a073. It protected a strategic location on the Roman road to the north and overlooking the confluence of the Caldew and Eden rivers.\n General Gnaeus Julius Agricola advances through Carlisle in AD\u00a079.\nThe fort at Carlisle was reconstructed in AD 83 using oak timbers from further afield, rather than local alder as a possible result of the increased Roman control of the area. At this time the Roman fort was garrisoned by a 500-strong cavalry regiment, the \"\".\nBy the early 2nd century, Carlisle was established as a prominent stronghold. The 'Stanegate' frontier, which consisted of Luguvalium and several other forts in a line east to Corbridge, was proving a more stable frontier against the Picts than those established deeper into Caledonia. In AD 122, the province was visited by Hadrian, who approved a plan to build a wall the length of the frontier. A new fort, Petriana, was therefore built in the Stanwix area of the city north of the river on Hadrian's Wall. It was the largest fort along the wall and was completed in stone by around AD 130. Like Luguvalium, which lay within sight, Petriana housed a nominal 1,000-strong cavalry regiment, the \"Ala Gallorum Petriana\", the sole regiment of this size along the wall. Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius abandoned the frontier and attempted to move further north; he built the Antonine Wall between the firths of Forth and Clyde. It was not a success and, after 20 years, the garrisons returned to Hadrian's Wall.\nAt one time, Carlisle broke off from Rome when Marcus Carausius assumed power over the territory. He was assassinated and suffered \"damnatio memoriae\", but a surviving reference to him has been uncovered in Carlisle. Coins excavated in the area suggest that Romans remained in Carlisle until the reign of Emperor Valentinian II, from AD 375 to AD 392.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe period of late antiquity after Roman rule saw Cumbria organised as the native British kingdom of Rheged. It is likely that the kingdom took its name from a major stronghold within it; this has been suggested to have been broadly coterminous with the ', Carlisle. King Urien and his son and successor Owain became the subjects of a great deal of Arthurian legend. Their capital has been identified as the listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain, which later developed into Caer-luel, whence the city's modern Welsh name Caerliwelydd. Rheged came under Northumbrian control before 730, probably by inheritance after Rienmelth, daughter of Royth and great-granddaughter of Urien, married Oswy, King of Northumbria. For the rest of the first millennium, Carlisle was an important stronghold contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. In 685, St Cuthbert, visiting the Queen of Northumbria in her sister's monastery at Carlisle, was taken to see the city walls and a marvellously constructed Roman fountain.\nBy the time of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, Carlisle was in the possession of the Scots. It was not recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. This changed in 1092, when William the Conqueror's son William Rufus invaded the region and incorporated Carlisle into England. The construction of Carlisle Castle began in 1093 on the site of the Roman fort, south of the River Eden. The castle was rebuilt in stone in 1112, with a keep and the city walls. The walls enclosed the city south of the castle and included three gates to the east, south, and north called the Irish or Caldew Gate, the English or Botcher Gate, and the Scotch or Ricker Gate respectively. The names of the gates exist in road names in Carlisle today. Carlisle Cathedral was founded as an Augustinian priory and became a cathedral in 1133. In 1157, Carlisle became the seat of the new county of Carliol (a name that was originally an abbreviation of Latin \"Carlioliensis\", meaning \"[Bishop] of Carlisle\"); in 1177 the county was renamed Cumberland.\nThe conquest of Cumberland was the beginning of a war between Scotland and England which saw the region centred around Carlisle change hands a number of times. It was a major stronghold after the construction of the castle. During the wars, the livelihood of the people on the borders was devastated by armies from both sides. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other sought security through their own strength and cunning, and they improved their livelihoods at their enemies' expense. These peoples were known as the Border Reivers and Carlisle was the major city within their territories.\nThe Reivers became so much of a nuisance to the Scottish and English governments that, in 1525, the Archbishop of Glasgow Gavin Dunbar cursed all the reivers of the borderlands. The curse was detailed in 1,069 words, beginning: \"I curse their head and all the hairs of their head; I curse their face, their brain (innermost thoughts), their mouth, their nose, their tongue, their teeth, their forehead, their shoulders, their breast, their heart, their stomach, their back, their womb, their arms, their leggs, their hands, their feet and every part of their body, from the top of their head to the soles of their feet, before and behind, within and without.\"\nEarly Modern era.\nAfter the Pilgrimage of Grace, Henry VIII, concerned at the weakness of his hold on the North, employed (1539) the engineer Stefan von Haschenperg to modernise the defences of Carlisle. von Haschenperg was sacked in 1543 for having \"spent great treasures to no purpose\"; but (by him and his successors) at the north end the castle towers were converted to artillery platforms, at the south the medieval Bochard gate was converted into the Citadel, an artillery fortification with two massive artillery towers. The death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603 and her succession by James VI of Scotland as King James I of England allowed more determined and coordinated efforts to suppress reiving. The borderers were not quick to change their ways and many were hanged and whole families were exiled to Ireland. It was not until 1681 that the problem of the reivers was acknowledged as no longer an issue.\nFollowing the personal union of the crowns Carlisle Castle should have become obsolete as a frontier fortress, but the two kingdoms continued as separate states. In 1639, with war between the two kingdoms looming, the castle was refortified using stone from the cathedral cloisters. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the castle was garrisoned for the king. It endured a long siege from October 1644 until June 1645 when the Royalist forces surrendered after the Battle of Naseby. The city was occupied by a parliamentary garrison, and subsequently by their Scots allies. In 1646, the Scots, now holding Carlisle pending payment of monies owed them by the English Parliament, improved its fortifications, destroying the cathedral's nave to obtain the stone to rebuild the castle. Carlisle continued to remain a barracks thereafter. In 1698 travel writer Celia Fiennes wrote of Carlisle as having most of the trappings of a military town and that it was rife with alcohol and prostitutes.\nIn 1707 an act of union was passed between England and Scotland, creating Great Britain, but Carlisle remained a garrison town. The tenth, and most recent siege in the city's history took place after Charles Edward Stuart took Carlisle in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. When the Jacobites retreated across the border to Scotland they left a garrison of 400 men in Carlisle Castle. Ten days later Prince William, Duke of Cumberland took the castle and executed 31 Jacobites on the streets of Carlisle.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nAlthough Carlisle continued to garrison soldiers, becoming the headquarters of the Border Regiment, the city's importance as a military town decreased as the industrial age took over. The post of Governor of Carlisle as garrison commander was abolished in 1838.\nIn the early 19th century textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers built factories in the city mostly in the Denton Holme, Caldewgate and Wapping suburbs in the Caldew Valley. These included Carr's of Carlisle, Kangol, Metal Box and Cowans Sheldon. Shaddon Mill, in Denton Holme, became famous for having the world's 8th tallest chimney and was the largest cotton mill in England.\nThe expanding industries brought about an increase in population as jobs shifted from rural farms towards the cities. This produced a housing shortage where at one point 25,000 people in the city only had 5,000 houses to live in. People were said to be herded together with animal houses, slaughter houses and communal lavatories with open drains running between them. Living conditions were so bad that riots were common and some people emigrated. The problem was not solved until the end of the 19th century when mass housing was built west of the city walls.\nIn 1823 a canal was built to Fisher's Cross (Port Carlisle) to transport goods produced in the city. This enabled other industrial centres such as Liverpool to link with Carlisle via the Solway. This was short-lived and when the canal operators ran into financial difficulty the waterway was filled in. A railway was built in place of the canal.\nCarlisle became a major railway centre on the West Coast Main Line with connections to the east. At one time seven companies used Carlisle Citadel railway station. Before the building of the Citadel railway station the city had several other railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle had the largest railway marshalling yard in Europe, Kingmoor, which, reduced in size, is operational and used by railfreight companies.\nThe Strand Road drill hall opened in 1874.\nModern history.\nAt the start of the 20th century, the population had grown to over 45,000. Transport was improved by the City of Carlisle Electric Tramways from 1900 until 1931, and the first cinema was built in 1906. In 1912, the boundaries of Carlisle were extended to include Botcherby in the east and Stanwix in the north.\nCarlisle was subject to the decline in the textile industry experienced throughout Britain as new machinery made labour unnecessary. In 1916, during the First World War, the government took over the public houses and breweries in Carlisle because of drunkenness among construction and munitions workers from the munitions factory at Gretna. This experiment nationalised brewing. As the Carlisle Board of Control, and subsequently the Carlisle &amp; District State Management Scheme, it lasted until 1971.\nDuring the Second World War, Carlisle hosted over 5,000 evacuees, many of whom arrived from Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding towns.\nA shopping centre (including a new central library) was built to the east and north-east of the market cross and opened in 1986. The area east of the market cross had formerly been occupied by narrow alleyways of housing and small shops (on a layout which had not changed much since medieval times) and referred to locally as \"The Lanes\". Carlisle city centre was pedestrianised in 1989.\nOn the evening of Friday, 7 January 2005, the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril burst their banks due to as much as rainfall upstream that day. 2,700 homes were flooded and three people died. The city's police and fire stations were flooded along with Brunton Park football stadium. The police, fire service and Carlisle United F.C. were mobilised, the latter as far as Morecambe. At the time of the flood, emergency services also had to respond to cases of car-related arson in the city.\nCity centre.\nCarlisle is the only city in Cumbria. The city centre is largely pedestrianised and the Lanes shopping centre is home to around 75 shops.\nCarlisle has a compact historic centre with a castle, cathedral and semi-intact city walls, as well as other medieval buildings including the Guildhall and Tithe Barn. The Citadel towers, which until 2016 also served as offices for Cumbria County Council, were designed by Thomas Telford, with the eastern tower incorporating part of the 16th-century building. The first Citadel building was a Tudor fortification replacing the medieval Englishgate, designed by the Moravian military engineer Stefan von Haschenperg in 1541. Next to the Citadel is Carlisle railway station, designed by William Tite in the neo-Tudor style, considered by Historic England to be among the most important early railway stations in England.\nGovernance.\nThere is one main tier of local government covering Carlisle, at unitary authority level: Cumberland Council. The council is based in Carlisle, with its offices including Carlisle Civic Centre and Cumbria House. Some peripheral parts of the Carlisle built up area are covered by civil parishes, but the main part of the built up area is unparished. The Cumberland councillors who represent the wards covering the built up area act as charter trustees to preserve Carlisle's charters and city status; they choose one of their number each year to serve as Mayor of Carlisle.\nThe Carlisle constituency covers the built up area plus rural areas to the north-east, extending up to the Scottish border. It is represented by Julie Minns of the Labour Party.\nAdministrative history.\nCarlisle was an ancient borough. Its date of becoming a borough is unknown; its earliest recorded municipal charter was issued by Henry II (reigned 1154\u20131189), but the borough clearly existed prior to that. In accordance with the custom of the time, the borough of Carlisle also became a city on becoming the seat of the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133.\nThe ancient borough covered approximately the area within the Carlisle city walls. The borough was defined as the township of English Street in the parish of Carlisle St Cuthbert, the four townships of Abbey Street, Castle Street, Fisher Street, and Scotch Street in the parish of Carlisle St Mary (which used part of Carlisle Cathedral as its parish church), and an extra-parochial area known as Eaglesfield Abbey, which covered the cathedral grounds. Both St Cuthbert's and St Mary's parishes also included extensive rural areas outside the borough boundaries.\nThe borough council (also known as the corporation) built the Town Hall in the Market Place in 1668\u20131669 to serve both as its meeting place and a courthouse, replacing a medieval town hall on the same site.\nFrom 1295, the borough also served as a parliamentary borough (constituency). The constituency was enlarged in 1832 to take in Botchergate from St Cuthbert's parish, and Rickergate and part of Caldewgate from St Mary's parish. In 1836, the borough was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. As part of those reforms, the municipal boundaries were adjusted to match the constituency.\nIn 1904 the parishes within the borough were united into a single civil parish of Carlisle which matched the borough. The borough was enlarged in 1912 to take in parts of several neighbouring parishes, notably including Stanwix. As thus enlarged, Carlisle was considered large enough for the borough council to take over county-level functions from Cumberland County Council, and so in 1914 Carlisle was made a county borough. The borough was further enlarged in 1951. The borough council moved its headquarters to the new Civic Centre on Rickergate in 1964.\nThe municipal borough and civil parish of Carlisle were abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area merged with Border Rural District to become a non-metropolitan district called Carlisle in the new county of Cumbria. Carlisle's borough and city statuses were transferred to the new district, and so the district council took the name Carlisle City Council.\nThe non-metropolitan district of Carlisle was in turn abolished in 2023 when the new Cumberland Council was created, also taking over the functions of the abolished Cumbria County Council in the area.\nGeography.\nCarlisle is situated on a slight rise, in the Cumberland Ward, at the confluence of the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril.\nAn important centre for trade, it is located west of Newcastle upon Tyne, north of Lancaster, south-east of Glasgow, south of Edinburgh, north-west of York, and north-north-west of London. Nearby towns and villages include Longtown (north), Penrith (south), Brampton (east), Wigton (west), Haggbeck, Harker, Carwinley, Blackford, Houghton, Scotby, Wreay and Rockcliffe.\nClimate.\nCarlisle experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\"). In January 2005 Carlisle was hit by strong gales and heavy rain, and on Saturday 8 January 2005 all roads into Carlisle were closed owing to severe flooding, the worst since 1822, which caused three deaths. Even worse flooding than in 2005 affected Carlisle between 4 and 6 December 2015. During this time, nearly 36 hours of incessant rainfall breached flood defences and left several areas submerged \u2013 including Bitts Park, Hardwicke Circus and Warwick Road. This left the Sands Centre (and the nearby Shell petrol station and Bitts Park), marooned from the rest of the city. As several other areas of Cumbria were also badly affected (particularly Appleby and Wigton), all trains to Scotland were postponed indefinitely, with trains on the West Coast Mainline going no further than Preston, as nearby Lancaster suffered flooding and problems with electricity supply. Prime Minister David Cameron visited the city on 7 December 2015 to assess the damage, having earlier called an emergency Cobra meeting.\nDivisions and suburbs.\nIn the north of Carlisle are the suburbs of Kingstown, Lowry Hill and Moorville, formerly part of the parish of Kingmoor. To the south of them are Stanwix, Edentown, Etterby, St Ann's Hill and Belah which were added to Carlisle in 1912. The parish of Stanwix Rural exists but only includes a small part of Carlisle's urban area, Whiteclosegate.\nTo the immediate south of Stanwix is the River Eden. On the opposite bank is the city centre bounded on the west by the West Coast Main Railway line and the River Caldew. In the past industry flourished on the banks of the River Caldew, especially Denton Holme and Caldewgate on the west bank and Wapping, around the former Metal Box works, on the east. West of Caldewgate and north of Denton Holme the suburbs of Newtown, Morton, Sandsfield Park, Longsowerby, Raffles and Belle Vue developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe eastern side of the city centre developed in the 19th century into a more affluent area along the main A69 road. It links with the former village of Botcherby to which a large council estate was added in the mid-20th century and later still Durranhill Housing Estate.\nSouth of the city centre is the Botchergate/St Nicholas area of late Victorian terraced housing similar to that found in Denton Holme and Caldewgate. The Botchergate East area until recently had older slum dwellings.\nTo the south west of Botchergate and St Nicholas are the former villages now suburbs of Upperby and Currock. The urban area spills over the former county borough boundary into Blackwell and Durdar in the civil parish of St Cuthbert Without.\nBetween Upperby and Botcherby is Harraby, a former village once part of St Cuthbert Without and the largest suburb of Carlisle. Harraby is subdivided into Harraby East, New Harraby, Harraby Green, Old Harraby, Petteril Bank and the Durranhill Industrial Estate. Adjoining Harraby to the south but outside the former borough boundary is the hamlet of Carleton.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nCarlisle is linked to the rest of England via the M6 motorway to the south, and to Scotland via the M74/A74 towards Glasgow and the north. Many trunk roads begin or terminate in Carlisle, including the A6 to Penrith and Luton (historically the main road to the south prior to the opening of the M6), the A595 to western Cumbria, the A69 to Newcastle upon Tyne and the A7 to Edinburgh.\nRail.\nCarlisle became a major railway centre with, at one time, seven different companies using Carlisle Citadel railway station. Prior to the building of the Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway marshaling yard in Europe, at Kingmoor, which, although reduced in size, is still operational and used by railfreight companies such as Colas Rail, DB Cargo UK, Freightliner and occasionally Direct Rail Services.\nToday, Carlisle railway station is a principal station on the West Coast Main Line. Other lines branch off to Newcastle, along the Tyne Valley line; Leeds, along the Settle and Carlisle line; Glasgow Central, via Dumfries along the Glasgow South Western Line which connects Ayr and Stranraer for the Stena Line ferry to Port of Belfast or P&amp;O Ferries to Larne Harbour; and west Cumbria along the Cumbrian Coast Line to Whitehaven, Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster. Services are operated by ScotRail, Avanti West Coast, Northern and TransPennine Express. Kingmoor Traction Maintenance Depot is a major facility north of Carlisle, operated by Direct Rail Services.\nBus services.\nMost local bus services in the city are operated by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire. Previously, local independent operator, Reays Coaches, operated a number of local routes, many of which were in competition with Stagecoach.\nThe bus station is situated on Drury Lane, off Lonsdale Street. It has seven stands, each of which are covered by a waiting shelter, as well as a travel centre.\nThe present station was built in the 1990s to replace a larger station that was partially on the same site and had access from Lowther Street, where the Earls Lane shopping area is now. It is owned and managed by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire. The main operators at the bus station are Stagecoach North East, Borders Buses, National Express and Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire.\nAir.\nCarlisle Lake District Airport is a small regional airport located east north-east of the city. The nearest major airport is Newcastle International Airport, near the east coast, which is around away from Carlisle.\nTrade and industry.\nCarlisle became an industrial city in the 19th and early 20th centuries with many textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers opening up mostly in the Denton Holme, Caldewgate and Wapping areas which lie in the Caldew Valley area of Carlisle. (One such manufacturer located in the Denton Holme area was Ferguson Printers, a large textile printing factory that had stood for many years before its closure in the early 1990s). In the early 19th century, a canal was dug connecting Caldewgate with the sea at Port Carlisle. The canal was later filled in and became a railway line.\nCarlisle was served by two electricity power stations. James Street station was built by the corporation and operated from 1899 until 1927. Willow Holme power station, north west of the city, was built and operated by the corporation from 1923 until nationalisation of the industry in 1948. It was closed down in 1980 and demolished in 1988.\nFamous firms that were founded or had factories in Carlisle included Carr's of Carlisle (now part of United Biscuits), Kangol, Metal Box (now part of Crown Holdings) and Cowans Sheldon. Cowans Sheldon originated in the city in the mid 19th century and became one of the world's most important railway and marine engineering firms, manufacturing finally ceased in Carlisle in 1987. Others include the construction firms of John Laing and Story Contracting. Pirelli Carlisle opened in 1969.\nThe hauliers Eddie Stobart Logistics who were founded in nearby Hesket Newmarket and were once part of the Stobart Group, had their HQ in Carlisle. Although they no longer have their HQ in Carlisle they still employ staff in the city. Robsons Border Transport Limited, J &amp; W Watt Limited and F Brown (Carlisle) Limited, all substantial road hauliers, had their HQ in Carlisle.\nUntil 2004, Carlisle's biggest employer was Cavaghan &amp; Gray, which became part of Northern Foods and was subsequently acquired by 2 Sisters Food Group which operated from two sites in the Harraby area of Carlisle producing chilled foods for major supermarket chains. The London Road site closed in 2005 with the loss of almost 700 jobs as production was transferred to the nearby Eastern Way site or other factories around the UK.\nThere are various light industrial estates and business parks located on the fringes of Carlisle and on former industrial sites close to the city centre. The largest is the Kingstown Industrial Estate, located just off the A7 road near to the M6 motorway.\nOn 28 March 2005, Carlisle was granted Fairtrade City status.\nEducation.\nThe University of Cumbria has four campuses in Carlisle on Fusehill Street, Brampton Road, Paternoster Row and Newcastle Street. The university provides a wide range of degree courses in higher education such as Information technology, Applied Psychology, Art, Business, Law, Media, Social Work and Teacher Education.\nCarlisle College is the further education establishment based in the city.\nThe secondary schools within Carlisle are: Richard Rose Central Academy, Richard Rose Morton Academy, Austin Friars St Monicas (Roman Catholic Private School), Trinity School and St John Henry Newman Catholic School. Other secondary schools in the wider City of Carlisle district are: Caldew School (Dalston), William Howard School (Brampton), and Lime House School (Dalston).\nRichard Rose Central Academy replaced St Aidan's County High School and Specialist Sports and Science College, and North Cumbria Technology College (NCTC, formerly Harraby School). It is sponsored by Eddie Stobart owner Andrew Tinkler, and local businessman Brian Scowcroft. It opened in September 2008. In January 2009, there were protests by parents and pupils regarding poor quality education and school facilities. The school was found to be failing and was placed in Special Measures, with the headmaster and chief executive being immediately replaced.\nCulture.\nArt and history.\nThe Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery was opened in 1893 by the Carlisle Corporation. The museum features resident exhibits detailing the history of Roman occupancy of the region, Hadrian's Wall and the Border Reivers. Tullie House, named after the Jacobean mansion in which it is located, hosts travelling exhibitions. The museum has received many awards and was expanded in 1990 and 2000.\nThe city's Guildhall Museum is based in a 14th-century house, and the Border Regiment Military Museum is in the castle.\nMusic and theatre.\nPast.\nHer Majesty's Theatre, in Lowther Street, was constructed in 1874 as the Victoria Hall, and started screening films in 1897. An early music director at the turn of the century was Howard Ellis Carr. After the interior was damaged by fire in 1904, it was rebuilt to designs by architects Beadle &amp; Hope, and reopened in 1905 as Her Majesty's Theatre. Films and variety shows were staged, until around 1919, when it staged only live productions and plays. Robert David MacDonald was artistic director at the theatre. After being briefly renamed Municipal Theatre in the 1960s, the theatre closed in early 1963 and reopened as the Regal Bingo Club in late 1963. This closed in the 1970s and the building was demolished in 1980, replaced by a car park.\nPresent.\nSands Centre Sports Hall is Carlisle's main entertainment venue which sometimes hosts touring musicians, theatre and comedians. The West Walls Theatre is situated in the city centre, an amateur theatre. The Old Fire Station opened in 2015 after being converted into a performing arts venue, it hosts touring bands, live stand-up comedy, dramas and art exhibitions. Brunton Park stadium has hosted live music including an Elton John concert in 2007.\nCarlisle Music Festival takes place in Carlisle Cathedral each year. The defunct Brampton Live, the largest folk festival in the north of England, formerly took place in Brampton. Over the weekend of 14/15 May 2011, Carlisle Lake District Airport hosted Europe's largest free music festival, Radio 1's Big Weekend. The festival's headline acts included Lady Gaga and the Foo Fighters. St Cuthbert's Church hosts an annual series of instrumental and chamber music concerts organised by North Cumbria Recitals.\nFood.\nEvery August the Carlisle Food Fair is held in the pedestrianised area of the city centre. It plays host to produce from across the continent and features local produce including Cumberland sausage, Cumberland sauce, Farmhouse Cheese and Cumberland Mustard.\nIn 2012, \"Fair Food Carlisle\" was awarded the runner-up prize in the government's \"Buy Better Together Challenge\" competition. The \"Buy Better Together Challenge\" was launched by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to work together to negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The challenge received 110 entries and to seven finalists were selected. The \"Fair Food Carlisle\" scheme uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses.\nMedia.\nFrom 1961 to 2009, Carlisle was home to Border Television which served Cumbria, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and parts of Northumberland.\nInitially based at studios in the Harraby area of the city, the station was controversially merged with ITV Tyne Tees in 2009 as part of wide-ranging cutbacks to ITV's regional output.\nAs of 2009, ITV Border's news and sales operations are based at offices in the north of the city, although production of its nightly news programme, \"Lookaround\", is based at Tyne Tees' Gateshead studios.\nAs of 2014, ITV Border is again producing a full regional news service, along with two hours a week of current affairs and features programming, aimed specifically at southern Scotland.\nOn BBC One, the city is served by the regional programme, \"BBC Look North\". \nTelevision signals are received from the Caldbeck TV transmitter.\n\"The Cumberland News\" is the local broadsheet paper published on Fridays. The \"News and Star\" is the evening paper. Both are published by Carlisle-based CN Group. Carlisle is home to BBC Radio Cumbria, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland and Hospital Radio Echo, which was established in 1965 and is the hospital radio station to Cumberland Infirmary, 24 hours a day. CRFM is Carlisle's community based station which also broadcasts online.\nSport.\nFootball.\nAssociation.\nCarlisle is represented in English football by Carlisle United, who currently play in the fourth tier of English football after being relegated to Football League Two in 2024. The club has played at Brunton Park on Warwick Road (A69) since 1909. In November 2011 plans were unveiled for the club to move to a 12,000-seat stadium in Kingmoor Park.\nThe club's first Football League tenure began in 1928 when it was elected to the northern section of the Football League Third Division, replacing Durham City. Its past achievements include reaching the Football League Cup semi-finals (its best run in either of the two domestic cups) in 1969, and winning promotion to the top flight (then the Football League First Division) in 1974. The club topped the English league after winning its first three games of the 1974-75 season, but failed to keep up its good form and was relegated after just one season. In 1987 the club returned to the Football League Fourth Division, and in 2004 was relegated to the Football Conference \u2013 the first former top division club to do so \u2013 only to regain their Football League place after one year. In 1999, Carlisle United escaped relegation from the Football League on the final day of the season when on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass scored an injury time winner against Plymouth Argyle. The 2\u20131 win meant that Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference.\nThough Carlisle United has rarely attracted the national football headlines, the club has fielded high-profile players. Some have achieved fame at bigger clubs after spending their early careers at the club. These include Peter Beardsley, Stan Bowles, Steve Harkness, Matt Jansen and Rory Delap. Many older players spent their later years at Carlisle United after playing for bigger clubs. These include Michael Bridges, Mervyn Day, Kevin Gray and David McCreery. Former managers include Bill Shankly, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Harry Gregg, Mick Wadsworth, Nigel Pearson and Paul Simpson. Since Workington was voted out of the Football League in 1977, Carlisle United were the only Cumbrian team to play senior football until Barrow A.F.C. rejoined the EFL in 2020.\nCeltic Nation F.C. was a Carlisle-based semi-professional club who played in the Northern Football League Division One. They folded in April 2015 after a season of financial problems. Nation started out in 2004 as Gillford Park F.C. and played in the Northern Football Alliance league and won four promotions in 8 years. In 2012 Scottish millionaire Frank Lynch who is based in America, started putting money into the club and changed its name to Celtic Nation. After two years, Lynch withdrew his financial support and the club struggled before folding.\nCarlisle City are a semi professional side who play in the Northern Football League. After spending 40 years in the Northern Football Alliance league, they were promoted to the North West Counties Football League in 2016, before being switched to their current league (at the same level) in 2019. They play at Gillford Park after taking over the lease from Celtic Nation in the summer of 2015.\nNorthbank Carlisle was a club which played its football in the Northern Football Alliance Premier Division. After forty years, the club decided to fold its senior team. Northbank still operates as a youth academy.\nRugby codes.\nCarlisle has two rugby union clubs: Carlisle RFC and Creighton RUFC. Carlisle RFC play at Warwick Road, alongside Carlisle United Football Club. Creighton RUFC originally played near Cumberland Infirmary but sold its ground to housing development company Story Homes in 2004 in exchange for new facilities off Cumwhinton Road, near Junction 42 of the M6. Former England rugby union captain Steve Borthwick is a native of Carlisle.\nThe rugby league team, Carlisle merged with Barrow and left Carlisle. Amateur rugby league club, Carlisle Centurions played in the National Division of the Rugby League Conference until they withdrew in 2010.\nGridiron.\nCarlisle Border Reivers were an American football team that played in Division 2 North until they folded in 2013. They rebranded as the Carlisle Kestrels in 2019, the team's original name. They play at Gillford Park.\nRacing.\nIn 1904, Carlisle Racecourse was established to the south of the city, it is now a first-class racecourse. Horse racing has been held in Carlisle for centuries before the racecourse was formally established.\nThree greyhound racing venues existed in Carlisle during the late 1920s. All three were independent (not affiliated to the sport's governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and were known as a flapping tracks, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The first was located at Gillford Park (home of the Carlisle Centurions RL and more recently Celtic Nation F.C.). The second was on pasture land in the former village of Harraby and was conducted by the Carlisle and Cumberland Greyhound Racing Sports Ltd. The third was north west of Carlisle on the Sheepmount playing fields and more recently the athletics track.\nOther sport.\nCarlisle Cricket Club and Cumbria County Cricket Club play at the Edenside Ground north of the city centre. Cumberland is classed as a minor county by the ECB. The club has won the \"Minor Counties Championship\" twice. The remains of a Roman bathhouse associated with the Roman fort of Petriana have been excavated at the site.\nCarlisle has several golf clubs, including Stoneyholme within the city, and Carlisle Golf Club which hosts regional qualifying to the Open Championship.\nIn 2012, Carlisle was one of the official stop-off points for the Olympic torch before it made its way down to the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London's Olympic Stadium.\nArmed forces.\nAs a frontier town for over a millennium and a half, Carlisle is a military city. It is the most besieged place in the British Isles, having been besieged at least ten times, and has garrisoned troops for most of its history. Cumbria's County regiment, the Border Regiment made its headquarters at Carlisle Castle. The regiment was amalgamated with the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) to become the King's Own Royal Border Regiment and subsequently the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment where its lineage continues. From 1720 to 1959, the regiment fought in many campaigns, including the French and Indian War, the Battle of Culloden, the First World War and the Second World War.\nRAF Carlisle.\nRAF Carlisle also known as 14 MU was located at Kingstown near the present-day Asda. The station closed in 1996 after nearly sixty years in a variety of roles. First established as RAF Kingstown in 1938, it was originally a bomber station, then one of the RAF's Elementary Flying Training Schools and latterly a post-war storage facility.\nRAF Spadeadam.\nThe largest RAF station by area in the country and one of only two electronic warfare ranges in Europe, RAF Spadeadam is located outside the City of Carlisle but maintains strong links with the local community; in 2018, it was awarded the Freedom of the City of Carlisle.\nRoyal Observer Corps, Carlisle Group.\nDuring the Second World War the air raid warning organisation No 32 Group Carlisle Royal Observer Corps operated in the city centre controlled from RAF Kingstown. The association with Kingstown developed further in 1962 when the ROC ceased its aircraft spotting role for the RAF and took on a new role plotting nuclear explosions and warning the public of radioactive fallout for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO). A new administration building and a protected, hardened Nuclear Reporting bunker was built at RAF Carlisle. The nuclear bunker was a standard above-ground structure and both the bunker and headquarters hutting were on a separate site at Crindledyke outside the main gates of RAF Carlisle. The Carlisle group was redesignated no 22 Group ROC.\nThe ROC constructed a smaller nuclear reporting post, Kingstown post (OS ref:NY 3837 5920), on the main RAF Carlisle site. The post was an underground protected bunker for a crew of three observers. The headquarters bunker accommodated an operational crew of around 100 with dormitory and canteen facilities an operations room and life support plant.\nThe Royal Observer Corps was stood down and its parent organisation the UKWMO was disbanded in December 1995 after the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence. The ROC buildings were demolished in 1996 and replaced by a cellphone communications mast. The foundations of the nuclear bunker can still be partially seen outlined in the concreted yard, which also contains the Air Training Corps hut during recent further development of the site.\nLegend and folklore.\nArthurian legend.\nThere are many legends and folkloric stories about the city during the Dark Ages, such as the \"Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle\", about the nephew of King Arthur and the \"free man\" of the city.\nIn a 14th-century poem, legend has it that Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table, stayed at the Castle of Carlisle while on a hunting expedition in the haunted Inglewood Forest. He then slept with the Carle's wife and killed him. This poem has strong parallels with another 14th century poem about Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The story has since been re-adapted many times, most recently in films from 1973, 1984 and 2021.\nBy some accounts, Carlisle is also none other than Camelot, the mythical seat of King Arthur's court.\nCurse of Carlisle.\nIn local folklore, the \"Curse of Carlisle\" is a 16th-century curse that is said to have been invoked by Archbishop Dunbar of Glasgow in 1525 upon cross-border families, known as the Border Reivers, who lived by stealing cattle and pillaging. For the millennium celebrations, the local council commissioned a 14-tonne granite artwork inscribed with all 1,069 words of the curse. Following the installation of the stone, Carlisle suffered floods, foot-and-mouth disease, job losses and a \"goal famine\" for the football team. In response to this, the city council considered removing the stone; however, Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled \"high priest of the British white witches\", proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: \"A curse can only work if people believe in it. I think at the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse.\"\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nCarlisle is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
