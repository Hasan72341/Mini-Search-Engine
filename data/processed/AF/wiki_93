The Jazz compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. Since the 1991\u201392 season, the team has played its home games at the Delta Center, an arena they share with the Utah Mammoth of the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise began as an expansion team in the 1974\u201375 season as the New Orleans Jazz, a tribute to New Orleans' history of originating jazz music. The Jazz relocated from New Orleans to Salt Lake City on June 8, 1979.\nThe Jazz were one of the least successful teams in the league in their early years. Although 10 seasons elapsed before the Jazz qualified for their first playoff appearance in 1984, they did not miss the playoffs again until 2004. During the late 1980s, John Stockton and Karl Malone arose as the franchise players for the team and formed one of the most famed pick and roll duos in NBA history. Led by coach Jerry Sloan, who took over from Frank Layden in 1988, they became one of the powerhouse teams of the 1990s, culminating in two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998, where they lost both times to the Chicago Bulls.\nBoth Stockton and Malone moved on in 2003. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, the Jazz returned to prominence under the on-court leadership of point guard Deron Williams. However, partway through the 2010\u201311 season, the Jazz began restructuring after Sloan retired and Williams was traded. Quin Snyder was hired as head coach in June 2014. With the development of Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell into All-Stars, the Jazz launched themselves back into title contention, eventually earning the league's best regular season record in the 2020\u201321 season. However, following disappointing early playoff exits in both 2021 and 2022, the Jazz traded Mitchell and Gobert in the 2022 offseason and entered a new era of rebuilding centered around Lauri Markkanen, who was acquired in the Mitchell trade.\nHistory.\n1974\u20131979: Early years in New Orleans with Pete Maravich.\nOn June 7, 1974, the New Orleans Jazz were admitted as an expansion franchise into the National Basketball Association (NBA). The first owner of the team was an ownership group led by Sam Battistone. Team officials selected the name because of its definition in the dictionary: collective improvisation. The team began its inaugural season in New Orleans in the 1974\u201375 season. The team colors were purple, gold, and green. The team's first major move was to trade for star player Pete Maravich (who had played college basketball at LSU) from the Atlanta Hawks for two first-round draft picks, three second-round picks, and one third-round pick over the next three years.\nVenue issues were a continual problem for the team while it was based in New Orleans. In the Jazz's first season, they played in the Municipal Auditorium and Loyola Field House, where the basketball court was raised so high that the NBA Players Association made the team put a net around the court to prevent players from falling off of the court and into the stands. Later, the Jazz played games in the cavernous Louisiana Superdome, but things were no better, because of high demand for the stadium, onerous lease terms, New Orleans' 11% amusement tax (highest in the nation), and Maravich's constant knee problems. They also faced the prospect of spending a whole month on the road each year because of New Orleans' Mardi Gras festivities, similar to the long road trip faced by the San Antonio Spurs each season during their city's rodeo.\n1979\u20131984: Moving to Utah, and the Frank Layden era.\nDeciding the Jazz were no longer viable in New Orleans, Battistone decided to move elsewhere. After scouting several new homes, he decided on Salt Lake City, even though it was a smaller market. Salt Lake City had previously been home to the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA) from 1970 to 1976. The Stars had been extremely popular in the city and had even won an ABA title in their first season after moving from Los Angeles. However, their financial situation deteriorated in their last two seasons, and they were shut down by the league 16 games into the 1975\u201376 season in December 1975 after missing payroll. The franchise kept the name despite the lack of a jazz music scene in Utah, as there was not enough time before the start of the 1979\u201380 season to receive league approval for a name change. The NBA would return to New Orleans in 2002 when the Charlotte Hornets relocated to become the New Orleans Hornets (now New Orleans Pelicans).\nThe Jazz's attendance declined slightly after the team's move from New Orleans to Utah, partly because of a late approval for the move (June 1979) and also poor marketing in the Salt Lake City area.\nTom Nissalke departed as coach after the Jazz started the 1981\u201382 season 8\u201312, and general manager Frank Layden replaced him.\nIn 1983, team was losing money, and management was crafting stunts, such as playing games at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, to help the team become more profitable. The team was rumored to be moving as a result of Battistone's cash shortage as well as the fact they were playing in the league's smallest market. However, fortunes on the court improved, with a healthy Adrian Dantley, Jeff Wilkins, and rookie Thurl Bailey at the forward positions, Mark Eaton and Rich Kelley jointly manning the post, Rickey Green and Darrell Griffith at the guards, and John Drew adding 17 points per game off the bench. They went 45\u201337 and won the Midwest Division, the first winning season and division championship in team history.\n1984\u20132003: The Malone and Stockton era.\nJazz fans were not happy when the team picked an unknown guard in the first round of the 1984 NBA draft, John Stockton. The Jazz fans on hand for the draft party booed the selection.\nThe 1984\u201385 season saw the emergence of Mark Eaton as a defensive force. Eaton averaged 5.6 blocks per game (still an NBA single-season record) along with 9.7 points and 11.3 rebounds, and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. On the downside, John Drew played only 19 games all season, which deprived the team of their high-scoring sixth man. However, the Jazz returned to the playoffs, facing the Houston Rockets and their All-Star centers, Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson. The Jazz prevailed in the series, 3\u20132, and advanced to the second round, losing the series to the high-scoring Denver Nuggets, 4\u20131.\nThe team's perennial financial woes and instability were somewhat stabilized during April 1985, when auto dealer Larry H. Miller bought 50% of the team from Battistone for $8 million. Battistone had been seeking to move the team.\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the team added Louisiana Tech forward Karl Malone, who made an immediate impact in the \u00a0season, averaging 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds per game. However, starter Darrell Griffith missed the season with a stress fracture, and the Jazz hovered around .500 most of the year. Adrian Dantley missed the postseason, and the Jazz lost in the first round to the Dallas Mavericks, 3\u20131.\nDuring the 1986 off-season, Battistone was approached to sell the team to Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, who would have moved the team to Minneapolis. Larry Miller did not want to sell the team, but because of contractual language in his agreement with Battistone, could have been bought out by the new owners if he had refused to sell. Offers went as high as $28 million (the Jazz were valued at $16 million less than a year earlier when Miller purchased half for $8 million) before Miller stepped in at the last minute, purchasing Battistone's remaining 50% for $14 million and keeping the team in Utah. Wolfenson and Ratner later became the founders of the Minnesota Timberwolves expansion franchise which, coincidentally, was almost sold and moved to New Orleans in 1994.\nIn 1986, Adrian Dantley, the team's star player who had carried them through the early years in Utah, was traded to Detroit for Kelly Tripucka, who ended up splitting time with Thurl Bailey. Darrell Griffith, back from injuries that caused him to miss the 1985\u201386 season, lost his starter spot at guard to Bob Hansen. Stockton warranted more time at the point guard position. Despite all these changes, the team finished 44\u201338 before losing to the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.\nFor the 1987\u201388 season, Stockton took over for Rickey Green as the starting point guard, and Malone established himself as one of the better power forwards in the league. The team finished 47\u201335 and defeated Portland, 3\u20131, in the first round, earning a second-round matchup with the reigning NBA champions, the Los Angeles Lakers. After Los Angeles took Game 1 at home, the Jazz won Game 2 in Los Angeles, 101\u201397, and took the lead in the series 2\u20131 with a Game 3 win in Salt Lake City. The Jazz lost Games 4 and 5, but won Game 6, 108\u201380, tying the series 3\u20133. In the decisive Game 7, the Lakers won 109\u201398.\n1988\u20131990: Arrival of Jerry Sloan.\nDuring the 1988\u201389 season, Frank Layden stepped down as head coach of the Jazz after the first 17 games, and was replaced by Jerry Sloan. The Jazz won 51 games and the Midwest Division championship as they grew better overall. Malone and Stockton, as well as Mark Eaton, were the leaders of the team and also All-Star selections. Eaton won Defensive Player of the Year for the second time, and it appeared the Jazz were ready to take the next step toward contending for an NBA title, after having pushed the Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference semifinals the previous season. However, the second-seeded Jazz were eliminated in the first round in three games by the seventh-seeded Golden State Warriors.\nThe following year, 1989\u201390, the Jazz made some changes. Thurl Bailey, who was relied on for 19 points per game the previous season, saw his playing time reduced in favor of rookie Blue Edwards, who played a prominent role with the team. The result was the best win\u2013loss mark in team history, as the Jazz finished 55\u201327, second in the division to the San Antonio Spurs (56\u201326). Malone had his best season statistically, averaging 31.0 points and 11.1 rebounds. Stockton averaged 17.2 points and 14.5 assists per game, both career highs, with the assist total and average leading the NBA that season. In the playoffs, the Jazz played the Phoenix Suns in the first round, led by All-Stars Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson. The Suns defeated the Jazz 3 games to 2. Again, the Jazz were left with questions as to how they could do so well in the regular season but fail to advance in the playoffs.\n1990\u20131996: Working toward championship contention.\nFor the 1990\u201391 season, the Jazz made another move to improve the team by executing a three-way trade that brought shooting guard Jeff Malone to Utah from the Washington Bullets, while Eric Leckner and Bob Hansen were sent from Utah to the Sacramento Kings and Pervis Ellison going from Sacramento to Washington.\nThe Jazz began the season 22\u201315 before going 27\u20138 in January and February, with new addition Jeff Malone averaging 18.6 points, giving them three strong scoring options (Karl Malone, Jeff Malone, and John Stockton\u00a0\u2013 64.8 of the team's 104 points per game). The Jazz finished 54\u201328, second in the division to San Antonio by a game, similar to their division finish the prior year. In the playoffs, they met the Phoenix Suns for the second year in a row. In Game 1 Utah won 129\u201390, which set the tone for the series, as Utah eliminated the Suns 3\u20131, earning a second-round matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, the defending Western Conference champions. The Jazz played well, keeping close in most of the games, but lost the series 4\u20131 to a deeper and more experienced Trail Blazers team.\nThe 1991\u201392 season proved to be the most successful in team history to that time. The Jazz moved to the Delta Center, a state-of-the-art arena that featured a seating capacity of 19,911. The new venue was a considerable improvement over the Salt Palace, which seated just over 12,000 and lacked luxury suites and retail space. Early in the year, a trade brought Tyrone Corbin, a tough defensive forward, from Minnesota in exchange for fan-favorite Thurl Bailey.\nThe Jazz went 55\u201327 and won the Midwest Division championship for the first time since 1989. In the playoffs, the Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 3\u20132 in the first round, then beat the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round, 4\u20131, to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time, where they again faced and lost to Portland, this time 4\u20132.\nThe 1992\u201393 season was a letdown, as the team slumped to 47\u201335 and third place in the division. The center position, manned by defensive workhorse Mark Eaton for most of the past decade, became suspect as Eaton struggled with injuries and age. The bright spot for the season was the hosting of the NBA All-Star Game and the surrounding events of All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City. In the playoffs, the Jazz lost to Seattle in the first round, 3\u20132. During the postseason, the team addressed its struggles at the center position by acquiring Felton Spencer from Minnesota in return for backup center Mike Brown.\nDuring the 1993\u201394 season, the Jazz traded Jeff Malone to the Philadelphia 76ers for shooting guard Jeff Hornacek. Hornacek meshed well with Stockton, and the Jazz improved to 53\u201329. In the playoffs, they faced San Antonio in the first round, shutting down NBA scoring leader David Robinson throughout the series. Robinson had averaged 29.8 points on 50 percent shooting during the regular season, numbers that dropped to 20.0 and 41 percent in the series against Utah. The Jazz then fought off a determined Denver Nuggets team 4\u20133 in the Conference semifinals (almost blowing a 3\u20130 series lead in the process) to advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets 4\u20131.\nIn the 1994\u201395 season, the Jazz had significant depth and talent and were expected to make a serious run for the championship. However, they lost starter Spencer 34 games into the season with a ruptured Achilles tendon. Despite this setback, the Jazz finished 60\u201322 before again losing to Houston in the playoffs, 3\u20132, in the first round.\nGreg Ostertag was added to the team for the 1995\u201396 season. The Jazz went 55\u201327, and reached the Conference Finals for the third time in history, nearly overcoming 3\u20131 series deficit before eventually succumbing to Seattle, 4\u20133.\n1996\u20131998: Reaching the NBA Finals.\nIn the next two seasons, the Jazz were finally able to capitalize on regular-season success. In 1996\u201397, the Jazz had the best record in franchise history (64\u201318), won the Midwest Division and finished with the best record in the Western Conference. The team included Stockton, Malone and Hornacek, as well as Bryon Russell, Antoine Carr, Howard Eisley and Shandon Anderson. Malone won his first NBA MVP award, averaging 27.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game.\nThe Jazz reached the NBA Finals for the first time after beating the Clippers 3\u20130, Lakers 4\u20131 and Rockets 4\u20132. The Jazz then met Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the Finals, losing the series 4\u20132, with the last two games decided in the final seconds (scores of 90\u201388 and 90\u201386).\nDuring the off-season, the Jazz made no changes to the roster. As the 1997\u201398 season neared, they were expected to be contenders for the championship again. However, Stockton suffered a serious knee injury before the season, and missed the first 18 games, in which the Jazz went 11\u20137.\nOn February 17, 1998, at the NBA trade deadline, the Jazz consummated a trade with the Orlando Magic, to acquire center Rony Seikaly in an attempt to bolster their center rotation. However, Seikaly refused to report within the mandated 48 hours required by NBA rules. From there, the trade was called off, and the Jazz took Chris Morris &amp; Greg Foster back. Rumors had Seikaly with a serious foot injury; however, Seikaly insisted the Jazz torpedoed the deal and that he wanted to play for them; however, Seikaly's refusal to report effectively killed the deal. After the trade was off, Orlando pivoted and traded Seikaly to the New Jersey Nets, where he would play a total of 18 games over the next 1 1/2 seasons before retiring from the NBA.\nThe Jazz played better after Stockton returned from his early-season injury. The team went 51\u201313 over the last 64 games, to finish at 62\u201320, and won the Midwest Division and received home-court advantage for the playoffs.\nIn the playoffs, the Jazz beat Houston 3\u20132, and San Antonio 4\u20131, to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the third straight year. Utah, with a veteran roster of Stockton, Malone and Hornacek, faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by superstar Shaquille O'Neal, guards Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and a young Kobe Bryant. The Jazz set the tone for the series with a win in Game 1, 112\u201377. Game 2, a 99\u201395 Jazz victory, and Games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles were decided by an average of 7.5 points. The Jazz swept the Lakers and earned a second consecutive trip to the NBA Finals.\nIn the 1998 NBA Finals (again against the Chicago Bulls), the Jazz took Game 1 at home, 88\u201385 in overtime. However, the Bulls overcame a slow start to win Game 2, 93\u201388, easily took Game 3, 96\u201354, and won Game 4, 86\u201382, to lead the series 3\u20131. The Jazz fought back and won Game 5 on the road, 83\u201381, to trail 3\u20132 in the series, with Game 6 (and a Game 7 if needed) in Salt Lake City. The Jazz held a lead in most of Game 6, but the Bulls rallied, and in the last seconds of the game, Michael Jordan stole the ball from Malone on the final Jazz possession and then pushed off of Bryon Russell and made a jump shot to win the game, 87\u201386, and the series for Chicago, 4\u20132.\n1998\u20132003: Final years of Stockton/Malone.\nIn the 1999 season, shortened to 50 games due to a lockout, the Jazz finished 37\u201313, tied with the Spurs for the best record in the league. They defeated the Sacramento Kings in five games in the first round of the playoffs. However, they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite yet another disappointment, Malone was awarded his second MVP.\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 season, the Jazz finished 55\u201327 and won the Midwest Division but again struggled in the postseason, and lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. In the off-season, Hornacek retired and Howard Eisley was traded in a four-team deal that brought in Donyell Marshall. They selected high-school basketball star DeShawn Stevenson in the first round of the 2000 NBA draft.\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, the Jazz posted a 53\u201329 record, but lost in the playoffs, surrendering a 2\u20130 series lead in the first round of the playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks to lose the series 3\u20132. This was their earliest exit from the playoffs since the 1994\u201395 season.\nIn the 2001\u201302 season, Andrei Kirilenko made his rookie debut, averaging 10.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.91 blocks per game. The team started the season slowly, with a record of 16\u201315 over the first two months, and finished 12\u201313 to go 44\u201338 overall. They lost to the Sacramento Kings 3\u20131 in the first round of the playoffs.\nPrior to the 2002\u201303 season, Marshall and Russell moved on to other teams. Matt Harpring was brought over from the Philadelphia 76ers, and took over the starting forward spot next to Malone, averaging 17.6 points and 6.6 rebounds, the best numbers of his career. The Jazz approached 50 wins going into the playoffs, but ended up falling short with a record of 47\u201335. They faced the Sacramento Kings in the playoffs again, and lost in a five-game first-round series, 4\u20131.\nAfter the season, Stockton retired, and Malone left as a free agent to join the Los Angeles Lakers.\n2003\u20132005: Post-Malone/Stockton era.\nWithout Malone and Stockton, the faces of the Jazz franchise, the team lacked foundation as it went into the 2003\u201304 season. They were expected to finish near the bottom of the NBA by several NBA preview magazines, including \"Sports Illustrated\". The Jazz finished with a 42\u201340 record. The team featured several unheralded players who emerged as key contributors, including Kirilenko, Raja Bell, and Carlos Arroyo. In particular, Kirilenko demonstrated versatility on both offense and defense and earned a spot in the All-Star Game. The Jazz missed the playoffs by one game to the Denver Nuggets, ending a streak of 20 consecutive seasons in the playoffs. Jerry Sloan finished second in the voting for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, losing to Hubie Brown of the Memphis Grizzlies.\nDuring the off-season, the team made moves to change the roster; they acquired Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur as free agents and re-signed Carlos Arroyo and Gordan Giricek to extensions.\nThe 2004\u201305 season was marked by injuries, first to Arroyo and Ra\u00fal L\u00f3pez, and later to Boozer and Kirilenko, which were a large part of the team's fall to the bottom of the division. When healthy, Boozer averaged 17.8 points and 9.0 rebounds in 51 games. The Jazz ended the 2004\u201305 season 26\u201356, their worst since the 1981\u201382 season.\n2005\u20132010: The Williams and Boozer era.\nIn 2005 the Utah Jazz acquired Deron Williams with the third overall draft pick but faced challenges as injuries plagued key players like Carlos Boozer, Gordan Giricek, and Andrei Kirilenko. The Jazz narrowly missed the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341, and saw veteran Greg Ostertag retire.\nThe 2006 offseason brought strong draft picks, including Paul Millsap and Ronnie Brewer, and a trade for veteran Derek Fisher. Improved play in the 2006\u201307 season saw the Jazz finish 51\u201331, with All-Star nods for Boozer and Mehmet Okur. Despite internal tension with Kirilenko, the Jazz advanced to the Western Conference Finals but were overpowered by the San Antonio Spurs, who later won the NBA championship.\nIn 2007, the Jazz continued to build momentum but were marred by off-court stories. Controversy arose after Kirilenko led his Russian national team to a win in EuroBasket 2007 (the European championship), a tournament in which he was named MVP. After that, Kirilenko posted on a blog that he wished to be traded from the Jazz and would be willing to walk away from his contract. However, no trade was made and he remained with the team. Elsewhere, Derek Fisher was allowed to walk off the team following his daughter's diagnosis of eye-cancer, leading Fisher to return to the Lakers. Nevertheless, key acquisitions like Kyle Korver bolstered the team, which secured a 54\u201328 record in 2007\u201308. After defeating Houston in the playoffs, they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round.\nThe 2008\u201309 season was marred by injuries to stars like Williams, Boozer, and Okur, alongside the death of team owner Larry H. Miller. Despite a strong home record, they finished 48\u201334 and were eliminated in the first playoff round by the Lakers. Williams emerged as one of the league\u2019s elite point guards, averaging 19.4 points and 10.8 assists, despite playing the entire season with a lingering ankle injury.\nIn 2009 the Jazz drafted Eric Maynor and added undrafted rookie Wesley Matthews. A midseason trade of Ronnie Brewer, criticized by Williams, allowed Matthews to step into a starting role. Boozer returned to form, Korver set an NBA three-point shooting record, and Williams made his first All-Star appearance. The Jazz concluded the 2009\u201310 season 53\u201329 but suffered critical injuries to Kirilenko and Okur in the playoffs. Despite overcoming Denver in the first round, they were swept by the Lakers, marking their third consecutive playoff exit at the hands of Los Angeles.\n2010\u20132017: Rebuilding and the post-Jerry Sloan era.\n2010\u20132013: Departure of Williams &amp; Boozer, Jefferson/Millsap duo.\nThe Jazz's 2010 NBA draft selections included Gordon Hayward (No. 9 overall) and Jeremy Evans (No. 55 overall). In free agency, Carlos Boozer signed a five-year, $80 million deal with the Chicago Bulls on July 7, 2010, later converted into a sign-and-trade yielding Utah a $13 million trade exception. The Bulls also signed Kyle Korver to a reported three-year, $13 million deal, while Wesley Matthews joined the Portland Trail Blazers with a five-year, $33 million offer sheet. To counter roster losses, Utah acquired Al Jefferson from Minnesota using the Boozer trade exception and signed Raja Bell to a three-year, $10 million contract.\nThe Jazz rebranded in 2010, reverting to their \"music note\" logo and unveiling new uniforms. Restricted free-agent Kyrylo Fesenko accepted a $1 million qualifying offer, while Francisco Elson and Earl Watson joined for the 2010\u201311 season. The team began the season strongly but faltered mid-season, prompting the resignation of longtime head coach Jerry Sloan on February 10, 2011. Tyrone Corbin replaced Sloan, while Jeff Hornacek joined as an assistant coach.\nOn February 23, 2011, the Jazz traded star Deron Williams to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, and two first-round picks. Concerns about retaining Williams long-term influenced the trade. The Jazz missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006, finishing the season 39\u201343. In the 2011 draft, they selected Enes Kanter and Alec Burks. Following the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season, Utah traded Mehmet Okur, and Andrei Kirilenko opted to remain in Russia. They signed veterans Josh Howard and Jamaal Tinsley.\nDuring the 2012 offseason, the Jazz traded Devin Harris for Marvin Williams and selected Kevin Murphy in the draft. They added Mo Williams and Randy Foye, re-signed Evans and Tinsley, and saw longtime Jazz player C.J. Miles leave for Cleveland. Dennis Lindsey became general manager, while Scott Layden departed for the San Antonio Spurs.\nBefore the 2013\u201314 season, Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson left in free agency, joining Atlanta and Charlotte, respectively. Jeff Hornacek became head coach of the Phoenix Suns. The Jazz were officially eliminated from playoff contention on March 14, 2014, after a 96\u201387 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n2013\u20132017: Hayward/Gobert era.\nOn June 27, 2013, Rudy Gobert was selected with the 27th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was later traded on draft night to the Utah Jazz. On July 6, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Jazz and joined them for the 2013 NBA Summer League.\nOn May 20, 2014, the Jazz earned the 5th pick in the 2014 NBA draft at the NBA Draft Lottery, with which they chose 18-year-old Australian point guard Dante Exum. They also had the 23rd pick from a trade with the Golden State Warriors and their own pick in the second round (the 35th pick overall). With the 23rd pick they selected Rodney Hood from Duke University. The 35th pick was used to select Jarnell Stokes, who was subsequently traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for a future second-round pick.\nOn June 6, 2014, Atlanta Hawks assistant coach Quin Snyder was named the eighth head coach in team history. Snyder signed a three-year contract with a team option for a fourth. He replaced Tyrone Corbin. Prior to joining the Utah Jazz, Snyder previously served as an NBA assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Jazz ended the 2015\u201316 season with a win\u2013loss record of 40\u201342, good for ninth place in the Western Conference; however, the team failed to qualify to play in the NBA Playoffs by one game.\nThe Jazz finished 51\u201331 during the 2016\u201317 season and qualified to play in the NBA Playoffs as the Western Conference's fifth seed. They defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games in the first round for the team's first playoff series win since 2010. The team advanced to play the defending Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals where they were swept 4\u20130, ending their season. Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert had breakout seasons in 2017. After putting together several solid seasons in prior years, Hayward was named an NBA All-Star, while Gobert was named to the NBA Defensive First Team and All NBA Second Team.\nHayward left the Jazz to sign with the Boston Celtics as a free agent on July 4, 2017, announcing his decision in a letter published by \"The Players' Tribune\". Hayward's contract was finalized on July 14, 2017.\n2017\u20132022: The Gobert and Mitchell era.\n2017: Donovan Mitchell arrives.\nOn June 22, 2017, Donovan Mitchell was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets, who immediately traded Mitchell's rights to the Jazz in exchange for Trey Lyles. The Jazz also acquired veteran Ricky Rubio to play the point guard position.\nThe Jazz began the 2017\u201318 season poorly, with an injury to Gobert and a lack of scoring leaving them with a 17\u201321 record by the end of December. In the second half of the season, the Jazz made rookie Mitchell a starter, and he subsequently led the team and all rookies in the league in points scored. Mitchell went on to break the record for the most three-pointers ever made by a rookie. The team improved drastically as a scoring team, and with the return of Gobert and improved play of Rubio, the Jazz finished the season winning 32 of their last 45 games and ended with a 48\u201334 record. The late-season burst earned the Jazz a no. 5 seed in the 2018 NBA playoffs, where they went on to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 4\u20132 in the first round before losing in the Second Round to the Houston Rockets in five games. After the season, Rudy Gobert was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Donovan Mitchell was runner-up in the Rookie of the Year voting, Quin Snyder was runner-up Coach of the Year, and general manager Dennis Lindsey was runner-up Executive of the Year.\n2018\u20132020: Regular-season success; playoff disappointment.\nThe 2018\u201319 season began with promise for the Jazz after the surprising success of the 2017\u201318 season. However, by the end of November they were 11\u201312 and in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. This continued in December as Mitchell struggled with his shot, and the Jazz record continued to be around the break-even mark.\nHowever, in the New Year, Mitchell's performance improved as he was averaging 27.7 points in January and 25.4 in February, and the Jazz improved down the stretch, closing out the season with a 32\u201313 run to finish 50\u201332 and earned the fifth seed in the Western Conference playoffs. In the first round, they played against the Houston Rockets, who were on a run of their own, going 33\u201314 in 2019 after a slow start. Houston proved to be too much for the Jazz, taking the series 4\u20131.\nOn May 10, 2019, the Jazz announced the promotion of Dennis Lindsey to executive vice president of basketball operations and Justin Zanik to general manager.\nDuring the 2019 off-season, the Jazz added several players by trade and free agency, including Jeff Green, Mike Conley Jr., Ed Davis, Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107, and Emmanuel Mudiay, while Derrick Favors, Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, Raul Neto, and Ricky Rubio left the team. Sports media viewed the changes as positive.\nOn the opening day of the 2019\u201320 season, a press conference was held, announcing that Utah would host the 2023 NBA All-Star Game. This would be the second time the Jazz hosted this event; the first was in 1993.\nOn December 24, 2019, the Jazz announced that they had waived forward Jeff Green, signed G-League free agent Rayjon Tucker, and traded Dante Exum to the Cleveland Cavaliers for shooting guard Jordan Clarkson, whose trade in particular was seen as overwhelmingly positive by the media, if also bittersweet for Jazz fans who hoped that Exum would eventually mature into the franchise cornerstone he was drafted to be.\nOn January 30, 2020, Gobert and Mitchell were named reserves for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. This marked the first time since 2007 that multiple Utah Jazz players had been selected to the All-Star game, and the first time since 2000 that multiple Jazz players had actually appeared in the game (Mehmet Okur had replaced an injured Carlos Boozer in 2007). In March 2020, Gobert and Mitchell were diagnosed with COVID-19, making the Jazz the first major sporting franchise in North America to be directly affected by the disease, and resulting in the suspension of all remaining NBA games of the season.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Jazz were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. The Jazz were mediocre in the eight seeding games, posting a 3\u20135 record. However, this allowed them to lock up the Western Conference sixth seed and a favorable matchup with the Denver Nuggets. In game 1, Donovan Mitchell achieved the third-highest single-game scoring total in playoff history (behind only Michael Jordan and Elgin Baylor) with 57 points, but the Jazz lost to the Nuggets in overtime. Mitchell's brilliant play continued through the series as the Jazz won the next three games, two of them by lopsided margins; however, they blew their 3\u20131 lead and lost at the buzzer in game 7 of the series.\nWithin hours of the Jazz's playoff loss, Mitchell agreed to a five-year, $195 million contract extension that would keep him in Utah. On December 20, 2020, Rudy Gobert signed a five-year, $205 million contract extension, the third-largest contract in NBA history and the largest ever for a center. During the 2020 off-season, the Jazz traded away backup centers Tony Bradley and Ed Davis, re-signed Jordan Clarkson to a four-year, $51.52 million contract, and re-acquired Derrick Favors from the Pelicans to serve as a more reliable post presence off the bench. In the 2020 NBA draft, the Jazz selected Kansas center Udoka Azubuike 27th overall in the first round and Syracuse forward Elijah Hughes 39th overall in the second round.\n2020\u20132021: Three NBA All-Stars; playoff contention.\nOn October 28, 2020, the Utah Jazz organization announced that Ryan Smith, an Oregon native (now based in Utah) and the billionaire co-founder of Qualtrics, had purchased the team from the Miller family. Smith agreed at the time of the sale to honor the terms of the legacy trust into which the Millers had placed the Jazz organization, including the provision requiring the team to be kept in Utah. On April 16, 2021, the Jazz announced that Dwyane Wade had purchased a minority ownership stake in the team and was expected to have hands-on involvement in team operations.\nThe Jazz began their 2020\u201321 season with an NBA-best and franchise-record 23\u20135 start, with Donovan Mitchell leading the team in scoring and Jordan Clarkson emerging as the frontrunner for Sixth Man of the Year. On February 17, 2021, head coach Quin Snyder was announced as the head coach of the Western Conference team for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the first Jazz coach so honored since Frank Layden in 1984. On February 23, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were announced as All-Star reserves for the second consecutive season, with Mitchell also slated to compete in the three-point contest. On March 5, Mike Conley was selected as an All-Star reserve for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Devin Booker. Conley was also announced as Booker's replacement in the three-point contest. This marked the second time in franchise history (the first being 1989 with John Stockton, Karl Malone, and Mark Eaton) that three Jazz players had been selected as All-Stars.\nOn February 24, 2021, former Jazz forward Elijah Millsap alleged via Twitter that Dennis Lindsey (then the team's general manager) had made a racist remark to him during an interview in 2015. Both Lindsey and Quin Snyder, who was present for the conversation, adamantly denied the allegations. The Jazz subsequently announced that independent counsel had been retained by the organization to investigate whether the allegations were true. On March 16, the NBA announced that this investigation had concluded that there was no proof Lindsey had made the comments, citing the fact that nobody associated with the meeting could corroborate Millsap's story (including Millsap's own agent, who confirmed that Millsap had never mentioned the incident to him at the time). The Jazz organization subsequently cleared Lindsey of any wrongdoing.\nOn May 16, 2021, the Jazz defeated the Sacramento Kings 121\u201399 to clinch sole possession of the best regular season record in the NBA for the first time in franchise history (the Jazz had tied for the best record in 1998 and 1999). At the conclusion of the regular season, Jordan Clarkson was named Sixth Man of the Year, becoming the first Jazz player to win the award and winning over his own teammate, Joe Ingles, who was runner-up.\nIn the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs, the Jazz played the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies. After losing game 1 in a surprising home upset with Donovan Mitchell held out due to lingering injury concerns, the Jazz won the next four games to advance to the Western Conference semifinals. Mitchell shot an impressive 11-16 from the field during game 5, scoring 30 points and recording 10 assists to help the Jazz seal the series. In the second round, the Jazz played the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers. Despite winning the first two games at home, the Jazz were eliminated from the playoffs after the Clippers won the next four games.\nThe Jazz regressed somewhat during the 2021\u201322 season; while Mitchell and Gobert were once again named All-Stars, the team did not have the same regular season success. Still, the Jazz posted a 49\u201333 record and made the playoffs as a 5th seed. In the first round, they faced the Dallas Mavericks. After winning game 1 in Dallas, the Jazz struggled and lost the series 4\u20132.\n2022\u2013present: The post Gobert\u2013Mitchell era.\n2022\u2013present: Arrival of Lauri Markkanen.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Jazz traded three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award winner Rudy Gobert to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, Walker Kessler (the 22nd selection in the 2022 NBA draft), four future first round draft picks, and a pick swap. On August 25, 2022, Beverley was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Stanley Johnson and Talen Horton-Tucker. On September 1, 2022, the Jazz traded three-time All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Collin Sexton, Lauri Markkanen, Ochai Agbaji (the Cavaliers' top selection and the 14th pick in the 2022 NBA draft), three future unprotected first-round draft picks, and two pick swaps.\nOn June 5, 2022, Quin Snyder announced his resignation as head coach of the Jazz. On June 29, the Jazz organization announced that Boston Celtics assistant coach Will Hardy had been hired as Snyder's replacement.\nOn February 2, 2023, Lauri Markkanen was selected to appear as a reserve in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, his first career All-Star selection. On February 10, it was further announced that Markkanen had been selected as an All-Star starter as a result of injuries to Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson. Markkanen also participated in the Three-Point Contest during All-Star weekend. In addition, the Jazz fielded a three-player team of Collin Sexton, Walker Kessler, and Jordan Clarkson in the NBA's re-formatted team skills challenge. The three Jazzmen ultimately won the event.\nOn February 8, 2023, the Jazz traded Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt to the Los Angeles Lakers and Mike Conley Jr., Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and two future second-round picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a three-team trade. In return, the Jazz received Russell Westbrook, Juan Toscano-Anderson, and Damian Jones along with the Lakers' 2027 first-round pick. The Jazz subsequently negotiated a buyout of Westbrook's contract and waived him, allowing him to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nThe Jazz finished the 2022\u201323 season 37\u201345 and failed to qualify for the NBA playoffs. At the conclusion of the season, Lauri Markkanen received the NBA Most Improved Player Award.\nThe Utah Jazz, led by Markkanen, finished the next season 31\u201351, missing the playoffs once again. A highlight of the season was Keyonte George's appearance on the All-Rookie second team. The next season, Russell Westbrook was acquired and waived once again by the Jazz during the offseason. They also signed sharpshooting veteran Patty Mills.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Jazz. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Utah Jazz seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nMascot.\nJazz Bear is the club's mascot. He was introduced to the league on November 4, 1994. He usually excites the crowd during halftime by coming onto the court on a motorbike.\nLogos and uniforms.\nNew Orleans Jazz.\nDuring the Jazz's time in New Orleans from 1974 to 1979, the home uniform was white with gold trim, a purple \"Jazz\" script and purple numbers. The road uniform was purple with gold trim, a white \"Jazz\" script and white numbers. The franchise's original colors of purple, gold, and green are those most associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\nUtah Jazz.\nMardi Gras colors: 1979\u20131996.\nWhen the team moved to Utah in 1979, the Jazz made slight changes to their uniforms. The home uniforms remained the same, with the word \"Utah\" added to the center chest logo in the 1986\u201387 season. In 1981, the road uniforms were changed to dark green, with the aforementioned Jazz logo on the center chest and gold numbers. For the 1984\u201385 season, they were changed back to purple, this time with gold numbers and white trim, along with the addition of the word 'Utah' on the logo. These uniforms were worn until the 1995\u201396 season. The green jerseys were worn for St. Patrick's Day in the 1985\u201386 season.\nPurple mountains: 1996\u20132004.\nFor the 1996\u201397 season, the Jazz drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of purple (slightly lighter from the previous shade), copper and turquoise. The logo, designed by former NBA creative director Tom O'Grady, was based on the 1993 All-Star Game logo. Their new uniform set featured a silhouette of the Wasatch Range on the center chest, with a stylish new Jazz script, and purple and turquoise details. On the road purple jersey, the white mountain range gradually fades to purple just above the numbers, which are white, with copper interior trim and teal outlining. On the home white jersey, the numbers are purple, with white interior trim and teal outlining. The Jazz wore these uniforms until the 2003\u201304 season.\nThe Jazz also introduced an alternate black uniform in the 1998\u201399 season, with the Jazz script on the center chest, but without the Wasatch Range silhouette. On this jersey, both the Jazz script and numbers are white, with purple interior trim and copper outlining, and copper side panels. This uniform was worn until the 2003\u201304 season.\nNavy and powder blue: 2004\u20132010.\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, the Jazz once again updated their color scheme, logos and uniforms. The new color scheme, which the team used until the end of the 2009\u201310 season, consisted of navy blue, powder blue, silver and purple, though the latter color was only used on the primary and alternate logos. The team logo remained substantially the same, with the exception of the new color variation. The new home uniform consisted of an updated \"Jazz\" script on the center chest in navy blue, with navy numbers, both of which had silver interior trim and powder blue outlining. The new road uniform was navy blue, with a \"Utah\" script in powder blue on the center chest and powder blue numbers, both of which had silver outlining and white interior trim.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, the Jazz introduced a new alternate powder blue uniform. This uniform, which the team wore until the end of the 2009\u201310 season, featured a Jazz script identical to the team logo and navy blue numbers below the script, also with silver and white trim. The nameplate on the back of the jersey was navy blue.\nThe team's original 'J-note' logo was revived in the 2008\u201309 season, but was only used on television broadcasts and in the team's then-current colors.\nReturn of the 'J-note': 2010\u20132016.\nOn June 15, 2010, the Jazz unveiled a new logo and color scheme on the team's official website. For the 2010\u201311 season, the Jazz kept the mountain logo as the primary logo, but in a new color scheme of navy blue, gold, dark green &amp; gray, though the latter color was dropped after the 2015\u201316 season. The 'J-note' logo returned to its original green-and-gold scheme, but the navy blue was retained. The new uniform set, which was unveiled on August 16, features a design nearly identical to the team's aforementioned 1970s uniform designs, with the following differences: navy blue replacing purple on the road uniform, dark green numerals on the home white jerseys, a V-neck on both the home and road jerseys and side panels on both the home and away jerseys. The new uniforms were a combination of both the old and new styles, with navy blue retained from the most recent color scheme, but the now-famous 'J-note' logo and gold and green were revived.\nThe Jazz unveiled an alternate jersey on December 9, 2011, that is similar to their road jersey, but swaps the navy and green colors so that the primary color is green, with a navy stripe on the side. This uniform was worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\nModified look; move to Nike: 2016\u20132022.\nOn May 12, 2016, the Jazz updated their logos and uniforms. The team selected its wordmark logo as its new primary logo, with the addition of the word 'Utah' above the two Z's; because of that, the team discontinued the use of the mountain logo, which had been used since 1996. A new home court design was also unveiled. Home and road uniform modifications included the creation of a new, custom number font. To go along with the new look, two new alternate uniforms were introduced: a modified green alternate, with a \"Utah\" script arched in white, and a new navy sleeved alternate featuring the white 'J-note' logo on the right breast and numbers on the left breast in gold, with green, gold and white stripes below the chest.\nIn 2017, as part of the switch to Nike as the NBA's uniform provider, the Jazz made some slight changes to their uniform set. While the white \"Association\" and navy \"Icon\" uniforms remained mostly intact, the Jazz retired their green and navy sleeved alternates in favor of a gold \"Statement\" uniform, featuring the navy 'J-note' logo and green numbers. \n\"Red Rocks\" City uniform: 2017\u20132022.\nThe \"City\" uniform was inspired from the red rock formations found in Southern Utah, and it featured a gradient of gold, orange, burgundy and black. After a three-season run, the Jazz replaced their original \"City\" uniform with a similar design, but with the gradient reversed so that it fades to black. NBA guidelines require a new \"City\" uniform to be released every one to three years.\nEarned uniforms.\nAlso part of the Nike rotation is the \"Earned\" uniform, which is given only to teams who qualified in the NBA playoffs the previous season. The \"Earned\" uniform, however, is only used in select seasons, unlike the other uniforms. The 2019 version mirrored that of the \"Statement\" uniform except with a dark green base and lack of navy elements. The 2021 version was similar but with a light Kelly green base (a nod to the early 1980s green uniforms) and different striping patterns.\nBlack and yellow 'J-note': 2022\u20132025.\nThe Jazz unveiled new uniforms before the 2022\u201323 season. As part of the transition, the team brought back the classic 1996\u20132004 purple \"mountain\" uniforms as the \"City\" uniform, along with \"Statement\" black, \"Icon\" yellow and \"Association\" white uniforms. The white uniform features only the J-note logo and numbers in black, the yellow uniform has \"Jazz\" and numbers in black, and the black uniform has \"Utah\" and numbers in yellow.\nThe new black, white, and yellow \"remix\" uniforms and color scheme was largely received poorly by Jazz fans and media members alike.\nModernized purple mountains: 2023\u2013present.\nStarting with the 2023\u201324 season, the Jazz announced in advance on social media that a \"remixed\" version of the \"mountain\" uniforms would replace the classic 1996\u20132004 version as its \"City\" uniform; this design features updated mountain gradients, an enlarged \"Utah\" wordmark in front, and white numbers positioned on the left chest.\nBetween the 2024\u201325 and 2025\u201326 seasons, the Jazz would gradually phase out the black and spotlight yellow uniforms in favor of the modernized \"purple mountains\" uniforms. For 2024\u201325, the existing white \"Association\" and black \"Statement\" uniforms with yellow trim were retained, but added to the rotation is a black \"Statement\" uniform featuring the \"J-note\" in front of a gray Wasatch Range silhouette with purple and sky blue trim, and a purple \"City\" uniform with \"Utah\" in white in front of the mountain silhouette. The black and purple \"Statement\" uniform would debut in January of that season, replacing the black and yellow uniform. For 2025\u201326, the Jazz would fully adopt the \"purple mountains\" uniforms. The \"Icon\" uniform is similar to the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform but with the addition of black and sky blue trim, and the \"Association\" uniform followed the same albeit inverse template.\nFor the Jazz's 2025\u201326 \"City\" uniform, they revisited the popular \"Red Rocks\" design from 2017 to 2022, but recolored to a black and gray gradient with sky blue accents.\nThrowback uniforms.\nThe Jazz have worn the original J-note uniforms on three separate occasions. During the 2003\u201304 season, the Jazz commemorated the team's 25th season in Utah by donning replicas of the 1986\u201396 white uniforms. Then in the 2009\u201310 season, the Jazz wore the 1979\u20131984 green uniforms (albeit with white trim and letters) to pay tribute to the 30th anniversary of the aforementioned move to Utah.\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Jazz wore a modernized version of their 1984\u20131996 purple uniforms to mark the team's 40th season in Utah.\nFor the 2019\u201320 season, the Jazz wore a modernized version of their 1996\u20132004 purple uniforms. The team wore these uniform designs during its two trips to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. The Jazz brought such uniforms back for the 2022\u201323 season but treated as a \"City\" uniform, due to the fact that it bore the current Nike swoosh logo whereas other \"Classic\" edition uniforms bore the classic wordmark-and-swoosh logo beginning in 2021.\nFor the 2023\u201324 season, the Jazz announced that they would wear the original 1974\u201375 purple uniforms as part of the franchise's 50th anniversary and as part of its #PurpleIsBack marketing campaign.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Jazz hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee, who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with team.\n\"Italics\" denotes still active but not with team.\nPoints scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNBA MVP\nNBA Rookie of the Year\nNBA Defensive Player of the Year\nNBA Sixth Man of the Year\nNBA Most Improved Player\nNBA Coach of the Year\nNBA Executive of the Year\nJ.

After it was purchased by Fox, KSTU's programming schedule no longer had space to carry Jazz games, leaving the team without a broadcast partner. In 1993, Larry H. Miller purchased local TV station KXIV and renamed it to KJZZ, in an effort to create a sports-oriented station to showcase his teams. The new KJZZ station started carrying Jazz games with the 1993\u20131994 season.\nKJZZ continued to carry the team's games until 2009, when the Jazz signed a new exclusive 12-year agreement with then FSN Utah, (now part of AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain) on October 20, 2009. A one-year extension was signed during the 2020 offseason, and the team continued to air games on AT&amp;T SportsNet into the 2022\u201323 season.\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery, owners of AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, announced that they would wind down operations of AT&amp;T SportsNet. The Jazz, who had already been exploring alternate broadcast solutions in 2022, would announce a return to KJZZ-TV for the 2023\u201324 season. In most of Idaho, Montana and portions of Washington and Oregon, the Jazz continue to air on Root Sports Northwest, which was formerly owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. In southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, the Jazz are available through FuboTV. The Jazz also announced a streaming service in partnership with Kiswe, Jazz+, which offers options for annual and monthly subscriptions, as well as passes for individual games. In 2024, with the co-owned Utah Hockey Club (since named the Utah Mammoth) debuting under similar broadcasting arrangements, the service became part of a streaming hub known as SEG+. As a result of Root Sports' impending shutdown at the end of 2025, Jazz+ coverage would extend into territories formerly served by the channel for the start of the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe Jazz's flagship radio stations are KZNS (1280) \"The Zone\" and KZNS-FM Fox Sports Radio 97.5.\nThe team's current TV and radio announcers are:\nRetired announcers:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72891", "revid": "829949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72891", "title": "Golden State Warriors", "text": "National Basketball Association team in San Francisco, California\nThe Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. The team plays its home games at Chase Center.\nThe Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947, and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964\u201365 season with the NBA's worst record (17\u201363). Their rebuilding period was brief, however, as they drafted Rick Barry four months after the trade. Barry, along with Jamaal Wilkes, powered the Warriors to their third championship in 1975, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015. In 2016, the Warriors achieved the best-ever regular-season record at 73\u20139 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games after surrendering a 3\u20131 series lead. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018. They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors and Durant left that off-season. After missing the playoffs the next two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs and defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals.\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\",&lt;ref name=\"Williams/Lyons\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time. The Warriors rank third for the most NBA championships and Finals appearances in NBA history, trailing only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics. Chamberlain and Curry are the only players in franchise history to win the league MVP award, for a total of three awards.\nHistory.\n1946\u20131962: Early years in Philadelphia.\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League. Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as head coach and general manager. The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946\u201347 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship. Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955\u201356 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.\n1959\u20131965: The Wilt Chamberlain era.\nIn 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \"Wilt the Stilt\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased a majority of shares in the team, moved it to the San Francisco Bay Area, and renamed it the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City, just south of the San Francisco city limits, from 1962 to 1964; then the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966. Occasionally, home games were played in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose. They also played frequently at the University of San Francisco gymnasium. Philadelphia would not remain without an NBA team for long; the Syracuse Nationals moved to the city in 1963 and became the Philadelphia 76ers.\nBefore the 1963\u201364 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964\u201365 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\n1965\u20131978: The Thurmond and Barry era.\nIn 1965, the team used their first-round draft pick on Rick Barry, who became NBA Rookie of the Year before leading the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966\u201367 season. The Warriors lost the Finals, four games to two, to the 76ers: Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia.\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967\u201368 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970\u201371 season was the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\nThe franchise adopted the name Golden State Warriors before the 1971\u201372 season, to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California. Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974\u201375. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.\nAt 59\u201323, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975\u201376 season. They were upset, however, by the 42\u201340 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n1978\u20131985: Competitive struggles.\nDue to the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\n1985\u20131997: The \"Run TMC\" era.\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the \"NBA's Greatest Games\" series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\nThe \"Sleepy Floyd game\" catalyzed increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area; so did new coach Don Nelson, who engineered a string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin. Collectively known as \"Run TMC\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C., the trio stayed together for just two seasons and won only one playoff series. Nelson sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens, a promising young front-court player meant to complement the coach's run-and-gun system. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who co-owned the team from 1986 to 1995 with Dan Finnane. In 1993\u201394, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing with off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The 1994\u201395 season was the first under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995\u201396 season, and ended up with a 36\u201346 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996\u201397 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30\u201352 finish. After the season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Erick Dampier and Duane Ferrell.\n1997\u20132009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset.\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997\u201398 season. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself. St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (picked over future MVPs Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash and future All Star Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the next draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle, forgoing future All Star Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), who would be a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006\u201307 season.\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002\u201303 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.\nIn June 2003, Cohan elevated marketing executive Robert Rowell to team president, a role which involved hiring, firing and contract negotiation on the basketball side. After a disappointing 2003\u201304 season, head coach Eric Musselman and St. Jean were fired. Mike Montgomery was hired as head coach and Chris Mullin was chosen to succeed St. Jean with the title of executive vice president of basketball operations. Mullin hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself.\nThe Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005\u201306 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114\u2013109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\nEntering the 2006\u201307 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard \u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius and forward Josh Powell. This trade allowed the Warriors to \"run and gun\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106\u2013107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26\u201335.\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42\u201340) at 16\u20135 in their last 21 games. \"We believe\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedri\u0146\u0161, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 and 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118\u2013112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3\u20132. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18\u20130 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No.\u00a08 seed to beat a No.\u00a01 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No.\u00a08 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular-season series.\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006\u201307 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing fashion. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game), and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48\u201334 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\nIn the 2008 off-season, Baron Davis opted to return to his hometown and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of that year's draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 to long-term contracts.\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008\u201309 season, finishing 29\u201353. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99\u201389.\n2009\u2013present: The Stephen Curry era.\n2009\u20132012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks.\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009\u201310 as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26\u201356, failing to make the playoffs. Curry finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.\nThe Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \"The City\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969\u201371 \"The City\" uniforms. The Warriors made an off-season trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80\u00a0million deal that depended on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. After Morrow left for New Jersey Nets, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11\u00a0million deal.\nOn July 15, 2010, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450\u00a0million. On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka, Dennis Wong and Chamath Palihapitiya.\nThe Warriors continued their 2010 off-season signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option; Lin became the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5\u00a0million in mid-September. After coach Don Nelson resigned in September 2010, assistant coach Keith Smart was hired as the team's new head coach.\nThe Warriors won 36 games and failed to make the playoffs in 2010\u201311. The team broke a franchise record with 21 made three-pointers in a win against the Orlando Magic. In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round pick that was used on Draymond Green. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 three-pointers in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005\u201306. In a win against the Portland Trail Blazers, Wright then broke another NBA record, becoming the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined. Wright ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most three-pointers attempted with 516; each mark set a new Warriors franchise record. After the season, Curry received the NBA Sportsmanship Award. Coach Smart was dismissed on April 27, 2011, due to the change in ownership. Team President Rowell was also fired and replaced with Rick Welts. Seventeen-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced Smart as head coach on June 6.\nThe Warriors selected future All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA draft. However, the team did not improve in the 2011\u201312 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shortened season with a 23\u201343 record (13th in the conference) and again failing to make the playoffs. Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. Hindered by several injuries to key players, the team then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw Thompson move into a starting role. However, Curry suffered a series of ankle and foot-related injuries that limited him to 26 regular-season games.\n2012\u20132014: Ascension.\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise. In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. According to sportswriter Anthony Slater, in this draft, \"Golden State got a starter [Barnes], a rotation player [Ezeli] and a transcendent talent that perfectly fit the small-ball direction of the league [Green].\" In addition, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension. At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history. In 2016, however, Slater argued that Curry's relatively inexpensive contract paid \"huge dividends\" by freeing up the necessary funds to allow the team to \"keep a strong core around him\". The team made a series of other moves, trading Dorell Wright, obtaining point guard Jarrett Jack, and signing forward Carl Landry.\nDespite early-season injuries to Brandon Rush and Andrew Bogut, and despite starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the 2012\u201313 Warriors had one of their best starts in decades. The team earned 20 wins in less than 30 games played for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6\u20131 road trip in franchise history, including a 97\u201395 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006\u201307 \"We Believe\" Warriors. This time, the local battle cry was \"We Belong\". The team finished the season with a record of 47\u201335, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut. Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets (an NBA single-season record for the player nicknamed \"baby-faced assassin\") and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \"Splash Brothers\" by team employee Brian Witt for their backcourt shooting, combined for 483 three-pointers, easily besting the single-season record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995\u201396.\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and future NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under the salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 and Brandon Rush (along with multiple draft picks) to the Utah Jazz. With their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round. Other off-season changes included the departure of free agents Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry and the signings of forward-center Marreese Speights, center Jermaine O'Neal, point guard Toney Douglas, and Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic.\nThe Warriors began the 2013\u201314 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12\u20139, as compared to 17\u20134 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Ezeli, Douglas, and O'Neal. Most prominently, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month; during this period, the Warriors' defensive and offensive performance suffered and the team posted a losing 5\u20137 record while revealing a lack of bench depth. When Iguodala returned, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak that included six wins on a road trip, tying an NBA record. The streak was the franchise's longest since the 1975 championship year, and fell just one win short of the team record of 11.\nTo strengthen their bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics. A day before the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake. Boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the All-Star break. On April 11, in a 112\u201395 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib kept him out of the postseason; the injury dealt a blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\nEven as the team rolled towards the postseason, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \"difference in philosophies\" and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\" on the Warriors' coaching staff. Less than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991\u201392 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or fewer, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more. Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by former Seattle SuperSonics legend Ray Allen in 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\n2014\u20132019: The Dynasty.\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014, despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players and a three-year 121\u2013109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263). Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once. Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\nOn May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors signed Steve Kerr to a reported five-year, $25 million deal to become the team's new head coach. It was the first head-coach job for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion guard who set an all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr had served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team from 2007 to 2010, and had recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). The Warriors also signed point guard Shaun Livingston and guard Leandro Barbosa during the off-season.\nThe Warriors completed the 2014\u20132015 regular season with a league-best record of 67\u201315, setting a Warriors record for wins. The team finished with a home record of 39\u20132, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2\u20131 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP. Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981\u201382.\nOther highlights of the 2014\u201315 season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\nOn July 27, 2015, David Lee\u2014who had lost his starting power forward job to Draymond Green during the season\u2014was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb; Golden State was seeking to offload his salary given his limited role on the team.\nThe Warriors began the 2015\u20132016 regular season by winning their first 24 games, the best start in NBA history. This surpassed the previous record of 15\u20130 by the 1948\u201349 Capitols and the 1993\u201394 Rockets, and broke a 131-year-old record of 20\u20130 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. These 24 wins included the best road start in NBA history at 14\u20130, surpassing the 1969\u201370 New York Knicks, which was also the joint-third longest road win streak. Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015. Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014\u201315 season, eclipsing the 2012\u201313 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history. The team set an NBA record with 54 consecutive regular-season home wins, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016; the previous record of 44 was held by the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.\nOn March 31, 2016, the Warriors won their 68th win of the season in an overtime game over the Utah Jazz, breaking the franchise record for most wins in a single season in franchise history.

On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes. Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece. Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six. In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.\nJuly 2016 featured a series of significant player transactions. On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors. On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team. The Durant signing made the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win the 2017 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers. On July 9, 2016, free-agent forward Harrison Barnes signed with the Dallas Mavericks. Centers Festus Ezeli and Marreese Speights left the Warriors for other teams, as did guard Leandro Barbosa. Center Andrew Bogut was traded, along with a future second-round pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick. Veteran power forward David West signed with the Warriors, as did free-agent center Zaza Pachulia.\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016\u201317 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116\u2013106 win over the Pelicans. On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142\u2013106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars. On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points. On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94\u201387 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016\u201317 regular-season record of 67\u201315. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12\u20130, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4\u20131 in the Finals, and their 16\u20131 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage () in NBA playoffs history. After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation. The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. to \"celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\" Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017\u201318 regular season record of 58\u201324. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4\u20131, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3\u20132 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors staved off elimination and came back to win the series 4\u20133, winning the Western Conference for the 4th straight year. The 2018 Finals pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season; this marked the first time in NBA history that the same two teams had met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007. On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons. After the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for \"Sports Illustrated\", \"USA Today\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and the \"New York Daily News\" described the Warriors as a dynasty. The Warriors returned to the Finals the following year and lost 4\u20132 to the Toronto Raptors.\n2019\u20132021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles.\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready for the 2019\u201320 NBA season. The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental effects, and obstruction of views. The new location still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco but did not require the voter approval needed for the original site. The move was criticized for alienating fans in Oakland. The sale was finalized in October 2015 and naming rights were sold to JPMorgan Chase, which named the arena called Chase Center. Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco.\nAfter the Finals loss to Toronto, during which Durant tore his Achilles and Thompson tore his ACL, Durant chose to sign a four-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets. In order to not lose Durant for nothing, the Warriors sent Durant along with a protected first-round pick (2020) to the Nets in exchange for D'Angelo Russell in a two-way sign-and-trade. The sign-and-trade triggered a hard cap for the Warriors, who were forced to trade Iguodala's $17 million salary to the Memphis Grizzlies while also giving them a top-4 protected 2024 first-round pick as incentive.\nThe Warriors played their first regular-season game at Chase Center on October 24, 2019, in a 141\u2013122 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. During their very next home game, on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Curry broke his hand in a collision, requiring surgery that was expected to keep him out of action for at least 3 months. This, along with Thompson's injury rehab keeping him out the entire year, sent the Warriors into a downward spiral from which they never recovered. However, they saw second-round pick Eric Paschall, two-way player Damion Lee, and training camp pickup Marquese Chriss establish themselves as rotation players. At the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Russell, 2018 first-round pick Jacob Evans, and recent acquisition Omari Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, a top-3 protected first-round pick, and a second-round pick. Curry returned for one game on March 5 before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended their 2019\u201320 season with a league-worst record of 15\u201350.\nIn the 2020 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the second overall pick in the draft, which they used to draft James Wiseman. They also drafted Nico Mannion with the 48th overall pick. Just as the 2020\u201321 NBA season was about to begin, guard Klay Thompson was reported to miss the incoming season due to an Achilles tendon injury making the second season he missed in his career. At the beginning of the season against the Nets, Curry dropped 20 points to a 99\u2013125 loss to the Nets. They finished the regular season with a 39\u201333 record, qualifying for the new NBA play-in-tournament against the seventh seeded Los Angeles Lakers. Curry won his second scoring title with 32.0 points per game and was in the NBA Most Valuable Player conversation alongside Philadelphia's Joel Embiid and Denver's Nikola Joki\u0107, who would go on to win the award. The Warriors were eliminated from the playoffs after losing two play-in tournaments to the Los Angeles Lakers who would become the seventh seed, and the Memphis Grizzlies, originally the ninth seed, who went on to face the Jazz after winning the play-in against the Warriors. This was the second consecutive year that the Warriors missed the playoffs.\n2021\u20132022: Championship glory.\nWith the 2021 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the seventh pick in the draft from the Minnesota Timberwolves from the D'Angelo Russell trade, and their own 14th overall pick. With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody. The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million. They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr. and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica to one-year deals. On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area.\nIn January 2022, the team faced controversy after part-owner Chamath Palihapitiya repeatedly stated on a podcast that he did not care about the ongoing persecution of Uyghurs in China. The team distanced themselves from Palihapitiya stating that he \"does not speak on behalf of our franchise, and his views certainly don't reflect those of our organization.\" The Warriors' statement was criticized for not mentioning the Uyghurs or the genocide.\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018\u201319 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their twelfth NBA Finals in franchise history after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4\u20131. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4\u20132. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.\nIn 2021, the Golden State Warriors, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, were a paid spokespersons for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. The Warriors, alongside other spokespeople, are currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.\n2022\u20132023: Injury struggles.\nDuring the 2022\u201323 season, the Warriors were hampered by injuries to Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, the latter of whom was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game.\nThe team finished with the sixth seed and a 44\u201338 record, qualifying for the last direct playoff spot. In the playoffs, they overcame a 0\u20132 deficit to beat the third-seeded Sacramento Kings in seven games. In the Western Conference semifinals, they lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games. This was the first time since 2014 that the Warriors lost in the playoffs before reaching the Finals, and the first playoff series loss against a Western Conference opponent under Steve Kerr.\nLogos and uniforms.\nPhiladelphia.\nAs the Philadelphia Warriors, their uniforms generally featured the shortened city name \"PHILA\" in front, with a few adjustments to the striping and color scheme on the letters. Home uniforms were white and road uniforms were blue with gold accents, with red added during the late 1940s.\nSan Francisco: \"The City\".\nMoving to San Francisco in 1962, the Warriors incorporated a similar uniform to the one they previously wore in Philadelphia, but for the first season they wore gold road uniforms with the city name in blue with red drop shadows. In the 1963\u201364 season, the gold and blue were reversed on the road uniform. In both seasons, the home white uniform featured the city name in gold with blue drop shadows.\nFrom 1964 to 1966, the Warriors updated their uniform, going with the team name in block letters and incorporated the interlocking \"SF\" similar to the San Francisco Giants' cap logo on the shorts. The home uniform color was changed to gold and red was dropped from the color scheme.\nFor the remainder of their run as the San Francisco Warriors, they wore what is now known as \"The CITY\" uniform. The design incorporated a silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge inside a circle and an upward sloping San Francisco cable car on the front and back of the uniform respectively. Numbers were placed within these logos. Within the contrasting side stripes is the team name in block letters, and the \"Indian Headdress\" roundel logo was placed on the left leg.\nCalifornia outline (1971\u20131988).\nUpon moving to Oakland and adopting the name Golden State Warriors in 1971, the team began wearing uniforms that featured \"Golden State\" in Western-style lettering above a circle with the outline of California and a star representing the San Francisco Bay Area inside. This uniform was worn until the 1975 championship season, although some uniforms also featured the team name below the circle.\nAhead of the 1975\u201376 season, the Warriors tweaked the uniform to feature the team name in Western-style lettering along with a fancier number design. Additional striping was placed on the shorts. This design remained in place until the 1987\u201388 season, though the team made some subtle changes to the striping and letter scheme. Before the 1986\u201387 season, the home uniform was changed back to white, though the team briefly flirted with wearing white uniforms on select home games in the early 1980s.\nRun TMC era uniform (1988\u20131997).\nIn 1988, the Warriors updated their uniform, now featuring the team name written diagonally in front along with numbers on the left chest. The updated \"California outline\" logo was moved to the left leg. This uniform was introduced in time for the arrival of Don Nelson as head coach and the rise of Run TMC.\nThunder era (1997\u20132010).\nThe Warriors identity was drastically changed in the 1997\u201398 season, now featuring a dark navy blue, bright gold and orange color scheme. The uniform heavily incorporated the lightning bolt motif, with the gold \"Warriors\" wordmark now featuring the lightning bolt shooting atop the \"W\". The alternate \"Thunder\" logo was added to the right leg.\nBefore the 2001\u201302 season, the Warriors made subtle changes to the uniform, removing the lightning bolt stripes in favor of a thick orange stripe on either side. The \"Warriors\" wordmark also removed the lightning bolt on the \"W\", and on the white uniform, it was reverted to navy blue letters. In the 2004\u201305 season, the Warriors added an orange alternate uniform which is a palette swap of their home uniform.\nReturn to classic look (2010\u20132017).\nIn 2010, the Warriors returned to a modern version of the team's \"The CITY\" uniform, this time incorporating the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge as part of the logo. The uniform also incorporated striping inspired by the bridge's suspension cables. During Christmas Day games between 2013 and 2016, the Warriors would subtly tweak their uniforms to match every other team's designs\nMidway through the 2012\u201313 season, the Warriors unveiled their gold sleeved alternate uniform, featuring a white silhouette of the \"Bay Bridge\" logo behind a diagonal \"Warriors\" wordmark in blue, along with blue pinstripes on the shorts. It was followed the next season by a sleeved version of the team's white uniform. In the 2014\u201315 season, the design was tweaked to a slate-gray base and white letters minus the full team name on the logo. A variation of the slate gray sleeved uniform was used during Chinese New Year week, incorporating red accents; a white version was worn in the 2016\u201317 season. The sleeved uniforms became a hallmark of the Adidas era.\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the Warriors wore a blue \"Crossover\" uniform which was inspired by the 1990s Run TMC-era uniform.\nNike era (2017\u2013present).\nThe Warriors kept their primary uniforms after switching from Adidas to Nike in 2017, with the white uniform becoming the \"Association\" uniform and the blue uniform becoming the \"Icon\" uniform. From 2017 to 2019, the Warriors kept their slate gray uniforms as its \"Statement\" uniform, tweaking the design to reference Oakland as \"The Town\" by incorporating the city's oak tree logo to the uniform.\nOn June 12, 2019, the Warriors unveiled subtle adjustments to their primary logo, including a new custom font. Updated uniforms were released on September 17, 2019. Most notably, on the blue \"Icon\" uniform, the colors on the \"Bay Bridge\" logo were no longer inverted unlike in the previous uniform. The \"Statement\" uniform became gold and featured \"The Bay\" atop a circle with an illustration of a San Francisco Bay sunset; this was due to the team returning to San Francisco that season. In 2022, the \"Statement\" uniform was changed to a navy blue base and incorporated the \"Golden State\" wordmark in block letters. Then before the 2024\u201325 season, the \"Statement\" uniform was changed to a black base and featuring \"Golden\" and \"State\" surrounding the uniform number. A new \"W\" alternate logo was also released.\nCity and Earned uniforms.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Warriors wore gold \"City\" uniforms with \"The Bay\" atop a blue circle and a dragon silhouette atop the Golden Gate Bridge; this paid tribute to the Bay Area's Chinese American community. In 2018\u201319, the Warriors wore a variation of this \"City\" uniform in navy blue with gold accents.\nThe Warriors received an \"Earned\" uniform in 2018 as a reward for participating in the previous year's playoffs. Their first \"Earned\" uniform is a gold variation of \"The Town\" \"Statement\" uniform. After the Warriors moved to San Francisco in 2019, the dark gray \"Statement\" uniform was repurposed into a \"City\" uniform as a tribute to Oakland. This design featured a black base with gray and blue accents.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Warriors wore a \"City\" uniform that paid tribute to the \"We Believe\" era in Oakland, as well as their 47 seasons there in general. It features the same coloring scheme as well as the \"Oakland\" location identifier in the lettering of the previous logo.\nThe \"City\" uniform for the 2021\u201322 season was a \"mix-tape\" of earlier uniforms. The black base was an homage to \"The Town\" uniforms which were a tribute to Oakland, the blue-trimmed gold lightning bolt stripes took cues from the 2000s Warriors uniforms, the block numbers came from their late 1980s uniforms, and the 1990s \"California Outline\" logo adorned the beltline. On the shorts is the team's 75th anniversary logo.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform was designed by Bay Area artist Allison Hueman, and featured a black base with a yellow illustration of a rose at the bottom. Inside a circle is a yellow-outlined rose, and outside are alternating lines said to represent sun rays. The uniform paid tribute to women at the intersection of court, community and culture.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Warriors again wore a black \"City\" uniform, this time as a tribute to San Francisco. The \"San Francisco\" wordmark, numbers and embellishments paid homage to the city's iconic cable car.\nThe \"City\" uniform used in the 2024\u201325 season incorporated the classic navy, yellow and red color scheme the team used in the early 1960s, as well as a nod to the Golden Gate Bridge. The design was also based on the \"Statement\" uniform the team unveiled that season, featuring \"Golden\" and \"State\" in metallic gold surrounding the yellow number.\nFor the Warriors' 2025\u201326 \"City\" uniform, they unveiled a cream version of \"The Town\" uniforms with brown and gold accents.\nClassic uniforms.\nThe Warriors have worn throwback versions of \"The CITY\" uniforms on select games since the 1990s, most recently wearing them in the 2020\u201321 season. They've also worn other throwback uniforms in tribute to several great moments in Warriors history, such as the 1974\u201375 \"Cinderella\" championship uniforms, the famous Sleepy Floyd game-inspired uniforms from 1987, the Run TMC uniforms from the 1990s, and in their final game in Oakland in 2019, a white uniform based on the 2007 \"We Believe\" era uniforms.\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, the Warriors wore a Warriors Origins jersey, which is a modernization of their 1961\u201362 road uniform. The 1961\u201362 season was their last season in Philadelphia, as well as the season in which Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single game. The jersey also commemorates the 75th anniversary of the franchise. The original jersey read \"PHILA\", but in order to avoid confusion with the Philadelphia 76ers (whose regular jerseys also read \"PHILA\"), the Warriors elected to emblazon the jersey with the team name instead, making it a fauxback jersey. The Warriors wore a white version of this jersey in the 2024\u201325 season.\nRivalries.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014\u201315 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals. Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers both moved to California during the early 1960s. Unlike the animosity displayed in MLB's Dodgers\u2013Giants or NFL's 49ers\u2013Rams rivalries, the teams and fanbases generally respect each another. The teams met six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. The rivalry took on a new flavor after the Lakers signed LeBron James, who had faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. The teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams moved to California in the early 1960s. The Lakers lead the all-time regular-season series 262\u2013173, and the postseason series 25\u201311.\nSacramento Kings.\nSince the Sacramento Kings moved there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both teams are based in Northern California, with the cities of Sacramento and San Francisco located 86 miles apart from one another. However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round. In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Domantas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3) and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity), the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals. The series would draw the highest first and second round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warriors swingman Kelenna Azubuike does color commentary for the Warriors on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.

{"id": "72892", "revid": "44092845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72892", "title": "Los Angeles Clippers", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Inglewood, California\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are an American professional basketball team based in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Clippers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, beginning with the 2024\u201325 NBA season. Previously, the Clippers played their home games at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles from 1999 to 2024, which they had shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are frequently referred to by their fans as \"the Clips\" or \"LAC\".\nThe franchise was founded as the Buffalo Braves in 1970 as an expansion team. Led by Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo, the Braves reached the NBA playoffs three times during their eight seasons in Buffalo. Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocation from Buffalo to San Diego, California, in 1978 and subsequent rebranding as the San Diego Clippers, in reference to the sailing ships seen in San Diego Bay. The team saw little success on the court and missed the playoffs during all six of their years in San Diego.\nIn 1984, owner Donald Sterling controversially relocated the franchise to Los Angeles without NBA approval, which was permitted following legal action between the league and Sterling. Over the course of their first 27 seasons in Los Angeles, the Clippers qualified for the postseason only four times and won a single playoff round. As a result, they have been frequently described as a perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers.\nThe Clippers' reputation improved during the 2010s, which saw them transform into consistent postseason contenders. Aided by the \"Lob City\" lineup of Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul, the team qualified for the playoffs in six consecutive seasons from 2012 to 2017 and won two consecutive division titles in 2013 and 2014, both firsts for the franchise. Despite this success, the Clippers struggled in the postseason and were frequently eliminated in the Conference Semifinals; the team reached the conference finals for the first time in 2021. To date, they are the oldest franchise in North American professional sports to have never played in a championship game.\nHistory.\n1970\u20131978: Buffalo Braves.\nThe franchise began in Western New York as the Buffalo Braves, one of three NBA expansion franchises that began play in the 1970\u201371 season, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland Cavaliers. They played their home games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, along with another Buffalo team that would begin play that year, the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres.\nAfter two bad seasons, the Braves' fortunes started to change under coach Jack Ramsay and star center Bob McAdoo. McAdoo led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons and was named the league's MVP in the 1974\u201375 season. The Braves qualified for the playoffs three times in a row, losing twice to the eventual Eastern Conference champions (the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, and the Washington Bullets in 1975). Despite the team's modest success in Buffalo, Braves owner Paul Snyder and the league found it impossible to schedule home games at the auditorium because of the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball team, which had a pre-existing lease on the arena and priority on game dates over the Braves, with the next best dates in turn taken by the more successful Sabres.\nAt a time when the NBA was nearing a nadir and the league did not have its current prestige, the Griffins saw the Braves as a threat to their own success, and purposely scheduled better dates at the arena to prevent the Braves from succeeding. As a result, after a failed attempt to sell the team to an owner who intended to move it to South Florida, Snyder sold the team to Kentucky Colonels owner John Y. Brown, Jr., who decimated the team's roster, traded away all of its stars, and drove attendance down to the point where they could break their own lease on the arena.\nEventually, Brown met with Celtics owner Irv Levin in 1978 so they could trade franchise ownerships. Southern California resident Levin then decided to move the Braves to San Diego, something the league would have never allowed him to do with the Celtics. Asked about the move, Levin nominated a shorter commute for himself as a key reason.\n1978\u20131984: San Diego Clippers.\nIn 1978, San Diego welcomed the Braves franchise to the city. The city's previous NBA franchise, the San Diego Rockets, had relocated to Houston seven years earlier in 1971. In between, the city hosted an ABA franchise, the San Diego Conquistadors, though that team folded partway through its fourth season after they had been renamed the Sails. San Diego team officials did not think \"Braves\" was a proper representative nickname for the club in San Diego, and a local naming contest ultimately decided on \"Clippers\", in reference to the city being known for the great sailing ships that passed through San Diego Bay. The first head coach of the Clippers was chosen to be Gene Shue, a respected tactician. He preferred a fast playing style with many scoring opportunities. Only three players from the Braves started in the team: Randy Smith, Swen Nater, and Scott Lloyd. Other starting players included Kermit Washington, and Sidney Wicks. World B. Free was also brought in from, the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a future first round pick.\nThe 1978\u201379 season started poorly, with the Clippers' first win coming in their fourth game, against the Chicago Bulls. The team lost 12 of its 18 first games and dropped to the bottom of the Pacific Division. Player Kevin Kunnert argued they had the \"killer instinct of a field mouse\". The worst loss came against the San Antonio Spurs, with a loss of 163 to 125. Nevertheless, within weeks, Free had become the leading scorer, as well as becoming a public icon. He finished second overall in NBA scoring average, with 28.9 per game (George Gervin of the San Antonio Spurs had a 29.6 average). Shue, meanwhile, tried to create a team spirit by creating a common social life. By the All-Star game the Clippers had improved, winning half of their 54 games, good enough for sixth in the Western Conference. Aiming for one of the six play-off spots for the Conference, they managed to win eight games in a row, and then another five games consecutively. Playing at the San Diego Sports Arena, the Clippers posted a record of 43\u201339 in their first season in California, leaving them two wins shy of the final playoff spot. It was also the first season in Southern California for long-time announcer Ralph Lawler, who began his association with the franchise.\nThe 1979\u201380 season saw the Clippers begin to struggle, despite adding center Bill Walton, a San Diego native who was two years removed from winning an NBA Championship and the NBA Most Valuable Player Award with the Portland Trail Blazers. Walton missed 68 games in his first season in San Diego due to foot injuries (which he also suffered in his final years in Portland). San Diego finished 35\u201347, as Walton and other key players missed significant time due to injuries. Free again finished second in league scoring, with 30.2 points per game. Paul Silas replaced Shue as head coach the following season, and the Clippers finished 36\u201346, again missing the postseason. Walton missed the entire season due to foot injuries, while Free was traded to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for guard Phil Smith.\nThe 1981\u201382 season brought ultimately unwelcome changes to the franchise as Levin sold the team to Los Angeles\u2013area real estate developer and attorney Donald Sterling for $12.5 million. The Clippers experienced poor play, as foot injuries again caused Walton to miss the entire season, and the team limped to a 17\u201365 record. Rumors of a move to Sterling's hometown of Los Angeles and franchise mismanagement plagued the team immediately from the onset of Sterling's acquisition. On one occasion, Sterling was fined $10,000 by the NBA, the largest sum ever levied by the NBA against an owner at the time, for publicly guaranteeing the Clippers would lose enough games to contend for a high enough draft pick to select Ralph Sampson. On another, he was fined for flying his players to away games in coach seats on commercial airliners, a violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement. Hotels refused to house the Clippers because of alleged non-payment for previous accommodations on multiple occasions. A bus company in Newark once stranded the team at the airport after Sterling failed to pay for previous trips, which nearly caused the team to miss a scheduled regular-season game that day against the New Jersey Nets.\nSterling attempted to relocate the franchise to Los Angeles in June 1982 but the NBA denied his request. Sterling then filed an unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit against the league, which subsequently filed a countersuit against the club and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which Sterling had a tentative agreement with to become the franchise's new home. The attempted move, combined with the franchise mismanagement issues, prompted an investigation of the Clippers by an NBA committee of other owners. In September of that year, the committee recommended that Sterling's ownership be terminated, having found that he was late in paying creditors and players. Days before a league scheduled vote in October to remove Sterling, he agreed to sell the team, and the league sought buyers who would keep the franchise in San Diego. At the suggestion of David Stern, then the league's vice president, Sterling was able to make a deal to maintain his position as owner, by instead handing over operations duties of the franchise to Alan Rothenberg, who became the team's president. A few months later in February 1983, Stern called the Clippers a \"first-class\" franchise, and the ouster of Sterling was no longer pursued. Later in 1983, Larry Fleisher, then the general counsel of the National Basketball Players Association, stated \"in all my years of involvement with the NBA, no team ever provided as much difficulties for the players than the Clippers under Sterling.\" \"He almost caused three strikes last season.\" The team's final two seasons in San Diego were not much better on the court despite Walton finally returning to action, finishing 25\u201357 in 1982\u201383 and 30\u201352 in 1983\u201384.\nIn 1984, Sterling, after again being denied permission from the NBA to do so, moved the Clippers to Los Angeles. The NBA subsequently fined Sterling $25 million for violating league rules and filed a lawsuit demanding the franchise be returned to San Diego. The league threatened to dissolve the franchise if ownership did not comply and return the team to San Diego. Sterling then filed another antitrust lawsuit against the league (for $100 million). This time, thanks to the recent court decision that allowed Al Davis to move the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) to Los Angeles, it appeared Sterling would win his case.\nIn September 1987, the league agreed to drop their lawsuit against the Clippers over the team's relocation to Los Angeles in exchange for Sterling dropping his case against the league, allowing him to keep the team in Los Angeles and decreasing his fine to $6 million.\nForty years after the NBA Clippers left San Diego, the Ontario Clippers of the NBA G League would relocate from Ontario, California, starting with the 2024\u201325 season, adopting the San Diego Clippers name as well as a modernized version of the \"three sails\" logo.\n1984\u20131989: Move to Los Angeles, and early struggles.\nIn 1984, despite the pending lawsuits between franchise ownership and the NBA following the move, the Clippers began play at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The Clippers finished their first season in Los Angeles 31\u201351 under head coach Jim Lynam.\nThe Clippers' early days in Los Angeles were marred with many seasons of hapless performances. Despite fielding a squad of talented veterans, the organization suffered systematic injuries to many of its star players. The phenomenon was dubbed the \"Clipper Triangle\" by some sportswriters, a reference to the Bermuda Triangle urban legend. Derek Smith suffered a knee injury during the 1985\u201386 season, followed by Norm Nixon (knee) and Marques Johnson (spinal cord) the following season. The team's 12\u201370 finish in the 1987 season was the second-worst single-season record in NBA history at the time (and is now the third-worst winning percentage in NBA history, behind the 1973 Philadelphia 76ers and the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats). That same season also saw Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor join the team as the general manager and vice president of basketball operations. Nixon suffered an ailing Achilles tendon in 1987\u201388 season, while number one draft pick rookie Danny Manning injured his anterior cruciate ligament during the 1988\u201389 campaign.\n1989\u20131994: Playoff appearances.\nThe Clippers traded the rights to the recently drafted Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams for high-scoring shooting guard Ron Harper at the start of the 1989\u201390 season. Los Angeles had a 19\u201319 record nearly halfway into the season, prompting some to seriously consider the team as a possible playoff contender. That move, along with the 1987 NBA draft of Ken Norman, the 1988 selections of Danny Manning and Charles Smith (Smith was acquired from Philadelphia in exchange for the draft rights to Hersey Hawkins), and the 1990 draft of Loy Vaught, formed a nucleus that would make the franchise a playoff contender.\nMidway through the 1991\u201392 season, the Clippers made yet another coaching change. Larry Brown, recently fired by the San Antonio Spurs, was hired as the team's head coach in late January 1992. He replaced Mike Schuler, who had led the team to a 22\u201325 record before his firing. Brown finished the season with a 23\u201312 mark, for a 45\u201337 overall\u2014the franchise's first winning season in 13 years. For the first time since moving to Los Angeles, they finished with a better record than the crosstown Los Angeles Lakers. The Clippers advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 16 years (since the franchise's Buffalo heyday), but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz, 3\u20132. Due to the late April 1992 Los Angeles riots, the Anaheim Convention Center was the site of Game 4 of the series, which the Clippers won. The team made the playoffs again in the 1992\u201393 season with a 41\u201341 record, but lost again in five games in the first round, this time to the Rockets.\nBrown left to become the Indiana Pacers' head coach after the season and Bob Weiss was brought in to replace him. That 1993\u201394 season proved to be one of the worst in Los Angeles history, with the Clippers and Lakers going a combined 60\u2013104. In February 1994, the Clippers traded Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins played 25 games for the club, averaging 29.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 37.9 minutes per game. After one year on the job, Weiss was fired, Wilkins left in free agency, and veteran head coach Bill Fitch was brought in to guide a new roster of young and inexperienced players.\n1994\u20132000: Fitch, Anaheim and the move to Staples Center.\nAnaheim relocation talks.\nAnaheim, a suburb approximately south of Downtown Los Angeles in Orange County, expressed interest in obtaining an NBA franchise. The city, expecting to lose the NFL's Los Angeles Rams (who relocated to St. Louis in 1995 for 21 seasons, before moving back to Los Angeles in 2016), was looking for a new professional team and began courting the Clippers, who struggled to carve out an identity competing against the popular Lakers for audience share. From 1994 to 1999, the Clippers played several games annually (usually five to eight regular-season games a season, and an annual preseason game) at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, sharing the venue with the NHL's Ducks and the Splash indoor soccer team. Clippers games regularly drew a much-higher average attendance per game at the Pond than when the team played its home games at their regular venue, the Los Angeles Sports Arena. For instance, between 1994 and 1997, the Clippers drew an average of nearly 16,000 fans per game at the Pond, while in Los Angeles, they drew in the neighborhood of 9,200 per home game. Anaheim officials and the Clippers had had on-going talks about moving to Anaheim full-time years before the Pond was eventually built, as Donald Sterling was pursuing options to play elsewhere in the Los Angeles metropolitan region if there was not a replacement for the Sports Arena being built.\nThe Clippers, however, nearly moved to Anaheim permanently in time for the 1996\u201397 season, but according to a \"Los Angeles Times\" article published in June 1996, owner Donald Sterling turned down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over 12 years. Odgen Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, and a practice facility. In another related \"Times\" article, Odgen and Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee. Also at the time, the Walt Disney Company, owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball team during that period, were pursuing at least a partial ownership of the Clippers, with the key element being that its game telecasts would be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California. However, as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams had continued to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket. This remained a sticking point in any deal to relocate to Anaheim, eventually leaving the team to remain in Los Angeles.\nBill Fitch era.\nOn the court, the Clippers continued to make frequent roster changes throughout this particular period, which only resulted in one playoff appearance under Fitch. Along with Loy Vaught, a collection of young players (including Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski, and Lorenzen Wright), and journeyman veterans (among them Pooh Richardson, Tony Massenburg, Rodney Rogers, Darrick Martin, and Brian Williams), the Fitch-coached teams during this particular era struggled mightily, although they did make the playoffs once during this time. The 1996\u201397 team made the playoffs with a losing record (36\u201346) and were swept in the first round by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Utah Jazz, three games to none.\nFour members of the 1996\u201397 squad are now deceased. Malik Sealy died in a car accident in 2000, Kevin Duckworth died of heart disease in 2008, Lorenzen Wright went missing and was murdered in 2010, and Dwayne Schintzius died from cancer complications in 2012. Two other players from the Fitch era suffered tragic circumstances of their own; Brian Williams (who played for the Clippers during the 1995\u201396 season, and later became known as Bison Dele) was believed to have been murdered by his brother while the two were vacationing in 2002 while in the South Pacific, and Rodney Rogers became paralyzed after a dirt bike crash in 2008 in his native North Carolina.\nIn December, Vaught, the team's leading scorer for the past three seasons, had season-ending back surgery. Without Vaught, the Clippers finished 17\u201365, the third-worst record in the league. Fitch was fired after the 1997\u201398 season (and later sued the team to recover the remaining money on his contract), and was replaced by one of his proteges, former Celtics and Bucks coach Chris Ford. Meanwhile, Vaught's career as a Clipper was effectively finished, as he left as a free agent after that season, and signed with the Detroit Pistons; at the time of his departure, he was the franchise's all-time rebounds leader with 4,471 (a number that was later surpassed by Elton Brand, with 4,710).\nThe Clippers won the first overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and selected center Michael Olowokandi from University of the Pacific. The team had a 0\u201317 start and finished with a 9\u201341 record in the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season. They were led by second-year forward Maurice Taylor, who averaged 16.8 points per game, and won the fourth overall pick in the following draft, which coincided with their move to the Staples Center. The Clippers would draft Lamar Odom, and then hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to help tutor Olowokandi during his second-year. Johnson remained an assistant coach until the middle of the 2002\u201303 season, when he took over as head coach. Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season, detailing a lack of improvement in Olowokandi, who is largely considered one of the biggest draft busts in league history.\nDuring the 1999 off-season, Rodney Rogers signed with the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers also sent Lamond Murray to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman. However, Newman was then traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Murdock a month later without ever playing a game for the Clippers. The team finished with the worst record in the league (15\u201367) in the 1999\u20132000 season, while the Lakers had the best record that year (67\u201315), and won the NBA championship.\nMove to Staples Center.\nIn what was supposed to be a counter-move, the Coliseum Commission, the management entity that managed the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and Coliseum, had planned to build a new 18,700-seat arena in the parking lot next to the Sports Arena that would have cost up to $94 million, that would have included 1,100 club seats, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site practice facility for the Clippers. However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (two miles directly up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers decided to become a tenant at Staples.\nIn 1999, the Clippers joined the Lakers and Los Angeles Kings in the new Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles. Also, because of the terms of its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders. However, in the years after, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold out every regular season and postseason home game.\n2000\u20132009: Further struggles at Staples Center.\nThe 2000\u201301 season brought changes. Derek Strong was sent to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Corey Maggette and the draft rights to Keyon Dooling. The Clippers' two draft picks that year were childhood friends from Illinois: high schooler Darius Miles (3rd overall pick) and Quentin Richardson (18th overall pick). The team became popular among fans with its high-flying style of basketball and the Clippers did improve slightly, registering a 31\u201351 record. The team also lead the NBA in bench-scoring, with 37 points per game.\nTo improve upon the previous season, the Clippers acquired high-scoring and rebounding power forward Elton Brand from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler. Brand earned a spot on the 2002 NBA Western Conference All-Star team as an injury replacement for Shaquille O'Neal. The Clippers contended for most of the season, but won only 3 of the last 12 games and finished 39\u201343, five games out of the playoffs. In order to seriously challenge for playoff contention in 2003, the franchise traded Miles to the Cavaliers for Andre Miller, who led the NBA in assists in 2001\u201302 with 11 per game. With a seasoned point guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best power forwards in Brand, and center Olowokandi, as well as having the best supporting cast in the league, the Clippers threatened a potential playoff run. However, poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27\u201355 record. Coach Alvin Gentry was also replaced, with Dennis Johnson entering midway through the 2002\u201303 season.\nAfter the dismal season prior, the team lost several of its core players, with Miller, Odom, Olowakandi, and forward Eric Piatkowski (who was one of the longest-tenured players in franchise history) departing via free agency prior to the 2003\u201304 season. The team opted to retain Brand and Maggette with long-term contracts. They, along with Richardson, made up one of the NBA's best high-scoring trios, with a combined 58 points per game. With new head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr., they finished 28\u201354, due to inexperience and injuries. The following season again saw the team missing the playoffs, although, they posted a better record than the Lakers for the first time since 1993. Bobby Simmons, a former second-round pick, won the 2004\u201305 NBA Most Improved Player award after averaging 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. As a result, Simmons signed a 5-year, $47\u00a0million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. To counter Simmons' defection, the Clippers announced they would sign Cuttino Mobley. Mobley's contract was identical in length, but for five million less than Simmons', and marked the first significant free-agent signing from outside the organization since Walton in the late 1970s. The Clippers also completed the building of a practice facility (the first NBA practice facility within the four corners of the City of Los Angeles) in the Playa Vista development. Midway through the season, the Clippers traded Marko Jari\u0107 (in a sign and trade transaction) and Lionel Chalmers to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Sam Cassell and a lottery-protected first round pick in the 2006 NBA draft.\nThe 2005\u201306 season was a turning point for the team's image; marked by several wins over top teams, Brand's performances were greatly praised, and he was chosen for the All-Star Game. Many sports writers noted the team's improvement, especially after acquiring sharpshooter Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 from the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for big-man Chris Wilcox. While the team had a few stretches of poor play, they were able to maintain a solid record, including posting several winning streaks. They achieved their first winning record in 14 seasons, and clinched their first playoff spot since 1997. They also finished with a better record than the Lakers for the second straight year. By finishing sixth in the Western Conference, with a record of 47\u201335 (their highest finish since the team left Buffalo), they benefited from the current NBA playoff format of regular-season records taking precedence over winning the division, and secured home court advantage over the Denver Nuggets.\nOn April 22, 2006, the Clippers won their first NBA playoff game in 13 years. Two days later, they won their second playoff game, going 2\u20130 against an opponent for the first time in franchise history. They lost Game 3, won Game 4, and on May 1, they won Game 5 in Los Angeles. This would mark their first playoff series win since they moved from Buffalo. In the next round, the team faced the Phoenix Suns. After losing a close Game 1, they won Game 2, 122\u201397. The series shifted to Staples Center for Game 3, but the Suns won, 94\u201391. In Game 4, Brand posted 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists as the Clippers evened the series. In Game 5, Raja Bell made a key 3-pointer for the Suns with 1.1 seconds left in the first overtime to send the game into a second overtime. However, Phoenix won in double-overtime, 125\u2013118. They bounced back with a series-saving 118\u2013106 Game 6 win. Second-year defensive specialist Quinton Ross had a timely offensive game, scoring a then career-high 18 points. Brand had 30 points (his scoring average in this series), 12 rebounds, and five blocks. Corey Maggette came off the bench to score 25 points, with 7\u20138 shooting from the field, and 9\u20139 from the free-throw line. Kaman and Cassell each scored 15 points. However, the Clippers lost the seventh game, 127\u2013107. General Manager (and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member) Elgin Baylor won the NBA Executive of the Year award for leading the Clippers' playoff run.\nThe 2006 off-season started as the team drafted Paul Davis in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft, as the 34th overall pick. The pick was acquired by the Clippers by way of a 2004 trade for Melvin Ely. The team also drafted Guillermo Diaz as the 52nd overall pick. While Davis signed with the team, Diaz decided to play overseas. However, the team still holds his draft rights. Meanwhile, in free agency, they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24\u00a0million deal. That was to counter the defection of Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 to the Lakers in a similar deal. Radmanovic's contract lasted another year, but both players would make the same amount of money annually, which would be $6\u00a0million. Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) re-signed on a two-year, $13\u00a0million deal, while the team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.\nIn September, the Clippers also announced a radio broadcast deal with KSPN-AM, the local ESPN Radio-operated outlet. Despite several additions, the team did not perform to expectations, with a lack of team chemistry and injuries to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, and Kaman, forcing the team to sign journeymen Luke Jackson, Alvin Williams, and Doug Christie to help solidify the team's bench. The season disappointment extended as Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocated left knee in which he tore every ligament in his knee. This was one of the most devastating injuries that season, and considered one of the worst in league history. The extent of the injury was so severe, local news outlets such as KCBS-TV/KCAL-TV and KNBC-TV elected not to air the clip of the injury. According to the team's lead physician, Dr. Tony Daly, Livingston's prognosis for him to return to basketball activity was eight months (which was around the first week of the upcoming season) to a full calendar year. The Clippers finished the season 40\u201342, two games behind the eighth-seed, while the Lakers finished with a better record for the first time since the 2003\u201304 season. The Clippers received the 14th draft pick from the NBA lottery in the 2007 NBA Draft, selecting Al Thornton.\nThe 2007\u201308 season started off negatively, with Brand rupturing his left Achilles tendon. Brand missed most of the season, and the team struggled to stay competitive. Chris Kaman took advantage of a depleted roster by averaging 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, but was limited to playing 56 games, also due to various injuries. The Clippers ended the season 23\u201359, and the team aimed to rebuild for the following season. Both Brand and Maggette were allowed to depart, while ten players were acquired. Brand stated his desire to stay, but the contract faltered, allowing him to move to the Philadelphia 76ers. Baron Davis, a Los Angeles native and formerly of the Golden State Warriors, signed a five-year contract with the Clippers, worth an estimated $65\u00a0million. In the upcoming draft, the Clippers obtained the seventh pick, and selected Eric Gordon. They also selected DeAndre Jordan, who was picked 35th overall. Mike Taylor, the 55th overall pick, was acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for a future second-round pick.\nIn July 2008, they acquired Marcus Camby from the Denver Nuggets in return for a $10\u00a0million trade exception and the choice to exchange second round picks with the Clippers in 2010. The Clippers also acquired guard Jason Hart from the Utah Jazz, in exchange for guard Brevin Knight, and signed Ricky Davis to a one-year deal. They continued an active off-season by re-signing former Clippers player Brian Skinner in July, while trading for Steve Novak. The team would also sign Jason Williams to a one-year deal. However, just prior to the start of training camp in September, Williams announced his retirement. Other mid-season acquisitions came in the form of Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins, who arrived from the New York Knicks in exchange for Tim Thomas and Cuttino Mobley. This trade made Kaman the sole member still on the team from their playoff run two years prior.\nIn October 2008, Baylor ended his 22-year reign as vice president and general manager of basketball operations. It remains one of the longest tenures in professional sports history. The Clippers indicated that Baylor had retired from his post, and as a result, head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. assumed the role of General Manager, while director of player personnel Neil Olshey was promoted to assistant general manager. However, several other reports indicated Baylor had been fired or resigned, and when questioned, Baylor responded he had been advised by his attorneys not to comment on the matter. This prompted speculation that the team and Baylor were in negotiations to work out a settlement agreement for his departure, with Baylor reportedly working without a formal contract since the early 1990s.\nThe 2008\u201309 season ended with the team 14th in the Western Conference, with a record of 19\u201363. They were then awarded the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.\n2009\u20132011: The arrival of Blake Griffin and steady improvement.\nWith the first overall pick, the team selected Blake Griffin. To clear a spot in the lineup for him, they traded Zach Randolph to Memphis for Quentin Richardson. Richardson was then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Sebastian Telfair, Craig Smith, and Mark Madsen.\nGriffin immediately impressed in training camp and preseason. On October 23, he broke his kneecap during the Clippers' final exhibition game against the New Orleans Hornets, following a dunk. Initially, the Clippers' stated that he only had a sore left knee, which would make him questionable for the season opener the following night, before they revealed the break. The injury sidelined Griffin for the entire season.\nOn February 4, 2010, head coach Mike Dunleavy resigned, and Kim Hughes was named interim coach. Dunleavy retained his front-office title and duties for just over a month, but on March 10 he was fired as General Manager, being replaced by Neil Olshey. Dunleavy received the news of his dismissal from the internet, as well as friends and reporters calling his cell phone. The Los Angeles Times reported that Dunleavy had filed for arbitration and that the Clippers had cut off his salary, even though his guaranteed contract did not end until after the 2010\u201311 season. Although the Clippers saw minor improvement, finishing with ten more wins at 29\u201353, Hughes was fired as head coach at the end of the season.\nIn July, former Chicago Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro was hired as the next head coach. In August, the team introduced new uniform designs at a photoshoot, at the team's practice facility. Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, who saw significant improvement in his two years with the team, modeled the new uniforms, which were re-designed for the first time since the 2000\u201301 season. The Clippers' primary and secondary logos, which are modifications of the previous ones, were introduced to the public weeks earlier, on the night of the 2010 NBA draft, where the Clippers selected Al-Farouq Aminu eighth overall.\nWith an improved Gordon, stalwart Kaman, rookie Aminu, starting center Jordan, a re-energized Baron Davis, and the debut of Griffin, the Clippers had high hopes for the season. However, they started slowly, losing ten of the first 11 games, with Davis and Kaman out with injuries. However, the Clippers showed strength when three of their first four wins came from the top teams in the Western Conference. Griffin got off to a strong start, drawing increased media attention in Clippers games and boosting ratings of local broadcasts of Clippers games. Griffin was chosen as a Western Conference Reserve in the 2011 NBA All-Star Game, a rare honor for a rookie, the first chosen by the coaches for the game since Tim Duncan in 1997. He also won the NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest, and was named the Rookie of the Year as the team finished with a record of 32\u201350. As the trade deadline approached, the Clippers sent Baron Davis along with their 2011 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. The pick eventually became the number one overall pick, which the Cavaliers used to select Kyrie Irving.\n2011\u20132017: Arrival of Chris Paul and \"Lob City\".\nIn December 2011, the Clippers signed Caron Butler to a $24 million deal and claimed veteran point guard Chauncey Billups three days later. On December 14, they traded Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu and Minnesota's 2012 first-round pick acquired in 2005 for New Orleans Hornets' four-time all-star Chris Paul. Paul had previously almost been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, but NBA commissioner David Stern had vetoed the trade (the NBA was owner of the Hornets at the time). Paul and Griffin were selected as starters for the Western Conference team in the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, the first time in franchise history the team had two All-Star starters in the same year.\nThe team gained the nickname \"Lob City\" due to a comment made by Griffin during the Clippers Media Day when the announcement of Chris Paul's trade reached the team. Griffin, after being told the news by Jordan, declared, \"Yeah! It's going to be lob city!\"\nIn February 2012, the Clippers signed Kenyon Martin. An 11-year NBA veteran and former NBA All-Star (2004), Martin joined the Clippers after signing with the Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association the previous summer. On February 6, 2012, during a game against the Orlando Magic, Billups tore his Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season. In March 2012, Nick Young joined the Clippers as part of a three-team trade with the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. He became the eighth player to debut in the 2011\u201312 season.\nAfter a stretch that saw the Clippers lose 12 of 19 games after Billups's season-ending injury, with rumors of Vinny Del Negro's career as head coach of the Clippers possibly coming to an abrupt end, Los Angeles went on a tear. The Clippers won 12 of their next 14 games, including road wins over the defending champions Dallas Mavericks and the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, clinching their fifth playoff berth since their 1976 conference semifinals loss to the Boston Celtics (the last time they made the playoffs as the Buffalo Braves) before a dominating home win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on April 16, 2012. It was their third win in four regular-season games against the Thunder. Chris Paul's push for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award was at its peak, and the 2011\u201312 season was the first time the Clippers were in the playoffs since 2005\u201306 season.\nIn their first playoff game, the Clippers rallied from a 27-point deficit against the Grizzlies to win 99\u201398 in one of the biggest rallies in playoff history. They led the series 3\u20131, then lost two straight, before coming back to win Game 7 in Memphis 82\u201372, becoming the sixth NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading series 3\u20131, and prevail to the second round. The Clippers relied on their bench during that game, and they came through, scoring all but two of their points in the fourth quarter. In the second round of the playoffs, the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs. The following off-season, GM Neil Olshey reached an agreement to become General Manager of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olshey was replaced by Gary Sacks. On draft night, the team re-acquired Lamar Odom from the Dallas Mavericks as part of a four-team deal that also sent Mo Williams and Furkan Aldemir, their 2012 draftee, to the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets, respectively. The team then sent Reggie Evans to the Brooklyn Nets for the right to swap second-round draft picks with the Nets in the 2016 NBA draft. On the same day, the Clippers signed free agent Jamal Crawford, formerly of the Portland Trail Blazers, and re-signed Billups to a one-year deal. The franchise then rounded out its roster for the upcoming season with Grant Hill, Ryan Hollins, and Ronny Turiaf, while signing Matt Barnes to a one-year deal early in the season.\nOn November 29, 2012, public address announcer David Courtney died in hospital, and was replaced by former Clippers and current Los Angeles Dodgers PA announcer, Eric Smith. On December 15, with a 111\u201385 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the Clippers recorded their record ninth consecutive win, breaking their previous franchise record (in Los Angeles) of eight wins set in the 1991\u201392 season. On December 21, with a 97\u201385 win over the Sacramento Kings, they notched their twelfth consecutive victory, breaking their previous 11-game streak as the Buffalo Braves in the 1974\u201375 season. On December 30, the Clippers recorded a team-record 17th straight win against the Utah Jazz, beating them 107\u201396. The win also made the Clippers the third team in NBA history to record an undefeated month ending the month of December 16\u20130. The streak ended when they lost to the Denver Nuggets on January 2, 2013.\nOn January 9, 2013, with a 99\u201393 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Clippers recorded another franchise record with their 13th straight home victory. On January 12, the Clippers 13 game home win streak came to an end with a 104\u2013101 loss to the Orlando Magic. A 126\u2013101 victory over the Phoenix Suns saw the Clippers reach the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history, breaking their previous mark of 49 from 1974\u201375, when they were in Buffalo. On April 7, with a 109\u201395 victory over the Lakers, they swept the LA season series, and clinched their first division title in franchise history. They would finish the season with a 56\u201326 record, and entered the playoffs as the fourth seed, to once again face the fifth seeded Memphis Grizzlies. The Clippers would go up 2\u20130 early in the series after a buzzer beater by Chris Paul in game 2. After being up 2\u20130 in the series, the Clippers would lose 4 games in a row to be eliminated the first round. This caused the team to not renew Vinny Del Negro's contract as head coach, and acquired Doc Rivers from the Boston Celtics. The deal was announced to have included two future first-round draft picks, in addition to an anti-trade clause preventing the Clippers and Celtics from engaging in further transactions amongst each other, including the exchanging of players, for the duration of the 2013\u201314 season.\nOn July 3, 2013, the Clippers traded Eric Bledsoe and Caron Butler to the Phoenix Suns for Jared Dudley and JJ Redick (from the Milwaukee Bucks). The Clippers and Suns also sent a second-round pick each to the Bucks. On July 7, the team re-signed Barnes, Paul, and Ryan Hollins. Paul's deal was for 5 years, worth around $105.3 million. The team also signed Darren Collison to fill the back-up point guard role, replacing Bledsoe and free agent Chauncey Billups, who signed with the Detroit Pistons. On August 28, the Clippers signed free agent power forward Antawn Jamison to a one-year deal worth the veteran minimum. Jamison only appeared in 22 games, and was eventually traded to the Atlanta Hawks on February 20, 2014, in exchange for the draft rights to Cenk Akyol. On December 19, 2013, the Clippers signed free agent small forward Stephen Jackson. Jackson also appeared sporadically, and was eventually waived on January 7, 2014. On January 16, the Clippers signed free agent small forward Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, while also acquiring both Glen Davis and Danny Granger for the remainder of 2013\u201314 season. On March 6, the Clippers defeated their crosstown rivals by 48 points 142\u201394, the most lopsided victory ever for the Clippers' franchise, and the most one-sided loss in Lakers history. On April 15, the Clippers broke the franchise record of wins with 57. In the playoffs, they defeated the Warriors in seven games before falling again, this time to the Thunder, in six games in the second round.\nDonald Sterling controversy.\nOn April 25, 2014, entertainment news website TMZ released a taped conversation in which team owner Donald Sterling\u2014who had a history of accusations of racist behavior against African Americans and Latinos dating back to the 1990s\u2014reprimanded V. Stiviano (of African American and Mexican heritage, who had reportedly been dating Sterling while he was estranged from wife) for posting an Instagram photo featuring her, former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson, and another woman. Sterling stated that it bothered him that she had \"broadcast that [she is] associating with black people\", and that he did not want Stiviano to bring them to the team's games. The remarks in the tape caused public backlash (including condemnations from many players, with Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant all voicing their disapproval); several sponsors also severed ties with the team, among them Kia Motors (for whom Griffin serves as its television spokesperson), State Farm Insurance, and Virgin America. Threats of boycotts against the Clippers were also considered, with the team itself briefly contemplating one at the April 27 playoff game against the Golden State Warriors (the fourth game in the team's first round playoff series). They opted to conduct a silent protest instead, by wearing their shirts inside-out, obscuring team logos.\nOn April 29, the NBA issued Sterling a lifetime ban from the organization after a league investigation into the recording confirmed that he was the one conversing with Stiviano. The league also issued a $2.5 million fine against Sterling (the highest allowable by the NBA) and barred him from attending games or practices involving any NBA team; being present in any Clippers office or facility; and from participating in any team business, player personnel decisions or league activity. NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of three-quarters of the league's 29 other team owners. Silver later announced that the NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team. Before the ban was issued, Sterling told Fox News contributor Jim Gray that he had no plans to sell the team. The NBA installed former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard Parsons as the interim CEO of the team on May 9, prior to allowing Steve Ballmer, a former CEO of Microsoft, to purchase the team for $2 billion. To buy the team, Ballmer reportedly beat out other candidates, including Eric Piatkowski and his group, Oprah Winfrey, Floyd Mayweather, Magic Johnson, as well as a group of crowdfunders. The team's sale price, which was four times the expected purchase-evaluated price, prompted speculation that Ballmer aimed to relocate the team to Seattle, his hometown. He had previously been a part of an ownership group that had unsuccessfully attempted to move the Sacramento Kings to that city, but later stated no intention to relocate the team.\nOn August 12, 2014, Ballmer officially took control of the team following an order by a California court that confirmed the sale from Shelly Sterling to Ballmer. As part of the deal, Shelly received the titles of \"Owner Emeritus\" and \"Clippers' Number 1 Fan\", as well as ten tickets in sections 101 or 111 for all Clippers games, two courtside tickets for all games in Los Angeles, six parking spots in Lot C for each game, 12 VIP passes that include access to the Lexus Club, Arena Club, or Chairman's Lounge and Media room or equivalent, for each Staples games, three championship rings following any Clippers title, and will run a charitable foundation. The deal also included a stipulation that Steve Ballmer would keep the Clippers in Los Angeles. On November 6, the team hired its first major female executive as former Auto Club Speedway president Gillian Zucker was hired as the Clippers' president of business operations. Zucker became one of two women to serve in an executive capacity in any of the four major professional sports leagues; the other being Jeanie Buss, president and part-owner of the crosstown Lakers.\n2014\u20132017: Final seasons of Lob City.\nThe Clippers' first regular season under Ballmer's co-ownership ended with a 56\u201326 record and the third seed in the Western Conference going into the 2015 playoffs. They met the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, winning the series in the seventh game on a game-winning shot by Paul with one second left. In the next series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets, they took a 3\u20131 series lead that included 25 and 33-point wins in games three and four, respectively. However, Houston won the final three games to eliminate Los Angeles. In the off-season, the Clippers acquired Lance Stephenson, Wesley Johnson, and Paul Pierce while re-signing Austin Rivers. Griffin missed half of the season and the Clippers finished with the fourth playoff seed before being then eliminated in the first round of the 2016 playoffs by the fifth-seeded Portland Trail Blazers.\nThe Clippers finished the 2016\u201317 season with a 51\u201331 record, the team's fifth straight 50-win season, despite injuries to both Griffin and Paul during the regular season. The Clippers won their last seven games and earned the fourth playoff seed by defeating the Sacramento Kings in the final game of the season. The Clippers faced the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs, but lost in seven games. Paul Pierce retired after the season.\n2017\u20132019: Rebuild.\nIn preparation for a rebuild, the Clippers brought in two-time Executive Of The Year winner Jerry West to serve as their special consultant; West was the architect behind the dynasties of the 2000 to 2002 Los Angeles Lakers and mid to late 2010s Golden State Warriors, and had helped to establish the Memphis Grizzlies as a relevant playoff contender. On June 28, 2017, Chris Paul was sent to the Houston Rockets in a sign-and-trade in exchange for Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Sam Dekker, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first-round pick, and cash considerations. The team retained Griffin and acquired Italian wing Danilo Gallinari in a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks. Due to injuries to Griffin and Gallinari and no serious depth on the roster, the team was struggling by the 2018 trade deadline and traded Griffin to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovi\u0107, a protected first-round pick in 2018, and a second-round pick in 2019. With the added depth, they finished with a winning record of 42\u201340 but missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011.\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the team were awarded the 12th and 13th overall picks, and selected Miles Bridges and Jerome Robinson, respectively. They then traded Bridges and two future second-round picks on draft night to Charlotte for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Austin Rivers was traded to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Marcin Gortat, while long-time Clipper DeAndre Jordan, who had been with the team since 2008, opted out of his contract and became a free agent. Despite the departure of Griffin and Jordan for the 2018\u201319 season, the Clippers clinched a playoff berth and finished the regular season with a 48\u201334 record. The team faced the defending two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the first round, losing in six games.\n2019\u2013present: The Kawhi Leonard era.\n2019\u20132024: The Paul George/Kawhi Leonard duo.\nIn the 2019 off-season, Kawhi Leonard opted out of his final year on his contract with the Toronto Raptors to become one of the top free agents. Leonard chose to sign with the Clippers when the team agreed to trade for the Oklahoma City Thunder's Paul George. For George, the Clippers traded Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, four unprotected first-round picks, a protected first-round pick, and two pick swaps.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Clippers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. They finished the year with a 49\u201323 record as the Western Conferences second seed. Despite high expectations, the Clippers failed to win their first conference semifinals series when they were eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in seven games. The defeat marked the second time that the Clippers lost the conference semifinals after taking a 3\u20131 series lead. A week later, Ballmer announced that Rivers stepped down as head coach in a mutual decision. Rivers was succeeded by Tyronn Lue.\nDespite losing Leonard to injury during the 2021 playoffs, the Clippers defeated the top-seeded Utah Jazz in the semifinals, leading them to their first Western Conference finals appearance in franchise history. The Clippers lost the conference finals in six games to the Phoenix Suns, preventing them from reaching their first NBA Finals.\nOn September 17, 2021, ground was broken for Intuit Dome, which will be the Clipper's home arena from the 2024\u201325 season. Due to Kawhi's injury during the playoffs, Leonard missed the entire 2021\u201322 season. In August 2021, the Clippers traded Patrick Beverley, Rajon Rondo, and a 2025 pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Eric Bledsoe, who would be dealt in February 2022 with Justise Winslow and Keon Johnson for Norman Powell and Robert Covington. The Clippers ended the season 42\u201340, qualifying for the play-in game, but would not make it out due to losses to Minnesota and New Orleans.\nIn the next season, the Clippers acquired former MVP Russell Westbrook and former All-NBA guard John Wall via free agency. Wall would later be dealt for Eric Gordon as part of a three-team deal. The Clippers would finish the season 44\u201338 and make the playoffs but be eliminated in the first round due to injuries to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\nNear the start of the 2023\u201324 season, the Clippers traded Marcus Morris Sr., Kenyon Martin Jr., Nicolas Batum and Robert Covington to the Philadelphia 76ers for P. J. Tucker, Filip Petru\u0161ev and former MVP James Harden. In the Clippers' final season in the Crypto.com Arena, they would start off the season slow, but when Terance Mann replaced Westbrook in the starting lineup, the Clippers went on a roll. They clinched a playoff spot on April 11, 2024, and finished as the fourth seed in the Western Conference with a 51\u201331 record. The Clippers were defeated in six games by the Dallas Mavericks.\nMove to Intuit Dome.\nOn June 15, 2017, the Clippers and the city of Inglewood entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement in which the team built a new privately funded arena, Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center, by 2024, when the Clippers' lease with Crypto.com Arena expired. The arena is located at Century Boulevard between Yukon and Prairie Avenues, directly south of SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League. The arena also houses a practice facility and team headquarters for the Clippers, as the team's former practice facility in Los Angeles' Playa Vista neighborhood is still owned by the Sterling Family Trust, and is leased back to the team. The Inglewood city council unanimously voted for the agreement in which a subsidiary of the Clippers purchased 22 acres covering four large city blocks in what is largely a lower-class/lower-middle-class residential neighborhood (Century to the north, 104th Street to the south, Doty to the east, and Prairie to the west) to build the new facility.\nThe planned arena was met with immediate opposition from the nearby Forum and its operator, the Madison Square Garden Company (parent company of the New York Knicks), as they accused both the Clippers and the Inglewood city government of \"backroom dealing\" and the fear that a new Clippers' arena would siphon events from the recently renovated sports arena-turned-concert venue. In March 2020, Steve Ballmer, owner of the Clippers, reached an agreement with the Madison Square Garden Company to buy The Forum, eliminating any opposition related to the construction of the Clippers' new arena.\nOn July 25, 2019, the Clippers released images of the proposed arena with the construction planned to begin in 2021 and completed in fall 2024 following the expiration of the Clippers' lease with the Staples Center. On September 17, 2021, the Clippers unveiled the first renditions of the new arena with an expected cost of up to $2 billion. The team also revealed the arena's name as Intuit Dome through a 23-year naming rights deal with Intuit worth $500 million.\n2024\u2013present: Departure of Paul George.\nIn the 2024\u201325 off-season, the Clippers, now with a new home arena and branding, lost Paul George and Russell Westbrook to the Philadelphia 76ers and Denver Nuggets, respectively, and re-signed James Harden.\nAfter missing the first 34 games of the season due to injury, Kawhi Leonard returned to play in January 2025. James Harden represented the Clippers at the All-Star Game.\n2025: Allegations of salary cap circumvention.\nIn September 2025, Pablo S. Torre reported on his podcast that the Clippers and Ballmer used now-bankrupt environmental company Aspiration as a means of circumventing the NBA salary cap. Torre reported that Kawhi Leonard had signed a $28 million \"no-show\" endorsement deal with Aspiration that required no action on Leonard's part, other than remaining a Clipper. Ballmer had also invested $50 million into Aspiration, and former anonymous employees of the company alleged that Leonard's deal was a means of paying him extra under the table. A follow-up report by Torre cited documents that Clippers minority owner Dennis J. Wong invested $2 million in Aspiration after the already-struggling company was late on a $1.75 million payment to Leonard, which the company marked as \"critical.\" John Karalis of the Boston Sports Journal later reported that Leonard also received an additional $20 million in Aspiration company stock, bringing Leonard's total promised compensation from the company to $48 million. \nThe NBA responded by announcing it was investigating the matter. The Clippers immediately denied the allegations, calling them \"absurd\" and \"flat-out wrong\" in multiple team statements. Ballmer gave an interview to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne on September 4th, claiming that the team had introduced Leonard to Aspiration after signing a $300 million sponsorship agreement with the company, which is allowed under NBA rules, but had no further involvement in any endorsement deals the parties signed. He claimed that he had no knowledge of the terms of the contract Leonard had signed, and stated he was a victim of fraud by Aspiration, expressing \"anger\" and \"sadness\" for his employees.\nRivalries.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe rivalry between the Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers is unique, as they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, Crypto.com Arena, but since the Clippers' move to Intuit Dome in 2024, no NBA teams share an arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets.\nLos Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. Some contend that the term \"rivalry\" is inaccurate due to the Lakers' historical success and the Clippers' lack thereof.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Clippers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Clippers seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nLogos and uniforms.\nWhen the Braves franchise moved to San Diego and renamed the Clippers, they retained the baby blue base on their uniforms, but replaced black with orange trim. A series of nautical flags which spelled \"Clippers\" adorned each side of the shorts. The team's original logo featured a large baby blue circle enclosing a small orange circle to represent Southern California's sunny climate and three white sails to represent a clipper. The \"three sails\" logo was later reused by the Clippers' G League team upon relocating from Ontario to San Diego in 2024.\nIn a foreshadowing move, the Clippers redesigned their logo and uniforms during the 1982\u201383 season. This set, which the team carried over upon moving to Los Angeles in 1984, replaced baby blue and orange with royal blue and red. The uniforms featured a royal blue base and red trim and were emblazoned with the team name in front; the \"C\" in the word \"Clippers\" was enlarged in the same manner as the logo. Most notably, \"San Diego\" was removed from the away jerseys and replaced with the same \"Clippers\" wordmark from the home jerseys. The Clippers also wore red uniforms on a number of occasions in 1984. The logo was now a generic moving white basketball with red lines superimposed over the full team name, which the team used until 2015, albeit with some tweaks to the design.\nIn 1987, the Clippers uniforms changed to a set that remained mostly intact until 2010. Red became the base color while blue was relegated to trim color. On the home white uniform, the team name was written in script lettering, while on the road red uniform, the city name in script was used. Later on, the road uniforms replaced the city name with the team name, and blue numerals were replaced with white numerals. Before the 2000\u201301 season, the Clippers made slight changes to their uniform, adding the interlocking \"LAC\" logo on the neckline and gaining thicker contrasting stripes and bolder numerals. Later on, the Clippers unveiled a blue alternate uniform which spelled the city name in red with white trim.\nIn 2010, the Clippers changed their uniforms, adjusting the stripes and letters. The white uniforms featured the team name in blue and the numerals in red, while the red uniforms were emblazoned with the city name in white and numerals in blue. Later on, the Clippers added a blue alternate uniform and a sleeved baby blue alternate uniform; both designs featured the city name in white and numerals in red.\nOn June 18, 2015, the Los Angeles Clippers unveiled its new brand identity. The club's primary logo features a basketball in the shape of a compass, with the club's \"LAC\" monogram situated in the middle. Below that is the club's wordmark logo in black, with the two curved lines below the wordmark symbolizing the horizon of the ocean, which the club says it alludes to its nautical roots. The team also unveiled its new home and away uniforms, which kept the design template from the previous uniforms. The home white uniform features the club's wordmark logo in black across the front. The away red uniform features the club's \"LAC\" monogram across the right breast, with the player's jersey number across the left breast.\nThe Clippers introduced an alternate black uniform intended to celebrate downtown Los Angeles on November 6, 2015. The uniform keeps the design template from the previous uniform, and features the club's primary logo without the wordmark.\nThe Clippers unveiled their new Nike Association (white) and Icon (team color) uniform designs on August 11, 2017. The home and road designations were dropped, and the team replaced its seldom-used road red uniform with a new blue \"Icon\" uniform that resembles the white \"Association\" uniform, which dropped the black accents. The black alternate (a.k.a. Statement uniform) was also retained. All three sets featured updated numeral and letter fonts.\nA fourth uniform option, the City uniform, was later unveiled. For the 2017\u201318 season, the Clippers brought back the classic San Diego baby blue and orange scheme for their first City uniform, including the nautical flags which spell the acronym \"LAC\".\nThe next season, the Clippers wore navy blue City uniforms to commemorate the team's 35th season in Los Angeles, as well as to pay tribute to the 1984 Summer Olympics. This design returned in the 2025\u201326 season, but the base was changed to orange with baby blue and black accents to honor the franchise's roots as the Buffalo Braves.\nIn the 2019\u201320 season, the Clippers donned white City uniforms with black letters and \"Los Angeles\" in Old English font as a tribute to Los Angeles' street culture. The Clippers kept most of the same design for the 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, this time with a black base.\nThe 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform saw the Clippers incorporate various uniform styles from the past, including the baby blue and orange of the Buffalo/San Diego era, the \"Clippers\" script from 1987 to 2015, and the three sails motif from the 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Clippers wore black \"City\" uniforms as homage to the Drew League, a summer tournament in Los Angeles that celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023. The white \"Los Angeles\" script was surrounded by a mosaic inspired by the Watts Towers.\nThe 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform featured the shortened nickname \"Clips\" in a font based on the team's 1978\u20131983 logo. The mostly navy uniform was designed by local artist Jonas Wood, who drew inspiration from the city's love for basketball. A light Pacific blue and black colorway was used as part of the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform.\nAfter reaching the 2020 NBA playoffs, the Clippers were rewarded with an \"Earned\" uniform for the 2020\u201321 season. The uniform essentially recreated the team's \"Icon\" uniform, but had a grey base with thick white stripes, and red and blue were relegated to the arm piping.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Clippers updated their black \"Statement\" uniforms, replacing the \"LAC\" logo with the \"Los Angeles\" script first used in their 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniforms. The three sails motif from the 2017\u201318 and 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniforms was also added.\nStarting with the 2024\u201325 season, the Clippers unveiled modern versions of the script uniforms they previously wore from 1987 to 2015. The logo now featured a stylized clipper ship surrounding a navy blue \"C\" in a white circle and Pacific blue outline, with pointed marks inspired by a compass and a basketball silhouette on the hull. The \"Association\" white uniform featured the modernized script \"Clippers\" wordmark in navy blue with red numbers. The \"Icon\" navy blue uniform featured the aforementioned \"Clippers\" script in red with white numbers, and the red \"Statement\" uniform featured a stacked script \"Los Angeles\" wordmark in navy blue with white numbers, along with nautical flags that spell \"LAC\" on the navy blue stripe.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Clippers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.

{"id": "72893", "revid": "44329014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72893", "title": "Los Angeles Lakers", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Los Angeles, California\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.\nThe franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL). After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers. The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships. After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960\u201361 season.\nThe Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979; first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport. Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987.\nAfter Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\". The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title.\nJackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018. In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis. The Lakers\u2014led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel\u2014won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024. In February 2025, the Lakers traded Davis while acquiring Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\nThe Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971\u201372. 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.\nHistory.\n1946\u20131954: Beginnings and Minneapolis dynasty with George Mikan.\nThe franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946\u201347 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season, its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000.\nMinneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key, behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team. Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers. Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas to be their first head coach, meeting with him and selling him on the team.\nAs the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer. In their first season, they led the league with a 43\u201317 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.\nIn 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two. Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved their record to 51\u201317 and won their third straight professional championship. In the 1950\u201351 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4\u00a0ppg and the Lakers went 44\u201324 to win their second straight division title. One of those games, a 19\u201318 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history. In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.\nDuring the 1951\u201352 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division. They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games. In the season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game. After a 48\u201322 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals. They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship. Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the season, he was still able to average 18\u00a0ppg. Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division. The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.\n1954\u20131958: Post-Mikan dry spell.\nFollowing Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals. Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year. Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955\u201356 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season. Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956\u201357. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957\u201358 when they won a league-low 19 games. They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9\u201330, and Kundla was rehired.\nThe Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9\u00a0ppg and 15.0\u00a0rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33\u201339 record. After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.\n1958\u20131968: Move to Los Angeles and Celtics rivalry.\nIn their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25\u201350. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed. Snow storms had driven the pilot off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt. Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University. During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles. Led by Baylor's 34.8\u00a0ppg and 19.8\u00a0rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season. On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs. They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.\nLed by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8\u00a0ppg respectively, the Lakers improved to 54\u201326 in 1961\u201362, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite fouling out of the game. The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven. Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential game-winning 18\u00a0foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.\nLos Angeles won 53 games in 1962\u201363, behind Baylor's 34.0\u00a0ppg and West's 27.1\u00a0ppg but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics. After falling to 42\u201338 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964\u201365. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3\u00a0ppg in the series. They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.\nLos Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.\n1968\u20131973: The arrival of Wilt Chamberlain.\nOn July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1\u00a0rpg. West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division. The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points, and had a 3\u20132 lead after five. Boston won the series in seven games however, and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award. In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2\u00a0ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4\u20133. The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe 1971\u201372 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120\u2013104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995\u201396. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points just once all year, and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.\nThe Lakers won 60 games in the 1972\u201373 season, and took another Pacific Division title. Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades. The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.\n1973\u20131979: Building \"Showtime\".\nDuring the 1973\u201374 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out. Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge. Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47\u201335 and win the Pacific Division. They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.\nAfter missing the playoffs in the 1974\u201375 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975\u201376, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3\u201310, and finished out of the playoffs at 40\u201342.\nWest and Cooke settled their differences\u2014and the former Laker's lawsuit\u2014and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach. West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling. Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976\u201377 season a league-best 53\u201329. They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals. During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon.\nIn the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977\u201378 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand. Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds, entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face. Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career. Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers. The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle. During the 1978\u201379 season, the team posted a 47\u201335 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.\n1979\u20131991: \"Showtime\".\nIn the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick. It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense. The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists. The team fell off in the 1980\u201381 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury. The team turned in a 54\u201328 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division. The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.\nEarly in the 1981\u201382 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade. Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home. Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games. Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs. Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers. The team won the Finals 4\u20132 to finish a 12\u20132 playoff run. On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979\u201380 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina. The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58\u201324, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season. Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio. The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games. After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.\nIn the 1983\u201384 season, Los Angeles went 54\u201328, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969. The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series. Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0\u20138 in Finals series against the Celtics.\nUsing the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148\u2013114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\". The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games. The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.\nIn the 1985\u201386 season, the Lakers started 24\u20133 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title. The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.\nPrior to the 1986\u201387 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs. Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65\u201317 record, and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons. The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining. Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP. At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions, which no team had done since the 1968\u201369 Boston Celtics.\nLooking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987\u201388 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62\u201320 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award. The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000.\nIn the 1988\u201389 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons. Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.\nFollowing the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63\u201319 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns. Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout, and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes. Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.\nThe 1990\u201391 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58\u201324 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.\n1991\u20131996: Post-\"Showtime\" dry spell.\nThe Lakers started the 1991\u201392 season by winning the international McDonald's Open in Paris, France, in October with Magic Johnson being named the tournament MVP. However, on November 7, 1991, Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.\nIn their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired.\nThe Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992\u201393 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2\u20130 lead against Phoenix. They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime. During the 1993\u201394 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant. Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33\u201349.\nUnder new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively. The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995\u201396 season to lead the then 24\u201318 Lakers to a 29\u201311 finish. After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.\n1996\u20132004: O'Neal and Bryant dynasty.\nDuring the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal. Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center. \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said. They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher. During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry. O'Neal led the team to a 56\u201326 record, their best effort since 1990\u201391, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury. O'Neal averaged 26.2\u00a0ppg and 12.5\u00a0rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88\u00a0bpg) in 51 games. The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game\u00a01 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969. In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11\u20130. O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury. Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games, finishing 61\u201321, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings. The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series, but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.\nDuring the 1998\u201399 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets. The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice. Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis. The team finished 31\u201319 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.\nBefore the 1999\u20132000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name. Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6\u00a0million a year contract. He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense. The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era. The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.\nLed by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games. They finished 67\u201315, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986\u201387 season. Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs. After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven. The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19\u20134 run to tie the game and eventually win 89\u201384 to advance to the NBA Finals. In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988. West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations. After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team, and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.\nThe following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year, but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio. They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime, the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15\u20131 postseason record was the best in NBA history.\nThe Lakers won 58 games in 2001\u201302. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento. The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory. In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106\u201399. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points. The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals. O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.\nThe Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002\u201303 season 11\u201319. However, they finished the season 39\u201313 to finish 50\u201332. They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant. Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant, forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century. Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder. The Lakers started 18\u20133 and finished 56\u201326 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games.\n2004\u20132016: The Kobe Bryant era.\n2004\u20132007: Rebuilding.\nDuring the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick. Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past, and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade. Jackson did not return as head coach, and about the team's 2003\u201304 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\". The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".\nThe Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004\u201305 season. Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors. The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson. After sitting out the first half of the 2004\u201305 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005. Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22\u201319 record before resigning due to health problems. Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season. Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34\u201348, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.\nWith the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey. The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit. Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season. On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history. Ending the season 45\u201337, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence. After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.\nIn the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43\u2014including seven in a row at one point\u2014to finish 42\u201340. They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.\n2007\u20132011: Bryant and Gasol championships.\nAfter re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007\u201308 season with a 25\u201311 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January. In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22\u20135 to finish the season. The Lakers' 57\u201325 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference. Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000. In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, the Lakers finished 65\u201317; the best record in the Western Conference. They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals. Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.\nThe Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace) in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009\u201310 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100\u201395. They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3\u20132 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles. Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6\u201324 shooting performance in game seven.\nAfter much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010\u201311 season. In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round. But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.\n2011\u20132016: Post-Jackson era.\nAfter Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011. Before the start of the shortened 2011\u201312 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded. On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill. With a 41\u201325 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.\nOn July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted. On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard. The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers. On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1\u20134 start to the 2012\u201313 season. Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5\u20135 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach. On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80. On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40\u201332 record the rest of the way to finish 45\u201337, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013. The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs. Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.\nOn December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013. However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season. On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise. The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27\u201355 season.\nAfter spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach. After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation. On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.\nDuring the first game of the 2014\u201315 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14\u201341. With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field. The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21\u201361, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history.\nThe next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick. On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team. In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17\u201365 record, the worst in franchise history.\n2016\u20132018: Post-Bryant era.\nOn April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season. On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over. The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University. The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.\nOn February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations. On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal. The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft, and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA. The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov. The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University. In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick. On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.\n2018\u2013present: The LeBron James era.\n2018\u20132019: The arrival of LeBron James.\nOn July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154\u00a0million contract. By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.\nOn April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations, and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.\n2019\u20132025: James and Davis era.\nOn May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach. The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery. On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft. This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players.\nOn January 25, 2020, LeBron James passed Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA's all-time scoring list during a road loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in Bryant's hometown. The next day, tragedy struck when Bryant was killed in a Calabasas helicopter accident, alongside his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others. The team would subsequently postpone their January 28 meeting with the crosstown rival Los Angeles Clippers. This marked the first time an NBA game was postponed for any reason since nearly seven years earlier when the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing led to the postponement of a Celtics game and the Lakers would pay tribute to Bryant and the victims prior to a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season on March 11, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52\u201319 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013, and as the top seed for the first time since 2010. They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. They defeated the Miami Heat 4\u20132 to win the 2020 NBA Finals, and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career. A championship dedicated to Bryant, the win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time. Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.\nDuring the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo. Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.\nThe Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets.\nOn December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP. They finished the 2023\u201324 season 47\u201335 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed.\nOn June 20, 2024, JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.\nOn June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history. On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James &amp; Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.\n2025\u2013present: The arrival of Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\nOn February 1, 2025, the Lakers traded Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a first-round pick in 2029 for all-star guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris. The Jazz got Jalen Hood-Schifino, and two 2025 second-round picks. The Lakers intended to trade Dalton Knecht, Cam Reddish, a 2030 pick swap, and their 2031 first-round pick to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Mark Williams. The trade was rescinded.\nRivalries.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA. The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s.\nThe rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4\u20132. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games.\nThe two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history.\nThe all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209\u2013165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s. Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games.\nThe rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThe Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers\u2013Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another. The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s. The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262\u2013173, and the postseason series 25\u201311.\nLos Angeles Clippers.\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena, but since the Clippers' move to Intuit Dome in 2024, no NBA teams share an arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets.\nLos Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. Some contend that the term \"rivalry\" was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.\nPhoenix Suns.\nThe Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA, and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013.\nSacramento Kings.\nThe Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6. The Lakers would win the series in game 7.\nOwnership history.\nHistoric ownership.\nThe NBL's Detroit Gems were founded by Dearborn businessmen Morris Winston and C. King Boring, and began playing in the 1946\u201347 season. After the season, Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen purchased the franchise for $15,000, relocated it to Minnesota, and changed its name from the Gems to the Lakers. General manager Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (two-thirds) interest. After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957. Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri. Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.\nUltimately, the Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short. The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota. Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it. By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners, but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959\u201360 season alone. The NBA's owners originally voted 7\u20131 against the move. When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8\u20130). Aided by Baylor's drawing power, and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.\nShort sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175\u00a0million. Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another. Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5\u00a0million.\nBuss family ownership.\nIn 1979, Cooke, who needed to raise money to fund a costly divorce, sold the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to real estate investor Jerry Buss for $67.5 million, of which the Lakers constituted $16 million. When Buss bought the team, the Lakers had won only one title since moving to Los Angeles. In Buss' 33-plus seasons in charge of the team, the Lakers won ten NBA championships and sixteen conference championships, and missed the playoffs only twice. He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. When he died in 2013, \"Forbes\" valued the team at $1 billion.\nJeanie Buss has been the Lakers' controlling owner since 2013, and runs the team on behalf of the entire family. Jerry Buss' six children hold the family's 66% controlling stake in the team via four related trusts, which are managed by co-trustees Jeanie, Janie, and Johnny Buss as of March 2017. A portion of the Lakers shares were reserved for Buss' ex-wife JoAnn, who died in 2019. The trusts are set up to ensure that the family retains control of the team, as no one sibling can sell their individual stake. However, the team can be sold if four of the six siblings vote in favor. According to Janie Buss Drexel, Jerry Buss' children cannot necessarily pass on their full ownership rights to their own children, meaning that control over the Lakers goes to the \"last man standing\" among the siblings.\nFollowing Jerry Buss' death, day-to-day control over the team was initially split between Jeanie Buss (the official controlling owner and the head of business operations) and Jim Buss (basketball operations). In February 2017, Jeanie fired Jim after several disappointing seasons, which triggered litigation over who controlled the Lakers. In March, the dispute was resolved in Jeanie's favor when the Buss siblings gave her lifetime operational control over the team, \"as long as the family owns the Lakers.\" In October 2024, \"Forbes\" estimated that the Lakers were the third-most-valuable team in basketball, at $7.1 billion.\nAs of 2024, ownership of the Lakers was divided among the following parties: the Buss Family Trusts (66%); Mark Walter (20%); Todd Boehly (7%); Patrick Soon-Shiong (4%), and Ed Roski Jr. (3%). The key changes were as follows:\nMark Walter's acquisition of majority ownership.\nIn June 2025, ESPN reported that the Buss family had agreed to sell majority control to Los Angeles Dodgers majority owner, Mark Walter, at a $10 billion team valuation. As part of the deal, Walter reportedly agreed to allow Jeanie Buss to continue running the team for \"a number of years\". The Buss family will temporarily retain a 15% stake in the team, the minimum stake for a principal team owner under NBA rules. On October 30, 2025, the NBA Board of Governors had unanimously approved the sale.\nFanbase and sponsors.\nJerry Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. In 2008, the team sold out every home game, and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.\nThe Lakers have a jersey patch deal with Bibigo that started during the 2021\u201322 season. Alongside Bibigo, current major sponsors of the Lakers include American Express, Chevron, Nike, and MGM Resorts. The Lakers sold a total of 767,626 tickets for the 2024\u201325 season, ranking 12th in the league.\nGiven the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Crypto.com Arena during home games. Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers' home games. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album \"Mother's Milk\", is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.\nName, logo, and uniforms.\nThe Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". The team's colors are purple, gold and white. The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons.\"\nThe Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times. These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69\u201313, in 1972; the worst record was 17\u201365, in 2016.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nFranchise and NBA records.\nBryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).\nThe Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971\u201372 season, highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984\u201385), and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971\u201372). They also hold records for having (into the 2009\u201310 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31). The 2000\u201301 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15\u20131, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017. The 1971\u201372 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162\u201399). They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36\u20135 in 1971\u201372, then 37\u20134 in both 1976\u201377 and 1979\u201380) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40\u20131 in the 1985\u201386 season.\nHome arenas.\nThe Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena (formerly known as Staples Center), located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games. Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings. The team's lease runs until 2041.\nBefore moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967\u20131999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately southwest of the team's current home. During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Staples Center, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.\nIn the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles. While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.\nMedia.\nFor 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001. Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname. He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions. Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001\u201302 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator. When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it. Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.\nFor the 2011\u201312 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.\nBeginning in the 2009\u201310 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish. KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976\u201377 season until the 2008\u201309 season. Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC. KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.\nOn February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012\u201313 season. The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72895", "revid": "44092845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72895", "title": "Phoenix Suns", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Phoenix, Arizona\nThe Phoenix Suns are an American professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. The Suns compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. They are the only team in their division not to be based in California. The Suns play their home games at the Mortgage Matchup Center.\nThe franchise began play in 1968 as an expansion team. Though their early years were mired in mediocrity, their fortunes changed in the 1970s after partnering Dick Van Arsdale and Alvan Adams with Paul Westphal. The team reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture a championship, the Suns would rebuild around Walter Davis for a majority of the 1980s, until the acquisition of Kevin Johnson in 1988.\nUnder Johnson's leadership, and following the acquisition of perennial All-Star Charles Barkley, the Suns became a consistent playoff team. With contributions from Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle, the Suns reached the playoffs for a franchise-record thirteen consecutive seasons and reached the 1993 NBA Finals. However, the team failed to win the championship and entered into another period of mediocrity until the early 2000s.\nIn 2004, the Suns signed free agent Steve Nash (who had blossomed for the Dallas Mavericks after being traded from Phoenix six years earlier), and returned into playoff contention. With Nash, Shawn Marion, and Amar'e Stoudemire, and under head coach Mike D'Antoni, the Suns became renowned worldwide for their quick, dynamic offense, which led them to tie a franchise record in wins in the 2004\u201305 season. Two more top two Conference placements followed, but the Suns again failed to attain an NBA championship, and were forced into another rebuild.\nAfter ten consecutive seasons without a playoff berth, the Suns reached the 2021 NBA Finals after acquiring Chris Paul, who formed a quartet with their young core of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges, but would eventually lose to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. In 2023, the Suns acquired 13-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant and three-time All-Star Bradley Beal.\nThe Suns own the NBA's fifth-best all-time winning percentage, have the highest winning percentage of any team to have never won an NBA championship, and have the most NBA Finals appearances (three) without a championship. 13 Hall of Famers have played for Phoenix, while two \u2013 Barkley and Nash \u2013 won NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) while playing for the team. Additionally, their Gowdy Award Winning radio announcer Al McCoy is the longest-tenured broadcaster in NBA history.\nHistory.\n1968\u20131976: Team creation and early years.\nThe Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968\u201369 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks from Milwaukee. They were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona, and remained the only one for the better part of 20 years (a Phoenix Roadrunners team played in the World Hockey Association from 1974 to 1977) until the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League relocated from St. Louis in 1988. The Suns played their first 24 seasons at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, called the \"Madhouse on McDowell\", located slightly northwest of downtown Phoenix. The franchise was formed by an ownership group led by Karl Eller, owner of a public enterprise, the investor Donald Pitt, Don Diamond, Bhavik Darji, Marvin Meyer, and Richard L. Bloch. Other owners with a minority stake consisted of entertainers, such as Andy Williams, Bobbie Gentry and Ed Ames. There were many critics, including then-NBA commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, who said that Phoenix was \"too hot,\" \"too small,\" and \"too far away\" to be considered a successful NBA market. This was despite the fact that the Phoenix metropolitan area was growing rapidly, and the Suns would have built-in geographical foes in places like in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.\nAfter continual prodding by Bloch (who became president of the Phoenix Suns), in 1968 the NBA Board of Governors granted franchises to Phoenix and Milwaukee on January 22, 1968, with an entry fee of $2 million. The Suns nickname was among 28,000 entries that were formally chosen in a name-the-team contest sponsored by \"The Arizona Republic\", with the winner awarded $1,000 and season tickets for the inaugural season. Suns was preferred over Scorpions, Rattlers, Thunderbirds, Wranglers, Mavericks, Tumbleweeds, Mustangs and Cougars. Stan Fabe, who owned a commercial printing plant in Tucson, designed the team's first iconic logo for a mere $200.\nIn the 1968 NBA expansion draft, notable Suns pickups were future Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich and Dick Van Arsdale.\nJerry Colangelo, then a player scout, came over from the Chicago Bulls, a franchise formed two years earlier, as the Suns' first general manager at the age of 28, along with Johnny \"Red\" Kerr as head coach. Unlike the first-year success that Colangelo and Kerr had in Chicago, in which the Bulls finished with a first-year expansion record of 33 wins and a playoff berth (plus a Coach of the Year award for Kerr), Phoenix finished its first year at 16\u201366, and finished 25 games out of the final playoff spot.\nBoth Goodrich and Van Arsdale were selected to the All-Star Game in their first season with the Suns. Goodrich returned to his former team, the Lakers, after two seasons with the Suns, but Van Arsdale spent the rest of his playing days as a Sun and a one-time head coach for Phoenix.\nThe Suns' last-place finish that season led to a coin flip for the number-one overall pick for the 1969 NBA draft with the expansion-mate Bucks. Milwaukee won the flip, and the rights to draft UCLA center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor), while Phoenix settled on drafting center Neal Walk from Florida. The 1969\u201370 season posted better results for the Suns, finishing 39\u201343, but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. The next two seasons (1970\u201371 and 1971\u201372), the Suns finished with 48- and 49-win seasons, but did not qualify for the playoffs in either year, and did not reach the playoffs again until 1976. The major draw for the franchise in this era was the dramatic play of Connie Hawkins.\nThis era was also marked by the arrival of longtime Suns play-by-play and Naismith Hall of Fame announcer Al McCoy, hired by Jerry Colangelo before the start of the 1972\u201373 NBA season. Soon locally renowned as \"the Voice of the Suns\", his broadcasts were simulcast on both television and radio from 1972 until 2003 when he became exclusive to the Suns Radio Network. He was still broadcasting Suns home games on radio as of the 2022\u201323 season, having called all three NBA Finals appearances for the franchise (in 1976, 1993, and 2021).\nColangelo called Al McCoy \"the greatest salesman for the game of basketball in our entire state\" and said that \"he had as much to do with the success of the Suns as any player, coach or manager\".\n1975\u20131976: Trip to the NBA Finals.\nThe 1975\u201376 season proved to be a pivotal year for the Suns as they made several key moves, including the off-season trade of former All-Star guard Charlie Scott to the Boston Celtics in exchange for guard Paul Westphal, a member of Boston's 1974 championship team. They also drafted center and eventual fan favorite Alvan Adams from the University of Oklahoma and guard Ricky Sobers of UNLV. The Suns and Buffalo Braves made a midseason trade, with Phoenix sending forward/center John Shumate to Buffalo in exchange for forward Garfield Heard.\nPhoenix had an inconsistent regular season, starting out at 14\u20139 (then the best start in team history), then went 4\u201318 during a stretch where the team sustained several injuries (including Dick Van Arsdale breaking his right arm in a February game). The Suns then went 24\u201313 in the final 37 games to finish 42\u201340, clinching their first playoff spot since 1970. The Suns faced the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, winning the series four games to two, and beat the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference finals, four games to three, to advance to their first NBA Finals.\nThe Suns faced an experienced Celtics team, led by eventual Hall of Famers Dave Cowens, John Havlicek and Jo Jo White. Game five of the 1976 NBA Finals took place at Boston Garden, where the Suns came back from a 22-point first-half deficit to force overtime. Havlicek made what was supposed to be a game-winning basket, but due to fans rushing the floor before time officially expired, officials put one second back on the clock with Phoenix having possession of the ball, but under their own basket. Instead of attempting a desperation heave, the Suns' Westphal intentionally called a timeout that they did not have, a technical foul, giving the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White converted to put them up 112\u2013110. However, this advanced the ball to half-court, and once the Suns had possession, Garfield Heard made a buzzer-beating turnaround jump shot to force a third overtime. The Suns' hard-fought battle was short-lived, as Boston's reserve player Glenn McDonald scored six of his eight points in the third overtime to lead the Celtics to a 128\u2013126 win. Boston eventually won the series in six games, clinching the championship at the Coliseum, defeating Phoenix in game six, 87\u201380.\n1976\u20131988: From success to scandals.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Suns enjoyed several successful seasons including the 1981 Pacific Division title, making the playoffs eight consecutive seasons including an appearance at the 1984 Western Conference finals. Problems arose on and off the court in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office indicted 13 people on drug-related charges, three of whom were active Suns' players James Edwards, Jay Humphries and Grant Gondrezick. These indictments were partially based on testimony from star player Walter Davis, who was given immunity. No defendants ever went to trial: two of the players went into a prosecution diversion program, while another received probation. Nevertheless, the scandal, although now perceived in many respects to be a witch hunt tarnished the reputation of the franchise both nationally and within the community. The scandal did provide an opening for general manager Jerry Colangelo to lead a group that bought the team from its owners for $44 million at the start of the 1987\u201388 season, a record at that time. With a drug scandal and the loss of promising young center Nick Vanos, who was killed in the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, the franchise was in turmoil both on and off the court.\n1988\u20131992: The Kevin Johnson/Tom Chambers/Dan Majerle era.\nThe Suns' luck began to turn around in 1988 with the acquisition of Kevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers, along with Mark West and Tyrone Corbin, for All-Star power forward Larry Nance and Mike Sanders. This was the beginning of a franchise-record 13 consecutive playoff appearances. All-Star Tom Chambers came over from the Seattle SuperSonics (the first unrestricted free agent in NBA history), 1986 second-round draft pick Jeff Hornacek continued to develop, and \"Thunder\" Dan Majerle was drafted with the 14th pick in the 1988 draft. Kurt Rambis was added from the Charlotte Hornets in 1989, and the team upset the Los Angeles Lakers in five games during the playoffs that season, before falling to the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. In 1990\u201391, the Suns went 55\u201327 but lost in the first round to the Utah Jazz, 3\u20131. In 1991\u201392, the Suns went 53\u201329. Having sent four players to the All-Star Game in the previous two seasons (Chambers, Johnson, Hornacek, and Majerle), the Suns swept the San Antonio Spurs in three games in the first round of the 1992 NBA playoffs. The Suns then were defeated in five games to the Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals. The series was punctuated by a game four in which the Suns lost in double overtime 153\u2013151 (the highest-scoring game in NBA playoff history to date). That game was the last Suns game ever played at the Coliseum.\n1992\u20131996: The Charles Barkley era.\nIn 1992, the Suns moved into their new arena in downtown Phoenix, the America West Arena. The arena is occasionally referred to as the \"Purple Palace\" due to its purple seats, one of the Suns' colors. All-Star power forward Charles Barkley was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers for Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang, and Tim Perry. Barkley went on to win the MVP award that 1992\u201393 season.\nIn addition to Barkley, the Suns added key players to their roster, including Danny Ainge and draftees Arkansas center Oliver Miller and forward Richard Dumas (who was actually drafted in 1991 but was suspended for his rookie year for violating the NBA drug policy).\nUnder rookie head coach Paul Westphal, a former Suns assistant and player with the 1976 Suns in the NBA Finals, the Suns won 62 games in 1992\u201393, setting a franchise record. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the eighth-seeded Lakers, coming back from a 0\u20132 deficit in the five-game series. The Suns then eliminated the Spurs and SuperSonics, advancing to the NBA Finals for the second time in franchise history. They eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls, led by eventual Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. The series also included a triple-overtime game in game three, making this and their previous game five in the 1976 series the only triple-overtime games in the history of the NBA Finals. Approximately 300,000 fans braved the 105\u00b0 heat to celebrate the memorable season in the downtown streets of Phoenix after the Finals had ended.\nThe Suns continued to be successful in the regular season, going 178\u201368 during the 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394, and 1994\u201395 seasons. They continued to bolster their roster by adding players such as A.C. Green, Danny Manning, Wesley Person, Wayman Tisdale, and Elliot Perry. Despite a Pacific Division title in 1995, the Suns were eliminated in consecutive Western Conference Semifinal rounds by the Houston Rockets, both series going a full seven games. Manning was rarely at full strength with the Suns, injuring his ACL in 1995 just before the All-Star break. In both years, the Suns led the series by two games at one point (2\u20130 in 1994, 3\u20131 in 1995) only to see the Rockets come back to win each series.\nAt the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Phoenix general manager Bryan Colangelo, the son of Jerry, initiated an eventually costly trade, sending the All-Star Majerle and a first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for John \"Hot Rod\" Williams. Majerle was a fan favorite in Phoenix and in the Suns' locker room. The trade was made to address the Suns' need of a shot-blocking center but Majerle's presence was missed and Williams's production never met expectations due to injuries.\nThe 1995\u201396 season was a disappointing year for the Suns, despite drafting NBA All-Rookie First Team member Michael Finley, who became unavailable for the playoffs due to injury. The Suns posted a 41\u201341 record and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs. Westphal was fired midway through the season and replaced by Fitzsimmons, his third stint as head coach. The office unrest led to turmoil in Barkley's relationship with Jerry Colangelo, who both spurned each other publicly. This led to Barkley being traded to Houston for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry, Mark Bryant, and Chucky Brown. Three of the four players were not with the franchise one year later.\n1996\u20132004: Average times.\nIn the 1996 NBA draft, the Suns used their 15th pick for Santa Clara guard Steve Nash. During his first two seasons in the NBA, he played a supporting role behind star point guards Jason Kidd and Kevin Johnson.\nAfter the Barkley trade, the Suns began the 1996\u201397 season 0\u201313, a franchise record for the worst start. During the 13-game losing streak, Fitzsimmons stepped down as the coach and was replaced by former player Danny Ainge.\nAfter an on-the-court altercation between Ainge and Horry, Horry was traded to the Lakers for former Sun and NBA all-star Cedric Ceballos. Cassell was later traded to Dallas for all-star guard Jason Kidd. With a mostly small lineup, the Suns put together an 11-game win streak that put them in the playoffs as the seventh seed, in a series that almost upset the favored Sonics. Despite the loss in the playoffs, the Suns became one of the few NBA teams to make the playoffs after starting the season 0\u201310 or worse, and one of the few to make the playoffs after experiencing a 10-plus-game losing streak during the regular season.\nWith Kidd starting at point guard, Nash was traded to the Mavericks in June 1998 in exchange for Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick (later used to select Shawn Marion).\nIn the off-season prior to the 2000 NBA season, the Suns traded for perennial All-Star Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, creating the tandem of Kidd and Hardaway called \"Backcourt 2000\". However, the combination of Hardaway and Kidd was never fully realized as Hardaway missed several games during the middle of the 1999\u20132000 season and Kidd broke his ankle going into the playoffs just as Hardaway returned to the court. As the Suns entered the 2000 playoffs, they beat the higher-seeded San Antonio Spurs 3\u20131 in the best-of-five series. The Spurs were without their best player Tim Duncan throughout the whole series. However, even with the return of Kidd in the next round, the Suns fell to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in a 4\u20131 series.\nThe Suns continued to make the playoffs until the 2001\u201302 season when they fell short for the first time in 14 years. That season marked the trade of Jason Kidd to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury. With the resultant high draft pick, the Suns were able to draft Amar'e Stoudemire.\nThe 2002\u201303 campaign saw the emergence of Stoudemire, a graduate of Cypress Creek High School (Orlando, Florida). He became the first high school-drafted player to win the NBA Rookie of the Year for the 2002\u201303 season, during which the Suns posted a record of 44\u201338 and returned to the playoffs. Marbury had a successful individual season, making the All-NBA Third Team and being selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns were eliminated in the first round once again by the San Antonio Spurs; a six-game series with the eventual NBA champions.\nIn the 2003\u201304 season, the Suns finished out of the playoffs with a 29\u201353 record. The Suns made a blockbuster mid-season trade sending Marbury and Hardaway to the New York Knicks for Antonio McDyess and a future first round pick that was later dealt to Denver.\n2004\u20132012: The Steve Nash era.\n2004\u20132006: Nash wins back-to-back MVPs.\nThe beginning of 2004 saw the departure of the face of Suns management since the team's inception, when Jerry Colangelo announced that the Phoenix Suns were to be sold to an investment group headed by San Diego\u2013based business executive and Tucson native Robert Sarver for $401 million. The 2004\u201305 season marked the Suns' return to the NBA's elite, finishing with the best record at 62\u201320, and tying a franchise record set by the 1992\u201393 team. They set a team record for greatest one-season improvement at 33 games. During the off-season, the Suns signed unrestricted free agent All-Star point guard Steve Nash from Dallas, who had formerly played for the Suns at the beginning of his career. Nash went on to win the MVP award that season. Amar'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion were named All-Stars and first-year coach Mike D'Antoni was named NBA Coach of the Year.\nIn the 2005 NBA playoffs, Phoenix was the first seed in the Western Conference. The Suns swept the Memphis Grizzlies, 4\u20130, and defeated the fourth-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the second round, 4\u20132, as Nash forced game six into overtime with a three-pointer in the closing seconds. In the Western Conference finals, the Suns played the San Antonio Spurs, who won the series 4\u20131, ending Phoenix's season, partly due to Joe Johnson missing the first two games of the series. Johnson went on to start the remaining games where he averaged 40 minutes per game and 18.3 points per game. The Suns lost the first two at home, as well as the following game in San Antonio to fall behind 3\u20130 in the series, before winning game four at San Antonio 111\u2013106. The team then lost game five at home 101\u201395 to be eliminated from the playoffs. Stoudemire averaged 37.0 points per game during the series against the Spurs, the highest ever by a player in the Western Conference finals.\nThe 2005\u201306 NBA season began with Stoudemire undergoing microfracture surgery in his knee on October 18, 2005, missing all but three games that season. Shooting guard Joe Johnson also demanded a sign-and-trade deal to the Atlanta Hawks, in which the Suns got Boris Diaw and two future first-round picks. Other acquisitions included Raja Bell and Kurt Thomas. Despite the turnover in players, the Suns again won the Pacific Division, going 54\u201328 and capturing the second seed in the Western Conference. Nash was awarded a second consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the second point-guard, after Magic Johnson, to win the award in consecutive seasons. Also, Diaw was named NBA Most Improved Player.\nThe Suns began the 2006 Western Conference Playoffs as favorites against the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning the first game in Phoenix, they found themselves trailing in the series 3\u20131 after impressive performances by Lakers' shooting guard Kobe Bryant. However, the Suns went on to win three straight games. With 7:33 left in the fifth game, Suns guard Raja Bell grabbed Bryant around the neck and threw him down as the Lakers' star drove to the basket. Bell earned a technical foul, his second of the game, and an automatic ejection. The Suns took game six in overtime, their first overtime win all season, despite 50 points from Bryant and Bell out serving a one-game suspension with last-second help from mid-season acquisition Tim Thomas. On their home court, the Suns won game seven 121\u201390, eliminating the Lakers for the first time since 1993. The Suns are 1 of 9 teams in NBA history to win a playoff series after being behind 3\u20131.\nIn the second round, the Suns faced the Los Angeles Clippers. The series was played closely, with both teams trading games on each other's courts. The series was 2\u20132 and the Suns were behind in game five before coming back and won in double overtime. After a game six loss, the Suns won the series in the seventh game on their home court at US Airways Center, winning by a margin of 20 with an NBA record fifteen 3-point FGs on May 22, 2006.\nThey went on to play the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference finals as underdogs. The Suns took game one in Dallas by a single point and their May 30 victory in game four marked the most wins for the franchise in a Conference finals series since the 1993 season. The Suns lost games five and six by a combined 25 points and were eliminated from the series on June 3.\n2006\u20132008: \"Seven seconds or less\".\nUnder coach D'Antoni, the Suns popularized the fast break offense known as \"7 seconds or less\", which was later published in a book written by \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Jack McCallum. Though criticized for a supposed lack of defense, the Suns specialized an efficient offense designed to quickly get off shots that made regrouping on defense difficult for the opposing team.\nThe Suns entered the 2006\u201307 season aiming to win the first championship in franchise history. From November 20 to December 22, the Suns posted a 15-game win streak, followed almost immediately with a 17-game win streak from December 29 to January 28. On March 14, the 49\u201314 Suns met the 52\u201310 Dallas Mavericks in a match-up where both teams were fighting for the top seed in the Western conference and Nash was going for his third consecutive MVP award against Dirk Nowitzki. Though the Suns won the game in double overtime, the Mavericks would finish with the West's top seed at 67\u201315, and Nowitzki would narrowly win the MVP award ahead of Nash.\nWhile the Mavericks were upset in the first round by the eight-seed Golden State Warriors, the 61\u201321 Suns defeated Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in five games in the opening round of the playoffs. This set up a rematch of the 2005 Western Conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs. The series saw the Spurs defeat the Suns in six games, in what many called \"the real finals\" of the 2006\u201307 season. The Spurs went on to win the championship that year.\nOn June 6, former TNT TV analyst and NBA three-point specialist, Steve Kerr, was appointed Suns' general manager and president of basketball operations. Kerr was also a part of the Sarver-led investment group that purchased the franchise from Jerry Colangelo. His first off-season signing was former Orlando Magic small forward Grant Hill on a one-year $1.8 million deal with a player option for a second season at $2 million. Hill, who was previously considered injury-prone, played in the majority of games over the next four seasons as a starter.\nThe Suns finished 55\u201327 on the season, two games behind the Lakers who won the division. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Suns lost to the Spurs in five games, the first time they did not advance past the first round in the D'Antoni-Nash era. Some have attributed this to the mid-season acquisition of aging former MVP Shaquille O'Neal for four-time All Star Shawn Marion. Though O'Neal was brought in as a physical presence to match with the likes of the Spurs' Tim Duncan, the move all but ended their fast-paced offense which had brought them to the cusp of a Finals appearance.\nOn May 11, 2008, Suns' head coach Mike D'Antoni left the team and signed with the New York Knicks.\n2008\u20132010: Ups and downs.\nOn June 9, 2008, Terry Porter was named head coach of the Phoenix Suns, succeeding Mike D'Antoni. Porter was an assistant coach of the Detroit Pistons when he was let go after the Pistons were eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the 2008 NBA Eastern Conference finals. During the off-season, the Suns had difficulties signing free agents because of being over the luxury tax. They made attempts to sign a backup point guard, Tyronn Lue; however, he decided to sign with the Bucks for more money. The Suns selected Robin Lopez (15th overall pick out of Stanford) in the 2008 NBA draft and acquired Goran Dragi\u0107, who was originally picked by the rival San Antonio Spurs.\nOn February 16, 2009, the Suns fired Porter and he was succeeded by Alvin Gentry. The Suns were expected to make the transition back to the up-tempo style basketball nicknamed the \"7 Seconds or Less\" or \"Run and Gun\" style. On February 18, Gentry began his head coaching tenure with a 140\u2013100 win over the Clippers at home. Six Suns players scored in double digits, led by Leandro Barbosa's 24 points. The Suns led by as much as 50 points during the game and were without their swingman Jason Richardson who was serving a one-game suspension. However, this offense cost them their defense, allowing over 107 points per game, 27th in the league. The Suns scored 140 in the next two games. On February 20, Amar'e Stoudemire underwent eye surgery and was out for eight weeks. They went 18\u201313 under Gentry in the last 31 games. At the end of the season, the Suns missed the playoffs with a 46\u201336 record.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Suns played a far more balanced style of basketball and finished with a 54\u201328 record. The Suns advanced to the NBA's Western Conference finals, eliminating the Portland Trail Blazers in six games and the San Antonio Spurs in four games, including an explosive performance by Goran Dragi\u0107 in game three against the Spurs, scoring 23 points in the fourth quarter. The Suns faced the Lakers in the Western Conference finals but lost in six games.\nOn June 15, 2010, Kerr resigned as general manager of the Suns and opted to return as an analyst for TNT effective June 30, 2010. In the wake of Kerr's decision to leave the club, senior vice president of basketball operations David Griffin told managing partner Robert Sarver he did not want to be a candidate to replace Kerr and left when his contract expired on June 30. The last moves of both Steve Kerr and David Griffin were drafting players Gani Lawal and Dwayne Collins with the second-round draft picks that they had in the 2010 NBA draft.\n2010\u20132012: Slow decline without Amar'e.\nThe Suns attempted to re-sign Amar'e Stoudemire in the 2010 free agency period with a five-year contract for around $95 million, with $71 million guaranteed, and the rest of his salary coming only if certain conditions were held, such as getting guaranteed 4th and 5th-season money if he remained healthy enough to meet those conditions. Stoudemire instead signed with the New York Knicks for $100 million.\nThe Suns hired player agent Lon Babby as president of basketball operations. The team then paid over $80 million to acquire Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick to not only replace Stoudemire but also add bench depth. On August 5, 2010, the Suns hired Lance Blanks as general manager. On December 19, 2010, the Suns acquired Vince Carter, Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus, and Marcin Gortat from the Orlando Magic, along with a low draft pick and cash considerations. For this acquisition, the Suns traded Jason Richardson, Earl Clark, and the recently acquired Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu. On February 24, 2011, the Suns acquired point guard Aaron Brooks, trading first round (lottery-protected) draft pick and point guard Goran Dragi\u0107 to the Houston Rockets. The Suns ended the 2010\u201311 season with a losing record and missed the playoffs.\nIn the 2011 NBA draft, the Suns used their 13th pick on Markieff Morris, a 6' 10\" power forward from the Kansas Jayhawks. Markieff is the twin brother of Marcus Morris, who played together for three years in Kansas. In the 2012 NBA draft, the Suns used their 13th pick to select Kendall Marshall, a 6' 4\" point guard from the North Carolina Tar Heels. Marshall was a prolific passer in his two seasons at North Carolina; setting the ACC and North Carolina season assist records, along with winning the Bob Cousy Award in his sophomore season with the Tar Heels.\n2012\u20132015: Pre\u2013Booker and struggle years.\n2012: The departure of Steve Nash.\nDuring the 2012 free agency period, the Suns traded Steve Nash to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for first-round picks in 2013 and 2015, as well as second-round picks in 2013 and 2014. After the trade, the Suns then re-acquired point guard Goran Dragi\u0107 from Houston, signed Minnesota Timberwolves forward Michael Beasley, and claimed Houston forward Luis Scola off amnesty waivers while also using the same amnesty clause (as codified in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement) to waive Josh Childress. They also did a three-way trade with the New Orleans Hornets and the Timberwolves by trading Robin Lopez and Hakim Warrick to the Hornets and a 2014 second-rounder to the Timberwolves in exchange for Wesley Johnson, a top 14-protected future first-rounder and the rights to Brad Miller and Jerome Dyson. The latter two players' rights were later waived and the Suns then signed Jermaine O'Neal for one year. The Suns also signed P. J. Tucker based on his performance with the Suns' Summer League team. On September 20, it was announced that Channing Frye had dilated cardiomyopathy and as a result, he missed the entire 2012\u201313 season, although he sometimes made special appearances to do the pre-game show for local Suns games with Tom Leander and Tom Chambers. On January 12, 2013, the Suns became the fourth-fastest NBA team to win 2,000 games with a 97\u201381 road victory against the Chicago Bulls, which also marked the last victory for Alvin Gentry as head coach for the Suns. On January 18, 2013, the day after a loss that broke a 24-home-game winning streak against the Milwaukee Bucks, Gentry agreed to leave the Phoenix Suns organization. Two days later, player development coach Lindsey Hunter was named interim head coach role for the remainder of the season. A few days later, assistant head coaches Dan Majerle and Elston Turner had also resigned from their positions. On February 21, 2013, the Suns had traded their 2013 second-round pick to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Marcus Morris. The next day, the Suns traded point guard Sebastian Telfair to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Iranian center Hamed Haddadi and a 2014 second-round pick. The Suns ended their first post-Steve Nash season with a 25\u201357 win\u2013loss record, their second-worst record in franchise history behind only their inaugural season.\n2013: The arrival of Ryan McDonough.\nOn April 22, 2013, it was announced that the Suns had fired general manager Lance Blanks. On May 7, 2013, former Celtics assistant general manager Ryan McDonough was announced as the new general manager of the Suns. On May 26, 2013, the Suns hired Jeff Hornacek as their head coach to replace interim head coach Lindsey Hunter. The team also started the new season with new modified logos, replacing most of the purple on their logos with black, although purple would still be found on their jerseys.\nIn the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Suns selected Ukrainian center Alex Len from Maryland with their 5th pick and power forward Alex Oriakhi from Missouri with their 57th pick. Although the Suns were expected to have a poor season, they began the season with a 19\u201311 record. Eric Bledsoe then went down against the Los Angeles Clippers with a torn meniscus and missed the following 33 games. The Suns went 17\u201316 during his absence led by Goran Dragi\u0107, keeping Phoenix in the playoff race with the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks. At 47\u201332, while Dallas and Memphis were both 48\u201332, Phoenix lost against both teams before they defeated the Sacramento Kings to finish the season 48\u201334. Dallas finished 49\u201333 and Memphis finished 50\u201332, resulting in Memphis finishing with the seventh seed, Dallas with the eighth, and Phoenix out of the playoffs.\nDuring the 2014 NBA draft, the Suns drafted sophomore forward T. J. Warren from NC State, Canadian freshman point guard Tyler Ennis from Syracuse, Serbian shooting guard Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107, and senior center-power forward Alec Brown from Wisconsin-Green Bay. After trying to obtain players like LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh, and losing Channing Frye to the Orlando Magic, the Suns decided to sign-and-trade for Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas under a four-year contract worth $27 million in exchange for Alex Oriakhi, using a $7 million traded-player exception. On September 24, 2014, the Suns and Eric Bledsoe agreed on a five-year contract worth $70 million. A couple of days after, on September 29, 2014, they extended both Markieff and Marcus Morris to four-year deals that combine to $52 million, with Markieff earning $32 million and Marcus getting the remaining $20 million. Right before the trade deadline on February 19, 2015, the Suns made moves to change the roster. After demanding a trade due to lingering frustrations with the front office and direction of the team, Goran Dragi\u0107 and his brother Zoran were traded by the Suns to the Miami Heat for Danny Granger and Miami's 2017 and 2021 first round picks in a three-team trade with the New Orleans Pelicans. Immediately after the trade, the Suns replaced Dragi\u0107 by trading for Milwaukee Bucks guard Brandon Knight, sending Tyler Ennis and Miles Plumlee to Milwaukee and the Lakers' 2015 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers. Isaiah Thomas was then traded to the Boston Celtics for Marcus Thornton and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 first round pick.\n2015\u2013present: The Devin Booker era.\n2015\u20132020: The arrival of Devin Booker and further struggle years.\nIn the 2015 NBA draft, the Suns drafted Kentucky shooting guard Devin Booker with the 13th pick. He was the youngest player drafted at the time by the Suns at 18-years-old and debuted two days before his 19th birthday against the Dallas Mavericks. On July 1, 2015, the Suns retained the rights of Brandon Knight under an offer similar to that of Eric Bledsoe's, and signed Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler to a four-year deal worth $52 million. A day later, the Suns traded Markieff's brother Marcus Morris, Reggie Bullock, and Danny Granger to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for their 2020 second-round selection. However, star player Eric Bledsoe sustained a season-ending injury on December 26, 2015.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Suns relieved Jeff Hornacek of his duties as head coach. Former NBA player Earl Watson took on interim head coaching duties. The Suns traded the disgruntled Markieff Morris on February 19, 2016, to the Washington Wizards for Kris Humphries, DeJuan Blair, and the Wizards' first-round pick in the 2016 NBA draft. On March 14, 2016, the Suns were eliminated from playoff contention for a sixth straight season making it the longest drought in franchise history surpassing the five straight misses from the 1970\u201371 NBA season to the 1974\u201375 NBA season. However, rookie Devin Booker went from being a sixth-man off-the-bench player for Kentucky to future impact player after the injuries to Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight. He earned the team's first NBA All-Rookie Team honors since Amar'e Stoudemire back in 2003. Earl Watson officially became the full-time head coach on April 19, 2016, with his new assistant coaches Jay Triano, former Suns player Tyrone Corbin, Marlon Garnett, and Scott Duncan replacing most of the assistant coaches from the previous season. During the 2016 NBA draft, the Suns drafted the 18-year-old Bosnian-born Croatian forward-center Dragan Bender, Washington power forward Marquese Chriss, and Kentucky point guard Tyler Ulis; Chriss was acquired by trading the Suns' 13th and 28th selections, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and the Pistons' 2020 second-round pick to the Sacramento Kings. During the 2016 free agency period, the Suns regained former players and fan-favorites Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa under new deals.\nWhile the Suns ended the 2016\u201317 season with only a slight improvement from their previous record despite the return of Eric Bledsoe, Devin Booker continued to improve in his second season with the team, leading the team in points scored at 22.1 per game. Marquese Chriss was also named to the All-Rookie Second Team that season. In the 2017 NBA draft, the Suns dropped to the 4th pick in the draft and selected Josh Jackson from the University of Kansas. On October 22, 2017, head coach Earl Watson was fired after a 0\u20133 start that included two losses of 40+ point deficits, which led to Jay Triano being promoted to interim head coach. On November 7, Bledsoe was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Greg Monroe and a protected first- and second-round draft pick. The Suns ended the season with the second-worst record in franchise history at 21\u201361. After the season concluded, the Suns let go of interim head coach Triano and hired Igor Koko\u0161kov as the team's new head coach. The Suns earned their first no. 1 pick in the 2018 NBA draft lottery after ending the season with the league-worst record that year. With the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, Phoenix selected Deandre Ayton. They would also trade up into the top 10 that year to take Mikal Bridges with the 10th pick from the Philadelphia 76ers, a draft pick the Suns already had from the Steve Nash trade before trading the pick to the 76ers in the Brandon Knight trade. In the off-season, Devin Booker signed a 5-year $158 million contract extension with the Suns.\nBefore the start of the regular season and during preseason on October 8, 2018, owner Robert Sarver decided to relieve Ryan McDonough from the general manager position, and named vice president of basketball operations James Jones and assistant general manager Trevor Bukstein as the interim general managers. A highlight of the season was when a planned three-way trade with the Washington Wizards and Memphis Grizzlies fell apart through miscommunication of the players involved and being sent in the planned deal.\nThe Suns would once again have another losing season as they missed the playoffs for the ninth straight season. At the end of the season, the Suns made James Jones the team's permanent general manager, with co-interim general manager Trevor Bukstein returning to his prior assistant general manager role. When the season came to an end, the coaching staff, including head coach Igor Koko\u0161kov, were fired on April 23, 2019. Former New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans head coach and Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach Monty Williams was hired as the team's new head coach on May 3, and completed the rest of the new coaching staff on June 26. Phoenix finished with a 19\u201363 record, the worst in the Western Conference. Ayton made the All-Rookie First Team. The Suns had the third odds in the lottery but landed the sixth pick.\nDuring the day of the 2019 NBA draft, the Suns agreed to deal T. J. Warren to the Indiana Pacers and their second-round pick (which would become KZ Okpala) to the Miami Heat for cash considerations. During the draft, they agreed to swap their sixth pick (which would become Jarrett Culver), trading down for the Minnesota Timberwolves' 11th pick (which would become Cameron Johnson) and Dario \u0160ari\u0107, and also agreeing to deal the Milwaukee Bucks' future first-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Aron Baynes and the draft rights to point guard Ty Jerome, as well as agree to a deal with undrafted Jalen Lecque. In the off-season they signed veteran point guard Ricky Rubio to a three-year deal, and re-signed Oubre to a two-year deal, signed Frank Kaminsky and Cheick Diallo.\nThe Suns played the Kings in their season opener on October 23, 2019, and won 124\u201395. On October 24, Ayton was suspended 25 games for failing a drug test. However, the Suns continued to play well, going 11\u201312 over their next 23 games.\nOn January 22, 2020, Larry Fitzgerald purchased a minority stake in the Suns, becoming the second active (at the time) NFL player with an NBA ownership share.\nOn February 13, 2020, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that Devin Booker had been named as a reserve in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, marking the first time since Steve Nash in 2012 that a Phoenix Suns player had been selected to the game. This later selection came as a result of an injury to Portland's Damian Lillard, who was unable to participate. Following the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Suns were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. They went undefeated in the bubble, finishing 8\u20130, but failed to qualify for the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season. They finished the season with a record of 34\u201339.\n2020\u20132022: The arrival of Chris Paul and return to the playoffs.\nIn the 2020 off-season, the Suns traded Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, Jalen Lecque, Ty Jerome, and a future first-round draft pick for 10-time All-Star, 10-time All-NBA, and nine-time All-Defensive point guard Chris Paul from the Oklahoma City Thunder. Phoenix also received small forward Abdel Nader. Both Devin Booker and Paul were named All-Star reserves for the 2020\u201321 NBA season. The Suns went on to have a 51\u201321 record (2nd best in the entire NBA), clinching the second seed in the Western Conference while head coach Monty Williams was named NBCA Coach of the Year. The Suns made the playoffs for the first time since 2010. The Suns faced the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, defeating them in six games to win their first playoff series since 2010. The Suns then went on to sweep the Denver Nuggets, advancing the team to the Western Conference finals. Prior to the Western Conference finals, Paul entered into the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocols and missed the first two games of the series. On June 30, 2021, the Suns won the conference finals in six games against the Los Angeles Clippers to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993 after a 41-point performance by Paul. The Suns won the first two games of the Finals but ultimately lost the series 4\u20132 to the Milwaukee Bucks, led by two-time regular season MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who would be eventually named Finals MVP. Despite the loss, Booker set the NBA record for the most points scored by a player in his debut postseason. Paul was awarded All-NBA Second Team honors for his performance that season although he came up short in the finals. He was also the first player to lose all four playoff series in which his team led 2\u20130.\nOn July 29, 2021, the day of the 2021 NBA draft, the Suns traded guard Jevon Carter and the 29th pick to the Brooklyn Nets for guard Landry Shamet. In August, the Suns re-signed free agent center Frank Kaminsky and also signed veteran center JaVale McGee to a one-year deal. Starting point guard Chris Paul was re-signed to a partially guaranteed four-year deal.\nAfter beginning the 2021\u201322 season with a 1\u20133 record, the Suns rattled off a winning streak that was capped off on December 2 with a 114\u2013103 victory over the Detroit Pistons, which gave the Suns their 18th consecutive win to best the team's previous record of 17 games set in the 2006-07 season. On February 3, 2022, starting guards Devin Booker and Chris Paul were selected to reserve spots for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. On February 10, the Suns traded second-year big man Jalen Smith and a second-round pick to the Indiana Pacers to reacquire wing Torrey Craig and acquired guard Aaron Holiday from the Washington Wizards for cash considerations at the NBA trade deadline. On March 10, the Suns became the first team that season to clinch a playoff berth after defeating the Miami Heat 111\u201390 on the road to claim their 53rd win. On March 24, the Suns clinched the NBA's top overall record with a 140\u2013130 victory over the Denver Nuggets. In the 79th game of the season, the Suns set a new franchise record for wins with a 121\u2013110 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers to tally their 63rd win on April 5, eliminating the Lakers from playoff contention in the process. The Suns finished the regular season with a record of 64\u201318 with Devin Booker finishing 4th in MVP voting. In the first round of the 2022 NBA playoffs, the Suns would defeat the New Orleans Pelicans in six games, before falling to the Dallas Mavericks in seven games in the second round despite holding a 2\u20130 series lead.\n2022\u20132025: Transition of ownership and the arrival of Kevin Durant.\nOn September 13, 2022, the NBA fined owner Robert Sarver $10 million and suspended him for one year after an independent investigation determined that he used the \"N-word\" multiple times in public, as well as conduct that included \"unequal treatment of female employees; sex-related statements and conduct; and harsh treatment of employees that on occasion constituted bullying.\" Both current and former NBA players, including LeBron James, Suns player Chris Paul, and Draymond Green, said that the punishment was too lenient, with Green requesting for a league vote to terminate Sarver as a league owner. On September 21, Sarver announced he would begin the process of selling both the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury. Sarver eventually accepted the sale of both teams to United Wholesale Mortgage's CEO Mat Ishbia and his brother Justin for a record-high $4 billion purchasing price on December 20, 2022, with the move being made official on February 7, 2023. At 43 years old, Mat Ishbia became the second youngest team owner in league history.\nDuring Ishbia's first few days of ownership, the Suns acquired 13-time All-Star and four-time scoring champion Kevin Durant, along with reacquiring T. J. Warren, from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap. Durant had previously requested a trade during the 2022 offseason, with Phoenix being listed as one of Durant's preferred landing spots. Following the acquisition of Durant, the Suns' odds to win the NBA Finals surged from +1800 to +450 per BetMGM, trailing only the Boston Celtics at +350.\nIn the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Suns would defeat the Los Angeles Clippers in five games. In the second round of the 2023 playoffs against the Denver Nuggets, the Suns lost the first two games to Denver, as Chris Paul suffered a groin injury in game 2. The Suns came back to win the next two games at home without Chris Paul, as Devin Booker and Kevin Durant became the first duo in NBA playoff history to each record 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in consecutive playoff games. However, after dropping game 5 in Denver, Phoenix went on to lose the series to the Nuggets in six games, as they trailed by 30 points at halftime in an elimination game at home for the second straight season. Following their series loss to the Nuggets, the Suns dismissed head coach Monty Williams after four seasons with the team. Williams finished his Phoenix tenure with a record of 194\u2013115 (.628) in the regular season and 27\u201319 in the playoffs. Subsequently, the Suns hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach on June 6, 2023.\nOn June 24, Phoenix acquired veteran guard Bradley Beal from the Washington Wizards in a three-team deal also involving the Indiana Pacers, with the Suns sending Chris Paul, Landry Shamet, five future second-round picks, four future pick swaps and cash considerations to Washington and one future second-round pick to Indiana. Just before the start of the regular season on September 27, the Suns traded Deandre Ayton and rookie Toumani Camara to the Portland Trail Blazers in a three-way deal that sent 7-time All-Star Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for Milwaukee shooting guard Grayson Allen and Portland center Jusuf Nurki\u0107. After starting the 2023\u201324 season with multiple injuries and a 14\u201315 record, the Suns went 35\u201318 the remainder of the season and were one of five teams to rank in the top 10 offensively and defensively during that span. They finished with a 49\u201333 record, securing the sixth seed in the 2024 NBA playoffs and clinching their fourth consecutive playoff appearance. However, they were promptly swept in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves, marking the first time the Suns were swept in a playoff series in 25 years. On May 9, 2024, Vogel was fired after one season with Phoenix. Two days later, the Suns hired Mike Budenholzer, who previously coached the Milwaukee Bucks and defeated the Suns in the 2021 NBA Finals, as their 22nd head coach in team history.\nThe Suns opened the 2024\u201325 season with the highest payroll in the league, with hefty salaries coming from their big three of Booker, Durant, and Beal. Phoenix opened out to an 8\u20131 start, but following a slump where the team went 6\u201316, coach Budenholzer elected to remove Beal and Nurki\u0107 from the starting lineup on January 6, 2025. Nurkic saw his playing time drastically reduced, and he was traded a month later. On February 3, Booker surpassed Walter Davis to become the Suns' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. With Phoenix's postseason hopes dwindling, Durant injured his ankle on March 30 in a game against the Houston Rockets that kept him out for the remainder of the season. The Suns lost nine of their last 10 games to end the season, finishing with a 36\u201346 record and the 11th spot in the Western Conference, failing to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2019\u201320 season. Shortly after the season concluded, Budenholzer was fired, and owner Mat Ishbia described the season as a failure, with intentions of creating a cultural reset of the franchise.\n2025\u2013present: Post Kevin Durant era.\nFollowing a 2024\u201325 season marked by financial mismanagement and on-court failures\u2014including a bloated payroll, the benching of star players, a missed playoff berth, and the firing of the head coach\u2014the Suns underwent a major front-office overhaul. General manager James Jones was replaced by Brian Gregory, and Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach Jordan Ott was named the Suns' head coach for the 2025\u201326 campaign. With an aging roster, the organization shifted its focus to building a younger, more athletic team around Devin Booker. On July 6, 2025, the Suns traded Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets in a seven-team deal, receiving guards Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks, the draft rights to center Khaman Maluach, forward Rasheer Fleming, guard Koby Brea, and a 2026 second-round pick in return. Phoenix also acquired center Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Vasa Mici\u0107, the draft rights to Liam McNeeley, and a 2029 first-round pick. On July 16, ten days after trading Durant, the Suns bought out the final two years of Bradley Beal's contract, clearing the way for him to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. Hindered by a massive salary and a no-trade clause, Beal\u2019s acquisition is widely considered one of the most detrimental moves in franchise history, as Phoenix failed to win a single playoff game in two seasons with Booker, Durant, and Beal together. With Durant and Beal gone, the Suns committed to Booker, signing him to a two-year, $145 million maximum extension through the 2029\u201330 season, setting a record for the highest annual extension salary in NBA history.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Suns. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Phoenix Suns seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nHome arenas.\nThe Suns played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum from 1968 until 1992. In 1992, they moved to America West Arena, referred to as \"The Purple Palace\". Although not without controversy, eventually the Phoenix City Council and the Suns Organization together completed renovation on the arena in 2021.\nUniform history.\n1968\u20131973: Original uniforms.\nAfter the NBA had awarded a franchise to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1968, local designers chose purple and orange as the main colors for the Phoenix Suns' uniforms. The original uniforms featured a futuristic \"Phoenix\" wordmark in front plus block numbers and letters in orange with purple and white trim. An orange sunburst logo was added on the sides of the shorts.\n1973\u20131992: Western look.\nThe Suns tweaked their uniforms for the 1973\u201374 season. Other than the basic template itself, only the lettering and numbers were changed from the original uniforms. The \"Phoenix\" wordmark and numbers were modified to a Western-style font, with a few changes to the treatment of the player's name at the back.\n1992\u20132000: Streaking Sun look.\nIn time for the move to the America West Arena for the 1992\u201393 season, the Suns overhauled their look. The home white and road purple uniforms now feature the \"Streaking Sun\" logo in the chest with \"Suns\" on top and the number at the bottom. The shorts feature the word \"Phoenix\" in orange letters written diagonally on the left leg. Prior to the 1994\u201395 season, the Suns introduced a black alternate uniform featuring the same template.\n2000\u20132013: Seven Seconds or Less look.\nBefore the 2000\u201301 season, the Suns changed to a more simplistic uniform style. The home white uniform had the word \"Suns\", the numbers in purple with orange trim, and purple side stripes. The road purple uniform had the word \"Phoenix\" and the numbers in white with orange trim along with grey side stripes. An orange alternate uniform, with the abbreviation \"PHX\" and the numbers in white with purple trim along with grey side stripes, arrived prior to the 2003\u201304 season. All three uniforms featured the updated \"Streaking Sun\" alternate logo on the stripes while the players' numbers were seen on the left leg until the 2005\u201306 season.\n2013\u20132017: Updated Streaking Sun look.\nThe Suns overhauled their uniforms anew prior to the 2013\u201314 season. The look was inspired from their previous uniform designs. The home white uniforms featured \"Suns\" in orange with black trim along with black numbers, orange streaks and grey and orange sunbursts. The purple road uniforms featured \"Phoenix\" in white with orange trim along with orange numbers, white streaks and black, grey and orange sunbursts. The orange alternate uniforms (sleeved from 2013 to 2015; sleeveless from 2015 to 2017) featured \"Suns\" in white with black trim along with black numbers, white streaks and black and dark orange sunbursts.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, the Suns added a grey-sleeved alternate uniform. The uniform has \"Phoenix\" and the numbers in black with orange trim. The \"Phoenix\" wordmark was a callback to the \"Western\" look of the 1970s and 1980s. A black alternate uniform was also added prior to the 2015\u201316 season. The black uniforms featured \"PHX\" in black with white trim along with white numbers and purple and orange trim.\nSince 2017: Switch to Nike.\nWhen the NBA switched to Nike beginning with the 2017\u201318 season, the Suns drastically revamped their uniforms. Gone was the modernized \"Streaking Sun\" and the sunburst of the previous uniforms, and the Suns returned to a more simplified design. Purple also returned as a prominent color. The home-and-away designations were eliminated and in its place were the white \"Association\" uniform, the primary color \"Icon\" uniform, the secondary color \"Statement\" uniform and the annual \"City\" uniform.\nThe Suns' \"Association\" uniforms featured \"Suns\" in orange and the numbers in purple. The purple \"Icon\" uniforms featured \"Phoenix\" in grey and the numbers in orange. The black \"Statement\" uniform featured \"PHX\" in grey and the numbers in orange. All three uniforms have the \"Streaking Sun\" logo on the beltline.\nStarting with the 2019\u201320 season, the Suns replaced the black uniform with a new orange uniform, featuring the \"Streaking Sun\" logo in front, the numbers in white, and the \"PHX\" abbreviation on the beltline. They wore the orange \"Statement\" uniform until the 2021\u201322 season, after which the Suns released a black \"Statement\" uniform with design elements inspired by the popular \"City\" uniforms worn in the 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 seasons (see below).\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Suns updated their purple \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" uniforms, revisiting the 1990s \"Streaking Sun\" look. The set featured the \"Suns\" wordmark inside the \"Streaking Sun\" instead of above the logo unlike its 1990s predecessors. Grey accents were eliminated, and orange drop shadows on the numbers were added.\nThe Suns unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform for the 2025\u201326 season. The design remained black with purple and orange trim, but featured a purple/orange \"Streaking Sun\" gradient silhouette that runs through the shorts. The \"Phoenix\" wordmark was written diagonally with the chest numbers on the bottom left, and the \"Suns\" diagonal wordmark was placed on the right leg.\nLos Suns special uniforms.\nThe Suns started wearing special \"Noche Latina\" uniforms in 2007 to commemorate the Latin American fanbase. The 2007 edition used the home white uniform template with the flag of Latin American countries substituting for the orange stripes. Starting in 2008, the Suns began to wear a modified version of their orange alternate uniforms with \"Los Suns\" in front, which they kept until 2013.\nDuring the 2010 NBA playoffs, the Suns wore their \"Los Suns\" uniforms on Cinco de Mayo for Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs. Sports reporter Dave Zirin called the \"Los Suns\" action an \"unprecedented political statement by a sports team.\" The move was also widely reported to be a protest of an Arizona illegal-immigration law enacted in April.\nAfter the 2013 rebrand, the Suns wore a black sleeved uniform with \"Los Suns\" in white with orange trim along with Latin-inspired accents at the back. This lasted only one season, however, as the Suns introduced a modified version of their purple uniforms in 2015, albeit with \"Los Suns\" in place of \"Phoenix\". This version lasted until 2017.\nFor 2018, Nike added a fourth uniform option, the \"City\" uniform. The Suns used the occasion to unveil a new version of the \"Los Suns\" uniform, albeit using only purple, grey and white. Unlike in previous years where the \"Los Suns\" uniform was worn only during the month of March, this uniform was first used during the month of January. For 2019, the \"Los Suns\" uniform added orange trim on the letters and stylized black piping while moving the front numbers to the left chest. It also featured a recolored Arizona flag in Suns colors on the shorts and \"SOMOS PHX\" slogan above the uniform tag. The 2020 version kept the same template albeit with black as the base color and purple as the trim color.\nCity Edition: \"The Valley\".\nThe 2020\u201321 Nike NBA Suns City Edition artwork makes tribute to the Phoenix valley region. The uniform features a black base, and pixelated mountain view sunset with an inspired rainbow of yellow, orange, red and purple. The image is based on Camelback Mountain located in North Phoenix. Camelback Mountain is a geographical identifier of The Valley, which has been the nickname of the Phoenix valley for decades. The front of the uniform reads \"The Valley\" in custom script lettering across a sunset themed rainbow over Camelback Mountain.\nEven though the NBA commemorated the league's 75th anniversary by having teams release mashup designs of previous uniforms for the 2021\u201322 \"City\" edition, the Suns elected to keep their \"The Valley\" uniforms for another season. These uniforms would also return for the 2025\u201326 season, as part of the NBA's \"City Remixed\" uniform program.\nA Spanish-language edition (\"El Valle\") served as the \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season. The predominantly grey uniform with sunrise number gradients and purple stripes pay tribute to the city's Chicano fanbase.\n\"The Valley\"-themed \"City\" uniform returned for the 2024\u201325 season, incorporating the classic \"Western\" font the team used from 1973 to 1992, and was heavily based on the uniforms used in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game held in Phoenix.\nCity Edition: Salute to Native American Culture.\nThe Suns went with a Native American motif for their 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, featuring a turquoise base, black letters, red trim, and indigenous art designs on the striping.\nMascot.\nThe Gorilla -- 'GO'.\nBarring a brief, early attempt involving a sunflower costume, the Suns had no official mascot for the first 11 seasons of their existence. This changed when a messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, delivered a telegram at Veterans Memorial Coliseum dressed as a gorilla. As he began to leave, Coliseum security suggested he do a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout. The fans loved it, as did the messenger, Henry Rojas, who kept coming to games until he was officially invited to be part of the team. Nicknamed \"Go\", the Gorilla has a fictional background story consisting of coming from the Banana Republic and earning an education at Furman University.\nAs Rojas's announced retirement from the role following the 1987-88 NBA season, the Suns held open auditions and try-outs to find a new Gorilla. Former Arizona State University national champion gymnast Bob Woolf immediately stood out with his more acrobatic, aerial take on the character, particularly impressing evaluators when he jumped off a trampoline onto a basketball hoop, pulled himself atop the raised fixture, and danced high above the rim. Woolf took over the role, introducing the Gorilla's signature slam dunk routines, backflips, and slapstick during games, such as running the stadium stairs to the Rocky theme. He became the first NBA mascot to incorporate Evel Knievel-inspired daredevil stunts like jumping through a ring of fire or being propelled to the hoop via catapult or grapple wire. He was also the first NBA mascot to ride a Harley-Davidson to courtside and integrate elaborate comedy sketches with costumes and props in his routine. The Gorilla soon became one of the most famous mascots in the NBA, his popularity in the '90s resulting in his inclusion as a hidden character in NBA Jam.\nThe Gorilla appeared on WWE Raw on March 17, 1998, where he was on the receiving end of a chokeslam and tombstone piledriver by Kane.\nWoolf performed as The Gorilla until the 2005\u201306 season, with Devin Nelson briefly taking over until end of the 2011\u201312 season, as Woolf then resumed the role until 2021. Rojas, the original telegram Gorilla, has since been involved in numerous charity projects. Woolf prefers to keep his relative anonymity, saying off-camera in a 2014 feature for SportsCenter, \"I don't want to be seen. I don't want to be known. I want the character to take center stage.\"\nThe Gorilla was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2005 and still makes appearances with charities, schools, hospitals and local businesses.\nMedia.\nOn television, Suns games not aired exclusively by one of the league's national television partners. They are carried on broadcast television by Gray Television's Arizona's Family Sports network (which consists of KPHE-LD in Phoenix, KAZF 32 in Flagstaff, KAZS 27 in Yuma, and KOLD-TV 13.5 in Tucson), or Phoenix independent station KTVK. Games are also carried on an over-the-top subscription streaming service known as Suns Live, in partnership with Kiswe.\nThe contract succeeds a previous agreement with regional sports network (RSN) Bally Sports Arizona (formerly Fox Sports Arizona), which first assumed rights to Suns home games in 2003, and added exclusive rights to away games beginning in the 2011\u201312 season (away games had previously been carried by KUTP). Suns owner Mat Ishbia stated that the agreements would give Suns fans \"more options and access than they\u2019ve ever had\", explaining in an interview that moving from the RSN model to free-to-air television would help counter the trend of cord cutting and increase the Suns' potential audience to three million households.\nThe contract was initially blocked by a lawsuit by Bally Sports' parent company, Diamond Sports Group (which had recently filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection) in April 2023. Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" Diamond sued the Suns over the Gray agreement, and the contract was voided by the bankruptcy court in accordance with an automatic stay. The stay did not impact a related agreement for rights to its WNBA sister team, the Phoenix Mercury. Diamond was ultimately allowed to exercise its right of first refusal, but did not make an offer before the deadline lapsed; as a result, the Suns' and Gray formalized the new broadcasting agreement on July 14, 2023.\n98.7 KMVP-FM serves as flagship station of the Suns Radio Network. Al McCoy served as the team's play-by-play announcer and \"Voice of the Suns\" from 1972 to 2023, making him the longest-tenured broadcaster in NBA history. He was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award at the 2007 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and was inducted into the Suns' Ring of Honor in 2016. The 2021\u201322 season marked McCoy's 50th season with the team. For 50 consecutive seasons (barring remote broadcasts due to COVID-19), Al McCoy was positioned at courtside, adjacent to the Suns' home bench, as recent as May 2022. He stopped broadcasting road games in 2019 due to difficult vantage points at higher locations in other NBA arenas limiting his preferred style of descriptive play-by-play. On October 2, 2022, his broadcast position was moved higher up in the arena, closer to the skybox-area of the Footprint Center. Tim Kempton serves as analyst, while Jon Bloom handles play-by-play for road games not broadcast by McCoy.\nTelevision broadcasts formerly featured a simulcast of McCoy's radio commentary, but this was dropped in 2003 in favor of dedicated commentary teams for radio and television. Studio host Tom Leander initially served as the television play-by-play announcer. As of the 2022\u201323 season, Kevin Ray and Leander split play-by-play duties, with either former Sun Eddie Johnson or Ann Meyers Drysdale on color. Eddie Johnson has been the Suns TV analyst since 2000, paired initially with McCoy until the discontinuation of radio simulcasts.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Suns hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nHall of Famers, retired and honored numbers.\nRing of Honor and retired numbers.\nNotes:\nPhoenix Suns' All-Century Team.\nThe Suns' All-Century Team was voted on by the fans:\n40th Anniversary Team.\nThe 40th Anniversary Suns Team, selected by fans through an Internet vote,\u00a0was unveiled on January 3, 2008. The same night the Suns defeated the Seattle SuperSonics, 104\u201396, to celebrate the team's 40th season.

It involves using and sharing knowledge to support an organization's goals.\nCourses in business administration, information systems, management, libraries, and information science are all part of knowledge management, a discipline that has been around since 1991. Information and media, computer science, public health, and public policy are some of the other disciplines that may contribute to KM research.\nNumerous academic institutions provide master's degrees specifically focused on knowledge management.\nAs a component of their IT, human resource management, or business strategy departments, many large corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations have resources devoted to internal knowledge management initiatives. These organizations receive KM guidance from a number of consulting firms.\nOrganizational goals including enhanced performance, competitive advantage, innovation, sharing of lessons learned, integration, and ongoing organizational improvement are usually the focus of knowledge management initiatives. These initiatives are similar to organizational learning, but they can be differentiated by their increased emphasis on knowledge management as a strategic asset and information sharing. Organizational learning is facilitated by knowledge management.\nThe setting of supply chain may be the most challenging situation for knowledge management since it involves several businesses without a hierarchy or ownership tie; some authors refer to this type of knowledge as transorganizational or interorganizational knowledge. industry 4.0 (or 4th industrial revolution) and digital transformation also add to that complexity, as new issues arise from the volume and speed of information flows and knowledge generation.\nHistory.\nKnowledge management efforts have a long history, including on-the-job discussions, formal apprenticeships, discussion forums, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs. With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific adaptations of technologies such as knowledge bases, expert systems, information repositories, group decision support systems, intranets, and computer-supported cooperative work have been introduced to further enhance such efforts.\nIn 1999, the term personal knowledge management was introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level.\nIn the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy, process and measurement. Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination and application; cognitive, social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement, benchmarking and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change. In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete and action-orientated.\nThe ISO 9001:2015 quality management standard released in September 2015 introduced a specification for 'organizational knowledge' as a complementary aspect of quality management within an organisation.\nResearch.\nKM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s. It was initially supported by individual practitioners, when Skandia hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first chief knowledge officer (CKO). Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly of CIBC, Canada), started investigating KM long before that. The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organizations. Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed. The KM idea has been taken up by academics, such as Ikujiro Nonaka (Hitotsubashi University), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Hitotsubashi University), Thomas H. Davenport (Babson College) and Baruch Lev (New York University).\nIn 2001, Thomas A. Stewart, former editor at \"Fortune\" magazine and subsequently the editor of \"Harvard Business Review\", published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organizations. The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity. First, is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; single-author publications are less common. Second, the role of practitioners has changed. Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009. Third, the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing, currently reaching 27 outlets.\nMultiple KM disciplines exist; approaches vary by author and school. As the discipline matured, academic debates increased regarding theory and practice, including:\nRegardless of the school of thought, core components of KM roughly include people/culture, processes/structure and technology. The details depend on the perspective. KM perspectives include:\nThe practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned with action research suggested as having more relevance and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice.\nDimensions.\nDifferent frameworks for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist. One proposed framework for categorising the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as to accomplish particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others.\nIkujiro Nonaka proposed a model (SECI, for Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, Internalisation) which considers a spiraling interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge.\nHayes and Walsham (2003) describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives. The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored; because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed.\nEarly research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort.\nSubsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory. Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e., symbols outside our heads). More recently, together with Georg von Krogh and Sven Voelpel, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward.\nA second proposed framework for categorising knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a system outside a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) from embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body's nervous and endocrine systems.\nA third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" (i.e., innovation) vs. the transfer or exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group, organisation, or community. Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of social computing tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer.\nStrategies.\nKnowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities. Organisations have tried knowledge capture incentives, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into performance measurement plans. Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged.\nOne strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy). In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a database, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification). Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy). In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide insights to requestor (personalisation). When talking about strategic knowledge management, the form of the knowledge and activities to share it defines the concept between codification and personalization. The form of the knowledge means that it's either tacit or explicit. Data and information can be considered as explicit and know-how can be considered as tacit.\nHansen et al. defined the two strategies (codification and personalisation). Codification means a system-oriented method in KM strategy for managing explicit knowledge with organizational objectives. Codification strategy is document-centered strategy, where knowledge is mainly codified as \"people-to-document\" method. Codification relies on information infrastructure, where explicit knowledge is carefully codified and stored. Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible. Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge. In contrast, personalisation encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly. Personification means human-oriented KM strategy where the target is to improve knowledge flows through networking and integrations related to tacit knowledge with knowledge sharing and creation. Information technology plays a less important role, as it only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing.\nGeneric knowledge strategies include knowledge acquisition strategy, knowledge exploitation strategy, knowledge exploration strategy, and knowledge sharing strategy. These strategies aim at helping organisations to increase their knowledge and competitive advantage.\nOther knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:\nMotivations.\nMultiple motivations lead organisations to undertake KM. Typical considerations include:\nKM technologies.\nKnowledge management (KM) technology can be categorised:\nThese categories overlap. Workflow, for example, is a significant aspect of content or document management systems, most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals. \nProprietary KM technology products such as HCL Notes (Previously Lotus Notes) defined proprietary formats for email, documents, forms, etc. The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats. Open-source and freeware tools for the creation of blogs and wikis now enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools.\nKM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level, as part of the Semantic Web. Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption, while other commentators have argued that it has been a success.\nKnowledge barriers.\nJust like knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing, the term \"knowledge barriers\" is not a uniformly defined term and differs in its meaning depending on the author. Knowledge barriers can be associated with high costs for both companies and individuals.\nKnowledge barriers appear to have been used from at least three different perspectives in the literature:\n1) Missing knowledge about something as a result of barriers for the share or transfer of knowledge.\n2) Insufficient knowledge based on the amount of education in a certain field or issue.\n3) A unique individual or group of humans' perceptual system lacks adequate contact points or does not fit incoming information to use and transform it to knowledge.\nKnowledge retention.\nKnowledge retention is part of knowledge management. It helps convert tacit form of knowledge into an explicit form. It is a complex process which aims to reduce the knowledge loss in the organization. Knowledge retention is needed when expert knowledge workers leave the organization after a long career. Retaining knowledge prevents losing intellectual capital.\nAccording to DeLong(2004) knowledge retention strategies are divided into four main categories:\nKnowledge retention projects are usually introduced in three stages: decision making, planning and implementation. There are differences among researchers on the terms of the stages. For example, Dalkir talks about knowledge capture, sharing and acquisition and Doan et al. introduces initiation, implementation and evaluation. Furthermore, Levy introduces three steps (scope, transfer, integration) but also recognizes a \"zero stage\" for initiation of the project.\nKnowledge audit.\nA knowledge audit is a comprehensive assessment of an organization's knowledge assets, including its explicit and tacit knowledge, intellectual capital, expertise, and skills. The goal of a knowledge audit is to identify the organization's knowledge strengths and gaps, and to develop strategies for leveraging knowledge to improve performance and competitiveness. Knowledge audit helps ensure that an organization's knowledge management activities are heading in the right direction. It also reduces the making of incorrect decisions. Term knowledge audit is often used interchangeably with information audit, although information audit is slightly narrower in scope.\nThe requirement and significance of a knowledge audit can vary widely among different industries and companies. For instance, within the software development industry, knowledge audits can play a pivotal role due to the inherently knowledge-intensive nature of the work. This contrasts with sectors like manufacturing, where physical assets often take more important role. The difference arises from the fact that in software development companies, the skills, expertise, and intellectual capital, often overshadow the value of physical assets.\nKnowledge audits provide opportunities for organizations to improve their management of knowledge assets, with the goal of enhancing organizational effectiveness and efficiency. By conducting a knowledge audit, organizations can raise awareness of knowledge assets as primary factors of production and as critical capital assets in today's knowledge economy. The process of a knowledge audit allows organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their knowledge assets. This includes identifying and defining these assets, understanding their behavior and properties, and describing how, when, why, and where they are used in business processes.\nKnowledge protection.\nKnowledge protection refers to behaviors and actions taken to protect the knowledge from unwanted opportunistic behavior for example appropriation or imitation of the knowledge.\nKnowledge protection is used to prevent the knowledge to be unintentionally available or useful for competitors. Knowledge protection can be for example a patent, copyright, trademark, lead time or secrecy held by a company or an individual.\nKnowledge protection methods.\nThere are various methods for knowledge protection and those methods are often divided into two categories by their formality: formal protection and informal protection. Occasionally a third category is introduced, semi-formal protection, which includes contracts and trade-secrets.\u00a0 These semi-formal methods are also usually placed under formal methods.\nOrganizations often use a combination of formal and informal knowledge protection methods to achieve comprehensive protection of their knowledge assets. The formal and informal knowledge protection mechanisms are different in nature, and they have their benefits and drawbacks. In many organizations, the challenge is to find a good mix of measures that works for the organization.\nFormal methods.\nFormal knowledge protection practices can take various forms, such as legal instruments or formal procedures and structures, to control which knowledge is shared and which is protected. Formal knowledge protection methods include for example: patents, trademarks, copyrights and licensing.\nTechnical solutions to protect the knowledge fall also under the category of formal knowledge protection. Formal knowledge protection from technical viewpoint includes technical access constraints and protection of communication channels, systems, and storage.\nWhile knowledge may eventually become public in some form or another, formal protection mechanisms are necessary to prevent competitors from directly utilizing it for their own gain. Formal protection methods are particularly effective in protecting established knowledge that can be codified and embodied in final products or services.\nInformal methods.\nInformal knowledge protection methods refer to the use of informal mechanisms such as human resource management practices or secrecy to protect knowledge assets. There is notable amount of knowledge that cannot be protected by formal methods, and for which more informal protection might be the most efficient option.\nInformal knowledge protection methods can take various forms, such as: secrecy, social norms and values, complexity, lead-time and Human resource management.\nInformal knowledge protection methods protect knowledge assets for example by making it difficult for outsiders to access and understand the knowledge within the boundaries of the organization. Informal protection methods are more effective for protecting knowledge that is complex or difficult to express, articulate, or codify.\nBalancing knowledge protection and knowledge sharing.\nThe balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a critical dilemma faced by organizations today. While sharing knowledge can lead to innovation, collaboration, and competitive advantage, protecting knowledge can prevent it from being misused, misappropriated, or lost. Thus, the need for organizational learning must be balanced with the need to protect organisations' intellectual property, especially whilst cooperating with external partners. The role of information security is crucial in helping organisations protect their assets whilst still enabling the benefits of information sharing. By implementing effective knowledge management strategies, organizations can protect valuable intellectual property while also encouraging the sharing of relevant knowledge across teams and departments. This active balancing act requires careful consideration of factors such as the level of openness, the identification of core knowledge areas, and the establishment of appropriate mechanisms for knowledge transfer and collaboration. Finding the right balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of the trade-off's involved and the context in which knowledge is shared or protected.\nKnowledge protection risks.\nProtecting knowledge cannot be considered without its risks. Here are listed four of the major risks associated with knowledge protection:\nIn conclusion, protecting knowledge is crucial to promote innovation and creativity, but it is not without its risks. Overprotection, misappropriation, infringement claims, and inadequate protection are all risks associated with knowledge protection. Individuals and organizations should take steps to protect their intellectual property while also considering the potential risks and benefits of such protection.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72897", "revid": "23838081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72897", "title": "Portland Trail Blazers", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Portland, Oregon\nThe Portland Trail Blazers (colloquially known as the Blazers) are an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. The Trail Blazers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team played its home games in the Memorial Coliseum before moving to Moda Center in 1995 (called the Rose Garden until 2013). The franchise entered the league as an expansion team in 1970, and has enjoyed a strong following: from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports at the time. Since the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008, the Trail Blazers remain as the only NBA team based in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA championship once in 1977. Their other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992. The team has qualified for the playoffs in 37 seasons of their 55-season existence (through the 2024\u201325 season), including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 through 2003, tied for the second longest streak in NBA history. The Trail Blazers' 37 playoff appearances rank fourth in the NBA only behind the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs since the team's inception in 1970. Six Hall of Fame players have played for the Trail Blazers (Lenny Wilkens, Bill Walton, Clyde Drexler, Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, Arvydas Sabonis, and Scottie Pippen). Bill Walton is the franchise's most decorated player; he was the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 1977, and the regular season MVP the following year. Four Blazers' rookies (Geoff Petrie, Sidney Wicks, Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard) have won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Three players have earned the Most Improved Player award: Kevin Duckworth (1988), Zach Randolph (2004), and CJ McCollum (2016). Three Hall of Fame coaches \u2013 Lenny Wilkens, Jack Ramsay, and Rick Adelman \u2013 have patrolled the sidelines for the Blazers, and two others, Mike Schuler and Mike Dunleavy, have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award with the team.\nHistory.\n1970\u20131974: Franchise inception.\nSports promoter and Trail Blazers founder Harry Glickman sought a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise for Portland as far back as 1955 when he proposed two new expansion teams, the other to be located in Los Angeles. When the Memorial Coliseum was opened in 1960 Glickman saw the potential it could serve as a professional basketball venue but it was not until February 6, 1970, that the NBA board of governors granted him the rights to a franchise in Portland. To raise the money for the $3.7 million admission tax, Glickman associated himself to real estate magnates Robert Schmertz of New Jersey, Larry Weinberg of Los Angeles and Herman Sarkowsky of Seattle. Two weeks later, on February 24, team management held a contest to select the team's name and received more than 10,000 entries. The most popular choice was \"Pioneers\", but that name was excluded from consideration as it was already used by sports teams at Portland's Lewis &amp; Clark College. The name \"Trail Blazers\" received 172 entries, and was ultimately selected by the judging panel, being revealed on March 13 in the halftime of a SuperSonics game at the Memorial Coliseum. Derived from the trail blazing activity by explorers making paths through forests, Glickman considered it a name that could \"reflect both the ruggedness of the Pacific Northwest and the start of a major league era in our state\". Despite initial mixed response, the Trail Blazers name, often shortened to just \"Blazers\", became popular in Oregon. While not directly connected, the Portland Trail Blazers do bear the namesake of the Salem Trailblazers who played in the Pacific Coast Professional Basketball League (PCPBL).\nAlong with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an expansion team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks led the team in its early years, and the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick.\n1974\u20131979: Bill Walton era.\nIn 1974 the team selected number one pick Bill Walton from UCLA. The ABA\u2013NBA merger of 1976 saw those two rival leagues join forces. Four ABA teams joined the NBA; the remaining teams were dissolved and their players distributed among the remaining NBA squads in a dispersal draft. The Trail Blazers selected Maurice Lucas in the dispersal draft. That summer, they also hired Jack Ramsay as head coach.\nThe two moves, coupled with the team's stellar play, led Portland to several firsts: winning record (49\u201333), playoff appearance, and an NBA championship in 1977. Starting on April 5 of that year, the team began a sellout streak of 814 straight games\u2014the longest in American major professional sports history\u2014which did not end until 1995, after the team moved into a larger facility.\nThe team started the 1977\u201378 season with a 50\u201310 mark, and some predicted a dynasty in Portland. However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over the remainder of his career, and the team struggled to an 8\u201314 finish, going 58\u201324 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals. That summer, Walton demanded to be traded to a team of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers), because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland. Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978\u201379 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter. The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.\n1980\u20131983: Transitioning.\nDuring the 1980s, the team was a consistent presence in the NBA postseason, failing to qualify for the playoffs only in 1982. However, they never advanced past the conference semifinals during the decade. The Pacific Division of the NBA was dominated by the Los Angeles Lakers throughout the decade, and only the Lakers and the Houston Rockets represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. Key players for the Blazers during the early 1980s included Mychal Thompson, Billy Ray Bates, Fat Lever, Darnell Valentine, Wayne Cooper, T. R. Dunn, Jim Paxson, and Calvin Natt.\n1983\u20131995: The Clyde Drexler era.\nDrafting Clyde Drexler.\nIn the 1983 draft, the team selected University of Houston guard\u2013forward Clyde Drexler with the 14th pick; \"Clyde the Glide\" would become the face of the franchise for over a decade, and the team's second-most decorated player (after Walton). In the next year's draft, the Trail Blazers landed the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. After the Houston Rockets selected Drexler's college teammate Hakeem Olajuwon at No. 1, the Trail Blazers selected Kentucky center Sam Bowie. Drafting third, the Chicago Bulls selected Michael Jordan. The selection of the injury-plagued Bowie over Jordan has been criticized as one of the worst draft picks in the history of American professional sports. That summer, the Blazers also made a controversial trade, sending Lever, Cooper, and Natt to the Denver Nuggets for high-scoring forward Kiki Vandeweghe. In the 1985 draft, the Blazers selected point guard Terry Porter with the last pick of the first round. Porter would go on to become one of the top point guards in the league, and the Blazers' all-time leader in assists.\nHowever, the Blazers continued to struggle in the postseason, and in 1986, Ramsay was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler. Despite this, they were the only team to beat the Boston Celtics on the road that season. That following off-season, the team drafted two players from behind the Iron Curtain, Arvydas Sabonis and Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, and sent Thompson to the San Antonio Spurs for former Oregon State University star Steve Johnson. Johnson was a high-scoring forward-center who the team intended to pair with Bowie on the frontline. It was not to be, as Bowie broke his leg five games into the 1986\u201387 season, missing the next two and a half seasons. During Schuler's brief tenure, the Blazers failed to advance out of the first round of the NBA playoffs.\nPaul Allen ownership.\nIn 1988, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen purchased the Blazers for $70 million. At the time of the purchase, Allen, then 35, became the youngest team owner in the Big Four professional sports. His first season as owner was one marked by turmoil, as conflicts erupted over who should start at several positions. Both Vandeweghe and Johnson suffered injuries; they were replaced in the starting lineup by Jerome Kersey and Kevin Duckworth. Several players, most notably Drexler, were accused of undermining Schuler. The team went 25\u201322 to open the 1988\u201389 season, and Schuler was fired. He was replaced on an interim basis with assistant coach Rick Adelman, and Vandeweghe was traded to the New York Knicks. Under Adelman, the team went 14\u201321 to finish the season, and barely qualified for the playoffs. That off-season, the team traded Sam Bowie (who had returned to the team to end the season) to the New Jersey Nets for forward Buck Williams, and Adelman was given the coaching job on a non-interim basis.\nReaching the NBA Finals.\nThe addition of Williams, and the replacement of the defensively challenged Vandeweghe with the defensive-minded Kersey, turned the team from a poor defensive squad into a good one. Led by Drexler, the team reached the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992, losing to the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls. Possibly inspired by the 1985 Chicago Bears' \"Super Bowl Shuffle\", during the run-up to their 1990 Finals appearance, the Blazers recorded two songs: \"Bust a Bucket\" and \"Rip City Rhapsody\" (with music played and recorded by Josh Mellicker, \"Rip City\" being a reference to the city's nickname). The year in between their two finals appearances, the team posted a league-best 63\u201319 record before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals, including a heartbreaker in game 6 where, in the final seconds, Cliff Robinson dropped a pass while standing directly under the basket, and then, with a few seconds left, Terry Porter's desperation wide-open 20-footer bounced out. However, the team failed to win an NBA title, and failed to advance past the first round in 1993 and 1994. Adelman was fired after the 1994 season, and replaced with P. J. Carlesimo, which led to the resignation of executive vice-president Geoff Petrie, a close friend of Adelman's.\nIn July 1994, the Trail Blazers announced the hiring of a new team president, former Seattle SuperSonics general manager Bob Whitsitt. Whitsitt, known as \"Trader Bob\" for his penchant for engaging player-exchange transactions, immediately set about revamping the Blazers roster; this included dismantling the aging Drexler-led team that had twice been to the finals. Drexler requested to be traded to a contender, and the Trail Blazers traded him to the Houston Rockets. In the fall of 1995, the team left the Memorial Coliseum for a new home, the 20,000-seat Rose Garden Arena. The sellout streak ended in the new building.\n1995\u20132006: Rebuilding and troubles.\nSeveral players left in free agency, including Terry Porter (1995), Buck Williams (1996), and Clifford Robinson (1997). Meanwhile, Trail Blazer management decided to leave Jerome Kersey unprotected in the 1995 expansion draft.\nIn an effort to quickly rebuild the team's roster, they acquired several players who were highly talented but had negative reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider was traded to the team by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick, and was considered to be a problematic player due to his previous arrests for assault, gambling and marijuana possession. He was arrested for marijuana possession just two days before his expected debut with the Blazers. Rasheed Wallace, who had garnered a reputation as a hot-tempered player since college, was also acquired in a trade with the Washington Bullets. Point guard Kenny Anderson was signed as a free agent, and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998; the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because he did not want to play in Canada for the 3 year old franchise. The team found success and eventually returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy. They beat the Phoenix Suns in the first round, sweeping them 3-0 and made history as it was the first time the Blazers had advanced from the first round since 1992. In the Semi-finals, they defeated the two-time defending Western Conference champions Utah Jazz with a 4\u20132 victory series. In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, and were subsequently defeated in a 4\u20130 sweep.\nAfter the failed championship run, Whitsitt sent Rider, who was the leading scorer that season with 13.9 points per game, and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Steve Smith. In one of their biggest acquisitions yet, the team added six-time champion and seven-time All-Star Scottie Pippen from the Houston Rockets. In the 1999\u20132000 season, the team advanced to the Western Conference finals, where they beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 3\u20131 in the opening round and the Utah Jazz 4\u20131 in the semifinals. They advanced to the conference finals where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In that series, the Trail Blazers lost 3 of the first 4 games but came back to win games 5 and 6, forcing a game 7. The Blazers had a 15-point lead at the start of the fourth quarter, but eventually lost their lead when the Lakers had a 25\u20134 run. The Trail Blazers lost game 7, 89\u201384 and the Lakers won the championship.\n\"The Jail Blazers\".\nOne of the most infamous periods in Trail Blazers history is the era of the \"Jail Blazers.\" Though the team had experienced its fair share of controversy and issues in prior seasons, many consider the \"Jail Blazers\" saga starting during the 2000\u20132001 season. The team made a series of personnel moves in the 2000 and 2001 off-seasons that failed to produce success. Forward Jermaine O'Neal was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Dale Davis. Brian Grant signed with the Miami Heat, and was replaced with ex-Seattle forward Shawn Kemp. The team started off well and had a 12-game winning streak in February and March in the regular season. The team signed guard Rod Strickland mid-season to augment their point guard corps. The team finished as 6th seed in the Western Conference with a 49\u201333 record, which qualified them for the playoff finals for the 20th consecutive year. They were eliminated in the first round, losing 0\u20133 to the Los Angeles Lakers.\nSome media outlets began to criticize the team, and questioned Whitsitt's decisions and position as manager. A popular criticism was that Whitsitt was attempting to win a championship title by assembling a roster of stars, without paying attention to team chemistry. Longtime NBA coach and analyst, Doug Collins, referred to Whitsitt as a \"rotisserie-league manager\". Fans were publicly disapproving of Whitsitt; one fan even attending a game with a banner reading \"Trade Whitsitt\" that they displayed in the crowd before eventually getting ejected from the venue. Tensions continued to rise within the franchise and media outlets started reporting on the team's internal personnel issues and the criminal activity that players were involved in. Mainstream media began referring to the team as \"The Jail Blazers\" because of all these problems.\nThat off-season, Dunleavy was fired and replaced with Maurice Cheeks, who was considered a \"players' coach\" because he was a former player in the NBA. The hiring of Cheeks was thought to be a positive decision as many believed he would relate more to the players than Dunleavy did. Cheeks brought on Dan Panaggio as assistant coach after a failed courtship with Henry Bibby of Southern California. More transactions followed as the Blazers traded Steve Smith to the Spurs for Derek Anderson, but issues began when Shawn Kemp checked himself into a rehab for cocaine use in April 2001. That same season, Whitsitt made one of his most controversial moves in signing free agent Ruben Patterson, who had previously pleaded no contest to a felony sexual assault charge and was required to register as a sex offender. In 2002, police responded to a security alarm alert at Damon Stoudamire's house, though no intruders were there. After smelling marijuana in the home, they searched the premises and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace; the search was later declared illegal and all charges were dropped. In 2003, several of the players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession. That same year, Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee \u2013 one of many incidents in his tumultuous relationship with NBA referees, which at the time stemmed from his belief that some of the referees were fixing the games against him and his teammates. Also during the 2003 season, Zach Randolph and Patterson got into an altercation in the locker room in which Patterson slammed Randolph onto the floor, an incident that later became known as the NBA's \"The Slam Heard Around The World.\" The feud between players continued and they later got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate and fracturing Patterson's left eye socket, an injury which took Patterson out of their playoff run. Guard Bonzi Wells famously told \"Sports Illustrated\" in a 2002 interview: \"We're not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don't matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they're still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they're fans, and we're NBA players.\" Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement. Later in 2005, Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Woods' dogs were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society.\nIn the summer of 2003, attendance to games was steadily declining alongside the team's reputation. With an exorbitant payroll, Whitsitt announced that he would leave the team to focus on Paul Allen's other franchise, the Seattle Seahawks.\nTo replace Whitsitt, the team hired two men at new positions. John Nash, a veteran NBA executive, was hired as general manager, and Steve Patterson as team president. The new management promised a focus on character while remaining playoff contenders; the team soon published a \"25-Point Pledge\" to fans. Troublesome players including Wells, Wallace, and Jeff McInnis were traded. However, the team failed to qualify for the 2004 NBA playoffs, ending a streak of 21 consecutive playoff appearances.\nThe following year in 2005, the team plummeted to a 27\u201355 record. The bankruptcy of the Oregon Arena corporation resulted in the Rose Garden becoming owned by a variety of investment firms. Cheeks was fired that season and replaced on an interim basis by director of player-personnel Kevin Pritchard. That summer the team hired Nate McMillan, who had coached the Sonics the prior season, as head coach and Pritchard returned to the front office.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Blazers posted a historic 21\u201361 record, the worst league record at the time. Attendance to games decreased, and the year was not free of player incidents. Players such as Miles, Patterson, Randolph, and Sebastian Telfair were involved in either on-court bickering or off-court legal incidents. Nash was fired at the end of the season, with Steve Patterson assuming the general manager role in addition to his duties as president. In addition, the team had a poor relationship with the management of the Rose Garden, frequently complaining of a \"broken economic model\". It was widely speculated by the end of the year that Paul Allen would sell the team, and the team was offered for sale that summer, with several groups expressing interest. However, Allen was willing to spend money and urged Pritchard to make draft-day trades. He subsequently took the team off the market.\n2006\u20132012: With Roy, Oden and Aldridge.\nIn the 2006 NBA draft, the Blazers traded Viktor Khryapa and the draft rights for Tyrus Thomas to acquire LaMarcus Aldridge. They also traded for the sixth pick, which became Brandon Roy. In the spring of 2007, Steve Patterson resigned as team president, and Paul Allen repurchased the Rose Garden. On the court, the team finished with a 32\u201350 record, an 11-game improvement, and Roy was named the 2006\u201307 Rookie of the Year. That summer, Kevin Pritchard was promoted to general manager, and former Nike executive Larry Miller was hired as team president. The Blazers won the 2007 NBA draft lottery and selected Ohio State center Greg Oden with the No. 1 pick. Some speculated they might choose Kevin Durant instead; Durant was picked at No. 2 by the Seattle SuperSonics. Oden suffered a pre-season knee injury requiring microfracture surgery and missed the entire 2007\u201308 season. Oden's injury woes and Durant's success drew comparisons to the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan in 1984.\nDespite this, the Trail Blazers had a 13-game winning streak starting in early December, resulting in an NBA-best 13\u20132 record for the month. Nate McMillan won NBA Coach of the Month, and Roy earned NBA Western Conference Player of the Week honors in back-to-back weeks\u2014the first Blazer to do so since Clyde Drexler in 1990\u201391. Roy was selected to the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, the first Blazer All-Star since Rasheed Wallace in 2001. The Blazers finished the season 41\u201341, their best record since 2003\u201304. Following the season, they became the only NBA team in the Pacific Northwest after the Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Greg Oden finally debuted, playing in 61 games. Portland also added international talent with Spanish swingman Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez and French-native Nicolas Batum, who emerged as a skilled defensive forward. Roy made his second straight All-Star Game appearance, and Fern\u00e1ndez competed in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend. Roy had a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns and hit game-winning shots against the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks. The Blazers clinched their first playoff berth since 2003 with a 54\u201328 record, their best since 2002\u201303, but lost in the first round to the Houston Rockets in six games.\nIn the 2009 off-season, the Blazers traded the No. 24 pick to Dallas for the No. 22 pick and selected V\u00edctor Claver. They also picked Villanova forward Dante Cunningham, Jon Brockman, and guard Patrick Mills. Brockman was traded to the Kings for No. 31 pick Jeff Pendergraph. Free agent Channing Frye signed with Phoenix, and Sergio Rodr\u00edguez was traded to the Kings. The Blazers attempted to sign free agents Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu and Paul Millsap, but T\u00fcrko\u011flu signed with Toronto, and Utah matched the offer for Millsap. On July 24, the Blazers signed point guard Andre Miller.\nDespite a winning record, the 2009\u201310 season was marred by injuries. Reserves Batum and Fern\u00e1ndez started on the inactive list, and forward Travis Outlaw followed with a serious foot injury. Centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through various injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan also ruptured his Achilles tendon during practice. To fill the void at center, the Blazers acquired Marcus Camby from the Clippers for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Despite these challenges, the Blazers finished 50\u201332, securing the 6th seed in the West. Roy underwent surgery for a torn meniscus but returned for Game 4 of the first-round series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the Blazers lost the series 4\u20132 to the Suns.\nDuring the 2010 off-season, the Blazers' front office saw significant changes with Rich Cho becoming the new general manager, succeeding Kevin Pritchard. Cho became the first Asian-American GM in NBA history. On August 12, the Blazers signed two new assistant general managers, Bill Branch and Steve Rosenberry, replacing Tom Penn, who was released in March. The organization also made changes to McMillan's coaching staff, hiring Bernie Bickerstaff, Bob Ociepka, and Buck Williams.\nSimilar to the previous season, the 2010\u201311 season was plagued by injuries. Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams suffered knee injuries, sidelining them for the season. In November, Oden underwent microfracture surgery on his left knee, ending his season. Brandon Roy also underwent double arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair both knees, casting doubt on his future. Days later, Marcus Camby had arthroscopic knee surgery.\nDespite the injuries, the Blazers remained competitive, with LaMarcus Aldridge emerging as the focal point of the team. Wesley Matthews also proved his worth in Roy's absence. Believing the team could make a playoff run, Cho made a trade on February 24, 2011, sending Dante Cunningham, Joel Przybilla, and Sean Marks to the Charlotte Bobcats for former All-Star Gerald Wallace. The Blazers won 48 games, securing another playoff berth but were eliminated in the first round by the eventual champion Dallas Mavericks in six games.\nIn the 2011 off-season, the Blazers released Cho, reportedly due to communication and \"chemistry issues\" with owner Paul Allen. Chad Buchanan took over as interim GM. Cho's dismissal was criticized as \"illogical\" by Sports Illustrated, though they noted that Allen had made many questionable moves during his tenure as owner.\nOn June 23, 2011, in the NBA draft, the Blazers selected guards Nolan Smith from Duke with the 21st pick and Jon Diebler from Ohio State with the 51st pick. On the same day, the Blazers made a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks, sending Andre Miller to Denver and Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez to Dallas, and acquiring Raymond Felton from Denver.\nThe 2011 NBA lockout halted transactions until early December, when the Blazers faced several setbacks: Brandon Roy announced his retirement due to chronic knee problems, Greg Oden had yet another knee setback, and LaMarcus Aldridge underwent heart surgery. Interim GM Chad Buchanan signed three free agents: Kurt Thomas, Jamal Crawford, and Craig Smith.\nIn the shortened 2011\u201312 season, the Blazers started 7\u20132 but quickly collapsed as starting point guard Raymond Felton and others struggled with McMillan's new running-style offense. Despite Aldridge making his first All-Star Game, the team remained inconsistent.\nOn March 15, 2012, the Blazers made several moves, trading Marcus Camby to Houston and Gerald Wallace to New Jersey for expiring contracts and draft picks. They also released Greg Oden and fired head coach Nate McMillan, naming Kaleb Canales as interim head coach. The team finished with a 28\u201338 record and missed the playoffs for the first time in three years.\nAt the 2012 NBA draft lottery on May 30, the Blazers secured the number 6 pick via the Brooklyn Nets and the number 11 pick due to their own record. Neil Olshey became the new GM in June, ending over a year of interim management.\n2012\u20132023: The Damian Lillard era.\nOn June 28, 2012, the Blazers selected Weber State guard Damian Lillard and University of Illinois center Meyers Leonard with the 6th and 11th picks overall, respectively. They also selected University of Memphis guard Will Barton with the 40th pick overall, and traded the rights of the 41st overall pick, University of Kansas guard Tyshawn Taylor, to the Brooklyn Nets for cash considerations.\nHeaded by their new general manager Olshey, the Trail Blazers front office further made a few changes during July 2012. The Blazers signed their 30th pick from the 2006 draft, Joel Freeland, and their 22nd pick from the 2009 draft, V\u00edctor Claver, as well as re-signing Hickson and Nicolas Batum. They also signed veteran point guard Ronnie Price to back up Lillard, who was selected as co-MVP of the 2012 Las Vegas Summer League. Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Terry Stotts was hired as head coach on August 7, 2012.\nUnder the reins of Lillard, the Blazers played well into January 2013, posting a 20\u201315 record. On January 11, 2013, at home against the Miami Heat, Wesley Matthews made two consecutive three-pointers late in the fourth quarter to help the Blazers secure a 92\u201390 victory. However, despite the Blazers remaining among the playoff contenders for most of the season, injuries to starters Batum, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Matthews, as well as a losing streak of 13 games\u00a0\u2013 the longest in the franchise's history\u00a0\u2013 led to the 11th position in the West, with a 33\u201349 record. Averaging 19.0 points, 6.5 assists, and 3.1 rebounds, Lillard was unanimously named Rookie of the Year, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, and Blake Griffin as the only unanimous selections in NBA history.\nGoing into the 2013 NBA draft, the Trail Blazers held four picks: the 10th pick in the first round and three second-round picks. The Blazers selected guard CJ McCollum out of Lehigh University with their 10th pick, and also selected center Jeff Withey from Kansas, power forward Grant Jerrett from Arizona, and Montenegrin big man Marko Todorovi\u0107. In addition, Cal guard Allen Crabbe was acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two second-round picks, in the 2015 and 2016 drafts.\nThe Blazers finished the 2014 season with 21 more wins than the previous season, which amounted for the largest single-season improvement in franchise history. This included a period in November when they won 11 straight games, and 13\u20132 in the month overall, for which coach Terry Stotts took home Coach of the Month honors. On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and pulled down 25 rebounds in a home game against the Rockets, the first time a Trail Blazers' player recorded a 30-point, 25-rebound game. On December 14, 2013, the Blazers made a franchise-record 21 three-pointers against the Philadelphia 76ers. They tied the new record 19 days later against the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the first NBA team to make 20 or more three-pointers in a game more than once in a season. Lillard was voted in as a reserve to his first All-Star game, joining Aldridge to represent Portland at the game. Portland finished 54\u201328, securing the fifth seed in the playoffs against the Rockets. The team also shot 81.5% at the free throw line, made 770 three-pointers, and started four players for all 82 regular season games, all franchise records.\nThe first-round series against the Rockets was a tight one, with three of the six games going to overtime. The Blazers fared well in the first two games despite not having home-court advantage, beating Houston 122\u2013120 and 112\u2013105 in Games 1 and 2 respectively, fueled by Aldridge's 46 points and 18 rebounds in game 1, and 43 points and three blocks in game 2. In the sixth game of the series with the Rockets threatening to force a game 7 back in Houston, down by two points with 0.9 seconds left in the game, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to close out the series (the moment was later nicknamed \"Rip City Revival\", as Portland advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 2000, where they lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in five games).\nDuring the 2014 off-season, Olshey signed center Chris Kaman and two-time former Blazers' guard Steve Blake to bolster the bench. Expectations by sportswriters and analysts were high for the Trail Blazers going into the 2015 NBA season given their surprise success in 2013\u201314. The Blazers beat the reigning Northwest Division Champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 106\u201389, in their season opener at home on October 29, 2014. Like the season before, the Trail Blazers dominated the month of November, at one point winning nine straight games from November 9 to 26 before being defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies. Injuries, which had not been significant the previous season, started to inflict themselves on various players. Starting center Lopez fractured his right hand in a game against the Spurs on December 15, 2014, and missed the next 23 games. Initially, the Blazers were much unfazed, winning 129\u2013119 in triple overtime against the Spurs on December 19, a game that saw Lillard and Aldridge combine for 75 points on 29 field goals; Lillard netted a career-high 43 points. Four days later, Lillard hit a three-pointer to tie the game and force overtime against the Thunder en route to 40 points and a 115\u2013111 victory. Three Blazers went to New Orleans for the All Star Weekend: Matthews for the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, Lillard as a reserve to the All-Star Game, and Aldridge as a starter to the All-Star game.\nMore injuries appeared around the start of the new year, which caused Aldridge, Batum, and Joel Freeland to miss various amounts of time, but none greater than Wesley Matthews' season-ending Achilles tendon tear on March 5, 2015. Called \"the heart and soul\" of the team by Aldridge, Matthews was in the midst of a career year when the injury occurred. In the first half of the season, the Blazers had a record of 30\u201311, allowed opponents to score an average of 97.0 points, and held them to 29.7% shooting on three-pointers; in the second half, the Blazers regressed to a 21\u201320 record, allowed 100.2 points, and let opponents shoot 37.9% from three. The Blazers clinched a return trip to the playoffs on March 30, 2015, defeating the Phoenix Suns, 109\u201386. Finishing the season 51\u201331, they clinched their first Northwest Division title since 1999 but fell to the Grizzlies in five games in the first round of the playoffs.\nIn the 2015 NBA draft, the Blazers selected Arizona forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and subsequently traded him to the Brooklyn Nets along with Steve Blake for center Mason Plumlee and the 42nd pick, Pat Connaughton.\nAfter losing four of their five starters at the end of the 2015\u201316 season, the Blazers won 44 games, were the 5th seed in the Western Conference, and beat the Clippers in six games in the first round, but were eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in five games in the Conference Semifinals.\nIn May 2017, the team revealed their new logo, an update of the pinwheel design with a new wordmark. According to Chris McGowan, president and CEO of the Trail Blazers, \"Together, we landed on subtle changes that provide a nod to our past while allowing us to modernize other aspects of our creative assets.\"\nThe 2017\u201318 season saw the Blazers finish with the third seed for the first time since the 1999\u20132000 season. On April 21, 2018, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the New Orleans Pelicans in a 4\u20130 sweep.\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Blazers finished the regular season 53\u201329, giving them the third seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers defeated the favored Oklahoma City Thunder in five games, a series which included Damian Lillard's game winning, buzzer beating, 37-foot three-pointer in game 5, giving them their first playoff series win since 2016. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Denver Nuggets. The series included a 140\u2013137 game 3 victory by the Blazers in the first quadruple-overtime game of the NBA playoffs since 1953. The Blazers eventually won the series in seven games and advanced to their first Conference Finals since 2000. In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the two-time defending champion, the Golden State Warriors. However, they lost the series in four games, and were swept.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Blazers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. They erupted to number 8 but, after winning a \"play-in game\" over Memphis, were eliminated by Lakers in five games in the first round. The NBA decided that, at the end of the regular season part of \"The Bubble\" in Orlando, if the ninth seed was within four games of the eighth seed, the two teams would play at least one game. If the eighth seed won (as the Blazers did), then the play-in was over. If the ninth seed won, then another \"winner-take-all\" game would be played for the eighth seed. The NBA adopted a version of the play-in, a \"tournament\", for the postseason following the 2020\u20132021 season, which the Blazers avoided by finishing sixth. That play-in tournament returned for the postseason after the 2021\u20132022 season.\nOn June 4, 2021, following a first-round loss in the 2021 NBA playoffs to the Denver Nuggets, the team and head coach Stotts mutually agreed to part ways. After moving on from coach Stotts, the team hired Chauncey Billups as the franchise's next head coach.\nOn February 8, 2022, in the midst of a losing season filled with injuries, the Blazers elected to trade CJ McCollum to the New Orleans Pelicans. Without McCollum in the lineup, there was an opportunity for Anfernee Simons to lead the Blazers offense. Simons play for the remainder of the season, earned him a multi-year extension.\nOn June 22, 2022, the Blazers received Detroit Pistons forward Jerami Grant in exchange for 2023 and 2025 draft picks.\nOn June 23, 2022, in the 2022 NBA draft, the Blazers selected guard Shaedon Sharpe out of the University of Kentucky and forward Jabari Walker from the University of Colorado with the 7th and 57th picks, respectively. In the 2022\u201323 regular season, the Blazers started well, and at one point were the top seed in the West, but then bit by bit slipped out of playoff contention. Lillard promptly requested a trade on July 1, and Portland began exploring options, though taking their time. General manager Joe Cronin was quoted as saying, \"If it takes months, it takes months.\"\nIn the 2023 NBA draft, the Blazers selected guard Scoot Henderson with the third overall pick. Henderson was a standout from the NBA G league team, the NBA G League Ignite.\n2023\u2013present: Post-Lillard era and rebuilding.\nOn September 27, 2023, the Blazers acquired All-Star guard Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, and Toumani Camara as part of a trade that sent Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and Grayson Allen, Jusuf Nurki\u0107, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson to the Phoenix Suns. Additionally, the Blazers acquired a 2029 first-round draft pick, with the option to swap with the Bucks for the 2028 and 2030 first-round picks. Four days later, Holiday was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Robert Williams III, Malcolm Brogdon, and two future first-round draft picks. Jerami Grant was re-signed to a five-year, $160 million contract. The Blazers had a poor year, missing the playoffs with a 21\u201361 record.\nWith the seventh selection of the 2024 NBA draft, the Blazers selected Donovan Clingan, a center from UConn. The same day, they acquired Deni Avdija from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Brogdon, the 14th overall pick, a 2029 first-round pick, and 2028 and 2030 second-round picks.\nOn October 23, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that head coach Chauncey Billups was arrested as part of two separate illegal gambling-related cases. The NBA announced that it placed Billups on \"immediate leave\", while assistant coach Tiago Splitter was named interim head coach.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Trail Blazers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Portland Trail Blazers seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Trail Blazers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Fame.\nNotes:\nNBA draft.\nThe Trail Blazers have had the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft four times in their history; each time selecting a center. In 1972 the choice was LaRue Martin, Bill Walton was picked in 1974, Mychal Thompson in 1978, and Greg Oden was taken in 2007. Several Blazers' picks have been criticized by NBA commentators as particularly unfortunate:\nIn the 1990s, the Blazers selected Jermaine O'Neal and in the modern millennium drafted Zach Randolph and, in 2006, acquired Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge in a draft day that included six trades involving the Trail Blazers.\nTeam branding.\nThe team's colors are red, black, and white. The team's \"pinwheel\" logo, originally designed by the cousin of founder Harry Glickman, is a graphic interpretation of two five-on-five basketball teams lined up against each other. One side of the pinwheel is red; the other side is black or white. The logo has gone from a vertical alignment to a slanted one starting in the 1991 season, creating a straight edge along the top\nThe Blazers' initial uniforms were white at home and red on the road. The 1970\u20131975 design featured a swooping tail accenting the last letter ('blazers' on the home uniforms; 'Portland' on the road uniforms). The 1975\u20131977 uniforms featured the team name written vertically on the right side; this uniform was used in their 1977 championship season.\nFollowing their championship victory, the Blazers unveiled a new look featuring a red, black and/or white sash that runs diagonally down the uniform. The team also switched their road uniforms to black, which they wore from 1977 to 1979, and again from 1985 to 1991. In the interim, a red uniform was used in lieu of the black uniforms from 1979 to 1985. These uniforms contained the lowercase 'blazers' in front. Following a redesign in the 1991\u201392 season, the Blazers updated their look to feature uppercase letters. Initially, the white uniform featured black letters with red drop shadows, but the color scheme was reversed mid-season. The black uniform letters were changed to white with red drop shadows. A 2002\u201303 rebrand saw the team add silver accents, update the white uniform letters back to black, and introduce a red alternate uniform, while a slight change in the 2005\u201306 season saw the Blazers return to the city name on their road uniforms.\nThe 2009\u201310 season saw the Blazers unveil a fourth alternate uniform, a design that features the team's 'Rip City' nickname and a more subtle version of the sash on the side. This uniform was tweaked to include sleeves in the 2014\u201315 season. For the 2012\u201313 season, the Blazers changed their red alternate uniform to include black lettering, a more tapered sash, and the pinwheel logo atop of it.\nFor the 2017\u201318 season, the Blazers made some slight revisions to their look upon moving to Nike, changing the alignment of the city and team name from italicized to straight while adding the 'Rip City' nickname on the waistband. They also changed their red alternate uniform to include a black and grey variation of the sash inspired from the team's pinwheel logo and a lack of white elements. In the 2019\u201320 season, the red \"Statement\" uniform was updated to feature white letters, white numbers with black trim and a thin white strip above the series of black and grey strips. This was due to visibility concerns surrounding the previous red uniform. Then in the 2022\u201323 season, in collaboration with Damian Lillard, the Trail Blazers updated their \"Statement\" uniform, only featuring the iconic \"pinwheel\" logo in black along with black/red side striping inspired by the aforementioned logo. In the 2025\u201326 season, both the \"Association\" and \"Icon\" uniform eliminated the silver accents and the contrasting neck and armhole striping.\nIn addition to the \"Association\", \"Icon\" and \"Statement\" uniforms, Nike released annual \"City\" uniform designs. The Blazers' 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniforms were predominantly black with a grayscale plaid pattern (in homage to former head coach Jack Ramsay), 'Rip City' and lettering in red, and a silhouette of the Portland city flag on the beltline. The 2018\u201319 season \"City\" uniforms again used the 'Rip City' concept, this time with a more subdued red \"blaze\" strip and black and dark grey background. In addition, the Blazers wore an \"Earned\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs. The uniforms were similar to the 'Rip City' jerseys but with a red base and white letters with black trim. The \"Earned\" jersey was only used for that season before it was shelved permanently. The 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform was heavily inspired by the team's original white uniforms, featuring 'Rip City' and block numerals in red with black trim, along with player names in black. In the 2020\u201321 season, the Blazers' \"City\" uniform will pay homage to the Oregon landscape and its native tribes. The uniform features a brown base with black lines similar to a wood grain, a series of zig-zag lines in shades of red, blue, yellow and orange along the right side, and the \"Oregon\" insignia found on the White Stag sign. The waist also includes the Oregon outline and nine blue triangles symbolizing the state's native tribes. As in 2019, the Blazers also wore an \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs. The uniforms were patterned after the team's \"Association\" uniform but lacked the red elements and had a silver base. For the NBA's 2021\u201322 75th anniversary season, the Blazers' \"City\" uniform was a mixture of past uniform elements. Once again going to the 'Rip City' concept, this uniform featured the same number font as the 1991\u20132002 uniforms, the red and gray plaid striping in homage to Jack Ramsay, the \"Portland\" script from the team's first uniforms on the waist, tributes to Portland's 'City of Roses' moniker and the team's 1977 championship and 1990 and 1992 conference titles, and a white circle surrounding the current logo in homage to the center court of Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\nFor the Trail Blazers' 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, the team went with a black uniform with teal and silver accents, replacing the trademark diagonal strip with a pattern inspired by the carpet found at Portland International Airport. \"PDX\" in silver letters was positioned above the uniform. The \"PDX\" uniform returned in the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe Trail Blazers again honored Dr. Jack Ramsay for their 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, featuring a black base, black grayscale plaid patterns, and red plaid letters. The \"Rip City\" throwback lettering was brought back with this uniform, along with cream numbers trimmed in red. A red-based 2023 NBA in-season tournament court with a middle cream strip was paired with this uniform, with silhouettes of the NBA Cup. This theme would continue on the team's 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, this time as homage to Portland's iconic plaid heritage and a salute to Mount Hood on the shorts. The black-based design again featured \"Rip City\" in white with grayscale plaid patterns.\nThe team's mascot is Blaze the Trail Cat, a two-tone silver-colored mountain lion, which has been the team's official mascot since 2002.\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Portland's official mascot was Bigfoot, which was former Trail Blazers player Dale Schlueter in a sasquatch costume that was tall. The concept was pitched to the Trail Blazers front office by Jay Isaac of Isaac-Ross Productions. On March 22, 1989, following a 151\u2013127 victory over Portland, Golden State Warriors head coach Don Nelson protested to the media about a skit during a timeout, in which Bigfoot crushed a model of the Golden Gate Bridge while the song \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" played over the public address system. Bigfoot was discontinued as Portland's mascot following the incident. A new Bigfoot character nicknamed Douglas Fur was introduced in March 2023 to serve as a secondary mascot alongside Blaze the Trail Cat. A popular unofficial mascot was the late Bill \"The Beerman\" Scott, a Seattle beer vendor-cheerleader who worked for numerous pro teams, including the Trail Blazers, the Seattle Seahawks, and the Seattle Mariners. Scott worked for the Trail Blazers from 1981 through 1985.\nFront office.\nThe team from 1988 until 2018 was owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen; ownership of the Trail Blazers is currently via a series of holding companies which Allen owned. Vulcan Inc. is a private corporation in which currently Allen's sister Jody Allen as head of Paul Allen's estate is the chairman and sole shareholder. A subsidiary of Vulcan, Vulcan Sports and Entertainment (VSE), manages Allen's sports-related properties, including the Trail Blazers, the Seattle Seahawks NFL team, Seattle Sounders FC of MLS, and the Moda Center. In the fall of 2012, Peter McLoughlin was named CEO of Vulcan Sports and Entertainment.\nThe Trail Blazers as a corporate entity are owned by VSE. Jody Allen as head of estate serves as the team's chairman, and her longtime associate Bert Kolde is vice-chairman. The position of president and chief executive officer is held by Chris McGowan, with Larry Miller having held the job until resigning in July 2012. The post of chief operating officer is vacant; the most recent COO of the team was Mike Golub, who resigned in July 2008 to take a more enhanced role with VSE. Kevin Pritchard served as general manager of the Trail Blazers until he was fired on June 24, 2010. The announcement was issued by the Blazers' head office just an hour before the beginning of the 2010 NBA draft. A month later, the Blazers named Oklahoma City Thunder assistant general manager Rich Cho as their new general manager. Cho was fired less than a year later, and director of college scouting Chad Buchanan served as interim general manager for the entire 2011\u201312 season. In June 2012, the Trail Blazers hired Neil Olshey as general manager.\nBefore Allen purchased the team in 1988, the Trail Blazers were owned by a group of investors headed by Larry Weinberg, who is chairman emeritus.\nVenues.\nThe Trail Blazers play their home games in the Moda Center, a multipurpose arena which is located in Portland's Rose Quarter, northeast of downtown. The Moda Center, originally named the Rose Garden, opened in 1995 and can seat a total of 19,980 spectators for basketball games; capacity increases to 20,580 with standing room. Like the Trail Blazers, the Moda Center is owned by Paul Allen through subsidiary Vulcan Sports and Entertainment. During a two-year period between 2005 and 2007, the arena was owned by a consortium of creditors who financed its construction after the Oregon Arena Corporation, a now-defunct holding company owned by Allen, filed for bankruptcy in 2004. In August 2013, the arena's name was changed from the Rose Garden to the Moda Center, after the Blazers' front office officials reached a $4 million agreement with Moda Health Corporation. The name change was met with considerable criticism from fans.\nPrior to 1995, the Trail Blazers' home venue was the Memorial Coliseum, which today stands adjacent to the Moda Center. This facility, built in 1960, can seat 12,888\u00a0spectators for basketball (originally 12,666). It was renamed the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in 2011.\nIn-game entertainment.\nThe team has a cheerleading-dance squad known as the BlazerDancers. Consisting of 16\u00a0members, the BlazerDancers perform dance routines at home games, charity events, and promotional events. A junior dance team composed of 8- to 11-year-old girls also performs at selected home games, as does a hip hop dance troupe. Other regular in-game entertainment acts include a co-educational acrobatic stunt team which performs technically difficult cheers, a break dancing squad known as the Portland TrailBreakers, and a pair of percussion acts.\nFan support and \"Blazermania\".\nThe relationship between the team and its fans, commonly known as \"Blazermania\", has been well-chronicled. The Trail Blazers have long been one of the NBA's top draws, with the exception of two periods in the team's history. The team drew poorly during its first four seasons of existence, failing to average more than 10,000\u00a0spectators per game. Attendance increased during the 1974\u201375 season, when the team drafted Bill Walton.\nThe phenomenon known as Blazermania started during the 1976\u201377 season, when the team posted its first winning record, made its first playoff appearance, and captured its only NBA title, defeating the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals; the team has been popular in Portland since that time. That season, the team started a sellout streak which continued until the team moved into the Rose Garden in 1995. The team continued to average over 19,000\u00a0spectators per game until the 2003\u201304 season, when attendance declined after the team continued to suffer image problems due to the \"Jail Blazer\" reputation it had gained, and was no longer as competitive on the court. After drafting eventual Rookie of the Year and three-time All Star Brandon Roy in 2006, attendance climbed in the 2006\u201307 season and continued to rebound in the 2007\u201308 season. The final 27 home games of the 2007\u20132008 season were consecutive sell-outs, a streak that continued through the entire 2008\u20132009 season and into the start of the 2011\u20132012 season.\nThe team's rallying cry, \"Rip City\", was coined by broadcaster Bill Schonely during the team's first season and remains an integral part of the team's and fanbase's identity.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Blazers began testing \"OneCourt Haptic Displays\", a haptic device that allows fans with low vision or blindness to be able to \"watch\" live games. The device was made more accessible the following season. It uses generative audio and haptics to \"translate live gameplay into trackable vibrations\".\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nThe Trail Blazers' former television play-by-play team was Mike Barrett and Mike Rice, joined by sideline reporter Michael Holton, who succeeded Terry Porter (2010\u201311) and Rebecca Haarlow (2009\u201310). The team was also known for its long association with Steve \"Snapper\" Jones, who played for the team prior to his career as a television analyst; Jones departed the franchise in 2005.\nRegional television coverage of Trail Blazers games was limited until the 1980s, with only closed-circuit broadcasts at the Paramount Theatre available by the mid-70s. In the 1980s, the team reached an agreement with KOIN to carry games on television; to protect the team's ticket sales, the package was largely limited to away games. The telecasts also had to be scheduled around CBS network programming that could not be pre-empted, such as \"60 Minutes\".\nIn the 1990s, the team split its home games between broadcast television (with KGW serving as flagship station by 2000) and a pay-per-view service known as BlazerVision; the team did not disclose how many viewers subscribed to the service, while \"Portland Business Journal\" writer Andy Giegerich criticized the service when it was assigned early-round playoff games in the 1999\u20132000 season (thus resulting in blackouts of TNT's national coverage), and anecdotally noted that the Trail Blazers lost more often in games that were on BlazerVision or otherwise untelevised. The pay per view component was removed for the 2000\u201301 season, with the Trail Blazers providing the games to cable providers at no extra cost to the customers.\nIn the 2001\u201302 season, the team established its own regional sports network, Action Sports Cable Network (ASCN), which would carry the majority of Trail Blazers telecasts. AT&amp;T Broadband refused to add the new channel due to the carriage fees it charged, which prevented it from reaching a wide audience. After having to resort to providing closed circuit feeds directly to bars, and sublicensing a package of games to the local PAX TV station, ASCN folded after one season. The team reached agreements with FSN Northwest (now Root Sports Northwest) and KGW to carry its regional broadcasts. It was alleged that the 2005 departure of Steve Jones from the commentary team was due in part to team displeasure with Jones' sometimes frank analysis of the team's on-court performance and off-court decisions.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the team moved to Comcast SportsNet Northwest (now NBC Sports Northwest); all but six regular season games were carried on CSN Northwest or the \"Blazers Television Network\" (a syndication package within the team's television market, whose flagship was KGW); 34 games were produced and broadcast in high-definition. The team's television contract with CSN Northwest was criticized due to the channel's lack of carriage on satellite television providers DirecTV and Dish Network, both of which compete with Comcast's cable television operations.\nOn July 6, 2016, the team renewed its contract with CSN Northwest through the 2020\u20132021 season, giving the network exclusive rights to all Trail Blazers games beginning in the 2017\u201318 season (and thus ending the team's over-the-air syndication package). The team had originally considered an arrangement with KPTV, under which games would be broadcast over-the-air and simulcast via an Internet service, but deals with potential streaming partners fell through. Root Sports Northwest made a higher-value, long-term offer, but the offer was rejected because Root Sports could not guarantee whether its carriage deal with Comcast Cable, which serves 55% of the Portland market, would be renewed. On November 2, 2017, NBC Sports Northwest launched a paid over-the-top service, \"Blazers Plus\", offering access to 15 games through the remainder of the season.\nOn June 16, 2016, \"The Oregonian\" reported that Barrett, Rice, and analyst Antonio Harvey had been released by the Trail Blazers. Wheeler will call games on radio alone, while the three former personalities still received pay for the final season of their contracts. The change came as part of a plan by the team to overhaul its telecasts as it enters the final year of its current television deal with CSN Northwest. The next day, the team announced that veteran sportscaster Kevin Calabro would become its new lead commentator beginning in the 2016\u201317 season. On July 1, 2020, Kevin Calabro announced his departure as TV play-by-play broadcaster. Jordan Kent, the main host for the Blazers TV studio show, was named interim TV play-by-play broadcaster and in November 2020 was named the full-time TV play-by-play broadcaster starting with the 2020\u20132021 season. However, Calabro resumed calling Trail Blazers games after an absence of only one season. Calabro's current partners are color commentator Lamar Hurd, and sideline reporter Brooke Olzendam.\nPrior to the 2021\u201322 season, the Trail Blazers announced that they would return to Root Sports Northwest under a multi-year deal of undisclosed length. A key factor in the deal was reported to be the network's wider carriage over NBC Sports Northwest, which included greater coverage on streaming and satellite providers (including DirecTV and Dish Network, although the latter's contract with Root Sports and several other AT&amp;T SportsNet channels expired at the end of September 2021, with no renewal). The Trail Blazers announced they would leave Root Sports Northwest on August 14, 2024; no details on a replacement broadcaster were announced at that time.\nOn September 23, 2024, the Trail Blazers announced an agreement with the Sinclair Broadcast Group to launch Rip City Television Network, which will syndicate games over-the-air to KATU-DT2 in Portland, Oregon, KUNS-DT2 in Seattle, Washington, KTVL-DT4 in Medford, Oregon, KVAL-DT2 in Eugene, Oregon, KCBY-DT2 in Coos Bay, Oregon, KPIC-DT2 in Roseburg, Oregon, KIMA-DT3 in Yakima, Washington and KEPR-DT3 in Pasco, Washington. In Portland, games moved to KUNP/KATU-DT2 on January 1, 2025. The Blazers also relaunched BlazerVision, but as a direct-to-consumer streaming service rather than a pay-per-view service.\nRadio.\nAll Trail Blazers' games are broadcast over the radio, with broadcasting carried on the Trail Blazers radio network, which consists of 25 stations located in the Pacific Northwest. The flagship station of the Blazers' radio network is 620 KPOJ in Portland. The radio broadcasting team consists of play-by-play announcer Travis Demers and studio host Jay Allen. All games are preceded by a pre-game analysis show, \"Blazers Courtside\", and followed by a post-game show known as \"The 5th Quarter\". Bob Akamian served as studio host until halfway through the 2010\u20132011 season, when the team hired away Adam Bjaranson from their over-the-air TV partner, KGW, and former Trail Blazers' player Michael Holton is the studio analyst. The original radio announcer for the team was Bill Schonely, who served as the team's radio play-by-play announcer from 1970 until 1992 and from 1994 until his retirement (he did Trail Blazers TV games with Jones from 1992 to 1994) in 1998\u2014calling 2,522 Blazers games\u2014and remained with the team as a community ambassador. Brian Wheeler then did play-by-play from 1998 to 2019.\nPress relations.\nSeveral local news outlets provide in-depth coverage of the Trail Blazers. Chief among them is \"The Oregonian\", the largest paper in the state of Oregon. Other newspapers providing detailed coverage of the team (including the assignment of beat writers to cover the team) include the \"Portland Tribune\", a weekly Portland paper, and the Vancouver, Washington \"Columbian\". Notable local journalists to cover the team include John Canzano of the \"Oregonian\", Jason Quick of The Athletic, and Dwight Jaynes of the \"Portland Tribune\". Online coverage of the \"Oregonian\" is provided through OregonLive.com, a website collaboration between the paper and Advance Internet. In addition to making \"Oregonian\" content available, oregonlive.com hosts several blogs covering the team written by \"Oregonian\" journalists, as well as an additional blog, \"Blazers Blog\", written by Sean Meagher.\nRelations between the team and \"The Oregonian\" have often been tense; the paper is editorially independent of the team and is often critical. During the Steve Patterson era, relations between the two institutions became increasingly hostile; several NBA executives told ESPN's Chris Sheridan that the situation was the \"most dysfunctional media-team relationship\" that they could recall. For instance during a portion of a pre-2006 NBA draft workout, which was closed to the media, an \"Oregonian\" reporter looked through a curtain separating the press from the workout and wrote about this on his blog. Outraged, the team closed subsequent practices to the press altogether, leading John Canzano of the paper to respond with outrage on his blog. In November 2006, the \"Oregonian\" commissioned an outside editor to investigate the deteriorating relationship, a move the rival \"Willamette Week\" called \"unusual\". In the report, both sides were criticized somewhat, but did not make any revelations which were unexpected.\nAdditional coverage is offered by various blogs, including Blazers Edge (part of SB Nation) and the Portland Roundball Society (part of ESPN's TrueHoop Network).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72898", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72898", "title": "Sacramento Kings", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Sacramento, California\nThe Sacramento Kings are an American professional basketball team based in Sacramento, California. The Kings compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Kings are the oldest team in the NBA, and the first team in the major professional North American sports leagues located in Sacramento. The team plays its home games at Golden 1 Center.\nThe franchise began with the Rochester Seagrams (a semi-professional team) from Rochester, New York, that formed in 1923 and hosted a number of teams there over the next 20 years. They joined the National Basketball League in 1945 as the renamed Rochester Royals, winning that league's championship in their first season, 1945\u201346. In 1948 they jumped with three other NBL teams to the Basketball Association of America, that later merged with the NBL to form the NBA. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, winning the NBA championship in 1951. The team, however, found it increasingly difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester and relocated to Cincinnati in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals.\nBefore the 1972\u201373 season, the team relocated again, this time to Kansas City, Missouri, and renamed the Kansas City\u2013Omaha Kings because it initially split its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska; the nickname was changed to avoid confusion with the baseball team dubbed the Kansas City Royals. After three seasons, the team truncated to Kansas City Kings, but continued to play several home games per season in Omaha, through March 1978.\nThe franchise again failed to find success in its market and moved after the 1984\u201385 season to Sacramento. Their best seasons to date in the city were in the early 2000s, including a very successful 2001\u201302 season when they had the best record in the NBA at 61\u201321 (a winning percentage of ). Between 2006 and 2022, the Kings had 16 consecutive losing seasons, the most in NBA history. The Kings also had the longest active postseason drought in the four major North American sports, which started in 2006 and lasted until 2023. Thanks to these periods of futility and their historic age, the franchise has the most losses in NBA history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\n1923\u20131944: Rochester Seagrams.\nThe basis of a purely-professional team in Rochester, New York, which came into existence in 1945, was two decades of a sponsored semi-professional team, the Rochester Seagrams. Canadian distiller Seagram was the team's main sponsor and received the bulk of what monies were made. During the 1932\u201333 season, the Seagrams actually played professionally in the District Basketball Association, while in the years 1933\u201336, they played in the District Basketball League instead. One of the team's early stars was Lester Harrison, a local high school star of some publicity before joining the team. Harrison later became the team's captain, coach, manager, and chief scout over the next two decades. Among visitors to Rochester to play the team were the Original Celtics, the New York Rens, and the Harlem Globetrotters.\n1945\u20131957: Rochester Royals.\nWith news that World War II was approaching its end, the National Basketball League (NBL) announced that it was expanding, and Harrison was approached for interest in a franchise. While the sponsored semi-professional team balked at additional expenses involved, Harrison and his brother Jack, a lawyer, jumped at the chance. They pooled money to meet the steep entry fee of $25,000 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) and were granted an NBL franchise. Their team, the Rochester Royals, pushed the Seagrams out of their local facility, smallish Edgerton Park Arena.\nThe best players were the returning Navy and Army players now being released from the war. There was no draft for the league in the selection of new players. So, Harrison was able to scoop up several name stars for his new team, among them Bob Davies, Red Holzman and William \"Fuzzy\" Levane, as well as NBL free agents like George Glamack and Al Cervi. The result was a strong league champion in their first season of existence as the Royals during the 1945\u201346 season.\nThe team had two more seasons of success during their NBL years, which permitted the team to play non-league opponents. During all three years, 1945\u20131948, the team played over 300 total games, hosting most of them.\nThe Royals defected to the NBL's rival, the Basketball Association of America (BAA), in 1948 along with the Fort Wayne Pistons, Minneapolis Lakers, and Indianapolis (Kautskys) Jets. A year later, the BAA and the NBL merged to become the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nAfter the move to the BAA, Rochester was placed in the Western Division. Their biggest rivals at the time were the Minneapolis Lakers, led by George Mikan, who won the NBA Championship five times between 1949 and 1954. The Royals were the only other team to win the NBA title during that period, defeating the New York Knicks 4\u20133 in 1951. It is the only NBA championship in the franchise's history.\nThe title, however, did not translate into profit for the Royals. With their relatively small arena and now-limited schedule, the franchise was losing money, despite the team finishing no lower than second in its division in both the NBL and BAA/NBA from 1945 to 1954. The roster turned over in 1955, except for star guard Bobby Wanzer, who soon became the team's new coach. The team moved to the larger Rochester War Memorial in 1955. The NBA even agreed to host their All-Star Game there in 1956. By then the Royals were in a rebuild and financial struggle and the NBA was putting pressure on Harrison to sell or relocate his team to a larger city, and eventually ownership announced that the 1956\u201357 season was the Royals' last in Rochester.\nThe Royals' stay in Rochester featured the services of nine future members of the Basketball Hall of Fame: Al Cervi, Bob Davies, Alex Hannum, Lester Harrison, Red Holzman, Arnie Risen, Maurice Stokes, Jack Twyman, Bobby Wanzer, while others proved prominent in other fields, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame member Otto Graham, Hollywood Walk of Famer Chuck Connors, and Jack McMahon.\n1957\u20131960: Early years of the Cincinnati Royals.\nIn April 1957, the Harrison brothers moved the Royals to Cincinnati, a city that was then trying to obtain an NBA expansion franchise. This move followed a well-received regular-season game played at Cincinnati Gardens on February 1, 1957. The change of venue had been said to have been partly suggested by Jack Twyman and Dave Piontek, who were two of several roster players on the new Royals from that area. Cincinnati, which had a strong college basketball fanbase then, and no NFL franchise to compete with (until the Bengals joined in 1970 after two seasons in the AFL), was deemed the best choice for the Harrisons, who also considered other cities. The Royals name continued to fit in Cincinnati, often known as the \"Queen City\".\nDuring the team's first NBA draft in Cincinnati, the team acquired Clyde Lovellette and guard George King. They teamed with the 1\u20132 punch of Maurice Stokes and Twyman to produce a budding contender in the team's first season in the Queen City. But injuries and the loss of star guard Si Green, the #1 overall pick of the 1956 NBA draft, to military service dropped the team into a tie for second place in the NBA Western Division during the 1957\u201358 season's second half.\nIn the season's finale, All-Pro star Maurice Stokes struck his head when he fell after pursuing a rebound. He shook off the effects of the fall, even as he had briefly been unconscious. After Game One in the playoffs three days later, Stokes's head injury was greatly aggravated by airplane cabin pressure during the flight back to Cincinnati for Game Two. He suffered a seizure and was permanently hospitalized, a tragedy that greatly shook the team. Stokes, a tremendous talent who could play center, forward and guard, was 2nd in the NBA in rebounds and 3rd in assists, a double feat only Wilt Chamberlain and Nikola Jokic have matched for a full season. The impact of losing Stokes was such that the team nearly folded. Six of the team's shaken players simply retired on the spot.\nFellow All-Star Twyman rose to All-Pro level over the next two seasons for Cincinnati, even as the team posted two 19-win seasons. The 1958\u201359 Cincinnati team featured five rookies, with Lovellette, King and other key players having left the team in the wake of Stokes' tragic injury. The Harrisons, wanting out at this point, sold to a makeshift local group, headed by Thomas Woods, Cincinnati Gardens management, and a number of local businessmen.\nJack Twyman came to the aid of his teammate, and even legally adopted Stokes. Raising funds for Stokes's medical treatment, Twyman helped him until his death in April 1970. The 1973 feature film \"Maurie\", which co-starred actors Bernie Casey and Bo Svenson, dramatized their story.\nShooting often for the beleaguered team, Twyman was the second NBA player to ever average 30 points per game for an NBA season. Twyman and Stokes were later named Hall of Famers.\n1960\u20131970: The Oscar Robertson era.\nIn 1960, the team was able to land local superstar Oscar Robertson. Robertson led a team that included Twyman, Wayne Embry, Bob Boozer, Bucky Bockhorn, Tom Hawkins and Adrian Smith over the next three seasons. The Royals reversed their fortunes with Robertson and rose to title contender. An ownership dispute in early 1963 scuttled the team's playoff chances when new owner Louis Jacobs booked a circus for Cincinnati Gardens for the week of the playoff series versus the champion Boston Celtics. The Royals' home games were at Xavier University's Schmidt Field House.\nIn late 1963, another local superstar, Jerry Lucas, joined the team. The Royals rose to the second-best record in the NBA. From 1963 to 1966, the Royals contended strongly against Boston and the Philadelphia 76ers, but won no titles. In the 1964 NBA draft the Royals drafted rookies George Wilson, Bill Chmielewski, Steve Courtin (later traded to 76ers), and Happy Hairston. The team's star players throughout the 1960s were Oscar Robertson and Jerry Lucas. Robertson met with individual success, averaging a triple-double in 1961\u201362 and winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1964. Robertson was a league-leading scorer and passer each season. Lucas was Rookie of the Year in 1964, led the league in shooting, and later averaged 20 rebounds per game over four seasons. Both were All-NBA First Team selections multiple times. The team failed to keep some promising players, though, and played in the tough NBA East division, dominated by the Boston Celtics, even as a Baltimore team played in the West Division for three years, denying the team likely visits to the NBA Finals.\nDuring the 1966\u201367 season, the Royals began playing some of their home games in neutral sites such as Cleveland (until the Cavaliers began play in 1970), Dayton and Columbus. This did wound their local fan base in Cincinnati, though, and fortunes for the team continued to steadily decline. That year, they would host the 1966 NBA All-Star Game, with Smith scoring 24 points to be named All-Star MVP. As of 2021, it is the last time that the franchise has hosted an All-Star Game. In the summer of 1968, Owner Louis Jacobs died and ownership went to his sons Jeremy and Max Jacobs.\nNew coach Bob Cousy traded Lucas in 1969. Robertson was traded to Milwaukee in 1970, where he immediately won an NBA title. Both transactions were unpopular with the fan base, resulting in a home attendance decline and eventually the franchise's move to Kansas City which was announced on March 14, 1972. The NBA Board of Governors voted 16\u20131 to permit the transfer nine days later on March 23. Before a crowd of 4,022, the Royals defeated the Baltimore Bullets 132\u2013114 in its final home game at Cincinnati Gardens the following night on March 24. The team represented Cincinnati for one last time in a 135\u2013122 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers witnessed by 10,289 at the Cleveland Arena two nights later on March 26.\n1972\u20131985: Kansas City\u2013Omaha/Kansas City Kings.\nAfter moving to Kansas City, the Royals renamed themselves the Kings to avoid confusion with the Royals baseball team. Now dubbed the Kansas City\u2013Omaha Kings, the team split its home games between the 7,316-seat Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri and the 9,300-seat Omaha Civic Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska.\nThe Cincinnati Royals had been looking at Omaha as a market as early as 1968, playing twelve \"home games\" in Nebraska from 1968 to 1971. From 1972 to 1975, the KC\u2013Omaha Kings played a total of 42 regular season contests (but no playoff games) in Omaha. In 1975, the club became simply the Kansas City Kings (moving into the new 16,785-seat Kemper Arena the previous season). The team did not abandon Omaha completely, playing several games there through the 1977\u201378 season. For the next two seasons, they played several home games in St. Louis.\n1972\u20131976.\nThe team netted a new superstar in point guard Nate Archibald, who led the league in scoring and assists in the 1972\u201373 season.\nWhile still in Cincinnati, the team introduced a most unusual uniform design, which placed the player's surname below his number. The design remained intact through the first several seasons of the team's run in Sacramento, even when the shade of blue on the road uniforms was changed from royal blue to powder blue, and the script '\"Kansas City\"' which adorned the road jerseys was scrubbed after the move in favor of a repeat of the \"Kings\" script on the home shirts. The Kings' back jersey template was later adopted by the WNBA and the NBA Development League, as well as the NBA during the All-Star Game since 2006.\nThe Kings had some decent players throughout. Tom Van Arsdale, the shooting forward, \"Jumpin\" Johnny Green, and Matt Guokas helped Archibald in the first year in Kansas City. Toby Kimball was a fan favorite. Jimmy Walker teamed with Archibald as the Kings made the playoffs the second year. Sam Lacey, an effective passing center, became one of the most dependable players in the league. Archibald became the first player to lead the league in scoring and assists in the first season in Kansas City. However, the management traded Archibald and wasted high draft picks. Bob Cousy gave way to Phil Johnson, who was fired midyear in 1977 and replaced by Larry Staverman, a player on the team on two separate occasions when it was in Cincinnati (Staverman coached for a brief time and then resigned in May 1981 to take up the role of team president's assistant for the Cleveland Browns).\n1976\u20131984.\nThe Kings finally achieved some success in their new home when they hired Cotton Fitzsimmons as coach. Fitzsimmons won the Midwest Division in 1978\u201379 with rookie point guard Phil Ford, who was NBA Rookie of the Year in 1979. Kansas City was led by shooting guard Otis Birdsong, strong on both offense and defense, all-around shooting forward Scott Wedman, and passing center Sam Lacey, who had a trademark bank shot. They drew an average of 10,789 fans to Kemper Arena that season, the only time during their tenure in KC that average attendance was in five figures (the attendance at the peak was only two-thirds of Kemper's capacity). The Kings later played several home games in St. Louis during the early 1980s to large crowds. Most Kansas City sports fans preferred to spend their entertainment dollar on the Royals, who won the American League West division championship four times in five seasons between 1976 and 1980, and reached the 1980 World Series.\nThe Kings made the playoffs in 1979\u201380 and again in 1980\u201381, despite finishing the 1980\u201381 regular season at 40\u201342 (). The Kings made a run in the 1981 NBA playoffs, reaching the Western Conference finals; these were the franchise's first playoff victories since 1964, and their only ones ever in Kansas City. Ernie Grunfeld played the point in this run in place of an injured Ford, as KC used a slow half-court game to win the first two rounds. Power forward Reggie King had a remarkable series, dominating the opposition. They then faced the Phoenix Suns in the Conference Semifinals and won three of the first four games before having to withstand consecutive victories by the Suns to force a Game 7 that saw them prevail 95\u201388 to become the first #5 seed to eliminate a #1 seed and also the second road team to win a Game 7 after leading 3\u20131. They then faced the Houston Rockets, also 40\u201342 in the regular season, but lost in five games in the Conference Finals. Lacey, the last remaining Cincinnati Royal to play for the Kings, could not keep up with Rockets superstar center Moses Malone. (The Kings did not win another playoff series for two decades.)\nHowever, a series of bad luck incidents prevented the team from building on its success. Cleveland Cavaliers owner Ted Stepien lured Wedman and Birdsong away with big contract offers. In 1979, the roof literally fell in at Kemper Arena because of a severe storm, forcing the team to play most of the 1979\u201380 season at the much smaller Municipal Auditorium. The general manager was fired in a scandal in which he was found to be reusing marked postage stamps. When the Kings rehired Joe Axelson as general manager, they brought back the man who had previously traded Oscar Robertson, Norm Van Lier, Nate Archibald and Jerry Lucas, and used the third pick in the ABA dispersal draft on Ron Boone. Axelson stayed on after the Kings left Kansas City where, in their last game ever, fans wore Joe Axelson masks. Axelson later said he hoped his plane would never touch down in Kansas City.\nAxelson became the first general manager in the history of sports to fail with the same franchise in four cities: Cincinnati, Kansas City, Omaha and Sacramento. He was not fired for good until he rehired coach Phil Johnson, whom he had fired in mid-season in Kansas City ten years before. The Kings also entered this period competing with the Kansas City Comets of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) for the winter sports dollar, when the Comets were led by marketers\u2014the Leiweke brothers. Their final season in 1984\u201385 resulted in a 31\u201351 () record, as fans stayed away from Kemper Arena in droves, with average attendance of 6,410. Long-time ABA and NBA star, Don Buse, played his final professional season for the Kings.\nOwnership began looking for a new home for the team. Poor attendance and lack of sponsorship dollars (the team was third in sports market share by a significant margin behind the NFL's Chiefs (even though they went 14 consecutive seasons without a playoff berth, covering the Kings' entire stay in Kansas City) and MLB's Royals) were the main reasons. Also, Kansas City had a much stronger following for the Kansas Jayhawks and Missouri Tigers college basketball teams than they did the NBA's Kings.\nThe franchise was sold for $10.5 million on June 8, 1983, to a six-man, Sacramento, California-based investment group led by Joseph Benvenuti who had a 50% interest and real estate developer Gregg Lukenbill who was the managing partner. The new ownership group honored the remaining two years of the Kings' lease with Kemper Arena which expired in June 1985 but also had a five-year option that eventually was never exercised. A $12-million conversion of an 82,000-square-foot warehouse into what would become the first ARCO Arena was announced on October 15, 1984. The transfer of the Kings to Sacramento was officially approved by NBA team owners on April 16, 1985, with the only contingency being the construction of an arena seating more than 16,000.\n1985\u20131991: Early years of the Sacramento Kings.\nThe Kings moved to their current home of Sacramento, California in the 1985\u201386 NBA season, with their first Sacramento season ending in the first round of the Western Conference 1986 NBA playoffs. The starting lineup was Reggie Theus, LaSalle Thompson, Mark Olberding, Terry Tyler, and Mike Woodson, with Larry Drew, Eddie Johnson, Otis Thorpe, and Joe Kleine coming off the bench. However, despite fan loyalty the Kings saw little success in subsequent seasons, and the team did not make the playoffs again until the 1996 NBA playoffs in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. Some of their failure was attributable to misfortunes such as the career-altering car crash suffered by promising point guard Bobby Hurley in 1993, and the suicide of Ricky Berry during the 1989 off-season; some was attributed to poor management such as the long tenure of head coach Garry St. Jean and the selection of \"Never Nervous\" Pervis Ellison with the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft. Former Kings television broadcaster Jerry Reynolds (1987, 1988\u201390) and NBA legend Bill Russell (1987\u201388) were the earliest head coaches.\n1988\u20131989: Ricky Berry.\nRicky Berry was selected by the Kings in the first round, 18th pick overall in the 1988 NBA draft. He had a dazzling rookie year in the 1988\u201389 season shooting 40.6 percent from the three-point range. The Kings also drafted Vinny Del Negro (selected by the Kings in the second round, 29th overall pick in the 1988 NBA draft) and acquired Rodney McCray from the Houston Rockets. In his first year with the Kings, McCray made 1988 NBA All-Defensive First Team. It was the first season the Kings would play without Reggie Theus and LaSalle Thompson (both part in the original team from Kansas City) or Joe Kleine (selected by the Kings as first round, sixth pick overall in the 1985 NBA draft). Thompson was drafted by the Kings in the first round, fifth overall pick in the 1982 NBA draft. It was also the last year that Michael Jackson (selected by the New York Knicks in the second round, 47th pick overall in the 1986 NBA draft but who played his entire career with the Kings) and Ed Pinckney (selected 10th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 1985 NBA draft and played for the Kings from 1987 to 1989) played for the Kings. On February 23, 1989, Brad Lohaus and Danny Ainge were traded to the Kings from the Boston Celtics for Joe Kleine and Ed Pinckney. In June of the 1989 off-season, Lohaus was then acquired by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA expansion draft. In August of the 1989 off-season, Berry was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Fair Oaks, California, at age 24 following an argument with his wife.\n1989\u20131990: Pervis Ellison.\nFollowing the loss of Ricky Berry, 1989\u201390 season featured Pervis Ellison, who was first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft by the Kings, and acquisition Wayman Tisdale (from the Indiana Pacers, second pick overall in the 1985 NBA draft). An injury kept Ellison on the sidelines for 48 of 82 games of his rookie year, after which he was traded to the Washington Bullets. Tisdale would go on to play for the Kings for five years. It was the last season that Danny Ainge, Kenny Smith (who had an impressive showing in the 1990 NBA Slam Dunk Contest), Rodney McCray, Harold Pressley (selected by the Kings in the first round, 17th overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft), Vinny Del Negro, Greg Kite, and Ralph Sampson played for the Kings. In 1990, Ainge was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, Kenny Smith was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, and Rodney McCray was traded to the Dallas Mavericks.\n1990\u20131991: Lionel Simmons.\nLionel Simmons\u2014nicknamed L-Train\u2014was drafted by the Kings in the 1990 NBA draft in the first round, 7th pick overall. In his first season, he made the NBA All-Rookie First Team. He would go on to play his entire career (1990\u20131997) with the Kings and had 5,833 career points. Antoine Carr (acquired from the Atlanta Hawks) played for the Kings in the 1990\u201391 NBA season and then was traded to the San Antonio Spurs. Free-agent Leon Wood, who would later become an NBA official, played for the Kings but was let go on Christmas Eve of 1990. Also notable that Bill Wennington was acquired from the Dallas Mavericks and played for the Kings for the 1990\u201391 season and after a successful career with the Chicago Bulls returned to the Kings for his final season in 1999\u20132000.\n1991\u20131998: The Mitch Richmond era.\nThe early 1990s were difficult for the Kings. Sacramento was known for having strong fan support, and while they won over 60 percent of their home games, the team struggled on the road, going 1\u201340 on the road in a single season. But prayers were answered when they acquired Mitch Richmond, who previously played for the Golden State Warriors. The former NBA Rookie of the Year was selected as an All-Star six times while making the All-NBA Second Team three times. Garry St. Jean was chosen as new coach in 1992 and coached the team all the way through 1997, where he was replaced by Eddie Jordan.\nDuring the 1990s, Sacramento had other stars like Spud Webb, Kurt Rambis, Wayman Tisdale, Walt Williams, Olden Polynice and Brian Grant, but they only lasted with the team for a few years. After the 1992\u201393 season, Rambis was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the 1993\u201394 season, Tisdale was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After the 1994\u201395 season, Webb was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyrone Corbin. Midway through the 1995\u201396 season, Williams was traded to the Miami Heat for Billy Owens (who was drafted by the Kings in 1991, and traded to Golden State for Richmond). After the 1996\u201397 season, Grant became a free agent and signed with the Portland Trail Blazers.\nOne accomplishment the team achieved under St. Jean during their tenures was a playoff appearance in 1996. The series was lost 3\u20131 to the Seattle SuperSonics who, led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, finished as that year's conference champions. They did not make a playoff appearance again while Richmond was still on the Kings. He was soon traded along with Otis Thorpe to the Washington Wizards for Chris Webber in May 1998. Although Richmond was lost, this trade proved to be one of the keys to finally achieving playoff success after so many seasons of mediocrity.\n1998\u20132006: \u201cThe Greatest Show on Court\".\nThe Kings drafted Jason Williams in the 1998 NBA draft, signed Vlade Divac, and traded for Chris Webber prior to the lockout-shortened season of 1998\u201399. These acquisitions coincided with the arrival of Peja Stojakovi\u0107 from PAOK BC (Greece), who had been drafted in 1996. Each of these moves was attributed to general manager Geoff Petrie, who has won the NBA Executive of the Year Award twice.\nLed by new head coach Rick Adelman, and aided by former Princeton head coach Pete Carril, the Kings' Princeton offense impressed others for its quick style and strong ball movement. Some criticized the Kings for their poor team defense, Williams's \"flash over substance\" style with its many turnovers, and Webber's failure to step up in important match-ups. Still, they quickly garnered many fans outside of California, many of whom were drawn to the spectacular pairing of Williams and Webber. In 1998\u201399, they went 27\u201323, their first winning season in nearly twenty years and their first since moving to Sacramento. The new arrivals Webber, Williams, and Divac all played key roles in this resurgence; Divac ranked near the top of the team in most statistics, Webber led the league in rebounds and was named to the All-NBA Second Team, and Williams was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. In the playoffs, they were matched up against the defending Western Conference Champions, the Utah Jazz. After winning game 1 by 20 points, the Jazz surrendered two consecutive playoff games to the Kings. They would turn the series around, however, and win the last two to keep the Kings from advancing in the playoffs.\nIn 1999\u20132000, the Kings' only notable transaction was trading shooting guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad to the Orlando Magic in exchange for veteran shooting guard Nick Anderson. They finished eighth in the Western Conference with a 44\u201338 record and were matched up with the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. Once again, however, the Kings failed to advance, losing the series 2\u20133 against the Lakers.\nThe following season, the Kings traded starting small forward Corliss Williamson to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard Doug Christie, a move made to improve the subpar defense. They also drafted Turkish power forward Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, further improving their bench rotation. Stojakovi\u0107 moved into the starting small forward role, where he and Webber proved to complement each other extremely well, and as the Kings continued to improve, their popularity steadily rose, culminating in a February 2001 \"Sports Illustrated\" cover story entitled \"The Greatest Show on Court\" with Williams, Christie, Stojakovi\u0107, Webber, and Divac gracing the cover. That year, they went 55\u201327, their best in 40 years. In the playoffs, they won their first series in 20 years, defeating the Phoenix Suns three games to one, before being swept in the second round by the Lakers, who eventually won the NBA Championship.\nIn July 2001, Jason Williams was traded, along with Nick Anderson, to the Vancouver Grizzlies for Mike Bibby and Brent Price. Despite Williams's often spectacular play, the Kings had grown tired of his recklessness and turnovers; Bibby would provide much more stability and control at the point guard position. This move was complemented by the re-signing of Webber to a maximum-salary contract, securing their superstar long term. With Bibby taking over for Williams, they had their best season to date in 2001\u201302. Though not as exciting or flashy as they had been in previous years with Williams, the team became much more effective and disciplined with Bibby at the helm. They finished with a league-best record of 61\u201321, winning 36 of 41 at home. After easily winning their first two playoff matchups against the Stockton and Malone-led Jazz and the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, respectively, the Kings went on to play the archrival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, regarded as one of the greatest playoff matchups in history. In a controversial series, the Kings lost in seven games, one game away from what would have been the first NBA Finals and a chance at the first professional sports championship in Sacramento history. This was a crushing blow to the Kings; after losing to their archrivals in a highly controversial series, the team would begin to decline and age in the years that followed. Many commentators and journalists would question the decisions made by the referees during game 6, specifically that the Lakers were awarded a staggering 27 free throws in the fourth quarter, many of which came from what were in retrospect proved to be no-calls. Following game 6 even print newspapers began to question the legitimacy of the game. Most notably, the \"New York Post\" ran a front cover with a headline entitled \"Foul Play\"; it also published a related article suggesting that the game was rigged. NBA analyst David Aldridge (then working for ESPN) spoke on the game:\nThe 2002 Western Conference finals left many fans wondering whether the Kings could have gone on to win a title, and debate would continue for many years after the events of the series. Later, due to allegations raised by former NBA referee Tim Donaghy, the NBA set up a review of the league's officiating. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led the review, concluded that while game 6 featured poor officiating, there was no concrete evidence that the game had been fixed.\nThe Kings went 59\u201323 and won the division during the following season, seeking to avenge their playoff loss to the Lakers. After defeating the Stockton- and Malone-led Jazz in the first round and winning game 1 against the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks in the second round, the Kings appeared to be on the brink of another Western Conference Finals berth. However, Chris Webber sustained a major knee injury in game 2, and the Kings lost in a seven-game series. Webber's knee required major surgery. He returned mid-season in 2003\u201304 a season in which the Kings were seeking another chance to avenge their playoff loss to the Lakers, but without his quickness and athleticism, which had been the focal point of his style of play, it was not the same. Despite that, the Kings still managed to defeat the Mavericks in the first round and after winning game 1 against the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round, the Kings appeared to be on the brink of their second Western Conference Finals berth in three years, but the Kings ended the season with a defeat to the Timberwolves in a seven-game series.\n2004\u20132006: Decline.\nThe 2004\u201305 season marked change for the Kings, who lost three starters from the famed 2002 team. In the off-season of 2004, Divac signed with the Lakers, which prompted the Kings to sign Brad Miller to start at center. Early in the season, Christie was traded to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley, and in February, Webber was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for three forwards (Corliss Williamson, Kenny Thomas, and Brian Skinner). Thomas and Skinner failed in their attempt to replicate Webber's impact, and as a result the team's record suffered. The Kings lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The 2005 off-season continued with changes, when they traded fan-favorite Bobby Jackson for Bonzi Wells and acquired free agent Shareef Abdur-Rahim.\nThe 2005\u201306 season started poorly since the Kings had a hard time establishing team chemistry. Newcomers Wells and Abdur-Rahim made major contributions early, but both were injured and missed a significant number of games. As the Kings' season continued, general manager Petrie decided to make a major move. Stojakovi\u0107 was traded for Ron Artest, a talented yet volatile forward known for his temper. Despite doubts that he would be able to replace the huge production of Stojakovi\u0107, Artest and the Kings went 20\u20139 after the 2006 NBA All-Star break, the second best post-All-Star break record that season. Despite a winning record of 44\u201338, it was clear that they were not the same team of years past. The Kings were seeded 8th in the Western Conference playoffs and were matched up in the first round against the San Antonio Spurs. Though the Kings were surprisingly competitive, the Spurs eliminated them 4\u20132. This was the end of their era of competitiveness and started a 16-year playoff drought which continued until 2023. The 2006 off-season began with the disturbing news that head coach Rick Adelman's contract would not be renewed. The Kings named Eric Musselman as his replacement.\n2006\u20132009: Change and transition.\nIn 2006\u201307, the disappointing play of the Kings was coupled with the distraction of legal troubles. Coach Eric Musselman pleaded no contest to DUI charges early in the season, while Artest got into trouble for neglect of his dogs, and was later accused of domestic assault. The Kings relieved Artest of basketball duties, pending investigation, then later reinstated him. They finished the season 33\u201349 (their worst in 9 years) which landed them in fifth place in the Pacific Division. They posted a losing record (20\u201321) at home for the first time since 1993\u201394. Their season included a seven-game losing streak that lasted from January 4 to 19. The Kings missed the 2007 NBA playoffs, the first time in eight seasons. Musselman was fired in April. The Kings' future appeared to rest on the shoulders of Kevin Martin, who was a lead candidate for 2007 NBA Most-Improved Player of the Year.\nThe 2007 off-season was a time of change. Head coach Musselman was replaced by former Kings player, Reggie Theus. The Kings selected Spencer Hawes with the 10th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. In addition, they acquired Mikki Moore from the New Jersey Nets. Martin signed a contract worth $55 million, extending his period with the team for five more years. The Kings lost key players over the off-season, with backup Ronnie Price leaving for the Utah Jazz, and Corliss Williamson retiring.\nThey claimed fourth-year Beno Udrih off waivers from Minnesota. Udrih quickly assumed the starting position for an injured Bibby. It was announced in February that the Kings had traded Bibby to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyronn Lue, Anthony Johnson, Shelden Williams, Lorenzen Wright and a 2nd round draft pick. The move was presumably made to clear cap space. Bibby had been the last player from the Kings team that reached the Western Conference Finals in 2002.\nThe Kings improved by five games and finished the 2007\u201308 season 38\u201344 and missed the playoffs by a bigger margin (12 games) than the previous season (8 games). They went 26\u201315 at home and 12\u201329 on the road. After selling out every home game since 1999, the 2007\u201308 season sold out only three games at ARCO Arena with attendance averaging 13,500 fans per home game, almost 4,000 below capacity.\nFollowing a quiet 2008 off-season, it was confirmed on July 29, 2008, that the Kings would trade Artest and the rights to Patrick Ewing Jr. and Sean Singletary to the Houston Rockets in exchange for former King Bobby Jackson, Dont\u00e9 Greene, a future first-round draft pick, and cash considerations for Rashad McCants and center Calvin Booth.\nReggie Theus was fired in the middle of the 2008\u201309 season, giving way to Kenny Natt as the interim head coach. The Kings continued to struggle under Natt, ending up with the NBA's worst record for the 2008\u201309 season at 17\u201365. On April 23, 2009, Kings' Vice President Geoff Petrie announced the firing of Natt and his four assistants, Rex Kalamian, Jason Hamm, Randy Brown and Bubba Burrage.\n2009\u20132012: Arrival of Tyreke Evans and DeMarcus Cousins.\nDespite having the best odds to win the top overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, the Kings obtained the 4th overall pick, the lowest they could possibly pick, to the outrage of many fans. Along with new head coach Paul Westphal, they selected Tyreke Evans. With the 23rd pick, they selected Omri Casspi from Israel.\nOn April 27, 2010, Evans was the first Sacramento-era player to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Evans also became the fourth player in NBA history to average 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie, joining Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James.\nOn June 24, 2010, the Kings selected DeMarcus Cousins with the 5th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also selected Hassan Whiteside with the 33rd pick of the 2010 NBA draft.\nDespite the excellent play of Cousins and Evans, both of whom were front-runners in Rookie of the Year voting and received All-Rookie First Team honors, the Kings still ranked near the bottom of the NBA, going 25\u201357 in Evans' rookie year, and 24\u201358 in Cousins' rookie year. Much of this was due to the poor fit of the roster around Evans and Cousins, and the uninspired coaching of Westphal.\nThe 2010\u201311 season was marked with uncertainty towards the end of the season. Frustrated by the lack of progress towards an arena and dwindling profits from other businesses, the Maloofs sought an immediate relocation of the franchise to Anaheim. The move seemed certain towards the end of the year, with Grant Napear and Jerry Reynolds emotionally signing off at the final home game vs. the Los Angeles Lakers. But after a vote by the NBA Board of Governors, the relocation effort was ended, to the glee of the fans.\nIn the 2011 NBA draft the Kings traded for the draft rights of Jimmer Fredette in a three-team deal with the Charlotte Bobcats and the Milwaukee Bucks, with the Kings receiving John Salmons sending Beno Udrih. This move was heavily panned by fans and media; by moving down in the draft and losing longtime starter Udrih for the unproductive Salmons, most found it difficult to find a bright spot in the deal. Westphal would shortly be fired, with Warriors assistant Keith Smart hired as his replacement. Around this time, the team took the slogan \"Here we rise!\" for its marketing campaign. Amidst various relocation rumors and locker room tensions, the Kings had yet another unsuccessful season. One of their few bright spots was rookie Isaiah Thomas. Due to criticisms about his height (5'9\" in shoes) and playmaking ability, Thomas slipped to the 60th and final pick of the draft. Despite this, and the presence of college superstar Fredette, Thomas earned the starting spot, finishing the season with averages of 11 points and 4 assists per game and earned a selection to the NBA All-Rookie team. In the 2012 NBA draft they selected Thomas Robinson out of Kansas.\nBecause of an unproductive rookie season by Robinson, he was traded with Francisco Garc\u00eda and Tyler Honeycutt to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Patterson, Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich.\n2013\u20132015: Franchise restructuring.\nOn May 16, 2013, the Maloof family reached agreement to sell the Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 for a then-record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million. Ranadiv\u00e9, 55, named Raj Bhathal, 71, founder of Tustin-based Raj Manufacturing, one of the largest swimwear companies in the nation, as one of the investors in a consortium to buy a majority stake in the Kings from the franchise's longtime owners, the Maloof family, for a reported $348 million. The group fought off a rival bid that would have moved the team to Seattle after the NBA's Board of Governors rejected investor Chris Hansen's bid to relocate the team. The new owners intend to keep the team in Sacramento. On May 28, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale, ending several years of efforts by other cities to take possession and move the Kings out of Sacramento. On May 31, 2013, the Kings closed escrow, finalizing the sale to the Ranadiv\u00e9 group at a record valuation of $534 million, beginning a new era for the franchise. Plans were already underway to move forward on an arena, as the Downtown Plaza was reportedly being sold to the Sacramento ownership group. A month later, on July 30, Turner Construction was selected to be the builder of the arena.\nOnce the sale had closed and ownership was transferred to Ranadiv\u00e9, the Kings began making changes to the management and staff. Geoff Petrie and Keith Smart were released; Michael Malone and Pete D'Alessandro were brought in to replace them. Corliss Williamson, Brendan Malone, Chris Jent, and Dee Brown were brought in as assistant coaches. On July 10, NBA executive Chris Granger was hired as team president. On September 23, 2013, Shaquille O'Neal purchased a minority share of the team, jokingly dubbing the team's new organization the \"Shaqramento Kings\".\nThese hires coincided with several roster moves. In the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Kings selected Kansas shooting guard Ben McLemore, who was widely projected to go top five, with the seventh overall pick. They also selected point guard and former McDonald's All-American Ray McCallum Jr. from the University of Detroit with the 36th pick. One week later, on July 5, the Kings sent former NBA Rookie of the Year Tyreke Evans to the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-team deal involving Robin Lopez, Greivis V\u00e1squez, Jeff Withey, Terrel Harris, and picks. On July 9, the Kings traded a future second-round draft pick to the Bucks in exchange for defensive small forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, and on July 15, the Kings signed Carl Landry, who had played a stint with the team in its previous ownership, to a 4-year deal worth $28 million.\nThe 2013\u201314 season was widely anticipated by Kings fans. Playing their first game on October 30, against the Nuggets, the Kings won 90\u201388, despite being without projected starters Landry and Mbah a Moute. They were led by a 30-point, 14-rebound performance from DeMarcus Cousins, and a putback dunk by Jason Thompson with under a minute to play which sealed the victory for the Kings.\nAfter the poor play of starting forwards John Salmons and Patrick Patterson through November, the Kings sought a change. On November 26, newly acquired Luc Richard Mbah a Moute was traded for power forward Derrick Williams. Nearly two weeks later, on December 8, they acquired Rudy Gay in a blockbuster seven-player deal that sent the struggling Patterson and Salmons to Toronto along with Chuck Hayes and off-season acquisition Greivis V\u00e1squez. Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray were also sent to the Kings. The organization sought to add depth to their lineup during the 2014 off-season to complement the Kings' star duo DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. Sacramento added Darren Collison, Ryan Hollins and Ramon Sessions through free agency signings, as well as drafting Nik Stauskas prior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season.\nAfter an 11\u201313 start to the 2014\u201315 season, head coach Michael Malone was fired by the Sacramento Kings organization. Tyrone Corbin filled in for the Kings until Hall of Fame coach George Karl replaced him in February 2015.\nOn January 30, 2015, DeMarcus Cousins was named to replace the injured Kobe Bryant as a Western Conference All-Star in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game. Cousins' selection marked the first time a Kings player earned All-Star honors since Brad Miller and Peja Stojakovi\u0107 represented Sacramento in 2004.\n2015\u20132017: Rise of Cousins.\nOn March 3, 2015, the Kings announced former Sacramento center Vlade Divac as the new vice president of basketball operations. Following the end of Sacramento's 29\u201353 season for 2014\u201315, The Kings made aggressive off-season moves in drafting Willie Cauley-Stein and acquiring Rajon Rondo, Kosta Koufos, Marco Belinelli, and Caron Butler in preparation for the 2015\u201316 season. To free up cap space, Divac traded Nik Stauskas, Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, a future top 10 protected first-round pick, and the right to swap two future first-round picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for the rights to second-round picks Art\u016bras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrovi\u0107. While the 76ers gave up nearly nothing to acquire draft assets that would result in the selection of number 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz, the Kings remained one of the worst teams in the NBA. It was regarded by many as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history.\nOn April 14, 2016, after a 33\u201349 season, the Kings fired head coach George Karl. Karl compiled a record of 44\u201368 with the Kings.\nThe 2016\u201317 season brought several changes. The Kings moved into their new arena, Golden 1 Center. On May 9, 2016, the Kings hired former Memphis Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger as head coach. During the 2016 NBA draft, the Kings traded the 8th pick to the Phoenix Suns for the 13th and 28th pick in the draft, as well as the rights to Serbian guard Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107. Later in the evening, the Kings traded Marco Belinelli to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for the 22nd pick in the draft. The Kings selected four players in the 2016 NBA draft\u2014Greek center Georgios Papagiannis with the 13th pick, Syracuse shooting guard Malachi Richardson with the 22nd pick, Kentucky forward Skal Labissiere with the 28th pick, and Oklahoma guard Isaiah Cousins with the 59th pick. In free agency, the Kings signed Anthony Tolliver, Garrett Temple, Arron Afflalo, Matt Barnes, and Ty Lawson.\n2017\u20132022: Post-Cousins Rebuild.\nOn February 20, 2017, the Kings traded DeMarcus Cousins, alongside Omri Casspi to the New Orleans Pelicans for Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield, Langston Galloway and two future draft picks. The Kings finished the 2016\u201317 season with a 32\u201350 record.\nIn the 2017 NBA draft the team selected Kentucky point guard De'Aaron Fox with the fifth pick. They also selected North Carolina forward Justin Jackson with the 15th pick, Duke center Harry Giles with the 20th pick, and Kansas point guard Frank Mason III with the 34th pick. With four rookie pickups, Divac wanted to add veteran presences on the roster. On July 10, 2017, the team signed three veterans\u2014Vince Carter, Zach Randolph, and George Hill.\nThe team finished the 2017\u201318 season with a 27\u201355 record, placing 12th in the Western Conference. Giles sat out the entire season due to a leg injury despite previous reports that he would make his rookie debut in January. Hill was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Greek center Papagiannis, who was selected in the first round of the 2016 draft, averaged only 2.1 points in the 16 games played.\nDuring the 2018 NBA draft, the Kings selected Duke center Marvin Bagley III. The team was criticized following the draft for not selecting Luka Don\u010di\u0107, while Divac would go on to say he was confident in Bagley. Prior to the 2018\u201319 season, multiple analysts picked Sacramento to finish last in the Western Conference, calling their recent draft a \"missed opportunity to build\" and their lack of a veteran presence to offset their rookie lineup. The Kings lost to the Utah Jazz 123\u2013117 in their season opener on October 17, 2018. Despite starting the season 1\u20133, including a loss to the Pelicans in which they gave up 149 points, the team would go onto win their next five games to hold a winning record. By December 30, the team held a 19\u201316 record. Ultimately, the Kings finished the season in ninth place in the Western Conference posting a record of 39\u201343; they again missed the playoffs. However, this was the team's best regular-season record since their last playoff appearance in the 2005\u201306 season. In spite of this, head coach Joerger was fired after the conclusion of the season, and Luke Walton was hired as his replacement three days later.\nEarlier in the season, the Kings were rocked by the discovery that their former chief revenue officer, Jeff David, had embezzled $13.4 million in sponsorship payments from the Kings and their corporate partners over four years. David, who had taken a similar position with the Miami Heat, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft and was sentenced to seven years in federal prison.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Kings were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. However, Sacramento finished these games with a 3\u20135 record, missing the play-in game and extending their playoff drought for the 14th consecutive season.\n2020: Arrival of Monte McNair.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Sacramento Kings announced that general manager Vlade Divac would resign from his position. Joe Dumars, a former player and executive for the Detroit Pistons, would be named interim Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations; Dumars had joined the Kings as a special advisor in June of the previous year.\nFollowing a month-long search, the Sacramento Kings announced on September 17, 2020, that Houston Rockets executive Monte McNair would be hired as the franchise's new general manager. With the Rockets, McNair spent thirteen years working under Daryl Morey, serving in various roles; he was most recently named assistant general manager in 2018. Following this hire, interim executive Joe Dumars was named as the chief strategy officer of the organization. Other candidates for the position included Minnesota Timberwolves executive vice president Sachin Gupta, Denver Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth, and former Atlanta Hawks general manager Wes Wilcox. McNair announced three additional hires on October 14, 2020; these included the aforementioned Wes Wilcox who became an assistant GM, former Philadelphia 76ers scouting director Phil Jabour as vice president of player personnel, and Oklahoma City Blue executive Paul Johnson as director of basketball operations.\nIn July 2021, Dyal Capital, a unit of Blue Owl Capital, began to solidify a deal investing in the basketball team, giving the investment firm a 5 percent stake in the team with a valuation of $1.5 billion, though another person familiar with the matter placed the valuation closer to $1.8 billion.\nIn the 2021 NBA draft, in order to improve their defense the Kings selected Davion Mitchell from Baylor University with the ninth pick.\nOn November 22, 2021, head coach Luke Walton was fired after a mediocre 6\u201311 start; he was then replaced by Alvin Gentry on an interim basis. For the 16th season in a row, the Sacramento Kings failed to reach the Playoffs, and thus passing the Los Angeles Clippers for the longest playoff drought in NBA history, the Kings also made a blockbuster trade at the trade deadline with the Indiana Pacers sending Tyrese Haliburton for Domantas Sabonis. Following the season, the Kings' fired Gentry as head coach.\n2022\u20132025: Fox and Sabonis Era.\nOn May 9, 2022, Golden State Warriors associate head coach Mike Brown was announced as the next head coach of the Kings. His tenure with the team began after the Warriors finished their 2021\u201322 season where they won the 2022 NBA championship. During the 2022\u201323 season, the Kings began lighting a large, purple beam into the night sky after every game won, inspiring chants of \"Light the Beam\" from the crowd at the end of victories at home.\nBoth De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis were named All-Stars and named to the All-NBA Third Team. On February 24, 2023, the Kings beat the host Los Angeles Clippers in double-overtime by the final score of 176\u2013175. It was the second-highest scoring game in NBA history behind a December 13, 1983, affair in which the Detroit Pistons beat the Denver Nuggets 186\u2013184 in triple-overtime. The game featured 44 combined three-pointers made, tied for the most in a game in NBA history and both teams shot over 58 percent from the field and over 80 percent free throws. It was also the first time in Kings franchise history in which two players scored at least 40 points in a game (Malik Monk scored a career-high 45, De'Aaron Fox had 42). On March 29, the Kings beat the Portland Trail Blazers 120\u201380 to clinch a playoff spot, breaking a 16-year playoff drought, which at the time was the longest active playoff drought in the four major North American sports. In the playoffs, they were defeated by the Golden State Warriors in seven games. Mike Brown was named NBA Coach Of The Year for his role in ending the playoff drought.\nThe next season, despite both Fox and Sabonis failing to return to the All-Star Team (though Sabonis was later named All-NBA Third Team and leading the league in double doubles and triple doubles), the Kings finished 46\u201336. However, they finished only 9th in that year's strong Western Conference. The Kings made the play-in tournament for the year, beating the Warriors in their first game but later losing to the New Orleans Pelicans.\nIn the offseason, the team acquired 6-time All-Star Demar DeRozan in a sign-and-trade deal. After a 13-18 start, the Kings fired Mike Brown just 18 months after he won Coach Of The Year. On 3 February 2025, the Kings completed a three-team trade, sending De'Aaron Fox to the Spurs while acquiring Zach LaVine from the Bulls. Sacramento also received Sidy Cissoko and a haul of draft picks, including a 2025 first-rounder from Charlotte.\nTeam logo, uniform and colors.\nRochester Royals.\nThe initial Rochester Royals logo featured a blue and white shield with the word \"ROCHESTER\" on the top, with a white banner with the word \"ROYALS\" on it. From the beginning, the road uniforms were blue with the city name written in front, while home uniforms were white with the team name written in front. Red accents were added later in their Rochester tenure.\nCincinnati Royals.\nUpon moving to Cincinnati in 1957, the team logo became a basketball with a cartoon face. The basketball was depicted as wearing a crown with the city of Cincinnati within it. The word \"CINCINNATI\" was featured above the logo while the word \"ROYALS\" was below. The crown also had the team name on it. This logo was white with blue outlines. The uniforms remained blue on the road and white at home, again with red accents and the city/team name designation on the respective uniforms.\nIn the late 1960s, the Royals wore a uniform with the team name written vertically on the left side, with the number on the right. In 1971, the team adopted a red crown with a blue half-basketball below it. The word \"CINCINNATI\", in blue, was placed above the logo. The word \"ROYALS\", in white, was placed on the crown. The logo change also reflected on the uniforms, now featuring a script 'Royals' in front with red numbers. However, blue names and numbers at home, and white names and numbers on the road were written at the back of the uniform, with the unusual arrangement of the number above the name being used for the first time (normally, the player's name is shown above the back number).\nKansas City\u2013Omaha/Kansas City Kings.\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the renamed and relocated Kansas City-Omaha Kings kept their uniforms and logos, with the exception of the name change. After settling in Kansas City for good in 1975, the Kings changed their road uniforms back to reading the city name in front. Beginning with the 1981\u201382 season, the road uniforms reverted to the team name in front, while numbers in front took on the same color schemes as the numbers in the back.\nSacramento Kings.\nFollowing their move from Kansas City in 1985 the Kings still used the same color scheme of red, white and blue. The logo of a crown atop a bottom half of the basketball was also carried over. However, the shades of blue used on their home and road uniforms were different for five seasons. The home uniforms use royal blue, while the road uniforms use powder blue. The striping patterns were also different between the two uniforms, with the script \"Kings\" wordmark on the sides of the road shorts, and basic side stripes on the home uniforms. Carrying over from Kansas City was the unusual placement of player names at the bottom of the number at the front of the uniforms.\nThe uniforms changed slightly in 1990, with royal blue now used on the road; the shorts now incorporate the Kings logo, and the name and number on the back switched places to the standard positions of the name being on the top, then the player's number below it. The player names were now in a standard monotone serif font which was used by several NBA teams. This version would mark the last time the classic script \"Kings\" wordmark was used until 2005.\nChange to purple and black.\nIn 1994, the Kings radically changed their look, adopting a new color scheme of purple, silver, black and white. This unique color combination was first adopted by the MLB's Colorado Rockies in 1993, and would later be used by the NHL's Los Angeles Kings between 1998 and 2011. The uniform set consists of one wide side stripe running through the right leg of the shorts, with the primary Kings logo prominently featured. The home uniform is in white, while the road uniform is in black. From 1994 to 1997, a half-purple, half-black uniform, featuring checkerboard side panels, was used as an alternate uniform, which was panned by fans. However, the uniform was revived for the 2012\u201313 season during Hardwood Classics Nights. A new purple uniform, which shares the same template from the home and road uniforms, was introduced in the 1997\u201398 season.\nBefore the start of the 2002\u201303 NBA season, the Kings changed their uniforms once again. This set included a modernized version of the \"Kings\" script on the home jersey, and the city name on the purple road jersey. The side stripes now run through the uniform. In the 2005\u201306 season they introduced a gold alternate uniform, featuring the classic script \"Kings\" wordmark. However, this alternate lasted only two seasons.\nIn 2008, the team introduced a new style of uniforms, with the names switching designations with a modernized \"Kings\" script on the road jersey in black text, and \"Sacramento\" on the home jersey still in white text. In doing this, the Kings became unique; most professional franchises place the team nickname on the home jerseys and the city name on the road jerseys. The numbers are black on both uniforms. The side panels were revamped, now only featured on the shorts and at the top half of the uniform. Before the 2011\u201312 season a black alternate uniform was introduced, sharing the same template as the home and road uniforms, but with the classic script \"Kings\" wordmark and silver numbers.\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Kings made a few tweaks to their home and away uniforms. While the team kept the 2008-era template, they brought back the 1994\u20132002 \"Kings\" script from the primary logo on both uniforms, along with purple (home) and white (away) numbers. The black alternate uniform was kept without any alterations. In addition, the crown logo at the back was replaced by the NBA logo, while a gold tab above it represents the franchise's 1951 NBA championship.\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the Kings changed their brand by adopting a logo reminiscent of their 1971\u20131994 design and dispatched black from their logo while keeping the purple and silver. The Kings unveiled their new uniforms on June 15, 2016, featuring four designs. Both the home white and purple away uniforms feature a modernized \"Kings\" script, an updated crown on top, and gray side stripes. The so-called 'City' uniforms are similar to the away uniforms, except that the abbreviation \"SAC\" in gray appears in front. The black 'Global' uniforms substitute the crown for a standing lion crest on top, along with a solid gray side stripe on the right and the primary logo on the left leg. All uniforms feature a baby blue collar, stitches, and tab that says \"Sacramento Proud\", a nod to the franchise's first few seasons in Sacramento.\nBeginning with the 2017\u201318 season, the jerseys will be sponsored by Blue Diamond Growers.\nAs part of the switch to Nike as the NBA's uniform provider, the home and away uniform designations were abolished. The Kings kept their uniforms mostly intact, but the erstwhile primary purple uniforms were retired in favor of the 'City' alternate purple uniforms. The Kings' primary uniform set now consists of the white 'Association' uniforms, the purple 'Icon' uniforms and the black 'Statement' uniforms.\nThe Kings announced an updated uniform set ahead of the 2023\u201324 season. The most notable change was that black became the primary color and purple relegated to accent color, along with a new \"Kings\" script heavily inspired by the team's uniforms from 1972 to 1994. The white \"Association\" uniform featured black letters and purple trim, along with purple, black and silver side stripes. The black \"Icon\" uniform featured white letters and purple trim, along with purple and silver side stripes. The \"Statement\" uniform drew inspiration from the alternate uniforms worn from 1994 to 1997, largely featuring purple with a black gradient along with purple and black checkerboard patterns on each side. The full team name, using the modern team wordmark, is emblazoned in front.\nCity special edition uniforms.\nNike also released a special edition 'City' uniform that pays tribute to both local culture and team heritage. Sacramento's 2017\u201318 'City' uniforms feature a white and powder blue base with red trim, echoing the road uniform colors the team wore from 1985 to 1990. A recolored lion head logo in red and gray is also emblazoned in front.\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Kings tweaked the 'City' uniforms, replacing the lion-head logo with the wordmark \"Sactown\". The same uniform design was carried over for the 2019\u201320 season, but with red as the base color and powder blue as the trim color.\nThe \"Sactown\" theme was retained for the 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, but with four design cues taken from prior uniforms. The black base paid homage to the 1994\u20132002 black uniforms. The checkerboard patterns were taken from their 1994\u20131997 purple/black alternate uniforms. The powder blue and red trim of the 1985\u20131990 road uniforms and of previous \"City\" uniforms were carried over to this design.\nThe 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform featured references of the Kings' previous uniform designs. The \"Sactown\" script and off-centered number arrangement paid homage to the Kings uniforms from 1971 to 1994. The black base and purple trim honored the 1994\u20132002 uniforms, and a modified version of the Rochester Royals' logo on the waist was a tribute to the original incarnation of the franchise.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform featured a gray base and purple trim, and was inspired by the team's near-relocation in 2012 and eventual sale to Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9. The gray base was taken from exterior of the team's current home, Golden 1 Center.\nThe 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform was heavily inspired by the Cincinnati Royals uniforms worn in the late 1960s, featuring a vertically arranged \"Kings\" wordmark in a white stripe, red borders, silver sleeve stripes, and blue base. The uniform commemorated the centennial anniversary of the franchise, dating back to its early years as the Rochester Seagrams. The Cincinnati theme was revisited in the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, with the \"Kings\" block lettering based on the team's warmup jackets in the late 1960s.\nThe 2025\u201326 \"City\" uniform was a remix of their 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, this time featuring a deep ink purple base and bright violet accents; this honored the now-iconic \"Light the Beam\" celebrations after home victories which started in that season.\nClassic uniforms.\nDuring the 2002\u201303 season, the Kings brought back the 1960s Cincinnati Royals white uniform for a few games as a tribute to Oscar Robertson. The following season, they wore the mid-1970s Kansas City Kings white uniform for select games to honor Nate Archibald.\nThe Kings' mid-1980s powder blue jerseys were first brought back in the 2004\u201305 season to celebrate the franchise's 20th season in Sacramento. They would return in 2015\u201316 for the team's final season at Sleep Train Arena, and the following season upon moving to Golden 1 Center.\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, the Kings honored the 1950\u201351 Rochester Royals championship team by wearing throwback uniforms from that era. The team also wore blue versions of the Rochester throwbacks in the 2014\u201315 season.\nFor the 2019\u201320 season, the Kings brought back their blue uniforms worn from 1990 to 1994 in commemoration of the franchise's 35th season in Sacramento.\nAhead of the 2024\u201325 season, the Kings unveiled their classic uniform as part of the team's 40th season in Sacramento. The style was based on the 2002 to 2008 purple uniform.\nMascot.\nSince the 1997\u201398 season, the official Kings mascot has been Slamson the Lion. Prior to that, the Kings mascot was \"The Gorilla.\"\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Kings. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Sacramento Kings seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nRivalries.\nPrior to moving to Ohio, the Royals' biggest rival was the Syracuse Nationals, which went on to become the Philadelphia 76ers. This left upstate New York without a team until the Buffalo Braves were established in 1970. This third attempt did not last, with the Braves moving to San Diego, California in 1978 to become the .\nIn 1970, the Cleveland Cavaliers were established. This brought a new rival for the Royals, as well as a new team in Ohio. This rivalry did not last, and the Royals moved to Kansas City only a few years later. Although the NBA previously had a team in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of the St. Louis Hawks, that team moved to Atlanta in 1968, thus preventing a potential new rivalry for the Kings. This made the Kings the first team in the state in four years. 13 years later, the Kings moved to California, leaving Missouri without a team.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6. The Lakers would win the series in game 7.\nGolden State Warriors.\nSince the Kings relocated to Sacramento in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Golden State Warriors, as both teams are based in Northern California, with Sacramento and San Francisco located 86 miles apart from one another. However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the playoffs until 2023, where they faced off in the first round. In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Domantas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest, resulting in Green being suspended in game 3, and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity), the Warriors defeated the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals. The series drew the highest first- and second-round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Kings hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nAll of the Kings retired numbers are hanging in the rafters of Golden 1 Center.\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike regular bonds, it does not make periodic interest payments or have so-called coupons, hence the term zero-coupon bond. When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include US Treasury bills, US savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons. Zero coupon and deep discount bonds are terms that are used interchangeably.\nIn contrast, an investor who has a regular bond receives income from coupon payments, which are made semi-annually or annually. The investor also receives the principal or face value of the investment when the bond matures.\nSome zero coupon bonds are inflation indexed, and the amount of money that will be paid to the bond holder is calculated to have a set amount of purchasing power, rather than a set amount of money, but most zero coupon bonds pay a set amount of money known as the face value of the bond.\nZero coupon bonds may be long or short-term investments. Long-term zero coupon maturity dates typically start at ten to fifteen years. The bonds can be held until maturity or sold on secondary bond markets. Short-term zero coupon bonds generally have maturities of less than one year and are called bills. The US Treasury bill market is the most active and liquid debt market in the world.\nStrip bonds.\nZero coupon bonds have a duration equal to the bond's time to maturity, which makes them sensitive to any changes in the interest rates. Investment banks or \"dealers\" may separate coupons from the principal of coupon bonds, which is known as the residue, so that different investors may receive the principal and each of the coupon payments. That creates a supply of new zero coupon bonds.\nThe coupons and residue are sold separately to investors. Each of the investments then pays a single lump sum. That method of creating zero coupon bonds is known as \"stripping\", and the contracts are known as strip bonds. \"STRIPS\" stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities.\nDealers normally purchase a block of high-quality and non-callable bonds, often government issues, to create strip bonds. A strip bond has no reinvestment risk because the payment to the investor occurs only at maturity.\nThe impact of interest rate fluctuations on strip bonds, known as the bond duration, is higher than for a coupon bond. A zero coupon bond always has a duration equal to its maturity, and a coupon bond always has a lower duration. Strip bonds are normally available from investment dealers maturing at terms up to 30 years. For some Canadian bonds, the maturity may be over 90 years.\nIn Canada, investors may purchase packages of strip bonds, so that the cash flows are tailored to meet their needs in a single security. These packages may consist of a combination of interest (coupon) and/or principal strips.\nIn New Zealand, bonds are stripped first into two pieces\u2014the coupons and the principal. The coupons may be traded as a unit or further subdivided into the individual payment dates.\nIn most countries, strip bonds are primarily administered by a central bank or central securities depository. An alternative form is to use a custodian bank or trust company to hold the underlying security and a transfer agent/registrar to track ownership in the strip bonds and to administer the program. Physically created strip bonds (where the coupons are physically clipped and then traded separately) were created in the early days of stripping in Canada and the U.S., but have virtually disappeared due to the high costs and risks associated with them.\nUses.\nPension funds and insurance companies like to own long maturity zero coupon bonds because of their high duration. That means that the bonds' prices are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate, and so offset, or immunize, the interest rate risk of the firms' long-term liabilities.\nTaxes.\nIn the United States, a zero-l coupon bond has original issue discount (OID) for tax purposes. Instruments issued with OID generally impute the receipt of interest, sometimes called phantom income, even though the bonds do not pay periodic interest.\nTherefore, zero coupon bonds subject to US taxation should generally be held in tax-deferred retirement accounts, to avoid taxes being paid on future income. Alternatively, when a zero coupon bond issued by a US state or local government entity is purchased, the imputed interest is free of U.S. federal taxes and, in most cases, state and local taxes.\nZero coupon bonds were first introduced in the 1960s but did not become popular until the 1980s. The use of such instruments was aided by an anomaly in the US tax system, which allowed for deduction of the discount on bonds relative to their par value. The rule ignored the compounding of interest and led to significant tax-savings when the interest is high or the security has long maturity. Although the tax loopholes were closed quickly, the bonds themselves have remained desirable because of their simplicity.\nIn India, the tax on income from deep discount bonds can arise in two ways: interest or capital gains. It is also a law that interest has to be shown on an accrual basis for deep discount bonds issued after February 2002, as per CBDT circular No 2 of 2002, dated 15 February 2002.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They became especially popular in the 19th century in Europe and the United States, inciting opposition from some writers of Romantic poetry. A few have survived into the 21st century and are on public display. Typically shown in rotundas for viewing, panoramas were meant to be so lifelike they confused the spectator between what was real and what was image.\nIn China, panoramic paintings are an important subset of handscroll paintings, with some famous examples being \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\" and \"Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River\".\nHistory.\nThe word \"panorama\", a portmanteau of the Greek words \u2018\"pano\"\u2019 (all) and \u2018\"horama\"\u2019 (view), was coined by the Irish painter Robert Barker in 1787. While walking on Calton Hill overlooking Edinburgh, the idea struck him and he obtained a patent for it the same year. Barker's patent included the first coining of the word \"panorama\". Barker's vision was to capture the magnificence of a scene from every angle so as to immerse the spectator completely, and in so doing, blur the line where art stopped and reality began.\nBarker's first panorama was of Edinburgh. He exhibited the \"Panorama of Edinburgh From Calton Hill\" in his house in 1788, and later in Archers' Hall near the Meadows to public acclaim. The first panorama disappointed Barker, not because of its lack of success, but because it fell short of his vision. The Edinburgh scene was not a full 360 degrees; it was semi-circular.\nIn 1792 he used the term to describe his paintings of Edinburgh, Scotland, shown on a cylindrical surface, which he soon was exhibiting in London, as \"The Panorama\".\nAfter the commercial but limited technical success of his first panorama, Barker and his son Henry Aston Barker completed a panorama of London from the Albion Mills. A reduced version was originally shown in their house with a larger one on display later.\nTo fulfill his dream of a 360 panorama, Barker and his son purchased a rotunda at Leicester Square. http:// christened the new rotunda, all 250 square meters of it. The previously reduced version, in contrast, measured only 137 square meters.\nThe rotunda at Leicester Square was composed of two levels, although they varied in size. Spectators observed the scenes from a platform in the center of the rotunda.\nIn 1793 Barker moved his panoramas to the first brick panorama rotunda building in the world, in Leicester Square, and made a fortune. Viewers flocked to pay a stiff 3 shillings to stand on a central platform under a skylight, which offered an even lighting, and get an experience that was \"panoramic\" (an adjective that didn't appear in print until 1813). The extended meaning of a \"comprehensive survey\" of a subject followed sooner, in 1801. Visitors to Barker's Panorama of London, painted as if viewed from the roof of Albion Mills on the South Bank, could purchase a series of six prints that modestly recalled the experience; end-to-end the prints stretched 3.25\u00a0metres. In contrast, the actual panorama spanned 250 square metres.\nThe main goal of the panorama was to immerse the audience to the point where they could not tell the difference between the canvas and reality, in other words, wholeness. To accomplish this, all borders of the canvas had to be concealed. Props were also strategically positioned in the foreground of the scene to increase realism. Two windows laid into the roof allowed natural light to flood the canvases, also making the illusion more realistic.\nTwo scenes could be exhibited at the rotunda in Leicester Square simultaneously; however, the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only rotunda to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience was herded down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds. The idea was to have spectators more or less forget what they just saw, leaving their minds blank to view the second scene.\nDespite the audience's \"mind blanking\" walk in the dark, panoramas were designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer. For some, this attribute placed panoramas in the same category as propaganda of the period: no more than an illusion meant to deceive.\nBarker's accomplishment involved sophisticated manipulations of perspective not encountered in the panorama's predecessors, the wide-angle \"prospect\" of a city familiar since the 16th century, or Wenceslas Hollar's \"Long View of London from Bankside\", etched on several contiguous sheets. When Barker first patented his technique in 1787, he had given it a French title: \"La Nature \u00e0 Coup d' Oeil\" (\"Nature at a glance\"). A sensibility to the \"picturesque\" was developing among the educated class, and as they toured picturesque districts, like the Lake District, they might have in the carriage with them a large lens set in a picture frame, a \"landscape glass\" that would contract a wide view into a \"picture\" when held at arm's length.\nBarker made many efforts to increase the realism of his scenes. To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed. Props were also strategically positioned on the platform where the audience stood and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases.\nTwo scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously; however, the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to do so. Houses with single scenes proved more popular to audiences as the fame of the panorama spread. Because the Leicester Square rotunda housed two panoramas, Barker needed a mechanism to clear the minds of the audience as they moved from one panorama to the other. To accomplish this, patrons walked down a dark corridor and up a long flight of stairs where their minds were supposed to be refreshed for viewing the new scene. Due to the immense size of the panorama, patrons were given orientation plans to help them navigate the scene. These glorified maps pinpointed key buildings, sites, or events exhibited on the canvas.\nTo create a panorama, artists travelled to the sites and sketched the scenes multiple times. Typically a team of artists worked on one project with each team specializing in a certain aspect of the painting such as landscapes, people or skies. After completing their sketches, the artists typically consulted other paintings, of average size, to add further detail. Martin Meisel described the panorama: \"In its impact, the Panorama was a comprehensive form, the representation not of the segment of a world, but of a world entire seen from a focal height.\" Though the artists painstakingly documented every detail of a scene, by doing so they created a world complete in and of itself.\nThe first panoramas depicted urban settings, such as cities, while later panoramas depicted nature and famous military battles. The necessity for military scenes increased in part because so many were taking place. French battles commonly found their way to rotundas thanks to the feisty leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte. Henry Aston Barker's travels to France during the Peace of Amiens led him to court, where Bonaparte accepted him. Henry Aston created panoramas of Bonaparte's battles including \"The Battle of Waterloo\", which saw so much success that he retired after finishing it. Henry Aston's relationship with Bonaparte continued following Bonaparte's exile to Elba, where Henry Aston visited the former emperor. Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter) (1764\u20131823) was the first important French panorama painter. Among his 17 panoramas, the most famous describe the cities of Rome, Naples, Amsterdam, Jerusalem, Athens and also the battle of Wagram.\nOutside of England and France, the popularity of panoramas depended on the type of scene displayed. Typically, people wanted to see images from their own countries or from England. This principle rang true in Switzerland, where views of the Alps dominated. Likewise in America, New York City panoramas found popularity, as well as imports from Barker's rotunda. As painter John Vanderlyn soon found out, French politics did not interest Americans. In particular, his depiction of Louis XVIII's return to the throne did not live two months in the rotunda before a new panorama took its place.\nBarker's Panorama was hugely successful and spawned a series of \"immersive\" panoramas: the Museum of London's curators found mention of 126 panoramas that were exhibited between 1793 and 1863. In Europe, panoramas were created of historical events and battles, notably by the Russian painter Franz Roubaud. Most major European cities featured more than one purpose-built structure hosting panoramas. These large fixed-circle panoramas declined in popularity in the latter third of the nineteenth century, though in the United States they experienced a partial revival; in this period, they were more commonly referred to as cycloramas.\nThe panorama competed for audiences most frequently with the diorama, a slightly curved or flat canvas extending 22 by 14\u00a0metres. The diorama was invented in 1822 by Louis Daguerre and Charles-Marie Bouton, the latter a former student of the renowned French painter Jacques-Louis David.\nUnlike the panorama where spectators had to move to view the scene, the scenes on the diorama moved so the audience could remain seated. Accomplished with four screens on a roundabout, the illusion captivated 350 spectators at a time for a period of 15\u00a0minutes. The images rotated in a 73 degree arc, focusing on two of the four scenes while the remaining two were prepared, which allowed the canvases to be refreshed throughout the course of the show. While topographical detail was crucial to panoramas, as evidenced by the teams of artists who worked on them, the effect of the illusion took precedence with the diorama. Painters of the diorama also added their own twist to the panorama's props, but instead of props to make the scenes more real, they incorporated sounds. Another similarity to the panorama was the effect the diorama had on its audience. Some patrons experienced a stupor, while others were alienated by the spectacle. The alienation of the diorama was caused by the connection the scene drew to art, nature and death. After Daguerre and Bouton's first exhibition in London, one reviewer noted a stillness like that \"of the grave.\" To remedy this tomblike atmosphere Daguerre painted both sides of the canvas, known as \"the double effect.\" By lighting both painted sides of the canvas, light was transmitted and reflected producing a type of transparency producing the effect of time passing. This effect gave the crew operating the lights and turning the roundabout a new type of control over the audience than the panorama ever had.\nIn Britain and particularly in the US, the panoramic ideal was intensified by unrolling a canvas-backed scroll past the viewer in a \"Moving Panorama,\" an alteration of an idea that was familiar in the hand-held landscape scrolls of Song dynasty. First unveiled in 1809 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panorama in a rotunda. A precursor to \"moving\" pictures, the moving panorama incorporated music, sound effects and stand-alone cut-outs to create their mobile effect. Such a traveling motion allowed for new types of scenes, such as chase sequences, that could not be produced so well in either the diorama or the panorama. In contrast specifically to the diorama, where the audience seemed to be physically rotated, the moving panorama gave patrons a new perspective, allowing them to \"[function] as a moving eye\".\nThe panorama evolved somewhat and in 1809, the moving panorama graced the stage in Edinburgh. Unlike its predecessor, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers. The scene or variation of scenes passed before the audience between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panoramas in a rotunda. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century.\nDespite the success of the moving panorama, Barker's original vision maintained popularity through various artists, including Pierre Pr\u00e9vost, Charles Langlois and Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux among others. The revival in popularity for the panorama peaked in the 1880s, having spread through Europe and North America.\nRomantic criticism of panoramas.\nThe panorama's rise in popularity was a result of its accessibility in that people did not need a certain level of education to enjoy the views it offered. Accordingly, patrons from across the social scale flocked to rotundas throughout Europe.\nWhile easy access was an attraction of the panorama, some people believed it was nothing more than a parlor trick bent on deceiving its public audience. Designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer, the panorama was placed in the same category as propaganda of the period, which was also seen as deceitful. The locality paradox also attributed to the arguments of panorama critics. A phenomenon resulting from immersion in a panorama, the locality paradox happened when people were unable to distinguish where they were: in the rotunda or at the scene they were seeing.\nPeople could immerse themselves in the scene and take part in what became known as the locality paradox. The locality paradox refers to the phenomenon where spectators are so taken with the panorama they cannot distinguish where they are: Leicester Square or, for example, the Albion Mills.\nThis association with delusion was a common critique of panoramas. Writers also feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. Hester Piozzi was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason. She did not like seeing so many people \u2013 elite and otherwise \u2013 fooled by something so simple.\nAnother problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with, namely, by redefining the sublime to incorporate the material. In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes and in so doing, made the sublime accessible to every person with 3 shillings in his or her pocket. The sublime became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity. By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat to romanticism, which was obsessed with the sublime. According to the romantics, the sublime was never supposed to include materiality and by linking the two, panoramas tainted the sublime.\nThe poet William Wordsworth has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of \"The Prelude\". It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity. He felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence. Wordsworth was offended by the fact that so many people found panoramas irresistible and concluded that people were not smart enough to see through the charade. Because of his argument in \"The Prelude\", it is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which one he saw; there is no substantial proof he ever went, other than his description in the poem.\nHowever, Wordsworth's hatred of the panorama was not limited to its deceit. The panorama's association with the sublime was likewise offensive to the poet as were other spectacles of the period that competed with reality. As a poet, Wordsworth sought to separate his craft from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population. In this context, phantasmagoria refers to signs and other circulated propaganda, including billboards, illustrated newspapers and panoramas themselves. Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their pretense: the panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. For Wordsworth, panoramas more or less brainwashed their audiences. Perhaps Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their popularity. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation depicted in the panorama and appreciate it for what it was \u2013 art.\nConversely, J. Jennifer Jones argues Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but rather hesitant about it. In her essay, \"Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama\", Jones argues that other episodes of \"The Prelude\" have just as much sensory depth as panoramas are supposed to have had. Jones studied how Wordsworth imitated the senses in \"The Prelude,\" much in the same way panoramas did. She concluded that panoramas were a balancing act between what the senses absorbed and what they came away with, something also present in Wordsworth's poetry. By her results then, Wordsworth's similar imitation of the senses proves he was not entirely opposed to them.\nThe subjects of panoramas transformed as time passed, becoming less about the sublime and more about military battles and biblical scenes. This was especially true during the Napoleonic era when panoramas often displayed scenes from the emperor's latest battle whether a victory or a crushing defeat such as depicted in the \"Battle of Waterloo\" in 1816.\nA modern take on the panorama believes the enormous paintings filled a hole in the lives of those who lived during the nineteenth century. Bernard Comment said in his book \"The Painted Panorama,\" that the masses needed \"absolute dominance\" and the illusion offered by the panorama gave them a sense of organization and control. Despite the power it wielded, the panorama detached audiences from the scene they viewed, replacing reality and encouraging them to watch the world rather than experience it.\nSurviving panoramas.\nRelatively few of these unwieldy ephemera survive. The oldest known surviving panorama (completed in 1814 by ) is on display at Schadau Castle, depicting an average morning in the Swiss town of Thun. As of today it is owned by the Gottfried Keller Foundation. Another rare surviving great-circle panorama is the Panorama Mesdag, completed in 1881 and housed in a purpose-built museum in The Hague, showing the dunes of nearby Scheveningen. Both of these works are considered of interest as they depict domestic scenes of their times. Depictions of warfare were more common as subject matter, an example of which is located at the battlefield of Waterloo, depicting the battle.\nAn exhibition \"Panoramania\" was held at the Barbican in the 1980s, with a catalog by Ralph Hyde. The Rac\u0142awice Panorama, currently located in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, is a monumental (15 \u00d7 120\u00a0metre) panoramic painting depicting the Battle of Rac\u0142awice, during the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising. A panorama of the Battle of Stalingrad is on display at Mamayev Kurgan. Among Franz Roubaud's great panoramas, those depicting the Siege of Sevastopol (1905) and Battle of Borodino (1911) survive, although the former was damaged during the Siege of Sevastopol (1942) and the latter was transferred to Poklonnaya Gora. The Pleven Panorama in Pleven, Bulgaria, depicts the events of the Siege of Plevna in 1877 on a 115\u00d715-metre canvas with a 12-meter foreground.\nFive large panoramas survive in North America: the Cyclorama of Jerusalem (a.k.a. the Panorama of Jerusalem at the Moment of Christ's Death) at St. Anne, outside of Quebec City; the Gettysburg Cyclorama depicting Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; John Vanderlyn's Panorama of the Garden and Palace of Versailles at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Atlanta Cyclorama, which depicts the Battle of Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia. A fifth panorama, also depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, was willed in 1996 to Wake Forest University in North Carolina; it is in poor condition and not on public display. It was purchased in 2007 by a group of North Carolina investors who hope to resell it to someone willing to restore it. Only pieces survive of a massive cyclorama depicting the Battle of Shiloh.\nIn the area of the moving panorama, there are somewhat more extant, though many are in poor repair and the conservation of such enormous paintings poses very expensive problems. The most notable rediscovered panorama in the United States was the Great Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress, which was found in storage at the York Institute now the Saco Museum in Saco, Maine, by its former curator Tom Hardiman. It was found to incorporate designs by many of the leading painters of its day, including Jasper Francis Cropsey, Frederic Edwin Church, and Henry Courtney Selous (Selous was the in-house painter for the original Barker panorama in London for many years.)\nThe St. Louis Art Museum owns another moving panorama, which it is conserving in public during the summers of 2011 and 2012. \"The Panorama of the Monumental Grandeur of the Mississippi Valley\"\u2014the only remaining of six known Mississippi River panorama paintings\u2014measures wide by long and was commissioned c.\u20091850 by an eccentric amateur archaeologist named Montroville W. Dickeson. Judith H. Dobrzynski wrote about the restoration in https://.\nIn 1918, the New Bedford Whaling Museum acquired the http://, created by artists Benjamin Russell and Caleb Purrington in 1848. At about long and high, it is one of the largest surviving moving panoramas (although far short of the \"Three Miles [4800\u00a0m] of Canvass\" advertised by its creators in their handbills). The museum is currently planning for the http:// of the Grand Panorama. Although in storage, highlights may be seen on the museum's https:// pages\nAnother moving panorama was donated to the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University Library in 2005. Painted in Nottingham, England around 1860 by John James Story (d. 1900), it depicts the life and career of the great Italian patriot, Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807\u20131882). The panorama stands about high and long, painted on both sides in watercolor. Numerous battles and other dramatic events in his life are depicted in 42 scenes, and the original narration written in ink survives.\nThe \"Arrival of the Hungarians\", a vast cyclorama by \u00c1rp\u00e1d Feszty \"et al.\", completed in 1894, is displayed at the \u00d3pusztaszer National Heritage Park in Hungary. It was made to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the 895 conquest of the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarians.\nThe Cyclorama of Early Melbourne, by artist John Hennings in 1892, still survives albeit having suffered water damage during a fire. Painted from a panoramic sketch of Early Melbourne in 1842 by Samuel Jackson. It places the viewer on top of the partially constructed Scott's Church on Collins Street in the Melbourne CBD. Commissioned to celebrate 50 years of the city of Melbourne, it was displayed in the Melbourne Exhibition Building for nearly 30 years before being taken into storage. Relatively small for a Cyclorama, it measured long and high.\nThe Biological museum (Stockholm), founded by hunter and taxidermist Gustaf Kolthoff, opened its dioramas to the public in November 1893 and is still an active museum with about 15000 visitors yearly. The museum has panorama paintings by Bruno Liljefors (assisted by Gustaf Fj\u00e6stad), Kjell Kolthoff and several hundred preserved animals in their natural habitats.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72903", "revid": "50461682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72903", "title": "Canvas", "text": "Extremely heavy-duty plain-woven fabric\nCanvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, shelters, as a support for oil painting and for other items for which sturdiness is required, as well as in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes. It is popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame.\nAlthough historically made from hemp, modern canvas is usually made of cotton, linen, or sometimes polyvinyl chloride (PVC). It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave. Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck. The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven. The term \"duck\" comes from the Dutch word for cloth, \"doek\". In the United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number system. The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number 10 canvas is lighter than number 4.\nThe word \"canvas\" is derived from the 13th century Anglo-French \"canevaz\" and the Old French \"canevas\". Both may be derivatives of the Vulgar Latin \"cannapaceus\" for \"made of hemp\", originating from the Greek (cannabis).\nFor painting.\nCanvas has become a common support medium for oil painting, acrylic painting, pour paint, watercolor, etc., replacing wooden panels. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French \"Madonna with angels\" from around 1410 in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. Its use in \"Saint George and the Dragon\" by Paolo Uccello in about 1470, and Sandro Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus\" in the 1480s was still unusual for the period. Large paintings for country houses were more likely to be on canvas, as it was less expensive than panel painting. Another common category of paintings on lighter cloth such as linen was in distemper or glue, often used for banners to be carried in procession. This is a less durable medium, and surviving examples such as Dirk Bouts' \"Entombment\", in distemper on linen (1450s, National Gallery) are rare, and often rather faded in appearance.\nPanel painting remained more common until the 16th century in Italy and the 17th century in Northern Europe. Mantegna and Venetian artists were among those leading the change; Venetian sail canvas was readily available and regarded as the best quality.\nCanvas is usually stretched across a wooden frame called a stretcher and may be coated with gesso prior to being used to prevent oil paint from coming into direct contact with the canvas fibers which would eventually cause the canvas to decay. A traditional and flexible chalk gesso is composed of lead carbonate and linseed oil, applied over a rabbit skin glue ground; a variation using titanium white pigment and calcium carbonate is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking. As lead-based paint is poisonous, care has to be taken in using it. Various alternative and more flexible canvas primers are commercially available, the most popular being a synthetic latex paint composed of titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate, bound with a thermo-plastic emulsion.\nMany artists have painted onto unprimed canvas, such as Jackson Pollock, Kenneth Noland, Francis Bacon, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Color Field painters, Lyrical Abstractionists and others. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint. In 1970, artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining:\nWhen I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.\nEarly canvas was made of linen, a sturdy brownish fabric of considerable strength. Linen is particularly suitable for the use of oil paint. In the early 20th century, cotton canvas, often referred to as \"cotton duck\", came into use. Linen remains popular with many professional artists, especially those who work with oil paint. Cotton duck, which stretches more fully and has an even, mechanical weave, offers a more economical alternative. The advent of acrylic paint has greatly increased the popularity and use of cotton duck canvas. Linen and cotton derive from two entirely different plants, the flax plant and the cotton plant, respectively.\nGessoed canvases on stretchers are also available. They are available in a variety of weights: light-weight is about or ; medium-weight is about or ; heavy-weight is about or . They are prepared with two or three coats of gesso and are ready for use straight away. Artists desiring greater control of their painting surface may add a coat or two of their preferred gesso. Professional artists who wish to work on canvas may prepare their own canvas in the traditional manner.\nOne of the most outstanding differences between modern painting techniques and those of the Flemish and Dutch Masters is in the preparation of the canvas. \"Modern\" techniques take advantage of both the canvas texture as well as those of the paint itself. Renaissance masters took extreme measures to ensure that none of the texture of the canvas came through. This required a painstaking, months-long process of layering the raw canvas with (usually) lead-white paint, then polishing the surface, and then repeating. The final product had little resemblance to fabric, but instead had a glossy, enamel-like finish.\nWith a properly prepared canvas, the painter will find that each subsequent layer of color glides on in a \"buttery\" manner, and that with the proper consistency of application (fat over lean technique), a painting entirely devoid of brushstrokes can be achieved. A warm iron is applied over a piece of wet cotton to flatten the wrinkles.\nCanvas can also be printed on using offset or specialist digital printers to create canvas prints. This process of digital inkjet printing is popularly referred to as Gicl\u00e9e. After printing, the canvas can be wrapped around a stretcher and displayed.\nFor embroidery.\nCanvas is a popular base fabric for embroidery such as cross-stitch and Berlin wool work. Some specific types of embroidery canvases are Aida cloth (also called Java canvas), Penelope canvas, Chess canvas, and Binca canvas. Plastic canvas is a stiffer form of Binca canvas.\nAs a compound agent.\nFrom the 13th century onwards, canvas was used as a covering layer on pavise shields. The canvas was applied to the wooden surface of the pavise, covered with multiple layers of gesso and often richly painted in tempera technique. Finally, the surface was sealed with a transparent varnish. While the gessoed canvas was a perfect painting surface, the primary purpose of the canvas application may have been the strengthening of the wooden shield corpus in a manner similar to modern glass-reinforced plastic.\nSplined canvas, stretched canvas and canvas boards.\n\"Splined canvases\" differ from traditional side-stapled canvas in that canvas is attached with a spline at the rear of the frame. This allows the artist to incorporate painted edges into the artwork itself without staples at the sides, and the artwork can be displayed without a frame. Splined canvas can be restretched by adjusting the spline.\n\"Stapled canvases\" stay stretched tighter over a longer period of time, but are more difficult to re-stretch when the need arises.\n\"Canvas boards\" are made of canvas stretched over and glued to a cardboard backing, and sealed on the backside. The canvas is typically linen primed for a certain type of paint. They are primarily used by artists for quick studies.\nMechanical properties in canvas conservation.\nUnderstanding the mechanical properties of art canvases is necessary for art conservation, especially when deciding on transporting paintings, conservation treatments and environmental specifications inside museums. Canvases are layered structures made from weaving fibers together, where each layer responds differently to changes in humidity, resulting in localized stresses that cause deformation, cracking, and delamination. There are two directions to the canvas: the warp direction (threads run vertically) and the weft direction (threads run horizontally). Researchers performed tensile testing to determine the effects of humidity on the strength of canvases and observed that increasing humidity decreased the effective elastic modulus (combined modulus of the weft and warp directions). For example, the effective modulus at 30% relative humidity is 180 MPa, which drops to 13 MPa at 90% relative humidity, suggesting that canvas is becoming more flexible and susceptible to deformation. There is an inherent anisotropy to the elastic modulus measured in the weft and warp direction as evidenced in the strain vs. load behavior of the canvas. The canvas exhibits a 0.1 strain in the weft direction and 0.2 strain in the warp direction before failing (thread ripping apart). Though, tensile testing provides an explicit measure of material strength, conservators are unable to tare a piece of painting to create the samples (required length of 250 mm), therefore the traditional methods of assessing mechanical properties have been visual cues and pH values. \nArt conservators have recently adopted a new method called zero-span strength analysis, nanoindentation, and numerical modelling to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical properties of painting canvases. Zero-span strength analysis measures the tensile strength of materials, such as paper and yarns, by reducing the clamping distance to 0.1 mm and applying load to a particular point on the yarn. This minimizes effects from material geometry and accurately assesses intrinsic fiber strength. This also reduces the amount of material needed for samples to 60 mm. Using zero-span strength analysis, conservators measured tensile strength of flax, commonly used canvas material in historical paintings and correlated tensile strength to the degree of cellulose depolymerization -- cellulose is a component of flax. Another method for assessing canvas quality is nanoindentation utilizing a millimeter-sized cantilever with a microsphere at its end and measuring local viscoelastic properties. However, with the nanoindentation method, conservators can probe the composite behavior of the layers of paint on top of the canvas, not the actual strength of the canvas itself. Lastly, conservators are using finite element modeling (FEM) and extended-FEM (XFEM) on canvases undergoing desiccation (removal of moisture) to visualize the global and local stresses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the narrowest sense of the word, it consists of a flat plate (the \"dial\") and a gnomon, which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the Sun appears to move through the sky, the shadow aligns with different hour-lines, which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \"style\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \"nodus\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude.\nThe term \"sundial\" can refer to any device that uses the Sun's altitude or azimuth (or both) to show the time. Sundials are valued as decorative objects, metaphors, and objects of intrigue and mathematical study.\nThe passing of time can be observed by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals. It is common for inexpensive, mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons, shadow lengths, and hour-lines, which cannot be adjusted to tell the correct time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIntroduction.\nThere are several different types of sundials. Some sundials use a shadow or the edge of a shadow while others use a line or spot of light to indicate the time.\nThe shadow-casting object, known as a \"gnomon\", may be a long thin rod or other object with a sharp tip or a straight edge. Sundials employ many types of gnomon. The gnomon may be fixed or moved according to the season. It may be oriented vertically, horizontally, aligned with the Earth's axis, or oriented in an altogether different direction determined by mathematics.\nGiven that sundials use light to indicate time, a line of light may be formed by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. A spot of light may be formed by allowing the Sun's rays to pass through a small hole, window, oculus, or by reflecting them from a small circular mirror. A spot of light can be as small as a pinhole in a solargraph or as large as the oculus in the Pantheon.\nSundials may also use many types of surfaces to receive the light or shadow. Planes are the most common surface, but partial spheres, cylinders, cones and other shapes have been used for greater accuracy or beauty.\nSundials differ in their portability and their need for orientation. The installation of many dials requires knowing the local latitude, the precise vertical direction (e.g., by a level or plumb-bob), and the direction to true north. Portable dials are self-aligning: for example, they may have two dials that operate on different principles, such as a horizontal and analemmatic dial, mounted together on one plate. In these designs, their times agree only when the plate is aligned properly. \nSundials may indicate the local solar time only. To obtain the national clock time, three corrections are required:\nApparent motion of the Sun.\nThe principles of sundials are understood most easily from the Sun's apparent motion. The Earth rotates on its axis, and revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. An excellent approximation assumes that the Sun revolves around a stationary Earth on the celestial sphere, which rotates every 24 hours about its celestial axis. The celestial axis is the line connecting the celestial poles. Since the celestial axis is aligned with the axis about which the Earth rotates, the angle of the axis with the local horizontal is the local geographical latitude.\nUnlike the fixed stars, the Sun changes its position on the celestial sphere, being (in the Northern Hemisphere) at a positive declination in spring and summer, and at a negative declination in autumn and winter, and having exactly zero declination (i.e., being on the celestial equator) at the equinoxes. The Sun's celestial longitude also varies, changing by one complete revolution per year. The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic passes through the twelve constellations of the zodiac in the course of a year.\nThis model of the Sun's motion helps to understand sundials. If the shadow-casting gnomon is aligned with the celestial poles, its shadow will revolve at a constant rate, and this rotation will not change with the seasons. This is the most common design. In such cases, the same hour lines may be used throughout the year. The hour-lines will be spaced uniformly if the surface receiving the shadow is either perpendicular (as in the equatorial sundial) or circular about the gnomon (as in the armillary sphere).\nIn other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, even though the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is \"not\" aligned with the celestial poles, even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be corrected accordingly. The rays of light that graze the tip of a gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a cone aligned with the celestial poles. The corresponding light-spot or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a conic section, such as a hyperbola, ellipse or (at the North or South Poles) a circle.\nThis conic section is the intersection of the cone of light rays with the flat surface. This cone and its conic section change with the seasons, as the Sun's declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such light-spots or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year. This is seen in shepherd's dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial.\nHistory.\nThe earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are shadow clocks (1500 BC or BCE) from ancient Egyptian astronomy and Babylonian astronomy. By 240 BC, Eratosthenes had estimated the circumference of the world using an obelisk and a water well and a few centuries later, Ptolemy had charted the latitude of cities using the angle of the sun. The people of Kush created sun dials through geometry. The Roman writer Vitruvius lists dials and shadow clocks known at that time in his \"De architectura\". The Tower of the Winds in Athens included both a sundial and a water clock for telling time. A canonical sundial is one that indicates the canonical hours of liturgical acts, and these were used from the 7th to the 14th centuries by religious orders. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's \"Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria\" (c. 1620) discusses how to make a perfect sundial. They have been in common use since the 16th century.\nFunctioning.\nIn general, sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow or throwing light onto a surface known as a \"dial face\" or \"dial plate\". Although usually a flat plane, the dial face may also be the inner or outer surface of a sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and various other shapes.\nThe time is indicated where a shadow or light falls on the dial face, which is usually inscribed with hour lines. Although usually straight, these hour lines may also be curved, depending on the design of the sundial (see below). In some designs, it is possible to determine the date of the year, or it may be required to know the date to find the correct time. In such cases, there may be multiple sets of hour lines for different months, or there may be mechanisms for setting/calculating the month. In addition to the hour lines, the dial face may offer other data\u2014such as the horizon, the equator and the tropics\u2014which are referred to collectively as the dial furniture.\nThe entire object that casts a shadow or light onto the dial face is known as the sundial's \"gnomon\". However, it is usually only an edge of the gnomon (or another linear feature) that casts the shadow used to determine the time; this linear feature is known as the sundial's \"style\". The style is usually aligned parallel to the axis of the celestial sphere, and therefore is aligned with the local geographical meridian. In some sundial designs, only a point-like feature, such as the tip of the style, is used to determine the time and date; this point-like feature is known as the sundial's \"nodus\".\nSome sundials use both a style and a nodus to determine the time and date.\nThe gnomon is usually fixed relative to the dial face, but not always; in some designs such as the analemmatic sundial, the style is moved according to the month. If the style is fixed, the line on the dial plate perpendicularly beneath the style is called the \"substyle\", meaning \"below the style\". The angle the style makes with the plane of the dial plate is called the substyle height, an unusual use of the word \"height\" to mean an \"angle\". On many wall dials, the substyle is not the same as the noon line (see below). The angle on the dial plate between the noon line and the substyle is called the \"substyle distance\", an unusual use of the word \"distance\" to mean an \"angle\".\nBy tradition, many sundials have a motto. The motto is usually in the form of an epigram: sometimes sombre reflections on the passing of time and the brevity of life, but equally often humorous witticisms of the dial maker. One such quip is, \"I am a sundial, and I make a botch, Of what is done much better by a watch.\"\nA dial is said to be \"equiangular\" if its hour-lines are straight and spaced equally. Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include the equatorial dial, the equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, the cylindrical dial and the conical dial. However, other designs are equiangular, such as the Lambert dial, a version of the analemmatic sundial with a moveable style.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere.\nA sundial at a particular latitude in one hemisphere must be reversed for use at the opposite latitude in the other hemisphere. A vertical direct south sundial in the Northern Hemisphere becomes a vertical direct north sundial in the Southern Hemisphere. To position a horizontal sundial correctly, one has to find true north or south. The same process can be used to do both. The gnomon, set to the correct latitude, has to point to the true south in the Southern Hemisphere as in the Northern Hemisphere it has to point to the true north. The hour numbers also run in opposite directions, so on a horizontal dial they run anticlockwise (US: counterclockwise) rather than clockwise.\nSundials which are designed to be used with their plates horizontal in one hemisphere can be used with their plates vertical at the complementary latitude in the other hemisphere. For example, the illustrated sundial in Perth, Australia, which is at latitude 32\u00b0 South, would function properly if it were mounted on a south-facing vertical wall at latitude 58\u00b0 (i.e. 90\u00b0 \u2212 32\u00b0) North, which is slightly further north than Perth, Scotland. The surface of the wall in Scotland would be parallel with the horizontal ground in Australia (ignoring the difference of longitude), so the sundial would work identically on both surfaces. Correspondingly, the hour marks, which run counterclockwise on a horizontal sundial in the Southern Hemisphere, also do so on a vertical sundial in the Northern Hemisphere. (See the first two illustrations at the top of this article.) On horizontal Northern Hemisphere sundials, and on vertical Southern Hemisphere ones, the hour marks run clockwise.\nAdjustments to calculate clock time from a sundial reading.\nThe most common reason for a sundial to differ greatly from clock time is that the sundial has not been oriented correctly or its hour lines have not been drawn correctly. For example, most commercial sundials are designed as \"horizontal sundials\" as described above. To be accurate, such a sundial must have been designed for the local geographical latitude and its style must be parallel to the Earth's rotational axis; the style must be aligned with true north and its \"height\" (its angle with the horizontal) must equal the local latitude. To adjust the style height, the sundial can often be tilted slightly \"up\" or \"down\" while maintaining the style's north-south alignment.\nSummer (daylight saving) time correction.\nSome areas of the world practice daylight saving time, which changes the official time, usually by one hour. This shift must be added to the sundial's time to make it agree with the official time.\nTime-zone (longitude) correction.\nA standard time zone covers roughly 15\u00b0 of longitude, so any point within that zone which is not on the reference longitude (generally a multiple of 15\u00b0) will experience a difference from standard time that is equal to 4 minutes of time per degree. For illustration, sunsets and sunrises are at a much later \"official\" time at the western edge of a time-zone, compared to sunrise and sunset times at the eastern edge. If a sundial is located at, say, a longitude 5\u00b0 west of the reference longitude, then its time will read 20\u00a0minutes slow, since the Sun appears to revolve around the Earth at 15\u00b0 per hour. This is a constant correction throughout the year. For equiangular dials such as equatorial, spherical or Lambert dials, this correction can be made by rotating the dial surface by an angle equaling the difference in longitude, without changing the gnomon position or orientation. However, this method does not work for other dials, such as a horizontal dial; the correction must be applied by the viewer.\nHowever, for political and practical reasons, time-zone boundaries have been skewed. At their most extreme, time zones can cause official noon, including daylight savings, to occur up to three hours early (in which case the Sun is actually on the meridian at official clock time of 3\u00a0PM). This occurs in the far west of Alaska, China, and Spain. For more details and examples, see time zones.\nEquation of time correction.\nAlthough the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about the Earth, in reality this motion is not perfectly uniform. This is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (the fact that the Earth's orbit about the Sun is not perfectly circular, but slightly elliptical) and the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth's rotational axis relative to the plane of its orbit. Therefore, sundial time varies from standard clock time. On four days of the year, the correction is effectively zero. However, on others, it can be as much as a quarter-hour early or late. The amount of correction is described by the equation of time. This correction is equal worldwide: it does not depend on the local latitude or longitude of the observer's position. It does, however, change over long periods of time, (centuries or more,)\nbecause of slow variations in the Earth's orbital and rotational motions. Therefore, tables and graphs of the equation of time that were made centuries ago are now significantly incorrect. The reading of an old sundial should be corrected by applying the present-day equation of time, not one from the period when the dial was made.\nIn some sundials, the equation of time correction is provided as an informational plaque affixed to the sundial, for the observer to calculate. In more sophisticated sundials the equation can be incorporated automatically. For example, some equatorial bow sundials are supplied with a small wheel that sets the time of year; this wheel in turn rotates the equatorial bow, offsetting its time measurement. In other cases, the hour lines may be curved, or the equatorial bow may be shaped like a vase, which exploits the changing altitude of the sun over the year to effect the proper offset in time.\nA \"heliochronometer\" is a precision sundial first devised in about 1763 by Philipp Hahn and improved by Abb\u00e9 Guyoux in about 1827.\nIt corrects apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. Heliochronometers usually indicate the minutes to within 1 minute of Universal Time.\nThe Sunquest sundial, designed by Richard L. Schmoyer in the 1950s, uses an analemmic-inspired gnomon to cast a shaft of light onto an equatorial time-scale crescent. Sunquest is adjustable for latitude and longitude, automatically correcting for the equation of time, rendering it \"as accurate as most pocket watches\".\nSimilarly, in place of the shadow of a gnomon the sundial at Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University uses the solar projection of a graph of the equation of time intersecting a time scale to display clock time directly. \nAn analemma may be added to many types of sundials to correct apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. These usually have hour lines shaped like \"figure eights\" (analemmas) according to the equation of time. This compensates for the slight eccentricity in the Earth's orbit and the tilt of the Earth's axis that causes up to a 15\u00a0minute variation from mean solar time. This is a type of dial furniture seen on more complicated horizontal and vertical dials.\nPrior to the invention of accurate clocks, in the mid 17th\u00a0century, sundials were the only timepieces in common use, and were considered to tell the \"right\" time. The equation of time was not used. After the invention of good clocks, sundials were still considered to be correct, and clocks usually incorrect. The equation of time was used in the opposite direction from today, to apply a correction to the time shown by a clock to make it agree with sundial time. Some elaborate \"equation clocks\", such as one made by Joseph Williamson in 1720, incorporated mechanisms to do this correction automatically. (Williamson's clock may have been the first-ever device to use a differential gear.) Only after about 1800 was uncorrected clock time considered to be \"right\", and sundial time usually \"wrong\", so the equation of time became used as it is today.\nWith fixed axial gnomon.\nThe most commonly observed sundials are those in which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, being oriented with true north and south, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude. This axis is aligned with the celestial poles, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the pole star Polaris. For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true North Pole, whereas it points horizontally on the equator. The world's largest axial gnomon sundial is the mast of the Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay in Redding, California . A formerly world's largest gnomon is at Jaipur, raised 26\u00b055\u2032 above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude.\nOn any given day, the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about this axis, at about 15\u00b0 per hour, making a full circuit (360\u00b0) in 24\u00a0hours. A linear gnomon aligned with this axis will cast a sheet of shadow (a half-plane) that, falling opposite to the Sun, likewise rotates about the celestial axis at 15\u00b0 per hour. The shadow is seen by falling on a receiving surface that is usually flat, but which may be spherical, cylindrical, conical or of other shapes. If the shadow falls on a surface that is symmetrical about the celestial axis (as in an armillary sphere, or an equatorial dial), the surface-shadow likewise moves uniformly; the hour-lines on the sundial are equally spaced. However, if the receiving surface is not symmetrical (as in most horizontal sundials), the surface shadow generally moves non-uniformly and the hour-lines are not equally spaced; one exception is the Lambert dial described below.\nSome types of sundials are designed with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the celestial poles like a vertical obelisk. Such sundials are covered below under the section, \"Nodus-based sundials\".\nEmpirical hour-line marking.\nThe formulas shown in the paragraphs below allow the positions of the hour-lines to be calculated for various types of sundial. In some cases, the calculations are simple; in others they are extremely complicated. There is an alternative, simple method of finding the positions of the hour-lines which can be used for many types of sundial, and saves a lot of work in cases where the calculations are complex. This is an empirical procedure in which the position of the shadow of the gnomon of a real sundial is marked at hourly intervals. The equation of time must be taken into account to ensure that the positions of the hour-lines are independent of the time of year when they are marked. An easy way to do this is to set a clock or watch so it shows \"sundial time\"\nwhich is standard time, plus the equation of time on the day in question.\nThe hour-lines on the sundial are marked to show the positions of the shadow of the style when this clock shows whole numbers of hours, and are labelled with these numbers of hours. For example, when the clock reads 5:00, the shadow of the style is marked, and labelled \"5\" (or \"V\" in Roman numerals). If the hour-lines are not all marked in a single day, the clock must be adjusted every day or two to take account of the variation of the equation of time.\nEquatorial sundials.\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the \"equatorial dial\" (also called the \"equinoctial dial\") is the planar surface that receives the shadow, which is exactly perpendicular to the gnomon's style. This plane is called equatorial, because it is parallel to the equator of the Earth and of the celestial sphere. If the gnomon is fixed and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the sun's apparent rotation about the Earth casts a uniformly rotating sheet of shadow from the gnomon; this produces a uniformly rotating line of shadow on the equatorial plane. Since the Earth rotates 360\u00b0 in 24 hours, the hour-lines on an equatorial dial are all spaced 15\u00b0 apart (360/24).\nformula_1\nThe uniformity of their spacing makes this type of sundial easy to construct. If the dial plate material is opaque, both sides of the equatorial dial must be marked, since the shadow will be cast from below in winter and from above in summer. With translucent dial plates (e.g. glass) the hour angles need only be marked on the sun-facing side, although the hour numberings (if used) need be made on both sides of the dial, owing to the differing hour schema on the sun-facing and sun-backing sides.\nAnother major advantage of this dial is that equation of time (EoT) and daylight saving time (DST) corrections can be made by simply rotating the dial plate by the appropriate angle each day. This is because the hour angles are equally spaced around the dial. For this reason, an equatorial dial is often a useful choice when the dial is for public display and it is desirable to have it show the true local time to reasonable accuracy. The EoT correction is made via the relation\n formula_2\nNear the equinoxes in spring and autumn, the sun moves on a circle that is nearly the same as the equatorial plane; hence, no clear shadow is produced on the equatorial dial at those times of year, a drawback of the design.\nA \"nodus\" is sometimes added to equatorial sundials, which allows the sundial to tell the time of year. On any given day, the shadow of the nodus moves on a circle on the equatorial plane, and the radius of the circle measures the declination of the sun. The ends of the gnomon bar may be used as the nodus, or some feature along its length. An ancient variant of the equatorial sundial has only a nodus (no style) and the concentric circular hour-lines are arranged to resemble a spider-web.\nHorizontal sundials.\nIn the \"horizontal sundial\" (also called a \"garden sundial\"), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally, rather than being perpendicular to the style as in the equatorial dial. Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face; rather, the hour lines are spaced according to the rule.\nformula_3\nOr in other terms:\nformula_4\nwhere L is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the gnomon makes with the dial plate), formula_5 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true north) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_5 of the 3\u00a0PM hour-line would equal the arctangent of since tan 45\u00b0 = 1. When formula_7 (at the North Pole), the horizontal sundial becomes an equatorial sundial; the style points straight up (vertically), and the horizontal plane is aligned with the equatorial plane; the hour-line formula becomes formula_8 as for an equatorial dial. A horizontal sundial at the Earth's equator, where formula_9 would require a (raised) horizontal style and would be an example of a polar sundial (see below).\nThe chief advantages of the horizontal sundial are that it is easy to read, and the sunlight lights the face throughout the year. All the hour-lines intersect at the point where the gnomon's style crosses the horizontal plane. Since the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the style points true north and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial's geographical latitude L\u00a0. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude. For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40\u00b0 can be used at a latitude of 45\u00b0, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5\u00b0, thus aligning the style with the Earth's rotational axis. \nMany ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the \"hourlines\" and so can never be corrected. A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5\u00b0 east to 23\u00b0 west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal hour angles. To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Since the hour angles are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These types of dials usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by. Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas.\nVertical sundials.\nIn the common \"vertical dial\", the shadow-receiving plane is aligned vertically; as usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation. As in the horizontal dial, the line of shadow does not move uniformly on the face; the sundial is not \"equiangular\". If the face of the vertical dial points directly south, the angle of the hour-lines is instead described by the formula:\nformula_10\nwhere L is the sundial's geographical latitude, formula_11 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_11 of the 3\u00a0P.M. hour-line would equal the arctangent of since The shadow moves \"counter-clockwise\" on a south-facing vertical dial, whereas it runs clockwise on horizontal and equatorial north-facing dials.\nDials with faces perpendicular to the ground and which face directly south, north, east, or west are called \"vertical direct dials\". It is widely believed, and stated in respectable publications, that a vertical dial cannot receive more than twelve hours of sunlight a day, no matter how many hours of daylight there are. However, there is an exception. Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole (e.g. north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer) can actually receive sunlight for more than 12\u00a0hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice. For example, at latitude 20\u00b0 North, on June\u00a021, the sun shines on a north-facing vertical wall for 13\u00a0hours, 21\u00a0minutes. Vertical sundials which do \"not\" face directly south (in the northern hemisphere) may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day, depending on the direction they do face, and on the time of year. For example, a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours; in the afternoon, the sun does not shine on its face. Vertical dials that face due East or West are \"polar dials\", which will be described below. Vertical dials that face north are uncommon, because they tell time only during the spring and summer, and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes (and even there, only around midsummer). For non-direct vertical dials \u2013 those that face in non-cardinal directions \u2013 the mathematics of arranging the style and the hour-lines becomes more complicated; it may be easier to mark the hour lines by observation, but the placement of the style, at least, must be calculated first; such dials are said to be \"declining dials\".\nVertical dials are commonly mounted on the walls of buildings, such as town-halls, cupolas and church-towers, where they are easy to see from far away. In some cases, vertical dials are placed on all four sides of a rectangular tower, providing the time throughout the day. The face may be painted on the wall, or displayed in inlaid stone; the gnomon is often a single metal bar, or a tripod of metal bars for rigidity. If the wall of the building faces \"toward\" the south, but does not face due south, the gnomon will not lie along the noon line, and the hour lines must be corrected. Since the gnomon's style must be parallel to the Earth's axis, it always \"points\" true north and its angle with the horizontal will equal the sundial's geographical latitude; on a direct south dial, its angle with the vertical face of the dial will equal the colatitude, or 90\u00b0 minus the latitude.\nPolar dials.\nIn \"polar dials\", the shadow-receiving plane is aligned \"parallel\" to the gnomon-style.\nThus, the shadow slides sideways over the surface, moving perpendicularly to itself as the Sun rotates about the style. As with the gnomon, the hour-lines are all aligned with the Earth's rotational axis. When the Sun's rays are nearly parallel to the plane, the shadow moves very quickly and the hour lines are spaced far apart. The direct East- and West-facing dials are examples of a polar dial. However, the face of a polar dial need not be vertical; it need only be parallel to the gnomon. Thus, a plane inclined at the angle of latitude (relative to horizontal) under the similarly inclined gnomon will be a polar dial. The perpendicular spacing X of the hour-lines in the plane is described by the formula\nformula_13\nwhere H is the height of the style above the plane, and t is the time (in hours) before or after the center-time for the polar dial. The center time is the time when the style's shadow falls directly down on the plane; for an East-facing dial, the center time will be 6\u00a0A.M., for a West-facing dial, this will be 6\u00a0P.M., and for the inclined dial described above, it will be noon. When t approaches \u00b16 hours away from the center time, the spacing X diverges to +\u221e; this occurs when the Sun's rays become parallel to the plane.\nVertical declining dials.\nA \"declining dial\" is any non-horizontal, planar dial that does not face in a cardinal direction, such as (true) north, south, east or west. As usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, but the hour-lines are not symmetrical about the noon hour-line. For a vertical dial, the angle formula_14 between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that formula_14 is defined positive in the clockwise sense w.r.t. the upper vertical hour angle; and that its conversion to the equivalent solar hour requires careful consideration of which quadrant of the sundial that it belongs in.\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17 is the sundial's geographical latitude; t is the time before or after noon; formula_18 is the angle of declination from true south, defined as positive when east of south; and formula_19 is a switch integer for the dial orientation. A partly south-facing dial has an formula_19 value of those partly north-facing, a value of When such a dial faces south (formula_21), this formula reduces to the formula given above for vertical south-facing dials, i.e.\nformula_22\nWhen a sundial is not aligned with a cardinal direction, the substyle of its gnomon is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The angle formula_23 between the substyle and the noon hour-line is given by the formula\nformula_24\nIf a vertical sundial faces trUe south Or north (formula_25 or formula_26 respectively), the angle formula_27 and the substyle is aligned with the noon hour-line.\nThe height of the gnomon, that is the angle the style makes to the plate, formula_28 is given by :\nformula_29\nReclining dials.\nThe sundials described above have gnomons that are aligned with the Earth's rotational axis and cast their shadow onto a plane. If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial is said to be \"reclining\" or \"inclining\". Such a sundial might be located on a south-facing roof, for example. The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula above\nformula_30\nwhere formula_31 is the desired angle of reclining relative to the local vertical, L is the sundial's geographical latitude, formula_32 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_32 of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of since When (in other words, a south-facing vertical dial), we obtain the vertical dial formula above.\nSome authors use a more specific nomenclature to describe the orientation of the shadow-receiving plane. If the plane's face points downwards towards the ground, it is said to be \"proclining\" or \"inclining\", whereas a dial is said to be \"reclining\" when the dial face is pointing away from the ground. Many authors also often refer to reclined, proclined and inclined sundials in general as inclined sundials. It is also common in the latter case to measure the angle of inclination relative to the horizontal plane on the sun side of the dial.\nIn such texts, since formula_34 the hour angle formula will often be seen written as :\nformula_35\nThe angle between the gnomon style and the dial plate, B, in this type of sundial is :\nformula_36\nor :\nformula_37\nDeclining-reclining dials/ Declining-inclining dials.\nSome sundials both decline and recline, in that their shadow-receiving plane is not oriented with a cardinal direction (such as true north or true south) and is neither horizontal nor vertical nor equatorial. For example, such a sundial might be found on a roof that was not oriented in a cardinal direction.\nThe formulae describing the spacing of the hour-lines on such dials are rather more complicated than those for simpler dials.\nThere are various solution approaches, including some using the methods of rotation matrices, and some making a 3D model of the reclined-declined plane and its vertical declined counterpart plane, extracting the geometrical relationships between the hour angle components on both these planes and then reducing the trigonometric algebra.\nOne system of formulas for Reclining-Declining sundials: (as stated by Fennewick)\nThe angle formula_38 between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that formula_38 advances counterclockwise with respect to the zero hour angle for those dials that are partly south-facing and clockwise for those that are north-facing.\nformula_40\nwithin the parameter ranges : formula_41 and formula_42\nOr, if preferring to use inclination angle, formula_43 rather than the reclination, formula_44 where formula_45 :\nformula_46\nwithin the parameter ranges : formula_47 and formula_48\nHere formula_17 is the sundial's geographical latitude; formula_19 is the orientation switch integer; t is the time in hours before or after noon; and formula_31 and formula_18 are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively.\nNote that formula_31 is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the Sun's side. Declination angle formula_18 is defined as positive when moving east of true south.\nDials facing fully or partly south have formula_55 while those partly or fully north-facing have an formula_56\nSince the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctangent function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle.\nUnlike the simpler vertical declining sundial, this type of dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a Northern Hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the Sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for Southern Hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing.\nWere these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west.\nIn a similar way, Northern Hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and Southern Hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value.\nThe critical declination formula_57 is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value of both the dial's reclination and its latitude :\nformula_58\nAs with the vertical declined dial, the gnomon's substyle is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The general formula for the angle formula_59 between the substyle and the noon-line is given by :\nformula_60\nThe angle formula_28 between the style and the plate is given by :\nformula_62\nNote that for formula_63 i.e. when the gnomon is coplanar with the dial plate, we have :\nformula_64\ni.e. when formula_65 the critical declination value.\nEmpirical method.\nBecause of the complexity of the above calculations, using them for the practical purpose of designing a dial of this type is difficult and prone to error. It has been suggested that it is better to locate the hour lines empirically, marking the positions of the shadow of a style on a real sundial at hourly intervals as shown by a clock and adding/deducting that day's equation of time adjustment. See Empirical hour-line marking, above.\nSpherical sundials.\nThe surface receiving the shadow need not be a plane, but can have any shape, provided that the sundial maker is willing to mark the hour-lines. If the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, a spherical shape is convenient since the hour-lines are equally spaced, as they are on the equatorial dial shown here; the sundial is \"equiangular\". This is the principle behind the armillary sphere and the equatorial bow sundial. However, some equiangular sundials \u2013 such as the Lambert dial described below \u2013 are based on other principles.\nIn the \"equatorial bow sundial\", the gnomon is a bar, slot or stretched wire parallel to the celestial axis. The face is a semicircle, corresponding to the equator of the sphere, with markings on the inner surface. This pattern, built a couple of meters wide out of temperature-invariant steel invar, was used to keep the trains running on time in France before World War I.\nAmong the most precise sundials ever made are two equatorial bows constructed of marble found in Yantra mandir. This collection of sundials and other astronomical instruments was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II at his then-new capital of Jaipur, India between 1727 and 1733. The larger equatorial bow is called the \"Samrat Yantra\" (The Supreme Instrument); standing at 27\u00a0meters, its shadow moves visibly at 1\u00a0mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6\u00a0cm) every minute.\nCylindrical, conical, and other non-planar sundials.\nOther non-planar surfaces may be used to receive the shadow of the gnomon.\nAs an elegant alternative, the style (which could be created by a hole or slit in the circumference) may be located on the circumference of a cylinder or sphere, rather than at its central axis of symmetry.\nIn that case, the hour lines are again spaced equally, but at \"twice\" the usual angle, due to the geometrical inscribed angle theorem. This is the basis of some modern sundials, but it was also used in ancient times;\nIn another variation of the polar-axis-aligned cylindrical, a cylindrical dial could be rendered as a helical ribbon-like surface, with a thin gnomon located either along its center or at its periphery.\nMovable-gnomon sundials.\nSundials can be designed with a gnomon that is placed in a different position each day throughout the year. In other words, the position of the gnomon relative to the centre of the hour lines varies. The gnomon need not be aligned with the celestial poles and may even be perfectly vertical (the analemmatic dial). These dials, when combined with fixed-gnomon sundials, allow the user to determine true north with no other aid; the two sundials are correctly aligned if and only if they both show the same time. \nUniversal equinoctial ring dial.\nA \"universal equinoctial ring dial\" (sometimes called a \"ring dial\" for brevity, although the term is ambiguous), is a portable version of an armillary sundial, or was inspired by the mariner's astrolabe. It was likely invented by William Oughtred around 1600 and became common throughout Europe.\nIn its simplest form, the style is a thin slit that allows the Sun's rays to fall on the hour-lines of an equatorial ring. As usual, the style is aligned with the Earth's axis; to do this, the user may orient the dial towards true north and suspend the ring dial vertically from the appropriate point on the meridian ring. Such dials may be made self-aligning with the addition of a more complicated central bar, instead of a simple slit-style. These bars are sometimes an addition to a set of Gemma's rings. This bar could pivot about its end points and held a perforated slider that was positioned to the month and day according to a scale scribed on the bar. The time was determined by rotating the bar towards the Sun so that the light shining through the hole fell on the equatorial ring. This forced the user to rotate the instrument, which had the effect of aligning the instrument's vertical ring with the meridian.\nWhen not in use, the equatorial and meridian rings can be folded together into a small disk.\nIn 1610, Edward Wright created the sea ring, which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass. This permitted mariners to determine the time and magnetic variation in a single step.\nAnalemmatic sundials.\nAnalemmatic sundials are a type of horizontal sundial that has a vertical gnomon and hour markers positioned in an elliptical pattern. There are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read on the ellipse. The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day.\nAnalemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon. Human gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months. A tall person casts a shadow at 27\u00b0 latitude on the summer solstice.\nFoster-Lambert dials.\nThe Foster-Lambert dial is another movable-gnomon sundial. In contrast to the elliptical analemmatic dial, the Lambert dial is circular with evenly spaced hour lines, making it an \"equiangular sundial\", similar to the equatorial, spherical, cylindrical and conical dials described above. The gnomon of a Foster-Lambert dial is neither vertical nor aligned with the Earth's rotational axis; rather, it is tilted northwards by an angle \u03b1 = 45\u00b0 - (\u03a6/2), where \u03a6 is the geographical latitude. Thus, a Foster-Lambert dial located at latitude 40\u00b0 would have a gnomon tilted away from vertical by 25\u00b0 in a northerly direction. To read the correct time, the gnomon must also be moved northwards by a distance\nformula_66\nwhere \"R\" is the radius of the Foster-Lambert dial and \u03b4 again indicates the Sun's declination for that time of year.\nAltitude-based sundials.\nAltitude dials measure the height of the Sun in the sky, rather than directly measuring its hour-angle about the Earth's axis. They are not oriented towards true north, but rather towards the Sun and generally held vertically. The Sun's elevation is indicated by the position of a nodus, either the shadow-tip of a gnomon, or a spot of light.\nIn altitude dials, the time is read from where the nodus falls on a set of hour-curves that vary with the time of year. Many such altitude-dials' construction is calculation-intensive, as also the case with many azimuth dials. But the capuchin dials (described below) are constructed and used graphically.\nAltitude dials' disadvantages:\nSince the Sun's altitude is the same at times equally spaced about noon (e.g., 9am and 3pm), the user had to know whether it was morning or afternoon. At, say, 3:00 pm, that is not a problem. But when the dial indicates a time 15 minutes from noon, the user likely will not have a way of distinguishing 11:45 from 12:15.\nAdditionally, altitude dials are less accurate near noon, because the sun's altitude is not changing rapidly then.\nMany of these dials are portable and simple to use. As is often the case with other sundials, many altitude dials are designed for only one latitude. But the capuchin dial (described below) has a version that's adjustable for latitude.\n describe the Universal Capuchin sundial.\nHuman shadows.\nThe length of a human shadow (or of any vertical object) can be used to measure the sun's elevation and, thence, the time. The Venerable Bede gave a table for estimating the time from the length of one's shadow in feet, on the assumption that a monk's height is six times the length of his foot. Such shadow lengths will vary with the geographical latitude and with the time of year. For example, the shadow length at noon is short in summer months, and long in winter months.\nChaucer evokes this method a few times in his \"Canterbury Tales\", as in his \"Parson's Tale\".\nAn equivalent type of sundial using a vertical rod of fixed length is known as a \"backstaff dial\".\nShepherd's dial \u2013 timesticks.\nA shepherd's dial \u2013 also known as a \"shepherd's column dial\", \"pillar dial\", \"cylinder dial\" or \"chilindre\" \u2013 is a portable cylindrical sundial with a knife-like gnomon that juts out perpendicularly. It is normally dangled from a rope or string so the cylinder is vertical. The gnomon can be twisted to be above a month or day indication on the face of the cylinder. This corrects the sundial for the equation of time. The entire sundial is then twisted on its string so that the gnomon aims toward the Sun, while the cylinder remains vertical. The tip of the shadow indicates the time on the cylinder. The hour curves inscribed on the cylinder permit one to read the time. Shepherd's dials are sometimes hollow, so that the gnomon can fold within when not in use.\nThe shepherd's dial is evoked in \"Henry VI, Part 3\",\namong other works of literature.\nThe cylindrical shepherd's dial can be unrolled into a flat plate. In one simple version, the front and back of the plate each have three columns, corresponding to pairs of months with roughly the same solar declination (June:July, May:August, April:September, March:October, February:November, and January:December). The top of each column has a hole for inserting the shadow-casting gnomon, a peg. Often only two times are marked on the column below, one for noon and the other for mid-morning / mid-afternoon.\nTimesticks, \"clock spear\", or \"shepherds' time stick\", are based on the same principles as dials. The time stick is carved with eight vertical time scales for a different period of the year, each bearing a time scale calculated according to the relative amount of daylight during the different months of the year. Any reading depends not only on the time of day but also on the latitude and time of year.\nA peg gnomon is inserted at the top in the appropriate hole or face for the season of the year, and turned to the Sun so that the shadow falls directly down the scale. Its end displays the time.\nRing dials.\nIn a ring dial (also known as an \"Aquitaine\" or a \"perforated ring dial\"), the ring is hung vertically and oriented sideways towards the sun. A beam of light passes through a small hole in the ring and falls on hour-curves that are inscribed on the inside of the ring. To adjust for the equation of time, the hole is usually on a loose ring within the ring so that the hole can be adjusted to reflect the current month.\nCard dials (Capuchin dials).\nCard dials are another form of altitude dial. A card is aligned edge-on with the sun and tilted so that a ray of light passes through an aperture onto a specified spot, thus determining the sun's altitude. A weighted string hangs vertically downwards from a hole in the card, and carries a bead or knot. The position of the bead on the hour-lines of the card gives the time. In more sophisticated versions such as the Capuchin dial, there is only one set of hour-lines, i.e., the hour lines do not vary with the seasons. Instead, the position of the hole from which the weighted string hangs is varied according to the season.\nThe Capuchin sundials are constructed and used graphically, as opposed the direct hour-angle measurements of horizontal or equatorial dials; or the calculated hour angle lines of some altitude and azimuth dials.\nIn addition to the ordinary Capuchin dial, there is a universal Capuchin dial, adjustable for latitude.\nNavicula.\nA navicula de Venetiis or \"little ship of Venice\" was an altitude dial used to tell time and which was shaped like a little ship. The cursor (with a plumb line attached) was slid up / down the mast to the correct latitude. The user then sighted the Sun through the pair of sighting holes at either end of the \"ship's deck\". The plumb line then marked what hour of the day it was.\nNodus-based sundials.\nAnother type of sundial follows the motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the \"nodus\". For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon's shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a vertical obelisk (e.g., the \"Solarium Augusti\") or the tip of the horizontal marker in a shepherd's dial. Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed. In such cases, the rays of light trace out a cone over the course of a day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface. Most commonly, the receiving surface is a geometrical plane, so that the path of the shadow-tip or light-spot (called \"declination line\") traces out a conic section such as a hyperbola or an ellipse. The collection of hyperbolae was called a \"pelekonon\" (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours).\nThere is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to harmonic mean of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines.\nNodus-based sundials may use a small hole or mirror to isolate a single ray of light; the former are sometimes called \"aperture dials\". The oldest example is perhaps the antiborean sundial (\"antiboreum\"), a spherical nodus-based sundial that faces true north; a ray of sunlight enters from the south through a small hole located at the sphere's pole and falls on the hour and date lines inscribed within the sphere, which resemble lines of longitude and latitude, respectively, on a globe.\nReflection sundials.\nIsaac Newton developed a convenient and inexpensive sundial, in which a small mirror is placed on the sill of a south-facing window. The mirror acts like a nodus, casting a single spot of light on the ceiling. Depending on the geographical latitude and time of year, the light-spot follows a conic section, such as the hyperbolae of the pelikonon. If the mirror is parallel to the Earth's equator, and the ceiling is horizontal, then the resulting angles are those of a conventional horizontal sundial. Using the ceiling as a sundial surface exploits unused space, and the dial may be large enough to be very accurate.\nMultiple dials.\nSundials are sometimes combined into multiple dials. If two or more dials that operate on different principles \u2014 such as an analemmatic dial and a horizontal or vertical dial \u2014 are combined, the resulting multiple dial becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both dials need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true north need not be determined; the dials are oriented correctly when they read the same time and declination. However, the most common forms combine dials are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.\nDiptych (tablet) sundial.\nThe diptych consisted of two small flat faces, joined by a hinge. Diptychs usually folded into little flat boxes suitable for a pocket. The gnomon was a string between the two faces. When the string was tight, the two faces formed both a vertical and horizontal sundial. These were made of white ivory, inlaid with black lacquer markings. The gnomons were black braided silk, linen or hemp string. With a knot or bead on the string as a nodus, and the correct markings, a diptych (really any sundial large enough) can keep a calendar well-enough to plant crops. A common error describes the diptych dial as self-aligning. This is not correct for diptych dials consisting of a horizontal and vertical dial using a string gnomon between faces, no matter the orientation of the dial faces. Since the string gnomon is continuous, the shadows must meet at the hinge; hence, \"any\" orientation of the dial will show the same time on both dials.\nMultiface dials.\nA common type of multiple dial has sundials on every face of a Platonic solid (regular polyhedron), usually a cube.\nExtremely ornate sundials can be composed in this way, by applying a sundial to every surface of a solid object.\nIn some cases, the sundials are formed as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a cylindrical hollow aligned with the Earth's rotational axis (in which the edges play the role of styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the \"hemisphaerium\" or the \"antiboreum\". (See the History section above.) In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to sit on a desk, whereas in others, they are large stone monuments.\nA Polyhedral's dial faces can be designed to give the time for different time-zones simultaneously. Examples include the Scottish sundial of the 17th and 18th\u00a0centuries, which was often an extremely complex shape of polyhedral, and even convex faces.\nPrismatic dials.\nPrismatic dials are a special case of polar dials, in which the sharp edges of a prism of a concave polygon serve as the styles and the sides of the prism receive the shadow. Examples include a three-dimensional cross or star of David on gravestones.\nUnusual sundials.\nBenoy dial.\nThe Benoy dial was invented by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham, Nottinghamshire, England. Whereas a gnomon casts a sheet of shadow, his invention creates an equivalent sheet of light by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit, reflecting them from a long, slim mirror (usually half-cylindrical), or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. Examples of Benoy dials can be found in the United Kingdom at:\nBifilar sundial.\nInvented by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922, the bifilar sundial has two non-intersecting threads parallel to the dial. Usually the second thread is orthogonal to the first.\nThe intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the local solar time.\nDigital sundial.\nA digital sundial indicates the current time with numerals formed by the sunlight striking it. Sundials of this type are installed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich and in the Sundial Park in Genk (Belgium), and a small version is available commercially. There is a patent for this type of sundial.\nGlobe dial.\nThe globe dial is a sphere aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, and equipped with a spherical vane. Similar to sundials with a fixed axial style, a globe dial determines the time from the Sun's azimuthal angle in its apparent rotation about the earth. This angle can be determined by rotating the vane to give the smallest shadow.\nNoon marks.\nThe simplest sundials do not give the hours, but rather note the exact moment of 12:00\u00a0noon. In centuries past, such dials were used to set mechanical clocks, which were sometimes so inaccurate as to lose or gain significant time in a single day. The simplest noon-marks have a shadow that passes a mark. Then, an almanac can translate from local solar time and date to civil time. The civil time is used to set the clock. Some noon-marks include a figure-eight that embodies the equation of time, so that no almanac is needed.\nIn some U.S. colonial-era houses, a noon-mark might be carved into a floor or windowsill. Such marks indicate local noon, and provide a simple and accurate time reference for households to set their clocks. Some Asian countries had post offices set their clocks from a precision noon-mark. These in turn provided the times for the rest of the society. The typical noon-mark sundial was a lens set above an analemmatic plate. The plate has an engraved figure-eight shape, which corresponds to the equation of time (described above) versus the solar declination. When the edge of the Sun's image touches the part of the shape for the current month, this indicates that it is 12:00\u00a0noon.\nSundial cannon.\nA sundial cannon, sometimes called a 'meridian cannon', is a specialized sundial that is designed to create an 'audible noonmark', by automatically igniting a quantity of gunpowder at noon. These were novelties rather than precision sundials, sometimes installed in parks in Europe mainly in the late 18th or early 19th\u00a0centuries. They typically consist of a horizontal sundial, which has in addition to a gnomon a suitably mounted lens, set to focus the rays of the sun at exactly noon on the firing pan of a miniature cannon loaded with gunpowder (but no ball). To function properly the position and angle of the lens must be adjusted seasonally.\nMeridian lines.\nA horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year. Examples are the Bianchini meridian line in Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome, and the Cassini line in San Petronio Basilica at Bologna.\nSundial mottoes.\nThe association of sundials with time has inspired their designers over the centuries to display mottoes as part of the design. Often these cast the device in the role of \"memento mori\", inviting the observer to reflect on the transience of the world and the inevitability of death. \"Do not kill time, for it will surely kill thee.\" Other mottoes are more whimsical: \"I count only the sunny hours,\" and \"I am a sundial and I make a botch / of what is done far better by a watch.\" Collections of sundial mottoes have often been published through the centuries.\nUse as a compass.\nIf a horizontal-plate sundial is made for the latitude in which it is being used, and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the celestial pole that is above the horizon, then it shows the correct time in apparent solar time. Conversely, if the directions of the cardinal points are initially unknown, but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct apparent solar time as calculated from the reading of a clock, its gnomon shows the direction of True north or south, allowing the sundial to be used as a compass. The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface, and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time. The gnomon will then be pointing to the north, in the Northern Hemisphere, or to the south in the southern hemisphere. This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass and can be used in places where the magnetic declination is large, making a magnetic compass unreliable. An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs. (See #Multiple dials, above.) The dials are attached to and aligned with each other, and are oriented so they show the same time. This allows the directions of the cardinal points and the apparent solar time to be determined simultaneously, without requiring a clock.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72947", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72947", "title": "Marin Mersenne", "text": "French polymath (1588\u20131648)\nMarin Mersenne, OM (also known as Marinus Mersennus or \"le P\u00e8re\" Mersenne; ; 8 September 1588 \u2013 1 September 1648) was a French polymath whose works touched a wide variety of fields. He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those written in the form \"Mn\" \n 2\"n\" \u2212 1 for some integer \"n\". He also developed Mersenne's laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, \"Harmonie universelle\", for which he is referred to as the \"father of acoustics\". \nMersenne, an ordained Catholic priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called \"the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s\" and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, \"the post-box of Europe\". He was also a member of the ascetical Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy.\nLife.\nMersenne was born of Jeanne Mouli\u00e8re, wife of Julien Mersenne, peasants who lived near Oiz\u00e9, County of Maine (present-day Sarthe, France). He was educated at Le Mans and at the Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che. On 17 July 1611, he joined the Minim Friars and, after studying theology and Hebrew in Paris, was ordained a priest in 1613.\nBetween 1614 and 1618, he taught theology and philosophy at Nevers, but he returned to Paris and settled at the convent of L'Annonciade in 1620. There he studied mathematics and music and met with other kindred spirits such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, \u00c9tienne Pascal, Pierre Petit, Gilles de Roberval, Thomas Hobbes, and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. He corresponded with Giovanni Doni, Jacques Alexandre Le Tenneur, Constantijn Huygens, Galileo Galilei, and other scholars in Italy, England and the Dutch Republic. He was a staunch defender of Galileo, assisting him in translations of some of his mechanical works.\nFor four years, Mersenne devoted himself entirely to philosophic and theological writing, and published \"Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim\" (\"Celebrated Questions on the Book of Genesis\") (1623); \"L'Impiet\u00e9 des d\u00e9istes\" (\"The Impiety of the Deists\") (1624); \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences\" (\"Truth of the Sciences Against the Sceptics\", 1624). It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he was a Jesuit. He was educated by Jesuits, but he never joined the Society of Jesus. He taught theology and philosophy at Nevers and Paris.\nIn 1635 he set up the informal \"Acad\u00e9mie Parisienne\" (Academia Parisiensis), which had nearly 140 correspondents, including astronomers and philosophers as well as mathematicians, and was the precursor of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences established by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666. He was not afraid to cause disputes among his learned friends in order to compare their views, notable among which were disputes between Descartes, Pierre de Fermat, and Jean de Beaugrand. Peter L. Bernstein, in his book \"Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk\", wrote, \"The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, which were founded about twenty years after Mersenne's death, were direct descendants of Mersenne's activities.\"\nIn 1635 Mersenne met with Tommaso Campanella but concluded that he could \"teach nothing in the sciences ... but still he has a good memory and a fertile imagination.\" Mersenne asked if Descartes wanted Campanella to come to Holland to meet him, but Descartes declined. He visited Italy fifteen times, in 1640, 1641 and 1645. In 1643\u20131644 Mersenne also corresponded with the German Socinian Marcin Ruar concerning the Copernican ideas of Pierre Gassendi, finding Ruar already a supporter of Gassendi's position. Among his correspondents were Descartes, Galileo, Roberval, Pascal, Beeckman and other scientists.\nHe died on 1 September 1648 of complications arising from a lung abscess.\nWork.\n\"Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim\" was written as a commentary on the Book of Genesis and comprises uneven sections headed by verses from the first three chapters of that book. At first sight the book appears to be a collection of treatises on various miscellaneous topics. However Robert Lenoble has shown that the principle of unity in the work is a polemic against magical and divinatory arts, cabalism, and animistic and pantheistic philosophies.\nMersenne was concerned with the teachings of some Italian naturalists that all things happened naturally and determined astrologically; for example, the nomological determinism of Lucilio Vanini (\"God acts on sublunary beings (humans) using the sky as a tool\"), and Gerolamo Cardano's idea that martyrs and heretic were compelled to self-harm by the stars; Historian of science William Ashworth explains \"Miracles, for example, were endangered by the naturalists, because in a world filled with sympathies and occult forces\u2014with what Lenoble calls a \"spontan\u00e9it\u00e9 ind\u00e9finie\"\u2014anything could happen naturally\".\nMersenne mentions Martin Del Rio's \"Investigations into Magic\" and criticises Marsilio Ficino for claiming power for images and characters. He condemns astral magic and astrology and the \"anima mundi\", a concept popular amongst Renaissance neo-platonists. Whilst allowing for a mystical interpretation of the Cabala, he wholeheartedly condemned its magical application, particularly angelology. He also criticises Pico della Mirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, Francesco Giorgio and Robert Fludd, his main target.\n\"Harmonie universelle\" is perhaps Mersenne's most influential work. It is one of the earliest comprehensive works on music theory, touching on a wide range of musical concepts, and especially the mathematical relationships involved in music. The work contains the earliest formulation of what has become known as Mersenne's laws, which describe the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string. This frequency is:\nThe formula for the lowest frequency is\nformula_1\nwhere \"f\" is the frequency [Hz], \"L\" is the length [m], \"F\" is the force [N] and \u03bc is the mass per unit length [kg/m].\nIn this book, Mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts that can be considered the basis of modern reflecting telescopes:\nBecause of criticism that he encountered, especially from Descartes, Mersenne made no attempt to build a telescope of his own.\nMersenne is also remembered today thanks to his association with the Mersenne primes. The Mersenne Twister, named for Mersenne primes, is frequently used in computer engineering and in related fields such as cryptography.\nHowever, Mersenne was not primarily a mathematician; he wrote about music theory and other subjects. He edited works of Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek mathematicians. But perhaps his most important contribution to the advance of learning was his extensive correspondence (in Latin) with mathematicians and other scientists in many countries. At a time when the scientific journal had not yet come into being, Mersenne was the centre of a network for exchange of information.\nIt has been argued that Mersenne used his lack of mathematical specialty, his ties to the print world, his legal acumen, and his friendship with the French mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) to manifest his international network of mathematicians.\nMersenne's philosophical works are characterized by wide scholarship and the narrowest theological orthodoxy. His greatest service to philosophy was his enthusiastic defence of Descartes, whose agent he was in Paris and whom he visited in exile in the Netherlands. He submitted to various eminent Parisian thinkers a manuscript copy of the \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", and defended its orthodoxy against numerous clerical critics.\nIn later life, he gave up speculative thought and turned to scientific research, especially in mathematics, physics and astronomy. In this connection, his best known work is \"Harmonie universelle\" of 1636, dealing with the theory of music and musical instruments. It is regarded as a source of information on 17th-century music, especially French music and musicians, to rival even the works of Pietro Cerone.\nOne of his many contributions to musical tuning theory was the suggestion of\n formula_2\nas the ratio for an equally-tempered semitone (formula_3). It was more accurate (0.44 cents sharp) than Vincenzo Galilei's 18/17 (1.05 cents flat), and could be constructed using straightedge and compass. Mersenne's description in the 1636 \"Harmonie universelle\" of the first absolute determination of the frequency of an audible tone (at 84\u00a0Hz) implies that he had already demonstrated that the absolute-frequency ratio of two vibrating strings, radiating a musical tone and its octave, is 1\u00a0:\u00a02. The perceived harmony (consonance) of two such notes would be explained if the ratio of the air oscillation frequencies is also 1\u00a0:\u00a02, which in turn is consistent with the source-air-motion-frequency-equivalence hypothesis.\nHe also performed extensive experiments to determine the acceleration of falling objects by comparing them with the swing of pendulums, reported in his \"Cogitata Physico-Mathematica\" in 1644. He was the first to measure the length of the seconds pendulum, that is a pendulum whose swing takes one second, and the first to observe that a pendulum's swings are not isochronous as Galileo thought, but that large swings take longer than small swings.\nBattles with occult and mystical thinkers.\nTwo German pamphlets that circulated around Europe in 1614\u201315, \"Fama fraternitatis\" and \"Confessio Fraternitatis\", claimed to be manifestos of a highly select, secret society of alchemists and sages called the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians. The books were allegories, but were obviously written by a small group who were reasonably knowledgeable about the sciences of the day, and their main theme was to promote educational reform (they were anti-Aristotelian). These pamphlets also promoted an occult view of science containing elements of Paracelsian philosophy, neo-Platonism, Christian Cabala and Hermeticism. In effect, they sought to establish a new form of scientific religion with some pre-Christian elements.\nMersenne led the fight against acceptance of these ideas, particularly those of Rosicrucian promoter Robert Fludd, who had a lifelong battle of words with Johannes Kepler. Fludd responded with \"Sophia cum moria certamen\" (1626), wherein he discusses his involvement with the Rosicrucians. The anonymous \"Summum bonum\" (1629), another critique of Mersenne, is a Rosicrucian-themed text. The cabalist Jacques Gaffarel joined Fludd's side, while Pierre Gassendi defended Mersenne.\nThe Rosicrucian ideas were defended by many prominent men of learning, and some members of the European scholarly community boosted their own prestige by claiming to be among the selected members of the Brotherhood. However, it is now generally agreed among historians that there is no evidence that an order of Rosicrucians existed at the time, with later Rosicrucian Orders drawing on the name, with no relation to the writers of the Rosicrucian Manifestoes.\nDuring the mid-1630s Mersenne gave up the search for physical causes in the Aristotelian sense (rejecting the idea of \"essences\", which were still favoured by the scholastic philosophers) and taught that true physics could be only a descriptive science of motions (\"M\u00e9canisme\"), which was the direction set by Galileo Galilei. Mersenne had been a regular correspondent with Galileo and had extended the work on vibrating strings originally developed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei.\nMusic.\nAn air attributed to Mersenne was used by Ottorino Respighi in his second suite of \"Ancient Airs and Dances\"\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72950", "revid": "1320267308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72950", "title": "York Minster", "text": "Grade I listed cathedral in England\nYork Minster, formally the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, is an Anglican cathedral in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. The minster is the seat of the archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the diocese of York and the province of York. It is administered by its dean and chapter. The minster is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.\nThe first record of a church on the site dates to 627; the title \"minster\" also dates to the Anglo-Saxon period, originally denoting a missionary teaching church and now an honorific. The minster undercroft contains re-used fabric of c.\u20091160, but the bulk of the building was constructed between 1220 and 1472. It consists of Early English Gothic north and south transepts, a Decorated Gothic nave and chapter house, and a Perpendicular Gothic eastern arm and central tower.\nThe minster retains most of its medieval stained glass, a significant survival among European churches. The east window, which depicts the Last Judgment, is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the world. The north transept contains the Five Sisters window, which consists of five lancets, each over high, filled with grisaille glass.\nHistory.\nA bishop of York was summoned to the Council of Arles in 314, indicating the presence of a Christian community in York at this time; however, archaeological evidence of Christianity in Roman York is limited. The first recorded church was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. The location of this church, and its pre-1080 successors, is unknown. It was probably in or beside the old Roman \"principia\", (the military headquarters), which may have been used by the king when in residence in York. Archaeological evidence indicates the \"principia\" was located partly beneath the post-1080 Minster site, but excavations undertaken in 1967\u201373 found no remains of the pre-1080 churches. It can therefore be inferred that Edwin's church, and its immediate successors, was near the current Minster (possibly to the north, underneath the modern Dean's Park) but not directly on the same site.\nMoves towards a more substantial building began shortly after Edwin's baptism. According to Bede, Edwin set about building a larger church made of stone, intended to enclose the wooden chapel in which he had been baptised. This stone structure was completed in 637 by Oswald and was dedicated to Saint Peter. The church soon fell into disrepair and was dilapidated by 670 when Saint Wilfrid ascended to the See of York. He repaired and renewed the structure, installing leaded roofs, glass windows, and rich furnishings. The attached school and library were established and by the 8th century were some of the most substantial in Northern Europe.\nIn 741, the cathedral may have been damaged or destroyed in a fire. Any damage to the cathedral was not long-lasting. Alcuin (who makes no mention of the fire or rebuilding) wrote in detail of the building's wealth and grandeur. In his time, there was a grand altar erected over the place of Edwin's baptism, covered with precious metals and jewels. A spectacular chandelier hung above the altar, and the cathedral possessed a rich and valuable silver cross and golden cruet. The cathedral, together with the rest of the city, then passed through the hands of numerous invaders, and its history is obscure until the 10th century. There were a series of Benedictine archbishops, including Saint Oswald of Worcester, Wulfstan and Ealdred, who travelled to Westminster to crown William the Conqueror in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the cathedral.\nIn January 1069 a rebellion in support of Edgar \u00c6theling triggered a brutal crackdown by William. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" reports that William's forces \"ravaged the town, and made St Peter\u2019s Minster a disgrace\". Later in the year, Danish invaders supporting the \u00c6theling sailed up the Humber and Ouse; they attacked the city, in the course of which a fire broke out, burning the cathedral. Anything at this point remaining of the cathedral may then have been further damaged by William's Harrying of the North. The first Norman archbishop, Thomas of Bayeux, arriving in 1070, apparently organised repairs, but in 1075, another Danish force sailed up the river, \"travelled to York and broke into St Peter\u2019s Minster, and there took much property, and so went away.\" Building of a new cathedral, the Norman Minster, began in 1080, and was completed before Thomas's death in 1100. The new cathedral was likely immediately to the south of the old Saxon cathedral, which was probably demolished once the new structure was completed. A similar approach was taken in the same period at Winchester. Built in the Norman style, the new cathedral was 364.173\u00a0ft (111\u00a0m) long and rendered in white and red lines. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.\nThe Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to rival Canterbury; building began in 1220. The north and south transepts were the first new structures; completed in the 1250s, both were built in the Early English Gothic style but had markedly different wall elevations. A substantial central tower was also completed, with a wooden spire. Building continued into the 15th century.\nThe Chapter House was begun in the 1260s and was completed before 1296. The wide nave was constructed from the 1280s on the Norman foundations. The outer roof was completed in the 1330s, but the vaulting was not finished until 1360. Construction then moved on to the eastern arm and chapels; the Norman choir was demolished in the 1390s with the exception of its undercroft of c.\u20091160, which was reconstructed to provide a platform for the new high altar. Work here finished around 1405. In 1407 the central tower collapsed; the piers were then reinforced, and a new tower was built from 1420. The western towers were added between 1433 and 1472. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.\nThe English Reformation led to the looting of much of the cathedral's treasures and the loss of much of the church lands. Under Elizabeth I there was a concerted effort to remove all traces of Roman Catholicism from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.\nFollowing the easing of religious tensions some work was done to restore the cathedral. From 1730 to 1736 the whole floor of the minster was relaid in patterned marble and from 1802 there was a major restoration. However, on 2 February 1829, an arson attack by Jonathan Martin inflicted heavy damage on the east arm. An accidental fire in 1840 left the nave, south west tower and south aisle roofless and blackened shells. The cathedral slumped deeply into debt and in the 1850s services were suspended. From 1858 Augustus Duncombe worked successfully to revive the cathedral. In 1866, there were six residentiary canonries: of which one was the Chancellor's, one the Sub-Dean's, and another annexed to the Archdeaconry of York.\nDuring the 20th century there was more concerted preservation work, especially following a 1967 survey that revealed the building, in particular the central tower, was close to collapse. \u00a32,000,000 was raised and spent by 1972 to reinforce and strengthen the building foundations and roof. During the excavations that were carried out, remains of the north corner of the Roman \"Principia\" (headquarters of the Roman fort of Eboracum) were found under the south transept. This area, as well as remains of the Norman cathedral, re-opened to the public in spring 2013 as part of the new exhibition exploring the history of the building of York Minster.\n1984 fire.\nOn 9 July 1984, York Minster suffered a serious fire in its south transept during the early morning hours. Firefighters made a decision to deliberately collapse the roof of the south transept by pouring tens of thousands of gallons of water onto it, in order to save the rest of the building from destruction. A total of 114 firefighters from across North Yorkshire responded to the fire and contained it, while York Minster's staff and clergy rushed to preserve historical objects in the building. The glass of the south transept rose window was shattered by the heat but the lead held it together, allowing it to be taken down for restoration. A subsequent investigation found an 80% chance that the fire was caused by a lightning strike to a metal electrical box on top of the roof, a 10% chance that the fire was caused by arson, and a 10% chance that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Some traditionalist Anglicans suggested the fire was a sign of divine displeasure at the recent consecration as Bishop of Durham of David Jenkins, whose views they considered heterodox.\nA repair and restoration project was completed in 1988 at a cost of \u00a32.25\u00a0million, and included new roof bosses to designs which had won a competition put on by BBC Television's \"Blue Peter\" programme for children. The roof trusses were rebuilt in oak, but some were coated with fire-retardant plaster.\n2002 West Door renewal.\nIn 2002, the carvings round the great west door, which had become severely weathered, were replaced with new sculptures carved by Minster masons to designs by the sculptor Rory Young, telling the Genesis story.\n2007\u20132018 renovation.\nIn 2007 renovation began on the east front, including the Great East Window, at an estimated cost of \u00a323\u00a0million. The 311 glass panels from the Great East Window were removed in 2008 for conservation. The project was completed in 2018.\nSchools.\nThere have been choir schools associated with the Minster since the 7th century. A 'song school' was founded in 627 by Paulinus of York, the first Archbishop of York. Buildings used by the former Minster school have been awarded listed status, among them the school house built 1830\u201333, two houses dating back to 1837, and a Georgian building of 1755.\nArchitecture of the present building.\nYork Minster is the second-largest Gothic cathedral of Northern Europe and clearly charts the development of English Gothic architecture from Early English through to the Perpendicular Period. The present building was begun in about 1230 and completed in 1472. York Minster is the largest cathedral completed during the Gothic period of architecture, Cologne Cathedral only being completed in 1880, after being left uncompleted for 350 years. It has a cruciform plan with an octagonal chapter house attached to the north transept, a central tower and two towers at the west front. The stone used for the building is magnesian limestone, a creamy-white coloured rock that was quarried in nearby Tadcaster. The Minster is long and the central tower has a height of . The choir has an interior height of .\nThe north and south transepts were the first parts of the new church to be built. They have simple lancet windows, including the \"Five Sisters\" in the north transept. These are five lancets, each tall and five feet wide and glazed with grey (grisaille) glass, rather than narrative scenes or symbolic motifs that are usually seen in medieval stained-glass windows. In the south transept is a rose window whose glass dates from about 1500 and commemorates the union of the royal houses of York and Lancaster. The roofs of the transepts are of wood; that of the south transept was burnt in the fire of 1984 and was replaced in the restoration work which was completed in 1988. New designs were used for the bosses, five of which were designed by winners of a competition organised by the BBC's \"Blue Peter\" television programme.\nWork began on the chapter house and its vestibule that links it to the north transept after the transepts were completed. The style of the chapter house is of the early Decorated Period where geometric patterns were used in the tracery of the windows, which were wider than those of early styles. However, the work was completed before the appearance of the ogee curve, an S-shaped double curve that was extensively used at the end of this period. The windows cover almost all of the upper wall space, filling the chapter house with light. The chapter house is octagonal, as is the case in many cathedrals, but is notable in that it has no central column supporting the roof. The wooden roof, which was of an innovative design, is light enough to be able to be supported by the buttressed walls. The chapter house has many sculptured heads above the canopies, representing some of the finest Gothic sculpture in the country. There are human heads, no two alike, and some pulling faces; angels; animals and grotesques. Unique to the transepts and chapter house is the use of Purbeck marble to adorn the piers, adding to the richness of decoration. The chapter house exhibits the influence of Saint-Urbain, Troyes in the tracery in the vestibule, while the stalls are enlarged versions of the archivolt niches in the portal of Notre-Dame de Paris.\nThe nave was built between 1291 and c.\u20091350 and is also in the decorated Gothic style. It is the widest Gothic nave in England and has a wooden roof (painted so as to appear like stone) and the aisles have vaulted stone roofs. At its west end is the Great West Window, known as the 'Heart of Yorkshire', second-largest among the church's 128 windows. This window was designed and built along with the rest of the west front by the master mason Ivo de Raghton in 1338\u201339. The tracery is in the Flamboyant or Curvilinear Decorated style of English Gothic architecture. Because of deterioration of stone mullions, the tracery was replaced in the late 1980s with an exact copy.\nThe east end of the Minster was built between 1361 and 1405 in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Despite the change in style, noticeable in details such as the tracery and capitals, the eastern arm preserves the pattern of the nave. The east end contains a four-bay choir; a second set of transepts, projecting only above half-height; and the Lady Chapel. The transepts are in line with the high altar and serve to throw light onto it. Behind the high altar is the Great East Window, the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, which underwent a decade-long restoration and conservation project, completed in 2018.\nThe sparsely decorated \"Central Tower\" was built between 1407 and 1472 and is also in the Perpendicular style. Below this, separating the choir from the crossing and nave is the striking 15th-century choir screen. It contains sculptures of the kings of England from William the Conqueror to Henry VI with stone and gilded canopies set against a red background. Above the screen is the organ, which dates from 1832. The West Towers, in contrast with the Central Tower, are heavily decorated and are topped with battlements and eight pinnacles each, again in the Perpendicular style.\nIn 2003, English Heritage made publicly available a monograph on the architectural history of York Minster. The book charts the construction and development of the minster based on the architectural recording of the building from the 1970s.\nStained glass.\nSome of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the 12th century and much of the glass (white or coloured) came from Germany. The glass was painted, fired, then joined with lead strips (came) into the windows. The Dean and Chapter of York commissioned John Thornton in 1405 to design the tall and wide Great East Window; he was paid \u00a366 for the work. Composed of over 300 panels, this is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, according to the Minster. The window represents scenes from the Book of Revelation, and the glazier Thornton may have been influenced by earlier illuminated manuscripts on the subject such as the Latin Douce Apocalypse (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Douce MS 180) and the Old French Queen Mary Apocalypse (London, British Library Royal MS BXV). The work was conceived by Archbishop John of Thoresby in the mid fourteenth century, but the window itself was only completed thanks to the funding of Bishop Walter Skirlaw and Archbishop Richard Scrope.\nAnother important window is the tall Five Sisters window. Because of the extended time periods during which the glass was installed, different types of glazing and painting techniques are visible in the different windows. Approximately two million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's stained-glass windows. The windows were removed in 1916 because of the fear of bombing during the First World War and the \"Five Sisters\" window was restored in 1925 with \u00a33,500 raised by Almyra Gray and Helen Little. The glass was removed again during the Second World War.\nIn 2008 a conservation project of the Great East Window commenced, involving the removal, repainting and re-leading of each individual panel. While the window was in storage in the minster's stonemasons' yard, a fire broke out in some adjoining offices, due to an electrical fault, on 30 December 2009. The window's 311 panes, stored in a neighbouring room, were undamaged and were successfully moved to safety. In September 2015, the first phase of the renovation project of the East Front of the Minster was completed. The final phase of the \u00a311\u00a0million restoration of the 311 panels was completed in September 2017 and they were re-installed between November 2017 and January 2018. In total, the work on the Great East Window had taken 92,400 hours of labour, including the time required to add protective UV coating on the glass. The work was largely undertaken or overseen by Peter Gibson, who worked on all the Minster's windows during his career.\nTowers and bells.\nThe two west towers of the minster hold bells, clock chimes and a concert carillon. The north-west tower contains Great Peter (216\u00a0cwt or 10.8\u00a0tons) and the six clock bells (the largest weighing just over 60\u00a0cwt or 3\u00a0tons). The south-west tower holds 14 bells (tenor 59\u00a0cwt or 3\u00a0tons) hung and rung for change ringing and 22 carillon bells (tenor 23\u00a0cwt or 1.2\u00a0tons) which are played from a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber (all together 36 bells.)\nThe clock bells ring every quarter of an hour during the daytime and Great Peter strikes the hour.\nThe change ringing bells fell silent in October 2016, following the controversial termination of the ringers' volunteer agreements by the dean and chapter. The pause in ringing included the Christmas period of 2016, reported as the first time in over 600 years that the Minster's bells were not heard on Christmas Day. After a year with no change ringing, a new band was appointed and ringing resumed.\nYork Minster became the first cathedral in England to have a carillon of bells with the arrival of a further twenty-four small bells on 4 April 2008. These are added to the existing \"Nelson Chime\" which is chimed to announce Evensong around 5:00\u00a0pm each day, giving a carillon of 35 bells in total (three chromatic octaves). The new bells were cast at the Loughborough Bell Foundry of John Taylor &amp; Co, where all of the existing minster bells were cast. The new carillon is a gift to the minster. It will be the first new carillon in the British Isles for 40 years and first hand played carillon in an English cathedral. Before Evensong each evening, hymn tunes are played on a baton keyboard connected with the bells, but occasionally anything from Beethoven to the Beatles may be heard.\nShrines.\nWhen Thomas Becket was murdered and subsequently enshrined at Canterbury, York found itself with a rival major draw for pilgrims. More specifically, pilgrims spent money and would leave gifts for the support of the cathedral. Hence Walter de Gray, supported by the King, petitioned the Pope. On 18 March 1226, Pope Honorius issued a letter to the effect that the name of William (Fitzherbert), formerly Archbishop of York, was \"inscribed in the catalogue of the Saints of the Church Militant.\" Thus there was now St William of York (whose name is perhaps more often associated with the adjacent St William's College). York had its saint but it took until 1279, when William de Wickwane (William de Wykewayne) was elected archbishop, for the remains of the canonised William to be transferred to a shrine prepared for them behind the high altar. This was placed on a platform raised upon the arches of the crypt removed to this position for that purpose. On 29 December King Edward I himself, together with the bishops who were present, carried on their shoulder the chest or feretory containing the relics to their new resting-place and Anthony Beck, consecrated the same day as Bishop of Durham, paid all the expenses.\nThe tomb of Walter de Gray was erected in the south transept. His remains were interred on \"the vigil of Pentecost, 1255\" under his effigy \"in full canonicals\" carved in Purbeck marble under a canopy resting on ten light pillars. It was subsequently somewhat hidden behind a screen of ironwork erected by Archbishop William Markham in the early 19th century.\nOn 9 November 2022 King Charles III unveiled a statue of his mother Queen Elizabeth II in a niche on the west facade of York Minster.\nConsulting architects.\nThe Minster's consulting architects (since 1965 called \"Surveyors of the Fabric\" \u2013 see Cant and Aylmer, \"York Minster\", p.\u00a0554) have included the following:\nOrgan.\nThe fire of 1829 destroyed the organ and the basis of the present organ dates from 1832, when Elliot and Hill constructed a new instrument. This organ was reconstructed in 1859 by William Hill and Son. The case remained intact, but the organ was mechanically new, retaining the largest pipes of the former instrument.\nIn 1903, J. W. Walker and Sons built a new instrument in the same case. They retained several registers from the previous instrument.\nSome work was undertaken in 1918 by Harrison &amp; Harrison when the Tuba Mirabilis was added and the Great chorus revised. The same firm rebuilt this Walker-Harrison instrument in 1931 when a new console and electro-pneumatic action were added together with four new stops. The smaller solo tubas were enclosed in the solo box. In 1960, J. W. Walker &amp; Sons restored the actions, lowered wind pressures and introduced mutations and higher chorus work in the spirit of the neo-classical movement. They cleaned the organ in 1982.\nThe fire of 1984 affected the organ but not irreparably; the damage hastened the time for a major restoration, which was begun in 1991 and finished two years later by Principal Pipe Organs of York, under the direction of their founder, Geoffrey Coffin, who had at one time been assistant organist at the Minster.\nIn 2018, a \u00a32\u00a0million project to refurbish the current organ was announced. The project took two years for its completion in March 2021 and saw nearly all of its 5,403 pipes removed and taken to organ specialists Harrison &amp; Harrison in Durham.\nOrganists.\nThe organists of York Minster have had several official titles, the job description roughly equates to that of Organist and Master of the Choristers. The current Organist and Director of Music of the Minster is Robert Sharpe. There is also an assistant director of Music, Ben Morris.\nAmong the notable organists of York Minster are four members of the Camidge family, who served as the cathedral's organists for over 100 years, and a number of composers including John Naylor (1883\u20131897), T. Tertius Noble (1898\u20131913), Edward Bairstow (1913\u20131946), Francis Jackson (1946\u20131982) and Philip Moore (1983\u20132008).\nDean and chapter.\nAs of 20 January 2024:\nBurials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAstronomical clock.\nThe astronomical clock was installed in the north transept of York Minster in 1955. The clock is a memorial to the airmen operating from bases in Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumberland who were killed in action during the Second World War. The clock is not currently working.\nIlluminations.\nIn November 2002, York Minster was illuminated in colour, devised by York-born Mark Brayshaw, for the first time in its history. The occasion was televised live on the BBC1 \"Look North\" programme. Similar illuminations have been projected over the Christmas period in subsequent years.\nYork Minster was also artistically illuminated on 5 November 2005, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the foiling of York-born Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plot. This was done by Patrice Warrener using his unique \"chromolithe\" technique with which he 'paints' with light, picking out sculpted architectural details.\nIn October 2010, York Minster's south transept was selected for \"Rose\", a \"son et lumiere\" created by international artists Ross Ashton and Karen Monid which lit up the entire exterior of the south transept of the minster and illuminated the Rose Window. There were also satellite illuminate events in Dean's Park.\nYork Mystery Plays.\nIn 2000, the Dean and Chapter allowed the York Mystery Plays to be performed for the first time inside the Minster, directed by Gregory Doran. The Plays returned to the Minster for a second time in 2016, directed by Phillip Breen with Philip McGinley performing the role of Jesus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The saying of the Daily Offices (Matins and Evensong) and Holy Communion (or Mass) also being celebrated daily, plus the use of vestments and incense, mean it is fair to ascribe the label \"Anglo-Catholic\" to the style of worship at York Minster. However, the theological and sacramental positions, and how far they may be called \"catholic\", is debated."}

{"id": "72955", "revid": "2278355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72955", "title": "Tewkesbury Abbey", "text": "The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, Tewkesbury, commonly known as Tewkesbury Abbey, is located in the town of Tewkesbury in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England. A former Benedictine monastery, it is now a parish church. Considered one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in Britain, it has \"probably the largest and finest Romanesque\" crossing tower in England.\nTewkesbury had been a centre for worship since the 7th century. A priory was established there in the 10th century. The present building was started in the early 12th century. It was unsuccessfully used as a sanctuary in the Wars of the Roses. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Tewkesbury Abbey became the parish church for the town. George Gilbert Scott led the restoration of the building in the late 19th century. The church and churchyard within the abbey precincts include tombs and memorials to many of the aristocracy of the area.\nServices have been high church but now include Parish Eucharist, choral Mass, and Evensong. These services are accompanied by one of the church's three organs and choirs. There is a ring of twelve bells, hung for change ringing.\nHistory.\nThe \"Chronicle of Tewkesbury\" records that the first Christian worship was brought to the area by Theoc, a missionary from Northumbria, who built his cell in the mid-7th century near a gravel spit where the Severn and Avon rivers join. The cell was succeeded by a monastery in 715, but nothing remaining of it has been identified.\nIn the 10th century the religious foundation at Tewkesbury became a priory subordinate to the Benedictine Cranborne Abbey in Dorset. In 1087, William the Conqueror gave the manor of Tewkesbury to his cousin, Robert Fitzhamon, who, with Giraldus, Abbot of Cranborne, founded the present abbey in 1092. Building of the present abbey church did not start until 1102, employing Caen stone imported from Normandy and floated up the Severn.\nRobert Fitzhamon was wounded at Falaise in Normandy in 1105 and died two years later, but his son-in-law, Robert FitzRoy, the natural son of Henry I who was made Earl of Gloucester, continued to fund the building work. The abbey's greatest single later patron was Lady Eleanor le Despenser, last of the De Clare heirs of FitzRoy. In the High Middle Ages, Tewkesbury became one of the richest abbeys of England.\nAfter the Battle of Tewkesbury in the Wars of the Roses on 4 May 1471, some of the defeated Lancastrians sought sanctuary in the abbey. The victorious Yorkists, led by King Edward IV, forced their way into the abbey; the resulting bloodshed caused the building to be closed for a month until it could be purified and re-consecrated.\nAt the dissolution of the monasteries, the last abbot, John Wakeman, surrendered the abbey to the commissioners of King Henry VIII on 9 January 1539. As a former monk of an endowed community, he received an annuity. This was the relatively large sum of 400 marks, but would have ceased when he was ordained as the first Bishop of Gloucester in September 1541. Meanwhile, the people of Tewkesbury saved the abbey from destruction. Insisting that it was their parish church which they had the right to keep, they bought it from the Crown for the value of its bells and lead roof which would have been salvaged and melted down, leaving the structure a roofless ruin. The price came to \u00a3453.\nThe bells merited their own free-standing belltower, an unusual feature in English sites. After the dissolution, the bell-tower was used as the gaol for the borough until it was demolished in the late 18th century.\nThe central stone tower was originally topped with a wooden spire, which collapsed in 1559 and was never rebuilt. Restoration undertaken in the late 19th century under Sir George Gilbert Scott was reopened on 23 September 1879. Work continued under the direction of his son John Oldrid Scott until 1910 and included the rood screen of 1892.\nFlood waters from the nearby River Severn reached inside the abbey during severe floods in 1760, and again on 23 July 2007.\nThe building.\nThe church itself is one of the finest Norman buildings in England. Its massive crossing tower is noted in Pevsner's Buildings of England to be \"probably the largest and finest Romanesque example in England\". Fourteen of England's cathedrals are of smaller dimensions, while only Westminster Abbey contains more medieval church monuments.\nNotable monuments.\nNotable church monuments surviving in Tewkesbury Abbey include:\nOther burials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe three organs.\nMilton Organ.\nThe abbey's 17th-century organ \u2013 known as the Milton Organ \u2013 was originally made for Magdalen College, Oxford, by Robert Dallam. After the English Civil War it was removed to the chapel of Hampton Court Palace, where the poet Milton may have played it. It came to Tewkesbury in 1737. Since then, it has undergone several major rebuilds. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\nGrove Organ.\nIn the north transept is the stupendous Grove Organ, built by the short-lived partnership of Michell &amp; Thynne in 1885: http://.\nChamber organ.\nThe third organ in the abbey is the Elliott chamber organ of 1812, mounted on a movable platform: http://.\nList of organists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe bells.\nThe bells at the abbey were overhauled in 1962 and the ring is now made up of twelve bells, cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough. A semitone bell (Flat 6th) and extra treble were also cast by Taylor of Loughborough in 1991 and 2020 respectively, making a total of 14 available for change ringing.\nThe Old Clock Bells are the old 6th (Abraham Rudhall II, 1725), the old 7th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696), the old 8th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696) and the old 11th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1717).\nThe abbey bells are rung from 09:30am to 10:30am every Sunday. They are also rung on certain Sundays before Evensong. Practice takes place each Thursday from 7:30pm to 9:00pm.\nChurchyard.\nThe churchyard contains war graves of two World War II Royal Air Force personnel.\nAbbey precincts.\nThe market town of Tewkesbury developed to the north of the abbey precincts, of which vestiges remain in the layout of the streets and a few buildings: the Abbot's gatehouse, the Almonry barn, the Abbey Mill, Abbey House, the present vicarage and some half-timbered dwellings in Church Street. The abbey now sits partly isolated in lawns, like a cathedral in its cathedral close, for the area surrounding the abbey is protected from development by the Abbey Lawn Trust, a registered charity originally funded by a United States benefactor in 1962.\nChoirs.\nThe abbey possesses, in effect, two choirs. The Abbey Choir sings at Sunday services, with children (boys and girls) and adults in the morning, and adults in the evening. Tewkesbury Abbey Schola Cantorum is a professional choir of men, boys and girls based at Dean Close Preparatory School and sings at weekday Evensongs as well as occasional masses and concerts.\nThe abbey previously had its own school to educate and provide choristers to sing the service of Evensong. The Abbey School was founded in 1973 by Miles Amherst and closed in 2006. The choir was then re-housed at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and renamed the Tewkesbury Abbey Schola Cantorum.\nWorship.\nFor the most part, worship at the abbey has been emphatically High Anglican. However, in more recent times there has been an acknowledgement of the value of less solemn worship, and this is reflected in the two congregational services offered on Sunday mornings. The first of these (at 9.15am) is a Parish Eucharist, with modern language and an informal atmosphere; a parish breakfast is typically served after this service. The main Sung Eucharist at 11am is solemn and formal, including a choral Mass; traditional language is used throughout, and most parts of the service are indeed sung, including the Collect and Gospel reading. Choral Evensong is sung on Sunday evenings, and also on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday during the week. A said Eucharist also takes place every day of the week, at varying times, and alternating between traditional and modern language. Each summer since 1969 (with the exception of 2007 when the town was hit by floods) the abbey has played host to Musica Deo Sacra, a festival combining music and liturgy. Photography in the abbey is restricted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72971", "revid": "2304267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72971", "title": "Diptych", "text": "Object made of two paired flat plates, often joined by a hinge\nA diptych (, ) is any object with two flat plates which form a pair, often attached by a hinge. For example, the standard notebook and school exercise book of the ancient world was a diptych consisting of a pair of such plates that contained a recessed space filled with wax. Writing was accomplished by scratching the wax surface with a stylus. When the notes were no longer needed, the wax could be slightly heated and then smoothed to allow reuse. Ordinary versions had wooden frames, but more luxurious diptychs were crafted with more expensive materials.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"diptych\" is borrowed from the Latin , which itself is derived from the Late Greek () 'pair of writing tablets'. is the neuter plural of () 'double-folded'.\nArt.\nAs an art term a diptych is an artwork consisting of two pieces or panels that together create a single art piece. These can be fastened together or presented adjoining each other. In medieval times, panels were often hinged so that they could be closed and the artworks protected.\nIn Late Antiquity, ivory notebook diptychs with covers carved in low relief on the outer faces were a significant art-form: the \"consular diptych\" was made to celebrate an individual's becoming Roman consul, when they seem to have been made in sets and distributed by the new consul to friends and followers. Others may have been made to celebrate a wedding, or, perhaps like the Poet and Muse diptych at Monza, simply commissioned for private use. Some of the most important surviving works of the Late Roman Empire are diptychs, of which some dozens survive, preserved in some instances by being reversed and re-used as book covers. The largest surviving Byzantine ivory panel (428\u00a0mm \u00d7 143\u00a0mm), is a leaf from a diptych in the Justinian court manner of c.\u2009525\u2013550, which features an archangel.\nFrom the Middle Ages many panel paintings took the diptych form, as small portable works for personal use; Eastern Orthodox ones may be called \"travelling icons\". Although the triptych form was more common, there were also ivory diptychs with religious scenes carved in relief, a form found first in Byzantine art before becoming very popular in the Gothic period in the West, where they were mainly produced in Paris. These suited the mobile lives of medieval elites. The ivories tended to have scenes in several registers (vertical layers) crowded with small figures. The paintings generally had single subjects on a panel, the two matching, though by the 15th century one panel (usually the left one) might contain a portrait head of the owner or commissioner, with the Virgin or another religious subject on the other side. The outsides, which often received considerable wear from travelling, might have simpler decorative designs, including the coat of arms of the owner.\nLarge altarpieces tended to be made in triptych form, with two outer panels that could be closed across the main central representation. They are one type of the multi-panel forms of painting known as \"polyptychs\".\nThe diptych was a common format in Early Netherlandish painting and depicted subjects ranging from secular portraiture to religious personages and stories. Often a portrait and a Madonna and Child had a leaf each. It was especially popular in the 15th and 16th centuries. Painters such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Hugo van der Goes used the form. Some modern artists have used the term in the title of works consisting of two paintings never actually connected, but intended to be hung close together as a pair, such as Andy Warhol's \"Marilyn Diptych\" (1962) which is a modern pop culture icon.\n\"Diptych\" is also often used in reference to films or pieces of literature that form a complementary pair. When taken together, they are viewed as illuminating each other and comprising a distinct work of art from the individual parts. An example is the pair of Alan Ayckbourn plays, House and Garden.\nThe street artist Banksy has regularly used the diptych format for a variety of his studio produced artworks including Girl with Balloon. The diptych version of the work is made from spray paint on canvas with each panel measuring 30 x 30\u00a0cm and was released in an edition of 25 in 2005.\nEcclesiastical.\nIt is in this form that the mention of \"diptychs\" in early Christian literature is found. The term refers to official lists of the living and departed that are commemorated by the local church. The living would be inscribed on one wing of the diptych, and the departed on the other. The inscribing of a bishop's name in the diptychs means that the local church considers itself to be in communion with him, the removal of a bishop's name would indicate breaking communion with him. The names in the diptychs would be read publicly by the deacon during the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), and by the priest during the Liturgy of Preparation. Diptychs were also used to inscribe the names of the saints. Although the wax tablets themselves are no longer used, the term is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches to describe the contents of the diptychs, with all the same connotations.\nDiptych sundial.\nA face was on the inside of each leaf. One leaf formed a vertical sundial, the other a horizontal sundial. The shadow caster, or \"gnomon\", was a string between them, and calibrated as to how far they should open, as the angle is critical. Such a sundial can be adjusted to any latitude by tilting it so its gnomon is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation. A common error states that if both dials show the same time, the instrument is oriented correctly and faces north (in the northern hemisphere). A Diptych made as stated as a combined vertical and horizontal sundial with a string gnomon will show the same time on both dials regardless of orientation. This property of self alignment is only true for diptychs historically in the case for a combination of an analemmatic and a vertical sundial. A double dial on a flat plate consisting of a horizontal and an analemmatic dial will also be aligned properly if both dials show the same time.\nSome diptychs had rough calendars, in the form of pelekinons calibrated to a nodus in the form of a bead or knot on the string. These are accurate to about a week, which was good enough to time planting of crops.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a surface area of approximately , Lake Victoria is Africa's largest lake by area, the world's largest tropical lake, and the world's second-largest fresh water lake by surface area after Lake Superior in North America. In terms of volume, Lake Victoria is the world's ninth-largest continental lake, containing about of water. Lake Victoria occupies a shallow depression in Africa. The lake has an average depth of and a maximum depth of . Its catchment area covers . The lake has a shoreline of when digitized at the 1:25,000 level, with islands constituting 3.7% of this length. \nThe lake's area is divided among three countries: Tanzania occupies 49% (), Uganda 45% (), and Kenya 6% ().\nThe lake is home to many species of fish which live nowhere else, especially cichlids. Invasive fish, such as the Nile perch, have driven many endemic species to extinction.\nNames.\nThough having multiple local language names (; ; ; ), the lake was renamed after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton. \nGeology.\nPhotojournalist John Reader, writing in his Alan Paton Literary Award-winning \"Africa: A Biography of a Continent\", describes Lake Victoria as being relatively geologically young at about 400,000-years old\u2014having been formed as westward-flowing rivers were backed up \"when a fractured block of the Earth's crust tilted along the line of the Great Rift Valley, raising its western edge\". A primary study, attempting \"fluvial differentiation of the basin of Lake Victoria\", draws several relevant tentative conclusions. First, during the Miocene era, what is now the catchment area of the lake was on the western side of an uplifted area that functioned as a continental divide, with streams on the western side flowing into the Congo River basin and streams on the eastern side flowing to the Indian Ocean. Second, as the East African Rift System formed, the eastern wall of the Albertine Rift (or Western Rift) rose, gradually reversing the drainage towards what is now Lake Victoria. Third, the opening of the main East African Rift and the Albertine Rift downwarped the area between them as the rift walls rose, creating the current Lake Victoria basin. \nDuring its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present shallow depression, through to what may have been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria has dried up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which were times when precipitation declined globally. According to another primary source, Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago\u2014as the African humid period began.\nHydrology and limnology.\nLake Victoria receives 80 percent of its water from direct rainfall. Average evaporation on the lake is between per year, almost double the precipitation of riparian areas. Lake Victoria receives its water additionally from rivers, and thousands of small streams. The Kagera River is the largest river flowing into this lake, with its mouth on the lake's western shore. Lake Victoria is drained solely by the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda on the lake's northern shore.\nIn the Kenya sector, the main influent rivers are the Sio, Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Mogusi, and Migori. The only outflow from Lake Victoria is the Nile River, which exits the lake near Jinja, Uganda. In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the principal source of the longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate source of the Nile, is more often considered to be one of the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either Rwanda or Burundi. The uppermost section of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches Lake Albert. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the White Nile and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north.\nThe lake exhibits eutrophic conditions. In 1990\u20131991, oxygen concentrations in the mixed layer were higher than in 1960\u20131961, with nearly continuous oxygen supersaturation in surface waters. Oxygen concentrations in hypolimnetic waters (i.e., the layer of water that lies below the thermocline, is noncirculating, and remains perpetually cold) were lower in 1990\u20131991 for a longer period than in 1960\u20131961, with values of less than 1\u00a0mg per litre (&lt; 0.4\u00a0gr/cu\u00a0ft) occurring in water as shallow as compared with a shallowest occurrence of greater than in 1961. The changes in oxygenation are considered consistent with measurements of higher algal biomass and productivity. These changes have arisen for multiple reasons: successive burning within its basin, soot and ash from which has been deposited over the lake's wide area; from increased nutrient inflows via rivers, and from increased pollution associated with settlement along its shores.\nBetween 2010 and 2022, the surface area of Lake Victoria increased by 15% flooding lakeside communities.\nBathymetry.\nThe lake is a shallow lake considering its large geographic area with a maximum depth of approximately and an average depth of . A 2016 project digitized ten-thousand points and created the first true bathymetric map of the lake. The deepest part of the lake is offset to the east of the lake near Kenya and the lake is generally shallower in the west along the Ugandan shoreline and the south along the Tanzanian shoreline.\nNative wildlife.\nMammals.\nMany mammal species live in the region of Lake Victoria, and some of these are closely associated with the lake itself and the nearby wetlands. Among these are the hippopotamus, African clawless otter, spotted-necked otter, marsh mongoose, sitatunga, bohor reedbuck, defassa waterbuck, cane rats, and giant otter shrew.\nReptiles.\nLake Victoria and its wetlands has a large population of Nile crocodiles, as well as African helmeted turtles, variable mud turtles, and Williams' mud turtle. The Williams' mud turtle is restricted to Lake Victoria and other lakes, rivers, and swamps in the upper Nile basin.\nCichlid fish.\nLake Victoria formerly was very rich in fish, including many endemics, but a high percentage of these became extinct since the 1940s. The main group in Lake Victoria is the haplochromine cichlids (\"Haplochromis\" \"sensu lato\") with more than 500 species, almost all endemic, and including an estimated 300 that still are undescribed. This is far more species of fish than any other lake in the world, except Lake Malawi. These are the result of a rapid adaptive radiation in the last circa 15,000 years. Their extraordinary diversity and speed of evolution have been the subjects for many scientists studying the forces that drive the richness of life everywhere. The Victoria haplochromines are part of an older group of more than 700 closely related species, also including those of several smaller lakes in the region, notably Kyoga, Edward\u2013George, Albert, and Kivu.\nMost of these lakes are relatively shallow (like Victoria) and part of the present-day upper Nile basin. The exception is Lake Kivu, which is part of the present-day Congo River basin, but is believed to have been connected to Lakes Edward and Victoria by rivers until the uplifting of parts of the East African Rift. This deep lake may have functioned as an \"evolutionary reservoir\" for this haplochromine group in periods where other shallower lakes in the region dried out, as happened to Lake Victoria about 15,000 years ago. In recent history only Lake Kyoga was easily accessible to Victoria cichlids, as further downstream movement by the Victoria Nile (to Lake Albert) is prevented by a series of waterfalls, notably Murchison. In contrast, the Owen Falls (now flooded by a dam) between Victoria and Kyoga were essentially a series of rapids that did not effectively block fish movements between the two lakes.\nThe Victoria haplochromines are distinctly sexually dimorphic (males relatively brightly colored; females dull), and their ecology is extremely diverse, falling into at least 16 groups, including detritivores, zooplanktivores, insectivores, prawn-eaters, molluscivores and piscivores. As a result of predation by the introduced Nile perch, eutrophication and other changes to the ecosystem, it is estimated that at least 200 species (about 40 percent) of Lake Victoria haplochromines have become extinct, including more than 100 undescribed species. Initially it was feared that this number was even higher, by some estimates 65 percent of the total species, but several species that were feared extinct have been rediscovered after the Nile perch started to decline in the 1990s. Several of the remaining species are seriously threatened and additional extinctions are possible. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, have survived in refugias among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the Nile perch), or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. Such adaptions include a larger gill area (adaption for oxygen-poor water), changes in the feeding apparatus, changes to the eyes (giving them better sight in turbid water) and smaller head/larger caudal peduncle (allowing faster swimming). The piscivorous (affected by both predation and competition from Nile perch), molluscivorous and insectivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with many extinctions. Others have become extinct in their pure form, but survive as hybrids between close relatives (especially among the detritivores). The zooplanktivores have been least affected and in the late 1990s had reached densities similar to, or above, the densities before the drastic declines, although consisting of fewer species and often switching their diet towards macroinvertebrates. Some of the threatened Lake Victoria cichlid species have captive \"insurance\" populations in zoos, public aquaria and among private aquarists, and a few species are extinct in the wild (only survive in captivity).\nBefore the mass extinction that has occurred among the lake's cichlids in the last 50 years, about 90 percent of the native fish species in the lake were haplochromines. Disregarding the haplochromines, the only native Victoria cichlids are two critically endangered tilapia, the Singida tilapia or \"ngege\" (\"Oreochromis esculentus\") and Victoria tilapia (\"O. variabilis\").\nIn 1927\u20131928 Michael Graham conducted the first ever systematic Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria. In his official report of the expedition, Graham wrote that \"The ngege or satu \"Tilapia esculenta\", is the most important food fish of the lake, whether for native or non-native consumption. No other fish equals it in the quality of the flesh. It is convenient size for trade, travels well and is found in much greater numbers than other important fish, such as semutundu (Luganda), \"Bagrus sp.\"\". Furthermore, Graham noted that the introduction of the European flax gill net of 5 inch mesh had undoubtedly caused a diminution in the number of ngege in those parts of the Kavirondo Gulf, the northern shore of the lake, the Sesse Islands and Smith's Sound which are conveniently situated close to markets. Survey catches in 1927\u201328 included several Haplochromis species that are now thought to be extinct, including: \"Haplochromis flavipinnis\", \"Haplochromis gowersii\", \"Haplochromis longirostris\", \"Haplochromis macrognathus\", \"Haplochromis michaeli\", \"Haplochromis nigrescens\", \"Haplochromis prognathus\".\nAs well as being due to the introduction of Nile perch, the extinction of cichlids in the genus \"Haplochromis\" has also been blamed on the lake's eutrophication. The fertility of tropical waters depends on the rate at which nutrients can be brought into solution. The influent rivers of Lake Victoria provide few nutrients to the lake in relation to its size. Because of this, most of Lake Victoria's nutrients are thought to be locked up in lake-bottom deposits. By itself, this vegetative matter decays slowly. Animal flesh decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms. There is little doubt that \"Haplochromis\" played an important role in returning detritus and plankton back into solution. With some 80 percent of \"Haplochromis\" species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by humans and terrestrial animals. The removal of \"Haplochromis\", however, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of algal blooms, which may in turn be responsible for mass fish kills.\nOther fish.\nThe non-cichlid native fish include African tetras (\"Brycinus\"), cyprinids (\"Enteromius\", \"Garra\", \"Labeo\", \"Labeobarbus\", \"Rastrineobola\" and \"Xenobarbus\"), airbreathing catfish (\"Clariallabes\", \"Clarias\" and \"Xenoclarias\"), bagrid catfish (\"Bagrus\"), loach catfish (\"Amphilius\" and \"Zaireichthys\"), silver butter catfish (\"Schilbe intermedius\"), \"Synodontis\" squeaker catfish, \"Nothobranchius\" killifish, poeciliids (\"Aplocheilichthys\" and \"Micropanchax\"), the spiny eel \"Mastacembelus frenatus\", elephantfish (\"Gnathonemus\", \"Hippopotamyrus\", \"Marcusenius\", \"Mormyrus\", \"Petrocephalus\", and \"Pollimyrus\"), the climbing gourami \"Ctenopoma muriei\" and marbled lungfish (\"Protopterus aethiopicus\").\nAt a genus level, most of these are widespread in Africa, but the very rare \"Xenobarbus\" and \"Xenoclarias\" are endemic to the lake, and the common \"Rastrineobola\" is near-endemic.\nCrustaceans.\nFour species of freshwater crabs are known from Lake Victoria: \"Potamonautes niloticus\" is widespread in the lake and \"P. emini\" has been recorded from the vicinity of Bukoba in Tanzania, but both are also found elsewhere in Africa. The last were first scientifically described in 2017 and very little is known about them: \"P. entebbe\" is only known from near Entebbe (the only known specimen was collected in 1955 and it is unknown if it was in or near the lake) and \"P. busungwe\" only at Busungwe Island in the northwestern part of the lake. The latter likely is the smallest African freshwater crab with a carapace width up to about , although \"P. kantsyore\" of Kagera River, and \"Platythelphusa maculata\" and \"P. polita\" of Lake Tanganyika are almost as small.\nThe only shrimp/prawn is \"Caridina nilotica\", which is common and widespread in Lake Victoria.\nMolluscs.\nLake Victoria is home to 28 species of freshwater snails (e.g., \"Bellamya\", \"Biomphalaria\", \"Bulinus\", \"Cleopatra\", \"Gabbiella\", and \"Melanoides\"), including 12 endemic species/subspecies. There are 17 species of bivalves (\"Corbicula\", \"Coelatura\", \"Sphaerium\", and \"Byssanodonta\"), including 6 endemic species and subspecies. It is likely that undescribed species of snails remain. Conversely, genetic studies indicate that some morphologically distinctive populations, traditionally regarded as separate species, may only be variants of single species. Two of the snail genera, \"Biomphalaria\" and \"Bulinus\", are intermediate hosts of the parasite that causes bilharzia (schistosomiasis). Human infections by this parasite are common at Lake Victoria. This may increase as a result of the spread of the invasive water hyacinth (an optimum snail habitat), and the loss of many snail-eating cichlids in the lake.\nSpiders.\n\"Evarcha culicivora\" is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae) found only around Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda. It feeds primarily on female mosquitos.\nFisheries.\nLake Victoria supports Africa's largest inland fishery (as of 1997). Initially the fishery involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (\"Bagrus\", \"Clarias\", \"Synodontis\" and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (\"Labeo victorianus\") and marbled lungfish (\"Protopterus aethiopicus\"). Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (\"Labeo victorianus\"), had already declined in the first half of the 20th century due to overfishing. To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent). Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives. At the peak in the early 1990s, of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years.\nEnvironmental issues.\nA number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the \"most dramatic example of human-caused extinctions within an ecosystem\".\nInvasive fish.\nStarting in the 1950s, many species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (\"Coptodon rendalli\"), redbelly (\"C. zillii\"), Nile (\"Oreochromis niloticus\") and blue-spotted tilapias (\"O. leucostictus\"). Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (\"Lates niloticus\").\nAs early as the 1920s, it was proposed to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia \"O. esculentus\", as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as \"trash fish\" by the colonial government. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the colonial government) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962\u201363. \nThe origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954\u201355 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.\nWater hyacinth invasion.\nThe water hyacinth has become a major invasive plant species in Lake Victoria.\nThe release of large amounts of untreated wastewater (sewage) and agricultural and industrial runoff directly into Lake Victoria over the past 30 years has greatly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake \"triggering massive growth of exotic water hyacinth, which colonised the lake in the late 1990s\". This invasive weed creates anoxic (total depletion of oxygen levels) conditions in the lake, inhibiting decomposing plant material, raising toxicity and disease levels to both fish and people. At the same time, the plant's mat or \"web\" creates a barrier for boats and ferries to maneuver, impedes access to the shoreline, interferes with hydroelectric power generation, and blocks the intake of water for industries. On the other hand, water hyacinth mats can potentially have a positive effect on fish life in that they create a barrier to overfishing and allow for fish growth, there has even been the reappearance of some fish species thought to have been extinct in recent years. The overall effects of the water hyacinth, however, are still unknown.\nGrowth of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria has been tracked since 1993, reaching its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining again by the end of 2001. Greater growth was observed in the northern part of the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled by hand, removed manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth. A green power plant that uses harvested water hyacinth (but also can use other degradable waste) was constructed in Kisumu County in 2013. In addition to the biogas it produces, its by-product can be used as fertilizer.\nOther factors which may have contributed to the decline of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Ni\u00f1o during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.\nPollution.\nPollution of Lake Victoria is mainly due to discharge of raw sewage into the lake, dumping of domestic and industrial waste, and fertiliser and chemicals from farms.\nThe Lake Victoria basin, while generally rural, has many major centres of population. Its shores are dotted with key cities and towns, including Kisumu, Kisii, and Homa Bay in Kenya; Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe in Uganda; and Bukoba, Mwanza, and Musoma in Tanzania. These cities and towns are also home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its influent rivers. The set up of small beaches and local authorities around the lake lack proper sewage treatment facilities allowing pollutants to find their way into the water. Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth. Increased logging and act of deforestation has led to environmental degradation around the region reducing the absorption of polluting chemicals and deteriorating the water quality.\nEnvironmental data.\nAs of 2016, an environmental data repository exists for Lake Victoria. The repository contains shoreline, bathymetry, pollution, temperature, wind vector, and other important data for both the lake and the wider Basin.\nHistory and exploration.\nThe first recorded information about Lake Victoria comes from Arab traders plying the inland routes in search of gold, ivory, other precious commodities, and slaves.\nMany Africans tribes lived in the catchment area around the lake. It was first sighted by a European in 1858 when the British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while on his journey with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the Great Lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, who had been recovering from illness at the time and resting further south in Kazeh (near present-day Tabora), was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to have been the true source of the Nile River, which Burton regarded as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery.\nIn the late 1860s, the famous Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone failed in his attempt to verify Speke's discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the River Congo system instead. Ultimately, the British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, on an expedition funded by the \"New York Herald\" newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke's discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake's northern shore.\nWater use.\nMany towns and cities are reliant on Lake Victoria for their water supplies, for farming and other uses.\nLamadi water scheme.\nThe Lamadi water scheme is a water and sanitation project that serves Mwanza and the satellite towns of Lamadi, Misungwi, Magu, Bukoba, and Musoma on the bank of Lake Victoria. \u00a0European Investment Bank started the project in 2013 with the aim of protecting the environmental health of the lake, through improved water and sanitation to the towns whose pollution is part of the degradation of the lake. The project aims to provide safe drinking water for an estimated one million people and improved sanitation for 100 000 people. Sediment and suspended solids are filtered out using sand, which acts like a sieve. The water is then ready to be chlorinated or treated in another way. The sand filtration helps reduce water-borne diseases and is based on the use of the local environment.\nNalubaale Dam.\nThe only outflow for Lake Victoria is at Jinja, Uganda, where it forms the Victoria Nile. The water for at least 12,000 years has drained across a natural rock weir. In 1952, engineers acting for the government of Colonial Uganda blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir. A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the \"agreed curve\" was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 cubic metres per second (392\u20132,224 cu\u00a0yd/sec) depending on the lake's water level.\nIn 2002, Uganda completed a second hydroelectric complex in the area, the Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station, with World Bank assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in Nairobi, Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement, and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level.\nTransport.\nSince the 1900s, Lake Victoria ferries have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The main ports on the lake are Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, Entebbe, Port Bell, and Jinja. Until 1963, the fastest and newest ferry, MV \"Victoria\", was designated a Royal Mail Ship. In 1966, train ferry services between Kenya and Tanzania were established with the introduction of and . The ferry MV \"Bukoba\" sank in the lake on 21 May 1996 with a loss of between 800 and 1,000 lives, making it one of Africa's worst maritime disasters. Another tragedy occurred recently on 20 September 2018 that involved the passagers ferry MV Nyerere from Tanzania that caused the deaths of over 200 people.\nOn 6 November 2022, Lake Victoria was the site of a commercial passenger aircraft crash.

Founded in the 7th century, it was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries; major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s. It is one of the largest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture in the West Country. The medieval abbey church served as a sometime cathedral of a bishop. After long contention between churchmen in Bath and Wells the seat of the Diocese of Bath and Wells was later consolidated at Wells Cathedral. The Benedictine community was dissolved in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nThe church architecture is cruciform in plan and can seat up to 1,200 patrons. An active place of worship, it also hosts civic ceremonies, concerts and lectures. There is a heritage museum in the cellars.\nThe abbey is a Grade I listed building, particularly noted for its fan vaulting. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders, representing Jacob's Ladder.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 675 AD, Osric, King of the Hwicce, granted the Abbess Berta or Bertana 100 hides near Bath for the establishment of a convent. This religious house became a monastery under the patronage of the Bishop of Worcester. King Offa of Mercia successfully wrested \"that most famous monastery at Bath\" from the bishop in 781. William of Malmesbury tells that Offa rebuilt the monastic church, which may have occupied the site of an earlier pagan temple, to such a standard that King Eadwig was moved to describe it as being \"marvellously built\". In 944 Folcwin reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in France along Benedictine lines and monks who opposed the reform fled to England. King Edmund I gave them the church at Bath, which was then in royal hands. Little is known about the architecture of this first building on the site. Monasticism in England had declined by that time, but Eadwig's brother Edgar (who was crowned \"King of the English\" at the abbey in 973) began its revival on his accession to the throne in 959. He encouraged monks to adopt the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was introduced at Bath under Abbot \u00c6lfheah (St. Alphege), who also repaired the church. Sometime in the 10th century, as a result of the monastic reforms of Oswald and Dunstan, the monastic community of the site was re-established as a Benedictine monastery, which it remained until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.\nNorman Conquest to the Dissolution.\nBath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, \u00c6lfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city.\nIn 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells\u2014a comparatively small settlement\u2014to the then walled city of Bath.\nWhen this was effected in 1090, John became the first Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, it was felt that a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.\nThe half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137, but work continued under Godfrey, the new bishop, until about 1156; the completed building was approximately long. It was consecrated while Robert of Bath was bishop. The specific date is not known; however, it was between 1148 and 1161.\nIn 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.\nJoint cathedral status was awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245. Roger of Salisbury was appointed the first Bishop of Bath and Wells, having been Bishop of Bath for a year previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. The great Romanesque cathedral church, begun in the early twelfth century, was allowed to fall into chronic disrepair during the fifteenth century. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495\u20131503), visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church \"ruined to its foundations\". He also described lax discipline, idleness and a group of monks \"all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh\".\nKing took a year to consider what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral. There are several stories that, on a visit to Bath, King had a dream in which he \"saw the Heavenly Host on high with angels ascending and descending by ladder\" which is now represented on the west front of the cathedral. However, this interpretation, which first appeared in the writings of John Harington, around 100 years after it was supposed to have happened, has been challenged.\nRobert and William Vertue, the king's masons were commissioned, promising to build the finest vault in England, promising \"there shall be none so goodely neither in England nor France\". Their design incorporated the surviving Norman crossing wall and arches. They appointed Thomas Lynne to supervise work on site and work probably began the following spring. Oliver King planned a smaller church, covering the area of the Norman nave only. He did not live to see the result, but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.\nReformation and subsequent decline.\nPrior Holloway surrendered Bath Priory to the crown in January 1539. It was sold to Humphry Colles of Taunton. The abbey was stripped of its co-cathedral status in the aftermath of the Dissolution when the cathedral was consolidated in Wells. The church was stripped of iron, glass and \u00a34,800 worth of lead and left to decay. Colles sold it to Matthew Colthurst of Wardour Castle in 1543. His son Edmund Colthurst gave the roofless remains of the building to the corporation of Bath in 1572. The corporation had difficulty finding private funds for its restoration.\nIn 1574, Queen Elizabeth I promoted the restoration of the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608 to 1616, paid \u00a31,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle. The restoration work on the Abbey financed by Montague was completed by 1611.\nModern renaissance.\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s buildings, including houses, shops and taverns which were very close to or actually touching the walls of the abbey were demolished and the interior remodelled by George Phillips Manners who was the Bath City Architect. Manners erected flying buttresses to the exterior of the nave and added pinnacles to the turrets.\nMajor restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front. Gilbert-Scott also designed the finely carved pews in the nave, and are among the finest examples of Church seating from the period, and have been described as \"one of the most magnificent and extensive suites of Victorian church seating in the country\".\nWork carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries included full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The west\nfront of the building, having decayed badly in the 500 years since it was built, has been subject to almost wholesale restoration. The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work carried out in the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.\nRectors of Bath Abbey.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\u2020 \"Rector died in post\"\nArchitecture.\nThe Abbey is built of Bath stone, which gives the exterior its yellow colour, and is not a typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was to serve as a monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.\nThe walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, many of which were added by George Manners during his 1830s restorations.\nThe nave, which has five bays, is long and wide to the pillars and rises to , with the whole church being long and wide.\nThe west front, which was originally constructed in 1520, has a large arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495\u20131503), this is a direct reference to the dream of the patriarch Jacob mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 28:12) and commonly called Jacob's Ladder.\nBelow the window a battlemented parapet supports a statue and beneath this, on either side of the door, are statues of St Peter and St Paul. Restoration work in the late 20th century involved cleaning with electronically controlled intermittent water sprays and ammonium carbonate poultices. One of the figures which had lost its head and shoulders was replaced. The sculptures on the West front have been interpreted as representing \"spiritual ascent through the virtue of humility and descent through the vice of pride\" and Christ as the Man of Sorrow and the Antichrist. During the 1990s a major restoration and cleaning work were carried out on the exterior stonework, returning it to the yellow colour hidden under centuries of dirt.\nWindows.\nThe building has 52 windows, occupying about 80 per cent of the wall space. The east end has a square-framed window of seven lights. It includes a depiction of the nativity made by Clayton and Bell in 1872, and was presented to the church by the Bath Literary Club.\nThe window of the Four Evangelists over the northwest door is a memorial to Charles Empson, who died in 1861.\nIn 2010 a stained glass window was uncovered in the abbey vaults. The design around the window is by William Burges.\nTower.\nThe two-stage central tower is not square but oblong in plan. It has two bell openings on each side and four polygonal turret pinnacles. The tower is high, and is accessed by a staircase of 212 steps.\nBells.\nIn 1700 the old ring of six bells was replaced by a new ring of eight. All but the tenor still survive. In 1770 two lighter bells were added to create the first ring of ten bells in the diocese. The tenor was recast in 1870. The abbey's tower is now home to a ring of ten bells, which are hung unconventionally such that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti-clockwise around the ringing chamber, rather than in the usual clockwise fashion. The tenor weighs 33 cwt (3,721\u00a0lb or 1,688\u00a0kg). Bath is a noted centre of change ringing in the West Country.\nInterior.\nThe interior fan vaulting ceiling, originally installed by Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses.\nGilbert Scott's work in the 1870s included the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore. They were converted to electricity in 1979. Other new features included a new pulpit and seating. A marble altarpiece from General George Wade in the sanctuary was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos. The fine carved pews installed in the nave during Scott's renovations, one of the best examples of 19th century church furnishings, were removed and replaced with stackable chairs in 2018, a move which was opposed by the Victorian Society leading to a Consistory court case which was decided in favour of the Abbey.\nIn the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson redesigned the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel, now Gethsemane Chapel, and added a cloister. New quire screens were installed in 2004, partly to improve the acoustics, topped with 12 carved angels playing musical instruments.\nA tiled floor dating from the late 13th to early 14th centuries was discovered in August 2018. Work to rebury coffins which had previously been under the abbey and stabilise the floor included the digging of a trench in which the tiles were uncovered.\nMonuments.\nWithin the abbey are 617 wall memorials and 847 floor stones. They include those dedicated to Beau Nash, Admiral Arthur Phillip (first Governor of the colony of New South Wales, which became part of Australia after federation in 1901), James Montague (Bishop of Bath and Wells), Lady Waller (wife of William Waller, a Roundhead military leader in the English Civil War), Elizabeth Grieve (wife of James Grieve, physician to Elizabeth, Empress of Russia), Sir William Baker, John Sibthorp, Richard Hussey Bickerton, William Hoare, Richard Bickerton and US Senator William Bingham. Many of the monuments in the churchyard were carved between 1770 and 1860 by Reeves of Bath. War memorials include those commemorating the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841\u201342), the First World War (1914\u201318), and the Second World War (1939\u201345). The most recent memorial was installed in 1958 to commemorate Isaac Pitman, the developer of Pitman shorthand, who died in 1897.\nMain organ.\nThe first mention of an organ in the abbey dates to 1634, but nothing is known of that instrument. The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan's son. The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals. The compasses of the manuals were extended, one and a half octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland; further repairs were effected by Flight &amp; Robson in 1826. This instrument was removed first to the Bishop's Palace at Wells in 1836, then to St Mary's Church, Yatton, where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified.\nThe abbey's next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill &amp; Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.\nA new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console standing on the floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman &amp; Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.\nIt was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence\u2014the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972\u2014and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.\nThe organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case. New 75 per cent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.\nContinuo organ.\nA four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440\u00a0Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415\u00a0Hz and A=465\u00a0Hz. It is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.\nChoir.\nThe abbey has sections for boys, girls, lay clerks and children (the Melody Makers) and a chamber choir. As well as singing at the abbey, they also tour to cathedrals in the UK and Europe. The choir has broadcast Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3, and has made several recordings. It performed at the Three Tenors concert for the opening of the Thermae Bath Spa. The abbey is also used as a venue for visiting choirs and, from its inception in 1947, the City of Bath Bach Choir.\nThe choirs of Bath Abbey sung the 2015 Christmas Service live on BBC One.\nThey are led by the directors of music and assisted by the organists. The current Director of Music is Huw Williams who took the role in 2017. He replaced Peter King who served from 1986 to 2016.\nDiscovery Centre museum.\nBath Abbey's Discovery Centre is located beneath the Abbey shop and features artefacts and exhibits about the Abbey's development and history. Displays included the history of the building of the Abbey, monastic life, and the Abbey's impact on the community, the architecture and sculptures of the buildings, and the role of the Abbey in present times. The Discovery Centre replaces the previous Heritage Museum.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in Canterbury, Kent, it is one of the oldest Christian structures in England and forms part of a World Heritage Site. Its formal title is the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Christ, Canterbury.\nFounded in 597, the cathedral was completely rebuilt between 1070 and 1077. The east end was greatly enlarged at the beginning of the 12th century, and largely rebuilt in the Gothic style following a fire in 1174, with significant eastward extensions to accommodate the flow of pilgrims visiting the shrine of Thomas Becket, the archbishop who was murdered in the cathedral in 1170. The Norman nave and transepts survived until the late 14th century, when they were demolished to make way for the present structures.\nBefore the English Reformation, the cathedral was part of a Benedictine monastic community known as Christ Church, Canterbury, as well as being the seat of the archbishop.\nHistory.\nRoman.\nChristianity in Britain is referred to by Tertullian as early as 208 AD and Origen mentions it in 238 AD. In 314 three Bishops from Britain attended the Council of Arles. Following the end of Roman life in Britain, during the first three decades of the fifth century, and the subsequent arrival of the heathen Anglo-Saxons, Christian life in the east of the island was disrupted. Textual sources however suggest that the Christian communities established in the Roman province survived in Western Britain during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries. This Western British Christianity proceeded to develop on its own terms.\nIn 596, Pope Gregory I ordered Augustine, the abbot of St Andrew's Benedictine Abbey in Rome, to lead the Gregorian Mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. According to the writings of the later monk Bede, these Augustinian missionaries gained permission from the Kentish king to restore several pre-existing churches. Augustine then founded Canterbury cathedral in 597 and dedicated it to Jesus Christ, the Holy Saviour. When other dioceses were founded in England, Augustine of Canterbury was made archbishop.\nAugustine also founded the Abbey of St Peter and Paul outside the Canterbury city walls. This was later rededicated to St Augustine himself and was for many centuries the burial place of the successive archbishops. The abbey is part of the World Heritage Site of Canterbury, along with the cathedral and the ancient Church of St Martin.\nEarly Medieval.\nBede recorded that Augustine reused a former Roman church. The oldest remains found during excavations beneath the present nave in 1993 were, however, parts of the foundations of an Anglo-Saxon building, which had been constructed across a Roman road. They indicate that the original church consisted of a nave, possibly with a narthex, and side-chapels to the north and south. A smaller subsidiary building was found to the south-west of these foundations. During the 9th or 10th century this church was replaced by a larger structure () with a squared west end. It appears to have had a square central tower. The 11th-century chronicler Eadmer, who had known the Saxon cathedral as a boy, wrote that, in its arrangement, it resembled St Peter's in Rome, indicating that it was of basilican form, with an eastern apse.\nDuring the reforms of Dunstan, archbishop from 960 until his death in 988, a Benedictine abbey named Christ Church Priory was added to the cathedral. But the formal establishment as a monastery seems to date only to c.\u2009997 and the community only became fully monastic from Lanfranc's time onwards (with monastic constitutions addressed by him to Prior Henry). Dunstan was buried on the south side of the high altar.\nAnglo-Saxon King \u00c6thelred the Unready and Norman-born Emma of Normandy were married at Canterbury Cathedral in the Spring of 1002, and Emma was consecrated \"Queen \u00c6lfgifu\".\nThe cathedral was badly damaged during Danish raids on Canterbury in 1011. The archbishop, \u00c6lfheah, was taken hostage by the raiders and eventually killed at Greenwich on 19 April 1012, the first of Canterbury's five martyred archbishops. After this a western apse was added as an oratory of Saint Mary, probably during the archbishopric of Lyfing (1013\u20131020) or Aethelnoth (1020\u20131038).\nThe 1993 excavations revealed that the new western apse was polygonal, and flanked by hexagonal towers, forming a westwork. It housed the archbishop's throne, with the altar of St Mary just to the east. At about the same time that the westwork was built, the arcade walls were strengthened and towers added to the eastern corners of the church.\nNorman.\nThe cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1067, a year after the Norman Conquest. Rebuilding began in 1070 under the first Norman archbishop, Lanfranc (1070\u20131077). He cleared the ruins and reconstructed the cathedral to a design based closely on that of the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne in Caen, where he had previously been abbot, using stone brought from France. The new church, its central axis about 5\u00a0m south of that of its predecessor, was a cruciform building, with an aisled nave of nine bays, a pair of towers at the west end, aisleless transepts with apsidal chapels, a low crossing tower, and a short quire ending in three apses. It was dedicated in 1077.\nUnder Lanfranc's successor Anselm, who was twice exiled from England, the responsibility for the rebuilding or improvement of the cathedral's fabric was largely left in the hands of the priors. Following the election of Prior Ernulf in 1096, Lanfranc's inadequate east end was demolished, and replaced with an eastern arm 198 feet long, doubling the length of the cathedral. It was raised above a large and elaborately decorated crypt. Ernulf was succeeded in 1107 by Conrad, who completed the work by 1126. The new quire took the form of a complete church in itself, with its own transepts; the east end was semicircular in plan, with three chapels opening off an ambulatory. A free-standing campanile was built on a mound in the cathedral precinct in about 1160.\nAs with many Gothic church buildings, the interior of the quire was richly embellished. William of Malmesbury wrote: \"Nothing like it could be seen in England either for the light of its glass windows, the gleaming of its marble pavements, or the many-coloured paintings which led the eyes to the paneled ceiling above.\"\nThough named after the 6th-century founding archbishop, the Chair of St Augustine, the ceremonial enthronement chair of the Archbishop of Canterbury, may date from the Norman period. Its first recorded use is in 1205.\nPlantagenet period.\nMartyrdom of Thomas Becket.\nA pivotal moment in the history of the cathedral was the murder of the archbishop, Thomas Becket, in the north-west transept (also known as the Martyrdom) on Tuesday 29 December 1170, by knights of King Henry II. The king had frequent conflicts with the strong-willed Becket and is said to have exclaimed in frustration, \"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\" Four knights took it literally and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. After the Anglo-Saxon \u00c6lfheah in 1012, Becket was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered.\nThe posthumous veneration of Becket transformed the cathedral into a place of pilgrimage, necessitating both expansion of the building and an increase in wealth, via revenues from pilgrims, in order to make expansion possible.\nRebuilding of the quire.\nIn September 1174 the quire was severely damaged by fire, necessitating a major reconstruction, the progress of which was recorded in detail by a monk named Gervase. The crypt survived the fire intact, and it was found possible to retain the outer walls of the quire, which were increased in height by in the course of the rebuilding, but with the round-headed form of their windows left unchanged. Everything else was replaced in the new Gothic style, with pointed arches, rib vaulting, and flying buttresses. The limestone used was imported from Caen in Normandy, and Purbeck marble was used for the shafting. The quire was back in use by 1180 and in that year the remains of Dunstan and \u00c6lfheah were moved there from the crypt.\nThe master-mason appointed to rebuild the quire was a Frenchman, William of Sens. Following his injury in a fall from the scaffolding in 1179 he was replaced by one of his former assistants, known as William the Englishman.\nTrinity Chapel and Shrine of Thomas Becket.\nIn 1180\u20131184, in place of the old, square-ended, eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad extension with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket. A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off in the course of his assassination. This latter chapel became known as the \"Corona\" or \"Becket's Crown\". These new parts east of the quire transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf's quire, necessitating flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, but Becket's remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220. Further significant interments in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The \"Black Prince\") and King Henry IV.\nThe shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket's original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, Walter of Coventry, described as \"a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems\". Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket's remains. Further votive treasures were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery. For much of the time, the chest (or \"feretory\") was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered. The Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, who visited in 1512\u20131514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, \"the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.\"\nThe income from pilgrims (such as those portrayed in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\") who visited Becket's shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the cathedral and its associated buildings. This revenue included the profits from the sale of pilgrim badges depicting Becket, his martyrdom, or his shrine.\nThe shrine was removed in 1538. King Henry VIII allegedly summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear, he was found guilty in his absence and the treasures of his shrine were confiscated, carried away in two coffers and 26 carts.\nMonastic buildings.\nA bird's-eye view of the cathedral and its monastic buildings, made in about 1165 and known as the \"waterworks plan\" is preserved in the Eadwine Psalter in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. A detailed description of the plan can be found in the classic paper by Willis. It shows that Canterbury employed the same general principles of arrangement common to all Benedictine monasteries, although, unusually, the cloister and monastic buildings were to the north, rather than the south of the church. There was a separate chapter-house which still exists, said to be \"the largest of its kind in all of England\". Stained glass here depicts the history of Canterbury.\nThe buildings formed separate groups around the church. Adjoining it, on the north side, stood the cloister and the buildings devoted to the monastic life. To the east and west of these were those devoted to the exercise of hospitality. Also to the east was the infirmary, with its own chapel. To the north, a large open court divided the monastic buildings from menial ones, such as the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brewhouse, and laundries, inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the monastery, was the eleemosynary department. The almonry for the relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, formed the paupers' hospitium.\nThe group of buildings devoted to monastic life included two cloisters. The great cloister was surrounded by the buildings essentially connected with the daily life of the monks: the church to the south, with the refectory placed as always on the side opposite, the dormitory, raised on a vaulted undercroft, and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer, responsible for providing both monks and guests with food, to the west. A passage under the dormitory led eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister, appropriated to sick and infirm monks.\nThe hall and chapel of the infirmary extended east of this cloister, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, overlooking the green court or herbarium, lay the \"pisalis\" or \"calefactory\", the common room of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the necessarium, a building in the form of a Norman hall, long by broad, containing 55 seats. It was constructed with careful regard to hygiene, with a stream of water running through it from end to end.\nA second smaller dormitory for the conventual officers ran from east to west. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, were the domestic offices connected with it: to the north, the kitchen, square, with a pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries, pantries, etc. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the refectory door in the cloister were two buildings where the monks washed before and after eating. One of these is the circular two-storey lavatorium tower. To the south of the infirmary cloister, close to the east end of the cathedral, is the treasury, with a distinctive octapartite vault.56\nThe buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior's group were \"entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or nobility who were assigned to him.\" The cellarer's buildings, where middle-class visitors were entertained, stood near the west end of the nave. The inferior pilgrims and paupers were relegated to the north hall or almonry, just within the gate.\nPriors of Christ Church Priory included John of Sittingbourne (elected 1222, previously a monk of the priory) and William Chillenden, (elected 1264, previously monk and treasurer of the priory). The monastery was granted the right to elect their own prior if the seat was vacant by the pope, and\u00a0\u2013 from Gregory IX onwards\u00a0\u2013 the right to a free election (though with the archbishop overseeing their choice). Monks of the priory have included \u00c6thelric I, \u00c6thelric II, Walter d'Eynsham, Reginald fitz Jocelin (admitted as a confrater shortly before his death), Nigel de Longchamps and Ernulf. The monks often put forward candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury, either from among their number or outside, since the archbishop was nominally their abbot, but this could lead to clashes with the king or pope should they put forward a different man\u00a0\u2013 examples are the elections of Baldwin of Forde and Thomas Cobham.\n14th and 15th centuries.\nEarly in the 14th century, Prior Eastry erected a stone quire screen and rebuilt the chapter house, and his successor, Prior Oxenden inserted a large five-light window into St Anselm's chapel.\nThe cathedral was seriously damaged by the 1382 Dover Straits earthquake, losing its bells and campanile.\nFrom the late 14th century the nave and transepts were rebuilt, on the Norman foundations in the Perpendicular style under the direction of the noted master mason Henry Yevele. In contrast to the contemporary rebuilding of the nave at Winchester, where much of the existing fabric was retained and remodeled, the piers were entirely removed, and replaced with less bulky Gothic ones, and the old aisle walls were completely taken down except for a low \"plinth\" left on the south side. More Norman fabric was retained in the transepts, especially in the east walls, and the old apsidal chapels were not replaced until the mid-15th century. The arches of the new nave arcade were exceptionally high in proportion to the clerestory. The new transepts, aisles, and nave were roofed with lierne vaults, enriched with bosses. Most of the work was done during the priorate of Thomas Chillenden (1391\u20131411): Chillenden also built a new quire screen at the east end of the nave, into which Eastry's existing screen was incorporated. The Norman stone floor of the nave, however, survived until its replacement in 1786.\nFrom 1396 the cloisters were repaired and remodelled by Yevele's pupil Stephen Lote who added the lierne vaulting. It was during this period that the wagon-vaulting of the chapter house was created.\nA shortage of money and the priority given to the rebuilding of the cloisters and chapterhouse meant that the rebuilding of the west towers was neglected. The south-west tower was not replaced until 1458, and the Norman north-west tower survived until 1834 when it was replaced by a replica of its Perpendicular companion.\nIn about 1430 the south transept apse was removed to make way for a chapel, founded by Lady Margaret Holland and dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. The north transept apse was replaced by a Lady Chapel, built-in 1448\u20131455.\nThe crossing tower was begun in 1433, although preparations had already been made during Chillenden's priorate when the piers had been reinforced. Further strengthening was found necessary around the beginning of the 16th century when buttressing arches were added under the southern and western tower arches. The tower is often known as the \"Angel Steeple\", after a gilded angel that once stood on one of its pinnacles.\nThe Modern period.\nThe Reformation, Dissolution and Puritanism.\nThe cathedral ceased to be an abbey during the Dissolution of the Monasteries when all religious houses were suppressed. Canterbury Cathedral, and the great monastery of Christ Church were surrendered to the Crown on 30 March 1539, after the occupants had made \"an inventory of the good, chattels, plate, precious ornaments, lead, and money belonging to the monks\" and \"all that could be moved\" was \"handed over to the master of the jewel-house\" of the Tower of London, after which \"the Prior and monks were then ejected. \nThe Cathedral reverted to its previous status of 'a college of secular canons'. According to the cathedral's own website, it had been a Benedictine monastery since the 900s. The New Foundation came into being on 8 April 1541. The shrine to St Thomas Becket was destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII and the relics lost.\nIn around 1576, the crypt of the cathedral was granted to the Huguenot congregation of Canterbury to be used as their Church of the Crypt.\nIn 1642\u20131643, during the English Civil War, Puritan iconoclasts led by Edwin Sandys (Parliamentarian) caused significant damage during their \"cleansing\" of the cathedral. Included in that campaign was the destruction of the statue of Christ in the Christ Church Gate and the demolition of the wooden gates by a group led by Richard Culmer. The statue would not be replaced until 1990 but the gates were restored in 1660 and a great deal of other repair work started at that time; that would continue until 1704.\nFurnishings.\nIn 1688, the joiner Roger Davis, citizen of London, removed the 13th-century misericords and replaced them with two rows of his own work on each side of the quire. Some of Davis's misericords have a distinctly medieval flavour and he may have copied some of the original designs. When Sir George Gilbert Scott carried out renovations in the 19th century, he replaced the front row of Davis' misericords, with new ones of his own design, which seem to include many copies of those at Gloucester Cathedral, Worcester Cathedral and New College, Oxford.\nStatues on the West Front.\nMost of the statues that currently adorn the west front of the cathedral were installed in the 1860s when the South Porch was being renovated. At that time, the niches were vacant and the Dean of the cathedral thought that the appearance of the cathedral would be improved if they were filled. The Victorian sculptor Theodore Pfyffers was commissioned to create the statues and most of them were installed by the end of the 1860s. There are currently 53 statues representing various figures who have been influential in the life of the cathedral and the English church such as clergy, members of the royal family, saints, and theologians. Archbishops of Canterbury from Augustine of Canterbury and Lanfranc, to Thomas Cranmer and William Laud are represented. Kings and Queens from \u00c6thelberht and Bertha of Kent, to Victoria and Elizabeth II are included.\n18th century to the present.\nThe original towers of Christ Church Gate were removed in 1803 and were replaced in 1937. The statue of Christ was replaced in 1990 with a bronze sculpture of Christ by Klaus Ringwald.\nThe original Norman northwest tower, which had a lead spire until 1705, was demolished in 1834 owing to structural concerns. It was replaced with a Perpendicular-style twin of the southwest tower (designed by Thomas Mapilton), now known as the Arundel Tower, providing a more symmetrical appearance for the cathedral. This was the last major structural alteration to the cathedral to be made.\nIn 1866, there were six residentiary canonries, of which one was annexed to the Archdeaconry of Canterbury and another to that of Maidstone. In September 1872, a large portion of the Trinity Chapel roof was completely destroyed by fire. There was no significant damage to the stonework or interior and the damage was quickly repaired.\nDuring the bombing raids of the Second World War its library was destroyed, but the cathedral did not sustain extensive bomb damage; the local Fire Wardens doused any flames on the wooden roof.\nIn 1986, a new Martyrdom Altar was installed in the northwest transept, on the spot where Thomas Becket was slain, the first new altar in the cathedral for 448 years. Mounted on the wall above it, there is a metal sculpture by Truro sculptor Giles Blomfield depicting a cross flanked by two bloodstained swords which, together with the shadows they cast, represent the four knights who killed Becket. A stone plaque also commemorates Pope John Paul II's visit to the United Kingdom in 1982. Antony Gormley's sculpture \"Transport\" was unveiled in the crypt in 2011. It is made from iron nails from the roof of the south-east transept.\nIn 2015, Sarah Mullally and Rachel Treweek became the first women to be ordained as bishops in the cathedral, as Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Gloucester respectively. In 2022, it was announced that David Monteith, who is gay and in a civil partnership, would serve as dean of the cathedral. His appointment was criticised by the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) and the Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON); the Church of England defended the decision stating that Monteith lives chastely with his partner. In 2024, the cathedral began offering blessings for same-sex couples \"already in civil partnerships or civil marriages\" or in \"covenanted friendship\" during ordinary or regular church services in accordance with \"Prayers of Love and Faith\".\nThe cathedral is Regimental Church of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment and a graduation venue for the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University.\nConservation.\nMuch of the stonework at Canterbury Cathedral is damaged and crumbling, the roofs are leaking and much of the stained glass is badly corroded. The last quinquennial structural review revealed that a combination of centuries of weathering, pollution and constant use had taken its toll on the ancient building and some serious problems were in need of urgent action.\nThe single biggest challenge is the roof. The cathedral is covered by a huge expanse of lead and whilst the majority of the wooden framework remains sound, much of the lead itself needs replacing. In addition, a large amount of concrete encasing the bottom of the roof beams needs to be removed and replaced with traditional wooden footers.\nConservation of the external masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of Caen stone. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify exactly which stones need to be replaced or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the Trinity Chapel, conservation work in several other chapels, and major improvements to the Treasury building, which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms.\nThe earliest coloured glass windows in the cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four Ervin Boss\u00e1nyi windows in the south-east transept (1957). Many have already been conserved and protected by the team of stained glass conservators led by Leonie Seliger. However, much conservation work remains to be done, notably on the Oculus window in the south-east transept\u00a0\u2013 a late 12th-century round window.\nDuring the autumn of 2008, a major restoration of the lead roof over the transept was completed at a cost of approximately \u00a3500,000. In 2018, the lead roof of the nave was replaced. The extensive restoration of the cathedral that was underway in mid-2018 was part of a 2016\u20132021 schedule that also includes improved landscaping and accessibility, new visitor facilities and a general external restoration. The so-called Canterbury Journey project was expected to cost nearly \u00a325 million; the funding included a \u00a313.8 million Heritage Lottery grant, \u00a310.9 million from the Canterbury Cathedral Trust and \u00a3250,000 from the Friends of the Cathedral.\nHistoric designations.\nThe cathedral and its precincts comprise a large number of listed buildings. The majority are listed at Grade I, the highest grade, with a much smaller number listed at Grade II*.\nGrade I.\nThe cathedral itself is listed at Grade I. Other Grade I listed buildings include: the Chapter House, the main gate into the cathedral precincts,\nthe cloister, a passageway known as the Dark Entry, the Lavatory Tower, the Library, Meister Omers, at No.16 The Precincts, originally a guest house for visitors, the Norman Staircase, the\nPrior Sellinge Gate, the\nPrior's Chapel, the remains of the Cellarer's Hall in the Archbishop's Palace Garden, the Archbishop's Palace itself, the Archdeacon of Canterbury's House, the Cathedral Appeal Fund Office &amp; the Deanery, the Wolfson Library, and Nos. 22\u201326 and 27 and 28 The Precincts.\nGrade II*.\nBuildings listed at Grade II* include; No.17 Cathedral Precincts, the Pilgrims Entry or Pentise attached to Number 29, Cathedral Precincts and the County of Kent War Memorial Cross.\nScheduled monuments.\nChristchurch Priory and the Archbishop's Palace, and the Norman Staircase, the Cellarer's Hall, and the Pilgrim's Entry are also designated scheduled monuments, the latter three under a composite listing, Monuments in the precinct of Canterbury Cathedral. \nFoundation.\nThe Foundation is the authorised staffing establishment of the cathedral, few of whom are clergy. The head of the cathedral is the Dean, currently David Monteith, who is assisted by a chapter of 30 canons, four of whom are residentiary, the others being honorary appointments of senior clergy in the diocese. There are also a number of lay canons who all together form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop when there is a vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom, they may only elect the person who has been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King's Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber. The cathedral has a workforce of over 300 (many of whom work part-time), and approximately 800 volunteers.\nDean and Chapter.\nAs of 1 August 2022:\nThe Cathedral uses \"Vice Dean\" not of one particular appointee, but to refer to the Canon in Residence for each month.\nMinor canons:\nFinance.\nCanterbury Cathedral receives no government or state funding and only occasional grants from English Heritage. It is not funded by the Church of England. The Church Commissioners pay the salary of the dean and two of the residentiary canons only. The cathedral is therefore largely self-funded.\nIt costs around \u00a320,000 per day to maintain the cathedral. (2023) In order to meet these costs the cathedral has to rely on income from entry fees paid by visitors and a number of commercial operations such as property rental, the Cathedral Shop, as well as the Cathedral Lodge Hotel and Conference Centre.\nThe Friends of Canterbury Cathedral is a charity which exists to \"cherish the history and beauty of the Cathedral; to preserve its fabric, worship, ornaments and furnishings and to provide a channel for individuals to show their support\". The Friends have published \"Canterbury Cathedral chronicle\" since 1928. The Friends have also published a number of books relating to the cathedral; these include \"The Romance of Canterbury Cathedral\" issued anonymously in 1932 by Raphael Tuck; the author was Margaret Agnes Babington (died 1958) whose name appeared in some of the later editions. Margaret Babington was honorary steward and treasurer of the Friends and undertook fund raising lecture tours for the cathedral. She was the daughter of the vicar of Tenterden.\nAppeal.\nThe \"Save Canterbury Cathedral\" appeal was launched in October 2006 to protect and enhance the cathedral's future as a centre of worship, heritage and culture. The aim was to raise \u00a350\u00a0million; by the end of 2010 the appeal had raised \u00a311.5\u00a0million, and as at May 2014 over \u00a320\u00a0million had been raised.\nThe core part of the fundraising programme is focused on the cathedral's fabric. The major conservation-restoration projects already identified will cost \u00a330\u00a0million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal\u00a0\u2013 the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s\u00a0\u2013 was launched to fund these projects. Fundraising for the appeal will take place over a number of years both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral's role as the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and as a World Heritage Site. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral's Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton.\nMajor repair and conservation projects to be funded by the appeal include roofs of the nave, aisles, and North West and South East Transepts; stone carvings, pinnacles and stone facings of the central Bell Harry Tower; work on the North side of the Corona Chapel; conservation of the Christ Church Gate entry to the Precincts; conservation of stained glass and surrounding stonework throughout the cathedral; and preservation of the collection of historic books and manuscripts.\nIn addition, there are plans to refurbish the cathedral pipe organ and renovations to the Choir House have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to the fabric of the library buildings and to the cathedral's audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and stained glass studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a centre of excellence for vital craft skills and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public.\nThe fundraising group is the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, an independent, registered charity (1112590) seeking funds to provide conservation, craftsmanship, music and education. Since mid-2017, the Chief Executive has been Sarah Frankland. The Trust was able to obtain the \u00a324.7m needed for The Canterbury Journey multi-year restoration programme which was planned for completion in 2021. In 2016\u201317 the Trust received \u00a33.66m in donations and an additional \u00a31.61m had been pledged for future projects. The next plan was to raise funds to restore and improve the Quire organ by 2020. In 2017, the cathedral was planning to have the new Welcome Centre open in 2019, with exhibition spaces and viewing gallery.\nPolice service.\nThe cathedral has its own police service, known as the Canterbury Cathedral Close Constables. They are attested Constables, with powers of arrest, who police and protect the Cathedral and Close. They also work with Kent Police.\nMusic.\nPolyphonic music written for the monks of Christ Church Priory, now Canterbury Cathedral, survives from the 13th century. The cathedral may have had an organ as early as the 12th century, though the names of organists are only recorded from the early 15th century.\nOne of the earliest named composers associated with Canterbury Cathedral was Leonel Power, who was appointed master of the new Lady Chapel choir formed in 1438.\nThe Reformation brought a period of decline in the cathedral's music which was revived under Dean Thomas Neville in the early 17th century. Neville introduced instrumentalists into the cathedral's music who played cornett and sackbut, probably members of the city's band of waits. The cathedral acquired sets of recorders, lutes and viols for the use of the choir boys and lay-clerks.\nOrgan.\nThe organ at Canterbury is of four manuals and is in both south and the north quire aisles, as well as a nave division. It was built in 1886 by Henry Willis and subsequently rebuilt by the same firm in the mid-20th century. It was rebuilt by N.\u00a0P. Mander in 1978 and reduced to three manuals at about that time. David Flood, Organist and Master of the Choristers for over 40 years, oversaw the redesign, specification and total expansion and rebuilding project of the Cathedral Organ in 2018\u20132020 The organ has now been fully restored and greatly enlarged, including reinstating the fourth manual, by Harrison and Harrison with work finishing in February 2020.\nOrganists.\nOrganists and assistant organists at Canterbury Cathedral have included composers William Shelbye, Clement Charlton Palmer, Gerald Hocken Knight and Philip Moore and musical directors Allan Wicks and Stephen Darlington. Following 42 years as both Assistant Organist and Organist and Master of the Choristers, David Flood retired on 29 December 2020. Following 10 years as assistant organist and latterly director of the Girls' Choir and a period as acting director of music, David Newsholme was appointed Director of Music in July 2021. The Assistant Organist is Jamie Rogers and he was appointed in December 2021.\nChoirs.\nThere has been a choral tradition at Canterbury Cathedral for 1400 years. The cathedral choir consists of up to 25 boy choristers and 12 lay clerks and choral scholars. The boys are aged eight to thirteen. They receive scholarships and attend St Edmund's School, Canterbury. There are seven choral services a week with Choral Evensong at 5:30 pm Monday through Friday, with the boys alone on Thursday and men on Wednesday. On Saturday and Sunday, there is evensong at 3:15 pm or 5:30pm and Eucharist on Sunday at 11 am. There are numerous extra services, especially at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost.\nThe Girls' Choir of Canterbury Cathedral was founded in 2014 and their first performance at Evensong, in January, was attended by more than 600 people and widely covered by the international press. They gave their first concert in December of that year. They now share their duties equally with the boys of the choir and sometimes work together. The girls are aged 12 to 18. They attend local schools in Canterbury and some further afield.\nIn February 2023 it was announced that the entire framework for the child choristers at Canterbury Cathedral would be changing and that they would no longer board or attend St Edmund's School, causing local and international comment. The Equality and Inclusion Plan set up by the new Dean was at the heart of this.\nBells.\nThe cathedral has a total of 21 bells in three of its five towers:\nThe South West Tower (Oxford Tower) contains the cathedral's main ring of bells, hung for change ringing in the English style. There are fourteen bells\u00a0\u2013 a ring of twelve with two semitones, which allow for ringing on ten, eight or six bells while still remaining in tune. All of the bells were cast in 1981 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry from seven bells of the old peal of twelve with new metal added and rehung in a new frame. The length (draught) of the ropes was increased by lowering the floor of the ringing chamber to the level of the south aisle vault at the same time, also allowing for the new bells to be set lower in the belfry than the old, with the intention of reducing stress on the Medieval structure. The heaviest bell (tenor) of this ring weighs . The ringers practise on Thursday at 7:15\u00a0pm.\nThe North West Tower (Arundel Tower) contains the cathedral's clock chime. The five-quarter chimes were taken from the old peal of twelve in the Oxford Tower (where the clock was originally), and hung from beams in the Arundel Tower. The chimes are struck on the eighth Gregorian tone, which is also used at Merton College, Oxford. The hour is struck on Great Dunstan, the largest bell in Kent at , which is also swung on Sunday mornings for Matins.\nIn 1316 Prior Henry of Eastry gave a large bell dedicated to Saint Thomas, which weighed . Later, in 1343, Prior Hathbrand gave bells dedicated to Jesus and St Dunstan. At this time the bells in campanile were rehung and their names recorded as \"Jesus\", \"Dunstan\", \"Mary\", \"Crundale\", \"Elphy\" (\u00c6lfheah) and \"Thomas\". In the 1382 Dover Straits earthquake the campanile fell, destroying the first three named bells. Following its reconstruction, the other three bells were rehung, together with two others, of whose casting no record remains.\nThe oldest bell in the cathedral is Bell Harry (approximately ), which hangs in a cage on the top of the central tower to which the bell lends its name. This bell was cast by Joseph Hatch in 1635, and is struck at 8\u00a0am and 9\u00a0pm every day to announce the opening and closing of the cathedral, and also occasionally for services as a Sanctus bell.\nThe cathedral also has custody of the bell of HMS \"Canterbury\", a World War I-era light cruiser, hung near the Buffs Chapel in the southwest transept.\nLibrary.\nThe library at Canterbury Cathedral has been in operation since the Middle Ages, and thus possesses a large number and variety items from the time period. Certain items within the library's collections that survived the turmoils surrounding the dissolution of the monasteries have been a part of the collection for nearly a millennium. \nThe cathedral library has a collection of about 30,000 books and pamphlets printed before the 20th century and about 20,000 later books and serials. Many of the earlier books were acquired as part of donated collections. It is rich in church history, older theology, British history (including local history), travel, science and medicine, and the anti-slavery movement. The library's holdings are included in the online catalogue of the library of the University of Kent.\nIn July 2018, the cathedral purchased at auction a medieval Trussel Bible for \u00a3100,000. This Bible, subsequently renamed the \"Lyghfield Bible\", after the monk William Lighfyld, had previously been at Canterbury, and had been removed following the dissolution of the monasteries.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The court eventually convicted 61 individuals and acquitted 14.\nIn 1995, it became located in Arusha, Tanzania, under Resolution 977. From 2006, Arusha also became the location of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. In 1998 the operation of the tribunal was expanded in Resolution 1165. Through several resolutions, the Security Council called on the tribunal to complete its investigations by end of 2004, complete all trial activities by end of 2008, and complete all work in 2012. The tribunal had jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of Common Article Three and Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions (which deals with internal conflicts).\nThe first trial, of Jean-Paul Akayesu, began in 1997. Jean Kambanda, interim Prime Minister, pleaded guilty. According to the ICTR's Completion Strategy, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1503, all first-instance cases were to have completed trial by the end of 2008 (this date was later extended to the end of 2009) and all work was to be completed by 2010. As of 2009, the tribunal had finished 50 trials and convicted 29 accused persons, and another 11 trials were in progress and 14 individuals were awaiting trial in detention; but the prosecutor intended to transfer 5 to national jurisdiction for trial. 13 others were still at large, some suspected to be dead. The United Nations Security Council called upon the tribunal to finish its work by 31 December 2014 to prepare for its closure and transfer of its responsibilities to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT or Mechanism) which had begun functioning for the ICTR branch on 1 July 2012. The Tribunal was officially closed on 31 December 2015.\nThe tribunal's failure to prosecute war crimes committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front or try RPF leader Paul Kagame was widely criticized, to the point of being characterized as \"victor's justice\".\nThe Rwandan genocide.\nThe Rwandan genocide refers to the mass slaughter of more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu by government-directed gangs of Hutu extremist soldiers and police in Rwanda. The duration of the 1994 genocide is usually described as 100 days, beginning on April 6 and ending in mid-July.\nThe tension between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi had developed over time but was particularly emphasized late in the nineteenth century and early in the twentieth century as a result of German and Belgian colonialism over Rwanda. The ethnic categorization of the two was an imposed and an arbitrary construct based more on physical characteristics than ethnic background. However, the social differences between the Hutu and the Tutsi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists. The distinction under colonial powers allowed Tutsis to establish ruling power until a Hutu revolution in 1959 abolished the Tutsi monarchy by 1961.\nThe hostility between the two groups continued, as \"additional rounds of ethnic tension and violence flared periodically and led to mass killings of Tutsi in Rwanda, such as in 1963, 1967, and 1973\". The establishment of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its invasion from Uganda furthered ethnic hatred. A ceasefire in these hostilities led to negotiations between the government and the RPF in 1992.\nOn April 6, 1994, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board. The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates.\nMost of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi. Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as \"cockroaches\" in need of extermination. Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs. Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims. Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally\u2014neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage. At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee camps of neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and former Zaire.\nEstablishment of the ICTR.\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda is regarded as a major failure. The international response to the Rwandan genocide was poor. For weeks, the major power nations denied that a genocide was taking place in Rwanda. The United States refused to call the incident \"genocide\" because using the term would make an obligation for the United States to send troops, which it was reluctant to do after several of its soldiers were killed during a humanitarian mission in Somalia the previous year. Finally in July 1994, after the genocide was over, the UN Security Council called for an investigation of the events, and acted to establish an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those individuals most responsible for the genocide. Adopting Resolution 955, the Security Council created the ICTR on 8 November 1994 and the ICTR would also deal with other crimes against international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda and neighboring states between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994.\nICTR structure.\nChambers.\nThe tribunal consisted of 16 judges in four \"chambers\" \u2013 three to hear trials, and one to hear appeals. In addition, there were 9 \"ad litem\" judges, making 25 in all. All 9 \"ad litem\" judges were assigned to Chambers II and III. There was an additional pool of 9 further \"ad literim\" judges who would be called on in the case of a judge being absent.\nThe presidents of the ICTR were La\u00efty Kama of Senegal (1995\u20131999), Navi Pillay of South Africa (1999\u20132003), Erik M\u00f8se of Norway (2003\u20132007), Dennis Byron of Saint Kitts and Nevis (2007\u20132011), Khalida Rachid Khan of Pakistan (2011\u20132012) and Vagn Joensen of Denmark (2012\u20132015). They were elected by the judges of the tribunal in plenary session.\nTrial Chamber I.\nThe column denoted by # indicates the order of precedence.\nOffice of the Prosecutor.\nThe Office of the Prosecutor was divided into various units at the height of its activity, including the Investigations Division and the Prosecution Division:\nThe Registry.\nThe Registry was responsible for the overall administration and management of the ICTR. It also performed other legal functions assigned to it by the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and was the Tribunal's channel of communication.\nThe Registry was headed by the Registrar, who was the Representative of the UN Secretary-General. Bongani Christopher Majola of South Africa was Registrar. after January 2013.\nThe Case of Jean-Paul Akayesu.\nAfter an intense and precisely targeted campaign of a number of international non-governmental organizations, which aimed at raising awareness of gendered violence at the ICTR, the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu established the legal precedent that genocidal rape falls within the act of genocide. \"...the [Trial] Chamber finds that in most cases, the rapes of Tutsi women in Taba, were accompanied with the intent to kill those women. ... In this respect, it appears clearly to the chamber that the acts of rape and sexual violence, as other acts of serious bodily and mental harm committed against the Tutsi, reflected the determination to make Tutsi women suffer and to mutilate them even before killing them, the intent being to destroy the Tutsi group while inflicting acute suffering on its members in the process.\" Presiding judge Navanethem Pillay said in a statement after the verdict: \"From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.\"\nMedia Case.\nThe trial against \"hate media\" began on 23 October 2000. It was charged with the prosecution of the media which encouraged the genocide of 1994.\nOn 19 August 2003, at the tribunal in Arusha, life sentences were requested for Ferdinand Nahimana, and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, persons in charge for the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines, as well as Hassan Ngeze, director and editor of the \"Kangura\" newspaper. They were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity, before and during the period of the genocides of 1994. On 3 December 2003, the court found all three defendants guilty and sentenced Nahimana and Ngeze to life imprisonment and Barayagwiza to imprisonment for 35 years. On 28 November 2007, the Appeals Chamber partially allowed appeals against conviction from all three men, reducing their sentences to 30 years' imprisonment for Nahimana, 32 years' imprisonment for Barayagwiza and 35 years' imprisonment for Ngeze.\nRelated legal activities.\nFrench investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re was also pursuing a case against the current President, Paul Kagame, and other members of his administration, for the assassination of his predecessor. This case was under the regular jurisdiction of the French courts because French citizens were also killed in the plane crash. The majority of genocide cases were handled by the so-called gacaca courts, a modernized customary dispute resolution mechanism.\nIndictees.\nThe ICTR indicted a total of 96 individuals. One individual remains at large as a fugitive and if captured will be tried before the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (the IRMCT). The proceedings against one individual are suspended before the IRMCT. The ICTR (or the IRMCT as its successor) convicted 61 individuals: 24 of whom are currently serving sentences, 22 of whom have completed their sentences, and 15 of whom died while serving their sentences. The Tribunal acquitted 14 individuals and transferred the cases against 10 individuals to national jurisdictions. Proceedings against nine individuals ended before a final judgment was rendered: two of whom had their charges dismissed by the Tribunal, two of whom had their charges withdrawn by the Prosecutor, and five of whom died.\nControversies.\nThe critique concerning the ICTR can be divided into claims pertaining to its creation, the fairness of its prosecution (who was accused and whom the prosecution failed to accuse although it should have issued indictments), trial fairness (who was sentenced, who was accused and whom the chambers failed to sentence or acquit although they should have done so) and the fairness of the procedures (did the parties have equal rights and equal opportunities to bring their evidence and arguments) and the court\u2019s efficiency (how much time and resources did the court use to achieve its aims \u2013 and did it achieve these aims).\nThe legal doubts about the UN Security Council having the power to create a court which have been levelled against the ICTY\u2019s creation are also valid regarding the ICTR. And just like the Yugoslav Tribunal, the ICTR had its jurisdictional blind spots: because its timely jurisdiction was limited to the year 1994, it could not prosecute later events like the violent dissolution of the Kibeho refugee camp or the crimes committed against the civilian population in Zaire (later the Democratic Republic of the Congo) by Hutu militias, the RPA and Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels. Formally, the territorial jurisdiction extended to Rwanda\u2019s neighbors, however the ICTR never investigated the role of Uganda or Zaire in the conflict. Neither did it investigate failures, shortcomings or possible crimes by politicians from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US who were engaged in negotiations with the Rwandan government before the genocide, in den Arusha peace process and in attempts to react to the ongoing genocide after April 1994.\nOpposite to the ICTY, the ICTR did not have to work in a strongly polarized ethnic environment. After the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had taken over the power in Rwanda and the Hutu militias (and the majority of the Hutu population) had fled to neighboring countries, the perspective of the victims (the Tutsi inside the country or \u201cTutsi de l\u2019interieur\u201d) and the liberators (the Rwandan Patriotic Front which included Tutsi but also many of the Hutu opponents to president Habyarimana and members of democratic Hutu parties) prevailed and strongly influence the way, ICTR staff interpreted the conflict. Attempts by indictees and lawyers who sided with their point of view to influence the ICTR were mostly unsuccessful, although much more belligerent and radical than politically motivated defense strategies at the ICTY. The ICTR was heavily dependent on access to witnesses from Rwanda, to access to documents and to the cooperation with the Rwandan government, because the UN Security Council had established the ICTR\u2019s main seat in Arusha rather than in Rwanda. There also was competition between the Rwandan government and the ICTR Office of the Prosecution over access to suspects in third countries which often led to frictions and tensions. According to opinion polls, the Rwandan population was not very impressed by the ICTR\u2019s efforts, first, because suspects had rather comfortable conditions in Arusha and did not face capital punishment, second because the trials there lasted much longer than the relatively swift and harsh trials Rwanda organized for many of lower ranking perpetrators. Some of the more prominent ones were even publicly executed in Kigali.\nA widely shared and very basic bias allegation against the ICTR consists in its failure to investigate and prosecute crimes committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Army, the armed wing of the RPA. In the light of human rights organizations\u2019 reports, the RPA had committed war crimes against the civilian population during its campaign in 1993 and after entering the country at the beginning of the genocide. There had been looting of private property and exactions against villagers but also revenge killings, among them the murder of several high-ranking catholic clerics in Kabgayi in 1994. The latter was subject of a domestic trial against RPA soldiers and officers, while the exactions from 1993 and early 1994 were not investigated. There is also a lasting controversy if the ICTR prosecution should have investigated and tried the assassination of president Habyarimana. The assault on his aircraft was later investigated by the French judiciary and there are several (mutually contradictory) reports about the assassination and its authors (which also included the French crew members as victims giving the French judiciary a legal basis for investigations), blaming either Hutu nationalist radicals who wanted to get rid of the president or the RPF.\nFor a long time (until the 2010s) neither prosecution nor chambers regarded it as the ICTR\u2019s job to prosecute contempt of court and false testimonies committed by witnesses. Their hesitance created incentives for the creation and expansion of perjurer networks and the creation of false evidence by either people, who wanted to see an accused sentenced (if he or she came from an enemy group) or acquitted (if he or she stemmed from their own ethnic background). Chambers regarded the prosecution of false testimony in court as being outside their core mandate and made contradictory decisions about who should prevent false testimony (the prosecution or the chambers) and how. Instead of initiating sanctions against perjurers, judges were eager to \u201cexplain false testimony away\u201d as examples of cultural exceptions or trauma.\nEfficiency:\nICTR publications usually measure efficiency in terms of the part of indicted persons who were put on trial. From that perspective, the ICTR was quite efficient, because it managed to get hold on all the persons for which it had issued arrest warrants. But alike the ICTY, the ICTR did not indict all people which it was tasked and empower to prosecute, because some of the Interahamwe leaders obtained the status of protected witnesses and a new identity (Cruvellier). F\u00e9licien Kabuga, a wealthy businessman from the Habyarimana era, who is widely believed to have financed the Interahamwe and provided them with machetes from China, managed to stay in hiding until his arrest in Paris in 2020. His trial started, but later was first interrupted and then terminated due to his dementia and inability to stand trial.\nICTR trials used to be very long and cumbersome. In some cases (Andr\u00e9 Rwamakuba), the trial chamber struck down the indictment after the prosecution had rested its case, because there was literally no case to answer to for the defense. But at that time, the accused had already spent years in custody for which they were (due to the UN\u2019s immunity) not eligible for any compensation. In another, the Office of the Prosecutor first summoned the former head of the Gendarmerie, Augustin Ndindiliyimana (who had feld to Belgium) as a witness and, when he refused to testify for the prosecution, indicted him. Ndindiliyimana was first found guilty and sentenced to exactly the same prison term that he had spent in pre-trial arrest and then exonerated and set free by the appeals chamber. For years he leaved with other acquitted suspects in a safe house in Tanzania, because the ICTR was unable to find a country that would issue him a long-term visa.\nBachmann and Fatic have argued that due to its dependence on Rwanda, the ICTR became a part of the Rwandan justice system, with the Rwandan government steering tribunal decisions almost at will, by either holding back evidence or channeling materials from survivor organizations into judicial procedures. According to Del Ponte, the Rwandan military intelligence eavesdropped on the prosecution to retrieve information about secret investigations concerning RPA-crimes. After pressure from Rwanda, the UK and the US, Del Ponte lost her position at the ICTR but was allowed to remain ICTY chief prosecutor. The Office of the Prosecutor never returned to the investigation concerning the downing of Habyarimana\u2019s Falcon and the secret investigations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is thought to have been a clerk or secretary to Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, the main advisor to Valdemar I of Denmark. He is the author of the , the first full history of Denmark, from which the legend of Amleth would come to inspire the story of \"Hamlet\" by Shakespeare.\nLife.\nThe \"Jutland Chronicle\" gives evidence that Saxo was born in Zealand. It is unlikely he was born before 1150 and it is supposed that his death could have occurred around 1220. His name Saxo was a common name in medieval Denmark. The name \"Grammaticus\" (\"the learned\") was first given to him in the \"Jutland Chronicle\" and the \"Sj\u00e6lland Chronicle\" makes reference to Saxo \"cognomine Longus\" (\"with the byname 'the tall'\").\nHe lived in a period of warfare and Danish expansion, led by Archbishop Absalon and the Valdemars. The Danes were also being threatened by the Wends who were making raids across the border and by sea. Valdemar I had also just won a civil war and later Valdemar II led an expedition across the Elbe to invade Holstein.\nSven Aggesen, a Danish nobleman and author of a slightly earlier history of Denmark than Saxo's, describes his contemporary, Saxo, as his \"contubernalis\", meaning \"tent-comrade\". This gives evidence that Saxo and Sven might have soldiered in the \"Hird\" or royal guard, since Sven used the word \"contubernium\" in reference to them. There is also a Saxo to be found on a list of clergy at Lund, where there was a Sven recorded as Archdeacon. Likewise there is Dean Saxo who died in 1190; however, the date does not match what is known about Saxo.\nBoth arguments, for a secular or religious Saxo, would confirm that he was well educated; as clergy, he would have received training in Latin and sons of great men were often sent to Paris. Saxo comes from a warrior family and writes that he is himself committed to being a soldier. He tells us that he follows \"the ancient right of hereditary service\", and that his father and grandfather \"were recognized frequenters of your renowned sire's (Valdemar I) war camp\".\nSaxo's education and ability support the idea that he was educated outside Denmark. Some suggest the title \"Grammaticus\" refers not to his education but rather his elaborate Latin style. We know from his writing that he was in the retinue and received the patronage of Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, who was the foremost adviser to King Valdemar I. In his will Absalon forgives his clerk Saxo a small debt of two and a half marks of silver and tells him to return two borrowed books to the monastery of Sor\u00f8. The legacy of Saxo Grammaticus is the sixteen-book heroic history of the Danes called .\nGesta Danorum.\nIn the preface to the work, Saxo writes that his patron Absalon (c.\u20091128 \u2013 21 March 1201), Archbishop of Lund, had encouraged him to write a heroic history of the Danes. The history is thought to have been started about 1185, after Sven Aggesen wrote his history. The goal of was, as Saxo writes, \"to glorify our fatherland\", which he accomplishes on the model of Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Saxo also may have owed much to Plato and Cicero, as well as to more contemporary writers like Geoffrey of Monmouth.\nSaxo's history of the Danes was compiled from sources that are of questionable historical value but were to him the only ones extant. He drew on oral tales of the Icelanders, ancient volumes, letters carved on rocks and stone, and the statements of his patron Absalon concerning the history of which the Archbishop had been a part. Saxo's work was not strictly a history or a simple record of old tales, but rather, as Friis-Jensen puts it, \"a product of Saxo's own mind and times\". Westergaard writes that Saxo combines the history and mythology of the heroic age of Denmark, and reworks it into his own story that exemplifies the past of the Danes.\nThe history is composed of sixteen books, and extends from the time of the founders of the Danish people, Dan I of Denmark and Angul, into about the year 1187. The first four books are concerned with the history of the Danes before Christ, the next four books with their history after Christ, and books 9\u201312 with Christian Denmark, and books 13\u201316 promote Lund and exploits before and during Saxo's own lifetime. It is assumed that the last eight books were written first, as Saxo drew heavily on the work of Absalon (who died in 1201, before the work was completed) for evidence of the age of Saint Canute and Valdemar I.\nThe first eight volumes share a likeness with the works of Saxo's contemporary Snorri Sturluson. They deal with mythical elements such as giants and the Scandinavian pantheon of gods. Saxo tells of Dan the first king of Denmark, who had a brother named Angul who gave his name to the Angles. He also tells the stories of various other Danish heroes, many of whom interact with the Scandinavian gods. Saxo's \"heathen\" gods, however, are not always good characters. They are sometimes treacherous, such as in the story of Harald, legendary king of the Danes, who was taught the ways of warfare by Odin and then was betrayed and killed by the god, who then brought him to Valhalla.\nSaxo's world is seen to have had very warlike values. He glorifies the heroes that made their names in battle far more than those who made peace. His view of the period of peace under King Frode is very low and is only satisfied when King Knut brings back the ancestral customs. Saxo's chronology of kings extends up to Saint Canute and his son Valdemar I. Saxo finished the history with the Preface, which he wrote last, in c.\u20091216 under the patronage of Anders Sunesen, who replaced Absalon as Archbishop of Lund. Saxo included in the preface warm appreciation of both Archbishops and of the reigning King Valdemar II.\nHistorical contribution.\nOf particular interest for Shakespeare scholars is the story of Amleth, the first instance of the playwright's Hamlet. Saxo based the story on an oral tale of a son taking revenge for his murdered father. Christiern Pedersen, a Canon of Lund, collaborated with Jodocus Badius Ascensius, a fellow enthusiast, to print the work of Saxo Grammaticus early in the sixteenth century. This was the first major step toward securing the historical significance of . Starting from that point, the knowledge of it began to spread within the academic community. Oliver Elton, who was the first to translate the first nine books of into English, wrote that Saxo was the first writer produced by Denmark.\nSaxo's skill as a Latinist was praised by Erasmus, who wondered how \"a Dane of that age got so great power of eloquence\". Later R. W. Chambers would call Saxo's writings \"difficult and bombastic, but always amusing Latin\". There have been many attempts to understand the type of Latin language used by Saxo, and to juxtapose it in history, to provide more information on where he was educated. Some have considered his Latin to have more in common with legal than with ecclesiastical training, and his poetry is thought to have traces of parallelism.\nAlthough Saxo is commonly viewed by modern Danes as their \"first national historian\", two other coherent accounts of Danish history by Danish authors predate . They are (English: \"Roskilde Chronicle\"), a small work written in Latin, completed in c.\u20091143, spanning from the introduction of Christianity in Denmark to the author's own time. The next to be published was \"Brevis historia regum Dacie\", written by Sven Aggesen (b. c.\u20091140\u20131150 \u2013 death unknown), thought to have been finished in 1186 or 1187 (the last event described happened in 1185), covering the years 300\u20131185.\nSaxo's works were received enthusiastically by Renaissance era scholars, who were curious about the pre-Christian history and legends. Saxo's portrayals of history have been seen to differ greatly from those of his contemporaries, especially Norwegian and Icelandic, including portrayals of various historical characters as either heroes or villains. There are also differences between Saxo's work and that of the fellow Danish historian Sven Aggesen from the same era.\nThese differences have to do with Saxo's elaboration and euhemerism in his descriptions of mainly Scandinavian history and mythology, Saxo's account on the tale of Thyri, for instance, is considered to be far more fantastic than the same tale presented by Sven. Saxo's work has been criticized for this reason. Kurt Johannesson's studies expanded greatly on the comprehension of , deviating from the approach that focuses mostly on mythology, and allowing the development of a wider understanding of Saxo's works.\nRecently some scholars, such as Sigurd Kv\u00e6rndrup, inspired by Johannesson's study of the four cardinal virtues in , have studied other elaborations and schemes in the writings of Saxo. Some of them have concluded that Saxo, instead of simply distorting allegedly true Nordic and Baltic traditions and/or beliefs, was creating something new, attuned to the approaching 13th century Danish race to strengthen institutions and engage in the Northern Crusades.\nImportantly, Saxo Grammaticus appears to have changed his agenda after the death of his patron Absalon in 1202. What eventually came to be the first nine books of , were actually written after the death of Absalon, and they focus largely on mythology, for which Saxo has been criticized. The contrast to the seven books written during the lifetime of Absalon is \"'enormous,' leading the main core of scholars to divide the two parts into mythical (books I\u2013IX) and historical (books X\u2013XVI), the last of the historical books being based on Absalon's memories. \"Therefore, we prefer to support the composition order of as X\u2013XVI, followed by I\u2013IX, and ending with the preface\", says historian Andr\u00e9 Muceniecks.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73010", "revid": "50929611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73010", "title": "Hardcore punk", "text": "Aggressive and fast subgenre of punk rock\nHardcore punk (commonly abbreviated to hardcore or hXc) is a punk rock subgenre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time. It was also inspired by Washington, D.C., and New York punk rock and early proto-punk. Hardcore punk generally eschews commercialism, the established music industry and \"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\" and often addresses social and political topics with \"confrontational, politically charged lyrics\".\nHardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Boston, and New York, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated sub-movements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including grunge and thrash metal.\nAlthough the music genre started in English-speaking Western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy, Japan and Brazil.\nCharacteristics.\nHardcore historian Steven Blush credits Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye with starting a \"die-hard mindset that begat almost everything we now call Hardcore\", which was virulently anti-music industry and anti-rock star. An article in \"Drowned in Sound\" argues that late 1970s/early 1980s-era hardcore is the true spirit of punk, because \"all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with New Romantic haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics\" and the punk scene now consisted of people like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Black Flag, and Circle Jerks, dedicated to the DIY ethics.\nOther writers have also attributed hardcore to a reaction against artsy and mellower sub-genres that punk grew into, such as post-punk and new wave. Hardcore punk additionally broke with original punk rock song patterns and visuals, favoring lower-key aesthetics.\nMusical elements.\nOne definition of the genre is \"a form of exceptionally harsh punk rock\". Hardcore has been called a faster, meaner genre of punk rock, that was a stern refutation against it, being more primal and immediate, with speed and aggression as the starting point.\nIn the vein of earlier punk rock, most hardcore punk bands have followed the traditional singer/guitar/bass/drum format. The song-writing has more emphasis on rhythm rather than melody. Blush writes \"The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll...like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form.\" According to AllMusic, the overall blueprint for hardcore was playing louder, harder and faster. Hardcore was a reaction to the \"cosmopolitan art-school\" style of new wave music. Hardcore \"eschew[ed] nuance, technique, [and] the avant-garde\", and instead emphasized \"speed and rhythmic intensity\" using unpredictable song forms and abrupt tempo changes.\nThe impact of powerful volume is important in hardcore. \"Noisey\" magazine describes one hardcore band as \"an all-encompassing, full-volume assault\" in which \"[e]very instrument sounds like it's competing for the most power and highest volume\". Scott Wilson states that the hardcore of the Bad Brains emphasized two elements: \"off-the-charts\" loudness which reached a level of threatening, powerful \"uncompromising noise\" and rhythm, in place of the typically focused-on elements in mainstream rock music, harmony and pitch (i.e., melody).\nHardcore vocalists often shout, scream or chant along with the music, using \"vocal intensity\" and an abrasive tone. The shouting of hardcore vocalists is often accompanied by audience members who are singing along, making the hardcore vocalist like the \"leader of a mob\" commonly known as \"gang vocals\". Steven Blush describes one early Minor Threat show where the crowd was singing the lyrics so loud they could be heard over the PA system. Hardcore vocal lines are often based on minor scales and songs may include shouted background vocals from the other band members. Hardcore lyrics expressed the \"frustration and political disillusionment\" of youth who were against 1980s-era affluence, consumerism, greed, Reagan politics and authority. The polarizing sociopolitical messages in hardcore lyrics (and outrageous on-stage behaviour) meant that the genre garnered no mainstream popularity.\nIn hardcore, guitarists frequently play fast power chords with a heavily distorted and amplified tone, creating what has been called a \"buzzsaw\" sound. Guitar parts can sometimes be complex, technically versatile, and rhythmically challenging. Guitar melody lines usually use the same minor scales used by vocalists (although some solos use pentatonic scales). Hardcore guitarists sometimes play solos, octave leads and grooves, as well as tapping into the various feedback and harmonic noises available to them. There are generally fewer guitar solos in hardcore than in mainstream rock, because solos were viewed as representing the \"excess and superficiality\" of mainstream commercial rock.\nHardcore bassists use varied rhythms in their basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick. Some bassists play fuzz bass by overdriving their bass tone.\nHardcore drumming, typically played fast and aggressively, has been called the \"engine\" and most essential element of the genre's aggressive sound of \"unrelenting anger\". Two other key elements for hardcore drummers are playing \"tight\" with the other musicians, especially the bassist (this does not mean metronomic time; indeed, coordinated tempo shifts are used in many important hardcore albums) and the drummer should have listened to a lot of hardcore, so that they can understand the \"raw emotions\" it expresses. Lucky Lehrer, the drummer and co-founder of the Circle Jerks in 1979, was an early developer of hardcore drumming; he has been called the \"Godfather of hardcore drumming\" and \"Flipside\" zine calls him the best punk drummer. According to Tobias Hurwitz, \"[h]ardcore drumming falls somewhere between the straight-ahead rock styles of old-school punk and the frantic, warp-speed bashing of thrash.\" Some hardcore punk drummers play fast D-beat one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical breakdowns in the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore, it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat.\nDancing.\nThe early 1980s hardcore punk scene developed slam dancing (also called moshing), a style of dance in which participants push or slam into each other, and stage diving. Moshing works as a vehicle for expressing anger by \"represent[ing] a way of playing at violence or roughness that allowed participants to mark their difference from the banal niceties of middle-class culture\". Moshing is in another way a \"parody of violence\", that nevertheless leaves participants bruised and sometimes bleeding. The term \"mosh\" came into use in the early 1980s American hardcore scene in Washington, D.C. A performance by Fear on the 1981 Halloween episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" was cut short when moshers, including John Belushi and members of a few hardcore punk bands, invaded the stage, damaged studio equipment and used profanity.\nFashion.\nMany North American hardcore punk fans adopted a dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans or work chinos, combat boots or sneakers, and crew cut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was a reflection of hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially a deconstruction of American fashion staples\u2014ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots.\nThe style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers. Siri C. Brockmeier writes that \"hardcore kids do not look like punks\", since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short haircuts, in contrast to the \"embellished leather jackets and pants\" worn in the punk scene. Lauraine Leblanc, however, claims that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands, dog collars, mohawk hairstyles, DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political statements, and patches. Tiffini A. Travis and Perry Hardy describe the look that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (e.g., an anarchy symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black or blonde to mohawks and shaved heads.\nCircle Jerks frontman Keith Morris wrote: \"[Punk] was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or sub. shop.\" Henry Rollins stated that for him, getting dressed up meant putting on a black shirt and some dark pants; taking an interest in fashion as being a distraction. Jimmy Gestapo from Murphy's Law describes his own transition from dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a bondage belt) to adopting a hardcore style (shaved head and boots) as being based on needing more functional clothing.\nSkateboard culture, streetwear, and workwear are also major influences on clothing worn by participants in both past and present eras of hardcore.\nPolitics.\nMusic writer Barney Hoskyns attributed hardcore being younger, faster and angrier than punk rock, to adolescents who were sick of their life in a \"bland Republican\" America. Hardcore punk lyrics often express antiestablishment, antimilitarist, antiauthoritarian, antiviolence, and pro-environmentalist sentiments, in addition to other typically left-wing, anarchist, or egalitarian political views. During the 1980s, the subculture often rejected what was perceived to be \"yuppie\" materialism and interventionist American foreign policy. Numerous hardcore punk bands have taken far-left political stances, such as anarchism or other varieties of socialism, and in the 1980s expressed opposition to political leaders such as then US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Reagan's economic policies, sometimes dubbed Reaganomics, and social conservatism were common subjects for criticism by hardcore bands of the time. Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law, however, endorsed Reagan and even went as far to call then former president Jimmy Carter a \"pussy\" in a 1986 \"New York Magazine\" cover story. Shortly after Reagan's death in 2004, the \"Maximumrocknroll\" radio show aired an episode composed of anti-Reagan songs by early hardcore punk bands.\nCertain hardcore punk bands have conveyed messages sometimes deemed \"politically incorrect\" by placing offensive content in their lyrics and relying on stage antics to shock listeners and people in their audience. Boston band The F.U.'s generated controversy with their 1983 album, \"My America\", whose lyrics contained what appeared to be conservative and patriotic views. Its messages were sometimes taken literally, when they were actually intended as a parody of conservative bands. Another act from Massachusetts, Vile, were known to insult women, minorities and gay people in their lyrics and would even go as far as putting their albums on the windshields of people's cars. On the other hand, Tim Yohannan and the influential punk rock fanzine \"Maximumrocknroll\" were criticized by some punks for acting as the \"politically correct scene police\", having what was perceived to be \"a very narrow definition of what fits into Punk\", apparently being \"authoritarian and trying to dominate the scene\" with their views.\nDuring the 2001\u20132009 United States presidency of George W. Bush, it was not uncommon for hardcore bands to express anti-Bush messages. During the 2004 United States presidential election, several hardcore punk artists and bands were involved with the anti-Bush political activist group PunkVoter. A minority of hardcore musicians have expressed right-wing views, such as the band Antiseen, whose guitarist Joe Young ran for public office as a North Carolina Libertarian. Former Misfits singer Michale Graves appeared on an episode of \"The Daily Show\", voicing support for George W. Bush, on behalf of the Conservative Punk website, and in 2023 testified on behalf of the far-right Proud Boys during their sedition trial for their role in attacking the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nDemographics.\nWhile the early hardcore scene was mostly young white males, both onstage and in the audience, there are notable exceptions. Black musicians include Bad Brains, Fred \"Freak\" Smith of Beefeater, Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro, and Scream bassist Skeeter Thompson. Numerous Black and Latino members have been in the band Suicidal Tendencies, including Mike Muir, Rocky George, R.J. Herrera, Louiche Mayorga, Robert Trujillo, Thundercat, Dean Pleasants, Ra D\u00edaz, Dave Lombardo, Eric Moore, Tim \"Rawbiz\" Williams, David Hidalgo Jr., and Ronald Bruner Jr. Other Latinos in early hardcore bands include Black Flag members Ron Reyes, Dez Cadena, Robo, and Anthony Martinez, Agnostic Front singer Roger Miret, his brother Madball singer Freddy Cricien, Adolescents guitarist Steve Soto, and Wasted Youth drummer Joey Castillo. Soto would later form the all-Latino punk band Manic Hispanic, which also featured Efrem Schulz from Death By Stereo. There are also notable women such as Crass singers Joy de Vivre and Eve Libertine, Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler, and Germs bassist Lorna Doom.\nSeveral documentaries, including 2003's \"Afro-Punk\" and 2016's \"Los Punks\", chronicle these subcultures within American punk and hardcore.\nAs of 2019, the genre is still overwhelmingly represented by white males. However, as sonic diversity has increased in the genre, so too has its fanbase. This has helped bring greater attention to inclusivity within the scene.\nBands like War On Women, Limp Wrist, Gouge Away, and G.L.O.S.S. have helped bring attention to subjects like women's rights, transphobia, rape, mental health, queer rights, and misogyny.\nRecord labels.\nRecord labels in hardcore are often DIY endeavors, run by musicians or participants within the community. Largely inspired by early labels like Dischord Records, Alternative Tentacles, Epitaph Records, SST Records, Revelation Records, and Touch &amp; Go Records, record labels are usually run on DIY ethic, collaboration, financial trust, and an emphasis on creative control. Labels within hardcore are seldom large, profit-making operations, but rather collaborative music partners with the intent to document and release music for the underground community.\nIan Mackaye, co-founder of Dischord Records claimed, \"We don't use contracts, lawyers, any of those kinds of things. We are partners \u2013 they make the music, and we make the records. From the beginning of this label, people have said that the way we do things is unsustainable, unrealistic, idealistic, and we were just dreaming\", he said. \"Well, the dream is now 35 years old, so they can go fuck themselves.\"\nEtymology.\nSteven Blush states that the Vancouver-based band D.O.A.'s 1981 album, \"Hardcore '81\", \"was where the genre got its name\". This album also helped to make people aware of the term \"hardcore\". Konstantin Butz states that while the origin of the expression \"hardcore\" \"cannot be ascribed to a specific place or time\", the term is \"usually associated with the further evolution of California's L.A. Punk Rock scene\", which included young skateboarders. A September 1981 article by Tim Sommer shows the author applying the term to the \"15 or so\" punk bands gigging around the city at that time, which he considered a belated development relative to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Blush said that the term \"hardcore\" is also a reference to the sense of being \"fed up\" with the existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to \"an extreme: the absolute most Punk\". Kelefa Sanneh states that the term \"hardcore\" referred to an attitude of \"turning inwards\" towards the scene and \"ignoring broader society\", all with the goal of achieving a sense of \"shared purpose\" and being part of a community. Sanneh cites Agnostic Front's band member selection approach as an example of hardcore's emphasis on \"scene citizenship\"; prospective members of the band were chosen based on being part of the local hardcore scene and being regularly in the moshing pit at shows, rather than based on a musical audition.\nHistory.\nLate 1970s and early 1980s.\nUnited States.\nLos Angeles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Hardcore punk drew a line in the sand between older and avant-garde rock fans and a new bunch of kids who were coming up. On one side there were those who considered the music (and its fans) loud, ugly and incoherent: to the folks on the other side, hardcore was the only music that mattered. A rare generational divide in rock music had arisen. And that's when exciting things happen.\n Music journalist Michael Azerrad in the book \"Our Band Could Be Your Life\" (2001)\nMichael Azerrad states that \"[by] 1979 the original punk scene [in Southern California] had almost completely died out\" and was replaced by punk music boiled down to its essence, but with faster tempos, which became known as \"hardcore\". Steven Blush states that the first hardcore record to come out of the West Coast was \"Out of Vogue\" by the Santa Ana band Middle Class. The band pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, Black Flag has been deemed the most influential group. Azerrad calls Black Flag the \"godfathers\" of hardcore punk and states that even \"...more than the flagship band of American hardcore\", they were \"...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music.\" Blush states that Black Flag were to hardcore what the Sex Pistols and Ramones were to punk. Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and primary songwriter Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978. In 2002, during an interview with Nardwuar, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra was asked what he believed to be the first hardcore record, he remarked: \"Sound Of Imker \"Train of Doomsday\" single in the late '60s in Holland. The only true '60s hardcore record I know.\"\nBy 1979, Black Flag were joined by another South Bay hardcore band, the Minutemen, with whom they shared a practice space until both bands were evicted, as well as the Circle Jerks (which featured Black Flag's original singer, Keith Morris). From Hollywood, two other bands playing hardcore punk, Fear and the Germs, were featured with Black Flag and the Circle Jerks in Penelope Spheeris' 1981 documentary \"The Decline of Western Civilization\". By the time the film was released, other hardcore bands from Los Angeles County were also making a name for themselves including Bad Religion, Descendents, Red Kross, Rhino 39, Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, Youth Brigade, and Youth Gone Mad. Neighboring Orange County had the Adolescents, Agent Orange, China White, Social Distortion, Shattered Faith, T.S.O.L., and Uniform Choice, while north of Los Angeles, around Oxnard, California, a hardcore scene known as \"nardcore\" developed with bands like Agression, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, and Rich Kids on LSD.\nWhilst popular traditional punk bands such as the Clash, Ramones, and Sex Pistols were signed to major record labels, the hardcore punk bands were generally not. Black Flag, however, was briefly signed to MCA subsidiary Unicorn Records but were dropped because an executive considered their music to be \"anti-parent\". Instead of trying to be courted by the major labels, hardcore bands started their own independent record labels and distributed their records themselves. Ginn started SST Records, which released Black Flag's debut EP \"Nervous Breakdown\" in 1979. SST went on to release a number of albums by other hardcore artists, and was described by Azerrad as \"easily the most influential and popular underground indie of the Eighties.\" SST was followed by a number of other successful artist-run labels\u2014including BYO Records (started by Shawn and Mark Stern of Youth Brigade), Epitaph Records (started by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion), New Alliance Records (started by the Minutemen's D. Boon and Mike Watt), as well as fan-run labels like Frontier Records and Slash Records.\nBands also funded and organized their own tours. Black Flag's tours in 1980 and 1981 brought them in contact with developing hardcore scenes in many parts of North America, and blazed trails that were followed by other touring bands. Concerts in the early Los Angeles hardcore scene increasingly became sites of violent battles between police and concertgoers. Another source of violence in L.A. was tension created by what one writer calls the invasion of \"antagonistic suburban poseurs\" into hardcore venues. Violence at hardcore concerts was portrayed in episodes of the popular television shows \"CHiPs\" and \"Quincy, M.E.\".\nIn the pre-Internet era, fanzines, commonly called zines, enabled hardcore scene members to learn about bands, clubs, and record labels. Zines typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, ads for records and labels, and were DIY products, \"proudly amateur, usually handmade. A zine called \"We Got Power\" described the Los Angeles scene from 1981 to 1984, and it included show reviews and band interviews with groups including D.O.A., the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and the Circle Jerks.\nSan Francisco.\nShortly after Black Flag debuted in Los Angeles, Dead Kennedys were formed in San Francisco. While the band's early releases were played in a style closer to traditional punk rock, \"In God We Trust, Inc.\" (1981) marked a shift into hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label, which in DK's case was Alternative Tentacles. The scene was helped in particular by the San Francisco club Mabuhay Gardens, whose promoter, Dirk Dirksen, became known as \"The Pope of Punk\". Another important local institution was Tim Yohannan's Maximumrocknroll, which started as a radio show in 1977, but branched out into a fanzine in 1982.\nWhile not as large as the scene in Los Angeles, the hardcore scene of the early 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands originating from the San Francisco Bay Area, including Bl'ast, Crucifix, the Faction, Fang, Flipper, and Whipping Boy. Additionally, during this time, seminal Texas-based bands Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, the Dicks, MDC, Rhythm Pigs, and Verbal Abuse all relocated to San Francisco. Further out of the Bay Area, Sacramento's Tales of Terror were cited by many, including Mark Arm, as a key inspiration for the grunge movement.\nWashington, D.C..\nThe first hardcore punk band to form on the East Coast of the United States was Washington, D.C.'s Bad Brains. Initially formed in 1977 as a jazz fusion ensemble called Mind Power, and consisting of all African-American members, their early foray into hardcore featured some of the fastest tempos in rock music. The band released its debut single, \"Pay to Cum\", in 1980, and were influential in establishing the D.C. hardcore scene. Hardcore historian Steven Blush calls the single the first East Coast hardcore record.\nIan MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, influenced by Bad Brains, formed the band Teen Idles in 1979. The group broke up in 1980, and MacKaye and Nelson went on to form Minor Threat, a band which, apart from Bad Brains, has arguably had the biggest influence on the hardcore punk genre, and whose contributions to the music, ethics, aesthetic, and ethos are still widely acknowledged by hardcore bands of the 2020s. The band used faster rhythms and more aggressive, less melodic riffs than was common at the time. Minor Threat popularized the straight edge movement with its song \"Straight Edge\", which spoke out against alcohol, drugs and promiscuity. MacKaye and Nelson ran their own record label, Dischord Records, which released records by D.C. hardcore bands, including the Faith, Iron Cross, Scream, State of Alert, Government Issue, Void, and D.C.'s Youth Brigade. The \"Flex Your Head\" compilation was a seminal document of the early 1980s D.C. hardcore scene. The record label was run out of the Dischord House, a Washington, D.C., punk house. Henry Rollins, who would come to prominence as the lead singer of the California-based Black Flag, as well as his own later Rollins Band, grew up in Washington, D.C., singing for the State of Alert, and was influenced by the music of Bad Brains and the bands of his childhood friend Ian MacKaye.\nThe tradition of holding all-ages shows at small DIY spaces, has roots in the early Washington, D.C., straight edge movement. It emerged from the idea that people of all ages should have access to music, regardless of if they're old enough to drink alcohol.\nBoston.\nSeminal Boston-area hardcore bands included the F.U.'s, the Freeze, Gang Green, Jerry's Kids, Siege, DYS, Negative FX, and SS Decontrol. Members of the latter three bands were influenced by D.C.'s straight edge scene, and were part of \"the Boston Crew\", a mostly straight edge group of friends known to physically fight people who used alcohol or drugs. Members of the Boston Crew would later go on to form the band Slapshot, and also included future Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer Dicky Barrett, who was then a member of the band Impact Unit, and drew the artwork for the DYS album \"Brotherhood\".\nIn 1982, Modern Method Records released \"This Is Boston, Not L.A.\", a compilation album of the Boston hardcore scene. In addition to Modern Method was Taang! Records, who released material by a number of the aforementioned Boston hardcore bands.\nFurther outside of Boston were Western Massachusetts bands Deep Wound (which featured future Dinosaur Jr. members J Mascis and Lou Barlow) and the Outpatients, both of whom would come to Boston to play shows. From nearby Manchester, New Hampshire, was G.G. Allin, a solo singer who, contrary to straight edge, used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, eventually dying of a heroin overdose. Allin's stage show included defecating on stage and then throwing his feces at the audience.\nNew York.\nThe New York City hardcore scene emerged in 1981 when Bad Brains moved to the city from Washington, D.C. Starting in 1981, there was an influx of new hardcore bands in the city including Agnostic Front, Beastie Boys, Cro-Mags, Cause for Alarm, the Mob, Murphy's Law, Reagan Youth, and Warzone. A number of other bands associated with New York hardcore scene came from New Jersey, including the Misfits, Adrenalin OD and Hogan's Heroes. Steven Blush calls the Misfits \"crucial to the rise of hardcore.\" New York hardcore had more emphasis on rhythm, in part due to the use of palm-muted guitar chords, an approach called the NY hardcore \"chug\". The New York scene was known for its tough ethos, its \"thuggery\", and club shows that were a chaotic \"proving ground\" or even a \"battleground\".\nIn the early 1980s, the New York hardcore scene centered around squats and clubhouses. After these were closed down, the scene was emanating in a small after-hours bar, A7, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and later around the famous bar CBGB. For several years, CBGB held weekly hardcore matin\u00e9es on Sundays, but they stopped in 1990 when violence led Kristal to ban hardcore shows at the club.\nEarly radio support in New York's surrounding Tri-State area came from Pat Duncan, who had hosted live punk and hardcore bands weekly on WFMU since 1979. Bridgeport, Connecticut's WPKN had a radio show featuring hardcore called Capital Radio, hosted by Brad Morrison, beginning in February 1979 and continuing weekly until late 1983. In New York City, Tim Sommer hosted \"Noise The Show\" on WNYU.\nBy 1984, the Ramones, one of the original New York punk bands, were experimenting with hardcore, with two songs, \"Wart Hog\" and \"Endless Vacation\" on their album \"Too Tough To Die\".\nOther American regions.\nMinneapolis hardcore consisted of bands such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements, while Chicago had Articles of Faith, Big Black and Naked Raygun. The Detroit area was home to Crucifucks, Degenerates, the Meatmen, Negative Approach, Spite and Violent Apathy. From Ohio was Maumee's Necros and Dayton's Toxic Reasons. The zine \"Touch and Go\" covered this Midwest hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983.\nJFA and Meat Puppets were both from Phoenix, Arizona; 7 Seconds were from Reno, Nevada; and Butthole Surfers, Big Boys, the Dicks, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.), Really Red, Verbal Abuse and MDC were from Texas. Portland, Oregon, hardcore punk bands included Poison Idea and Final Warning, while north of there, Washington state included the Acc\u00fcsed, Melvins, the Fartz, and 10 Minute Warning (the latter two included future Guns N' Roses member Duff McKagan). Other prominent hardcore bands from this time that came from areas without large scenes include Raleigh, North Carolina's Corrosion of Conformity.\nCanada.\nD.O.A. formed in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1978 and were one of the first bands to refer to its style as \"hardcore\", with the release of their album \"Hardcore '81\". Other early hardcore bands from British Columbia included Dayglo Abortions who formed in 1979, the Subhumans and the Skulls.\nNomeansno is a hardcore band originally from Victoria, British Columbia, and now located in Vancouver. SNFU formed in Edmonton in 1981 and also later relocated to Vancouver. Bunchofuckingoofs, from the Kensington Market neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, formed in November 1983 as a response to \"a local war with glue huffing Nazi skinheads\". In Montreal, The Asexuals helped fertilize a scene that became a necessary tour stop for punk and hardcore bands headed to the Northeast.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, a fertile hardcore scene took root early on. Referred to under a number of names including \"U.K. Hardcore\", \"UK 82\", \"second wave punk\", \"real punk\", and \"No Future punk\", it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and heavily distorted guitar sound of new wave of British heavy metal bands, especially Mot\u00f6rhead. Formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent, Discharge played a large role in influencing other European hardcore bands. AllMusic calls the band's sound a \"high-speed noise overload\" characterized by \"ferocious noise blasts.\" Their style of hardcore punk was coined as D-beat, a term referring to a distinctive drum beat that a number of 1980s imitators of Discharge are associated with.\nAnother UK band, the Varukers, were one of the original D-beat bands, Scottish band the Exploited were also influential, with the term \"UK 82\" (used to refer to UK hardcore in the early 1980s) being taken from one of their songs. They contrasted with early American hardcore bands by placing an emphasis on appearance. Frontman Walter \"Wattie\" Buchan had a giant red mohawk and the band continued to wear swastikas, an approach influenced by the wearing of this symbol by 1970s punks such as Sid Vicious. Because of this, the Exploited were labeled by others in the scene as \"cartoon punks\". Other influential UK hardcore bands from this period included GBH, Anti-Establishment, Antisect, Broken Bones, Chaos UK, Conflict, Dogsflesh, English Dogs, and grindcore innovators Napalm Death.\nOther countries.\nThere was an Italian hardcore punk scene in the 1980s that included groups like Wretched, Raw Power, and Negazione. Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including Anti Cimex, Disfear, and Mob 47. Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including Terveet K\u00e4det, one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe, notable hardcore bands included Hungary's Galloping Coroners from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era Niet from Ljubljana, Patareni from Zagreb and KBO! from Kragujevac.\nA Japanese hardcore scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s. The band SS is regarded as the first, forming in 1977. Bands such as the Stalin and GISM soon followed, both forming in 1980. Other notable Japanese hardcore bands include Balzac, Bomb Factory, Disclose (a D-beat band), Garlic Boys, Gauze, SOB, and the Star Club.\nMid\u2013to\u2013late 1980s.\nThe mid-1980s were a time of transition for the hardcore scene, with a number of influential bands from earlier in the decade changing their sound or breaking up. For instance, Black Flag's 1984 album \"My War\", which coincided with the band members growing their hair long, were criticized for having \"gone heavy metal\". The album's second side was called a road map for sludge metal, as well as being influenced by doom metal bands. Black Flag's eventual breakup in 1986 would coincide with the breakup of one of the other most influential hardcore bands, the Dead Kennedys.\nBy 1985, Boston bands SS Decontrol and DYS became metal bands, while the F.U.'s did the same, but changed their name to \"Straw Dogs\". By the end of the year, both SSD and DYS had broken up. Other bands in the mid-'80s that went from being strictly hardcore to adding more metal riffs developed an even heavier sound, with Corrosion of Conformity, Cro-Mags and D.R.I., becoming known as crossover thrash bands. Bands like Cro-Mags looked to early Bad Brains songs such as \"Supertouch/Shitfit\" as inspiration for heavy breakdowns in hardcore punk music.\nBad Religion briefly broke up in 1984, after making the progressive rock album \"Into the Unknown\". They returned to their roots on the 1985 \"Back to the Known\" EP, and then began their embrace of more melodic straightforward punk rock, starting with 1988's \"Suffer\". In 1986, Los Angeles's Youth Brigade changed their name to The Brigade, and changed their sound to a style that \"The Los Angeles Times\" compared to mainstream bands like U2, R.E.M., and Big Country. They broke up the following year.\nBands such as Minutemen, Meat Puppets, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements, changed their style, becoming alternative rock. Around the same time, a social movement within the influential hardcore punk scene of Washington, D.C., occurred during the summer of 1985, dubbed Revolution Summer. The movement challenged the initial wave of hardcore music, the attitudes of fans and bands before them and also the image mainstream media portrayed of punks. The bands that spawned out of Revolution Summer often took a stand against violence, especially at shows in the form of slam dancing, as well as standing up against the sexism of the scene. Bands associated with the movement, such as Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Dag Nasty, are notable for having inspired the emotional hardcore and the original emo genre of the late 1980s and 1990s. The subsequent post-hardcore music genre, spearheaded by bands like Fugazi, is an evolution of hardcore which was created by participants of the Revolution Summer movement. T.S.O.L., who had already embraced goth rock, became a hard rock band with 1986's \"Revenge\", being compared to Poison and Faster Pussycat, and touring with Guns N' Roses. Red Kross's second album, 1987's \"Neurotica\", was described as a blend of pop rock and art rock. The Beastie Boys gained fame by playing hip hop, and Bad Brains incorporated more reggae into their music, such as in their 1989 album \"Quickness\".\nStarting in 1986, the youth crew movement, became prominent in New York hardcore. Inspired by early hardcore bands such as 7 Seconds, Minor Threat and SSD, whose members were all straight edge and lyrical concerns included brotherhood and community values, youth crew was a reaction against the prevailing metal influence in hardcore at the time. The movement was based around Youth of Today, and fleshed out by bands signed to Youth of Today vocalist Ray Cappo's record label Revelation Records, including Gorilla Biscuits, Bold and Side by Side. Following the release of their second album \"Break Down the Walls\" (1986), Youth of Today toured extensively across the United States and internationally, leading to youth crew ideals spreading and the formation of many subsequent bands. Youth crew took a particular hold in Southern California, where Chain of Strength became one of the style's premier bands. As the style progressed, it too became influenced by the metal it originally opposed, seen in the musical style of Judge.\nIn the late 1980s, a more militant subculture of straight edge called hardline emerged through members of the anarcho punk scene and embraced veganism and radical environmentalism. Vegan Reich began as a crew of Animal Liberationists before becoming a band in order to promote their views in 1986; however, the group split from the wider U.S. anarchist movement in 1988 due to backlash from the community for their anti-carnist views. Vegan Reich vocalist Sean Muttaqi and Raid vocalist Steve Lovett created hardline philosophy and pioneered its musical movement alongside the English band Statement. Although hardline was overtly a political, anarchist school of thought rather than a hardcore subculture, hardline activists began to push their views specifically towards those in the mid to late 1980s straight edge scene due to the scene's wider appeal. The movement quickly gained popularity in Memphis and Indianapolis, before then spreading to Salt Lake City and Syracuse.\n1990s.\nThe early 1990s saw the pioneering of metalcore. One of the earliest metalcore scenes was that of Cleveland, Ohio, fronted by Integrity and Ringworm. Integrity's debut album \"Those Who Fear Tomorrow \" (1991) merged hardcore with apocalyptic lyrics and metal's guitar solos and chugging riffs to create one of the primeval albums in the genre. \"Revolver\" magazine writer Elis Enis stated that the album \"influenced practically every breakdown that's been recorded since\". Philadelphia's Starkweather and New Jersey's Rorschach were also early bands in the genre. In 1993, Earth Crisis released \"Firestorm\", one of the most influential songs in the genre. which ultimately popularised the militant vegan straight edge ethic and chug riffs. Soon after, the sound spread to Boston with Overcast and Converge and New York City with All Out War and Merauder.\nDuring this era in mainstream music, punk rock became a success in 1994 with popular bands like Green Day, the Offspring, and Rancid. While typically playing pop punk, Green Day's 1997 album \"Nimrod\" contained two songs (\"Platypus [I Hate You]\" and \"Take Back\") that were described as hardcore; meanwhile, Rancid would record a hardcore album with 2000's \"Rancid\". The same year, punk became popular again in 1994, Sick of It All released the major label album \"Scratch the Surface\". According to lead singer Lou Koller, people thought that they would go from a hardcore band to sounding like Green Day, so they intentionally made an album heavier than anything they'd done before. The album became a surprise success, with the single \"Step Down\" becoming a staple on MTV, thanks to a tongue-in-cheek music video featuring a roving reporter \"exposing\" the world of hardcore, and showing how to do various hardcore dance moves. The decade also saw a rise in pop-punk bands like New Found Glory and Saves the Day, which garnered attention from fans of hardcore due to band member connections to the contemporary hardcore scene.\nAs a reaction against the dominance of metal-influenced hardcore amongst straight edge bands, around 1996, a revival of the sound of the youth crew bands began. Bands including In My Eyes, Bane, Ten Yard Fight and Floorpunch, used the key aspects of late 1980s bands such as the gang vocals, high tempos and lyrical themes of straight edge, unity and vegetarianism. Additionally, at this time, Youth of Today's Ray Cappo formed Better Than a Thousand with Ken Olden and Graham Land of early 1990s straight edge band Battery, creating a sound, too, harkening back to this era. Further bands meshed straight edge with additional causes, such as Christian hardcore bands Call to Preserve, the Red Baron, xLooking Forwardx, Jewish band Sons of Abraham,\nqueercore band Limp Wrist, right-wing anti-immigrant band One Life Crew, and anti-capitalism bands Manliftingbanner and Refused.\nIn the late 1990s, a number of movements that attempted to rebel against the hypermasculinity that hardcore had come to embrace. One of these was fashioncore, which originated from Orange County, California metalcore bands, particularly Eighteen Visions. The movement placed emphasis on the fashion style of the musicians and saw many in hardcore begin to wear skinny jeans, collared shirts and white belts and adopting dyed, straightened and swooping fringed hairstyles. Sass music began with this same intention, doing so by incorporating elements such as homoerotic lyrics, lisped vocals, dance parts and sometimes synths.\nAs the 1990s drew to a close, a wave of metalcore bands began incorporating elements of melodic death metal into their sound. This formed an early version of what would become the melodic metalcore genre, with Shadows Fall's \"Somber Eyes to the Sky\" (1997), Undying's \"This Day All Gods Die\" (1999), Darkest Hour's \"The Prophecy Fulfilled\" (1999), Unearth's \"Above the Fall of Man\" (1999), Prayer for Cleansing's \"Rain in Endless Fall\" (1999) being some of the style's earliest releases. CMJ writer Anthony Delia also credited Florida's Poison the Well and their first two releases \"The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation\" (1999) and \"Tear from the Red\" (2002) as \"design[ing] the template for most of\" the melodic metalcore bands to come.\n2000s.\nBy 1999 and 2000, the youth crew revival was in decline, with Ten Yard Fight, In My Eyes and Floorpunch all disbanding. As a reaction against the homogeneity and simplicity that scene had developed, Ten Yard Fight guitarist Tim Cossar and the band's roadie Wesley Eisold formed American Nightmare. Although still musically rooted in the youth crew revival, the band's negative, poetic lyrics of self-loathing were inspired by groups like the Smiths. American Nightmare's influence was apparent promptly in their home of Boston, then expanded nationally with the release of their 2001 debut album \"Background Music\", being followed by a wave bands including Ceremony, Ruiner, Modern Life Is War, the Hope Conspiracy and Killing the Dream. A reaction against this movement also took place, which began with Mental, who were quickly followed by Have Heart. Have Heart's success led to the rise in popularity of other positive hardcore groups like Champion, Verse and Sinking Ships, and the rise in prominence of Bridge 9 Records. In an \"AllMusic\" review, Greg Prato wrote about the label's band Energy that \"While you wouldn't go quite as far as calling Energy \"a hardcore boy band,\" the group's leanings toward the mainstream are undeniable throughout \"Invasions of the Mind\". Friends Stand United (FSU) formed in Boston in the 1980s in an attempt to expel neo-Nazis from the scene. By the early 2000s, there were FSU chapters in Philadelphia, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles, Seattle, upstate New York and New Jersey, and they were considered to have about 200 members. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually classified FSU as a street gang, which used violent methods and repeatedly assault people at hardcore shows and on Boston streets. In conjunction with the gang activities, James eventually did time in jail for extortion.\nWith the increased popularity of punk rock in the mid-1990s and the 2000s, additional hardcore bands signed with major record labels. In 2001, New York's H2O released the album \"Go\" on MCA, but it failed at bringing the band big success, and fell flat with longtime fans. In 2002, AFI signed to DreamWorks Records but changed their sound considerably for its successful major label debut \"Sing the Sorrow\". Chicago's Rise Against were signed by Geffen Records, and three of its releases on the label were certified platinum by the RIAA. Like AFI, Rise Against gradually removed elements of hardcore from their music, culminating with 2008's \"Appeal to Reason\", which lacked the intensity found in their earlier albums. United Kingdom band Gallows were signed to Warner Bros. Records for \u00a31 million. Their major label debut \"Grey Britain\" was more aggressive than their previous material, and the band was subsequently dropped from the label. The success of the band led to other British hardcore acts of the time gain notability like the Ghost of a Thousand and Heights. Los Angeles band the Bronx briefly appeared on Island Def Jam Music Group for the release of their 2006 self-titled album, which was named one of the top 40 albums of the year by \"Spin\" magazine. They appeared in the Darby Crash biopic \"What We Do Is Secret\", playing members of Black Flag. In 2007, Toronto's Fucked Up appeared on \"MTV Live Canada\", where they were introduced as \"Effed Up\". During the performance of its song \"Baiting the Public\", the majority of the audience was moshing, which caused $2000 in damages to the set. Fucked Up went on to win the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for the album \"The Chemistry of Common Life\".\nAustralian hardcore also took off during this time with bands like Miles Away, Break Even, 50 Lions (formed in 2005), and Iron Mind (formed in 2006). The genre was played on the national Triple J network on the \"short.fast.loud\" program. Australian labels that released hardcore music include Broken Hive Records, Resist Records and UNFD Records.\n2010s.\nWith many bands breaking up in the late 2000s, accompanied by a general sense of sonic homogeny in the hardcore genre, the 2010s became a decade of experimentation and fusion in hardcore music that was fueled by access to streaming. Drawing from and collaborating with elements of other eras and genres, hardcore grew as music styles intersected. For instance, bands like Trash Talk began collaborating with artists like Tyler, the Creator and his hip hop collective Odd Future. Meanwhile, bands like Fury, Fiddlehead, and Give garnered a great deal of attention on an underground level for their lyricism and diverse sounds. Other prominent bands, like Title Fight and Basement brought elements of shoegaze and '90s noise rock into the hardcore genre.\nTrapped Under Ice were one of the most prominent bands in hardcore in the early 2010s. The band's second album \"Big Kiss Goodnight\" (2011) changing the sonic landscape of hardcore at the time, with \"Stereogum\" writer Tom Breiham stating in a 2023 article that \"it's been years since we've gotten a new Trapped Under Ice song, but that band's influence looms large over the entire hardcore landscape today.\" However, in 2013, the band suddenly disbanded, disheartened by the amount of interest in them by the music industry. In the meantime, its members focused on their other projects Angel Dust, Diamond Youth, Down to Nothing and Turnstile. Angel Dust's embrace of styles like indie pop, and Turnstile's of 1960s surf music and 1990s alternative rock led to them, too, becoming formidable in the follow decade.\nIn the early to mid-2010s, a number of British hardcore punk bands began being represented as members of a new musical movement dubbed the New Wave of British Hardcore, a term coined by Adam Malik from the Essence Records. Bands who are part of the movement generally take influence from '80s Boston and New York hardcore bands. Bands associated with the movement include Arms Race, Violent Reaction, Big Cheese, Higher Power, Perspex Flesh, Mob Rules, the Flex and Blind Authority. Some bands such as Rapture, Violent Reaction and Payday are straight edge.\nDuring this time, Muslim hardcore bands have emerged in the U.S., Canada, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The development of Muslim hardcore has been traced to the impact of a 2010 film \"Taqwacore\", a documentary about the Muslim hardcore scene. Bands include the Kominas from Boston, the all-girl Secret Trial Five from Toronto, Al Thawra (The Power) from Chicago \"and even a few bands out in Pakistan and Indonesia.\" Partly due to developments in digital communications, there was a rise in interaction between hardcore scenes in different places and subgenres, particularly in Europe. In September 2017, \"Bandcamp Daily\" wrote that Fluff Fest, which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and features an international lineup of independent bands ranging in style from crust punk to screamo, \"has established itself as the main DIY hardcore punk event in Europe\".\nDuring the decade, many hardcore bands also had considerable chart recognition. Turnstile signed to Roadrunner Records in 2017 and released their sophomore album \"Time &amp; Space\" in 2018, which reached number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Gouge Away, formed in 2012 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, saw their record \"Burnt Sugar\" peak at 46 on Billboard Independent Albums. Code Orange, who formed in Pittsburgh in 2008, their 2014 sophomore album \"I Am King\" reached number 96 on the Billboard 200, and its follow up, 2017's \"Forever\" peaked and number 62. Kentucky hardcore band Knocked Loose formed in 2013 and released their debut album \"Laugh Tracks\" in 2016, which peaked at number 163 on the Billboard 200. Its follow-up \"A Different Shade of Blue\" was released in 2019 and peaked at number 26. Many of these bands were a part of wave of bands gaining recognition for harkening back to the metallic hardcore sound of bands from the 1990s, which included Vein.fm, Code Orange, Knocked Loose, Varials, Jesus Piece, Counterparts and Kublai Khan.\nHardcore in the late 2010s saw a significant growth of the scene to involve bands taking influence from styles generally disassociated with it, such as industrial, heavy metal, post-punk and nu metal. Around this time, mainstream rappers began to associate themselves with the hardcore scene. Playboi Carti included a performance from a hardcore show as the front cover for his 2018 album \"Die Lit\", Denzel Curry collaborated with Bad Brains and Fucked Up in 2019 and rap groups Suicideboys and City Morgue were joined on tour by hardcore bands Turnstile and Trash Talk. Rappers Wicca Phase Springs Eternal and Ghostemane even began playing music by performing in hardcore bands. In September 2019, rap group Injury Reserve released a collaborative track with Code Orange and JPEGMafia.\nIn 2019, the highly influential 2000s Boston hardcore band Have Heart reunited for performances in four different locations after a ten-year breakup. One of these performances was outside the Worcester Palladium in Massachusetts, which drew around 10,000 attendees, making it the largest standalone hardcore show in history.\n2020s.\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic made the prospect of playing live music difficult. This brought about a heavy digital shift in independent music, where many bands began performing livestream shows for fans until physical shows could occur. With social distancing limiting the availability of physical interactions, the hardcore community relied on social media activity, podcasting, zines, and video content to stay connected virtually. During this period, a number of hardcore releases gained attention from the media and online that surpassed the genre's usual scope, namely Code Orange's \"Underneath\" (2020), Higher Power's \"27 Miles Underwater\" (2021) and Turnstile's \"Glow On\" (2021). \"Underneath\" topped the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums, reached number two on the US Top Tastemaker Albums chart, and received universal critical acclaim. Higher Power were hailed by \"Metal Hammer\" as \"the band redefining hardcore for a new generation\", and voted the most likely UK band to break into the mainstream in a \"Revolver\" fan poll. However, \"Glow On\" triggered an international explosion in popularity of the genre, and allowed for the subsequent success of bands including Zulu, High Vis and Speed. \"Glow On\" also received universal critical acclaim, peaked at number two on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums, and number thirty on the mainline \"Billboard\" 200 chart. A podcast published the \"New York Times\" credited a number of viral videos of live performances by hardcore bands as contributing to the popularity, including Sunami's live debut in San Jose on October 26, 2019, Hate5six's July 03, 2021 video of Mindforce performing at Underground Arts in Philadelphia and Turnstile's performance in Oxnard on August 29, 2021.\nThe southern San Francisco Bay Area scene gained particular prevalence in the 2020s, based in Santa Cruz and San Jose. The first of these bands was Gulch, who formed in 2016, and were later followed by Scowl, Drain and Sunami. As lockdowns began to ease, many of the bands in this scene began to put on \"guerilla shows\", such as one that took place on June 19, 2021, in San Jose featuring Sunami, Gulch, Drain, Scowl, Xibalba and Maya Over Eyes, which had an attendance of around 2,000. Gulch performed their final live performance at Sound and Fury Festival on July 31, 2022, at the peak of their popularity.\nThis period also saw a number of groups garner attention while experimenting with hardcore's sound. The \"Financial Times\" named London's Chubby and the Gang and Detroit's the Armed as two of the most commercially successful groups of this wave, while \"Spin\" magazine cited Militarie Gun, High Vis and Scowl as bands \"help[ing] to breathe life back into both\" alternative rock and hardcore.\nInfluence.\nHardcore punk has spawned a number of subgenres, fusion genres and derivative forms. Key derivatives like post-hardcore, emo, and skate punk have had a major impact on alternative music. Other subgenres include D-beat, melodic hardcore, crust punk, and thrashcore. Fusion genres include crossover thrash, grindcore, and metalcore, all of which fuse hardcore punk with extreme metal.\nMetallica and Slayer, pioneers of the heavy metal subgenre thrash metal, were influenced by a number of hardcore bands. Metallica's cover album \"Garage Inc.\" included covers of two Discharge and three Misfits songs, while Slayer's cover album \"Undisputed Attitude\" consisted of covers of predominately hardcore punk bands.\nThe Washington state band Melvins, aside from their influence on grunge, helped create what would be known as sludge metal, which is also a combination between Black Sabbath-style music and hardcore punk. This genre developed during the early 1990s, in the Southern United States (particularly in the New Orleans metal scene). Some of the pioneering bands of sludge metal were Eyehategod, Crowbar, Down, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath and Corrosion of Conformity. Later, bands such as Isis and Neurosis, with similar influences, created a style that relies mostly on ambience and atmosphere that would eventually be named atmospheric sludge metal or post-metal.\nFusion and subgenres.\nD-beat.\nD-beat (also known as discore or k\u00e4ngpunk) is a hardcore punk subgenre, developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band Discharge, after whom the genre is named, as well as a drum beat characteristic of this subgenre. The bands Discharge and the Varukers are pioneers of the D-beat genre. Robbie Mackey of \"Pitchfork Media\" described D-beat as \"hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight.\"\nEmo and post-hardcore.\nThe 1980s saw the development of post-hardcore, which took the hardcore style in a more complex and dynamic direction, with a focus on singing rather than screaming. The post-hardcore style first took shape in Chicago, with bands such as Big Black, the Effigies and Naked Raygun. It later developed in Washington, D.C., within the community of bands on Ian MacKaye's Dischord Records, with bands such as Fugazi, the Nation of Ulysses, and Jawbox. The style extended until the late 2000s. The mid-'80s Washington, D.C., Revolution Summer movement and post-hardcore scene would also see the birth of emo. Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics dealing with nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation. Other D.C. bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, Fire Party, Dag Nasty, also became connected to this movement. The style was dubbed \"emo\", \"emo-core\", or \"post-harDCore\" (in reference to one of the names given to the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene).\nThrashcore and powerviolence.\nOften confused with crossover thrash and sometimes thrash metal is thrashcore. Thrashcore (also known as fastcore) is a subgenre of hardcore punk that emerged in the early 1980s. It is essentially sped-up hardcore punk, with bands often using blast beats. Just as hardcore punk groups distinguished themselves from their punk rock predecessors by their greater intensity and aggression, thrashcore groups (often identified simply as \"thrash\") sought to play at breakneck tempos that would radicalize the innovations of hardcore. Early American thrashcore groups included Cryptic Slaughter (Santa Monica), D.R.I. (Houston), Ludichrist, (Long Island), Septic Death (Boise) and Siege (Weymouth, Massachusetts). Thrashcore spun off into powerviolence, another raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk. Other notable powerviolence bands include early Ceremony, Man is the Bastard and Spazz.\nGrindcore.\nGrindcore is an extreme genre of music that began the early to mid-1980s. Grindcore music relies on heavy metal instrumentation and eventually changed into a genre similar to death metal. Grindcore vocals, according to AllMusic, range \"from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks\". Grindcore also features blast beats; according to Adam MacGregor of \"Dusted\", \"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\" The band Napalm Death invented the grindcore genre; their debut album \"Scum\" was described by AllMusic as \"perhaps the most representative example of\" grindcore.\nBeatdown hardcore.\nBeatdown hardcore (also known as heavy hardcore, brutal hardcore, toughguy, and moshcore) is a style of hardcore punk and heavy metal which has deep, hoarse vocals, down-tuned guitars, blast beats, and slow breakdowns. More heavy metal-influenced than traditional hardcore punk, Rotting Out, Strife, Shai Hulud, Madball and Hatebreed all are beatdown hardcore bands.\nMetalcore.\nMetalcore is a fusion genre that merges hardcore punk with extreme metal. Metalcore has screaming, growling, heavy guitar riffs, breakdowns, and double bass drumming. Heavy metal\u2013hardcore punk hybrids arose in the mid-1980s and would also radicalize the innovations of hardcore as the two genres and their ideologies intertwined noticeably. The term has been used to refer to bands that were not purely hardcore nor purely metal such as Earth Crisis, Integrity and Hogan's Heroes. During the 2000s, there was a metalcore explosion and bands like Bullet for My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Shadows Fall, and As I Lay Dying all had some popularity.\nGrunge.\nIn the mid-1980s, bands such as Melvins, Flipper and Green River developed a sludgy, \"aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore,\" creating an alternative rock subgenre known as grunge. Grunge evolved from the local Seattle punk rock scene, and it was inspired by bands such as the Fartz, 10 Minute Warning and the Acc\u00fcsed. Grunge fuses elements of hardcore and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Grunge's key guitar influences included Black Flag and the Melvins. Black Flag's 1984 record \"My War\", on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle.\nNintendocore.\nNintendocore, another musical style, fuses hardcore with video game music, chiptune, and 8-bit music.\nSludgecore.\nEyehategod formed in Harvey, Louisiana in 1988 and is credited with originating a new style\u2014New Orleans hardcore-edged sludge. Another viewpoint is that New Orleans was the birthplace of the sludgecore movement, with Eyehategod being given the most credit for it. Sludgecore combines sludge metal with hardcore punk, and possesses a slow pace, a low guitar tuning, and a grinding dirge-like feel. Bands regarded as sludgecore include Acid Bath, Eyehategod, and Soilent Green, and all three formed in Louisiana. Crowbar formed in 1991 and mixed \"detuned, lethargic sludged-out metal with hardcore and southern elements\". According to rock journalist Steve Huey writing in AllMusic, Eyehategod was a sludge metal band that became part of the \"Southern sludgecore scene\". This scene also included Crowbar and Down, with all three bands being influenced by Black Flag, Black Sabbath, and the Melvins. Some of these bands incorporated Southern rock influences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As one of the founders of paleogenetics, he has worked extensively on the Neanderthal genome. In 1997, he became founding director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Since 1999, he has been an honorary professor at Leipzig University; he currently teaches molecular evolutionary biology at the university. He is also an adjunct professor at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.\nIn 2022, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution\".\nEducation and early life.\nP\u00e4\u00e4bo was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1955 and grew up there with his mother, Estonian chemist Karin P\u00e4\u00e4bo (; 1925\u20132013), who had escaped from the Soviet invasion in 1944 and arrived in Sweden as a refugee during World War II. He was born through an extramarital affair of his father, Swedish biochemist Sune Bergstr\u00f6m (1916\u20132004), who, like his son, became a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (in 1982). P\u00e4\u00e4bo is his mother's only child; he has via his father's marriage a half-brother, Rurik Reenstierna (also born in 1955), who only learned Svante was his brother in 2004.\nP\u00e4\u00e4bo grew up as a native Swedish speaker. In a 2012 interview with the Estonian newspaper \"Eesti P\u00e4evaleht\", he said that he self-identifies as a Swede, but has a \"special relationship with Estonia\".\nIn 1975, P\u00e4\u00e4bo began studying at Uppsala University, serving one year in the Swedish Defense Forces attached to the School of Interpreters. P\u00e4\u00e4bo earned his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1986 for research investigating how the E19 protein of adenoviruses modulates the immune system.\nResearch and career.\nP\u00e4\u00e4bo is known as one of the founders of paleogenetics, a discipline that uses genetics to study early humans and other ancient species.\nFrom 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of Zurich, Switzerland.\nAs an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow, P\u00e4\u00e4bo moved to the United States in 1987, accepting a position as a postdoctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Allan Wilson's lab and worked on the genome of extinct mammals.\nIn 1990, he returned to Europe to become professor of general biology at the University of Munich, and, in 1997, he became founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\nIn 1997, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and colleagues reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley.\nIn August 2002, P\u00e4\u00e4bo's department published findings about the \"language gene\", FOXP2, which is mutated in some individuals with language disabilities.\nIn 2006, P\u00e4\u00e4bo announced a plan to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals. In 2007, he was named one of \"Time\" magazine's 100 most influential people of the year.\nIn February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome. Over 3\u00a0billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the 454 Life Sciences Corporation.\nIn March 2010, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus \"Homo\" that had not yet been recognised, the Denisova hominin. P\u00e4\u00e4bo first wanted to classify the Denisovans as a species of their own, separate from modern humans and Neanderthals but changed his mind after peer-review. In this context, Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo was able to show that the TKTL1 gene discovered by Johannes F. Coy has a single amino acid substitution in Neanderthals compared to modern humans. This change probably influenced neuronal development and may have contributed to the difference in brain structure between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.\nIn May 2010, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal \"Science\". He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans. There is general mainstream support in the scientific community for this theory of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans. This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, in the Middle East.\nIn 2014, he published the book \"\" where he, in the mixed form of a memoir and popular science, tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome combined with his thoughts on human evolution.\nIn 2020, Hugo Zeberg and Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo determined that more severe impacts upon victims of the COVID-19 disease, including the vulnerability to it and the incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation, have been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. The findings were described in a Nature article with Hugo Zeberg from Karolinska Institutet and Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo from the Max Planck Institute.\nAs of \u00a02022[ [update]], P\u00e4\u00e4bo has an h-index of 167 according to Google Scholar and of 133 according to Scopus.\nAwards and honours.\nIn 1992, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. P\u00e4\u00e4bo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2000, and in 2004 was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences. He received the Ernst Schering Prize in 2003. In 2005, he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine. In 2008, P\u00e4\u00e4bo was added to the members of the Order Pour le M\u00e9rite for Sciences and Arts. In the same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that P\u00e4\u00e4bo had been awarded the 2009 Kistler Prize for his work isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old mummy. In June 2010, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor B\u00fccher Medal for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

It borders the Scottish council areas of Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders to the north, Northumberland and County Durham to the east, North Yorkshire to the south-east, Lancashire to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. Its largest settlement is the city of Carlisle.\nCumbria is predominantly rural, with an area of and a population of 510,680; this makes it the third-largest ceremonial county in England by area but the eighth-smallest by population. Carlisle is located in the north; the towns of Workington and Whitehaven lie on the west coast, Barrow-in-Furness on the south coast, and Penrith and Kendal in the east of the county. For local government purposes the county comprises two unitary authority areas, Westmorland and Furness and Cumberland. Cumbria was created in 1974 from the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the Furness area of Lancashire, and a small part of Yorkshire.\nThe interior of Cumbria contains several upland areas. Together they fringe the Vale of Eden, the wide valley of the River Eden, which runs south-east to north-west across the county and broadens into the Solway Plain near Carlisle. To the north-east are part of the Border Moors, and to the east part of the North Pennines; the latter have been designated a national landscape. South of the vale are the Orton Fells, Howgill Fells, and part of the Yorkshire Dales, which are all within the Yorkshire Dales national park.\u00a0The south-west contains the Lake District, a large upland area which has been designated a national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike; its longest and largest lake, Windermere; and its deepest lake, Wast Water. The county has long coast to the west which is bordered by a plain for most of its length. The north-west coast is part of the Solway Firth, a national landscape, and the south coast includes the Cartmel and Furness peninsulas. East of the peninsulas, the county contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, another national landscape\nThe county contains several Neolithic monuments, such as Mayburgh Henge. The region was on the border of Roman Britain, and Hadrian's Wall runs through the north of the county. In the Early Middle Ages parts of the region successively belonged to Rheged, Northumbria, and Strathclyde, and there was also a Viking presence. It became the border between England and Scotland, and was unsettled until the Union of the Crowns in 1603. During the Industrial Revolution mining took place on the Cumberland coalfield and Barrow-in-Furness became a shipbuilding centre, but the county was not heavily industrialised and the Lake District became valued for its sublime and picturesque qualities, notably by the Lake Poets.\nToponymy.\nThe place names \"Cumbria\" and \"Cumberland\" both mean \"land of the Cumbrians\" and are names derived from the term that had been used by the inhabitants of the area to describe themselves. In the period c.\u2009400\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091100, it is likely that any group of people living in Britain who identified as 'Britons' called themselves by a name similar to 'Cum-ri' which means \"fellow countrymen\" (and has also survived in the Welsh name for Wales which is \"Cymru\"). The first datable record of the place name as \"Cumberland\" is from an entry in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle for the year AD 945. This record refers to a kingdom known to the Anglo-Saxons as \"Cumbraland\" and in Latin as \"Cumbria\", often also known as Strathclyde, which in the 10th century may have stretched from Loch Lomond to Leeds. The first king to be unequivocally described as king of the Cumbrians is Owain ap Dyfnwal, who ruled from c.\u2009915\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009937.\nHistory.\nDuring the Neolithic period what is now Cumbria area contained an important centre of stone axe production (the so-called Langdale axe factory), products of which have been found across Great Britain. During this period, stone circles and henges were built across the county, and today, Cumbria has one of the largest number of preserved field monuments in England'.\nWhile not part of the region conquered in the Romans' initial conquest of Britain in AD 43, most of modern-day Cumbria was later conquered in response to a revolt deposing the Roman-aligned ruler of the Brigantes in AD 69. The Romans built a number of fortifications in the area during their occupation, the most famous being UNESCO World Heritage Site Hadrian's Wall which passes through northern Cumbria.\nAt the end of the period of British history known as Roman Britain (c.\u2009AD 410) the inhabitants of Cumbria were Cumbric-speaking native Celtic Britons who were probably descendants of the Brigantes and Carvetii (sometimes considered to be a sub-tribe of the Brigantes) that the Roman Empire had conquered in about AD 85. Based on inscriptional evidence from the area, the Roman ' of the Carvetii seems to have covered portions of Cumbria. The names \"Cumbria\", ' (the native Welsh name for Wales), \"Cambria\", and \"Cumberland\" are derived from the name these people gave themselves, *\"kombroges\" in Common Brittonic, which originally meant \"compatriots\".\nAlthough Cumbria was previously believed to have formed the core of the Early Middle Ages Brittonic kingdom of Rheged, more recent discoveries near Galloway appear to contradict this. For the rest of the first millennium, Cumbria was contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic Celtic Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Most of modern-day Cumbria was a principality in the Kingdom of Scotland at the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and thus was excluded from the Domesday Book survey of 1086. In 1092 the region was invaded by William II and incorporated into England. In 1133 the diocese of Carlisle was founded, cementing Cumbria's position within the English church. Cumbria left Scottish hands for the last time in 1157. Nevertheless, the region was dominated by the many Anglo-Scottish Wars of the latter Middle Ages and early modern period and the associated Border Reivers who exploited the dynamic political situation of the region. There were at least three sieges of Carlisle fought between England and Scotland, and two further sieges during the Jacobite risings.\nAfter the Jacobite Risings of the 18th century, Cumbria became a more stable place and, as in the rest of Northern England, the Industrial Revolution caused a large growth in urban populations. In particular, the west coast towns of Workington, Millom and Barrow-in-Furness saw large iron and steel mills develop, with Barrow also developing a significant shipbuilding industry. Kendal, Keswick and Carlisle all became mill towns, with textiles, pencils and biscuits among the products manufactured in the region. The early 19th century saw the county gain fame when the Lake Poets and other artists of the Romantic movement, such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, lived among, and were inspired by, the lakes and mountains of the region. Later, the children's writer Beatrix Potter also wrote in the region and became a major landowner, granting much of her property to the National Trust on her death. In turn, the large amount of land owned by the National Trust assisted in the formation in 1951 of the Lake District National Park, which remains the largest National Park in England and has come to dominate the identity and economy of the county.\nThe Windscale fire of 10 October 1957 was the worst nuclear accident in Great Britain's history.\nCumbria was created in 1974 from the administrative counties of Cumberland and Westmorland; the county boroughs of Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness; the districts of North Lonsdale, Grange, Ulverston, and Dalton-in-Furness from Lancashire; and the Sedbergh Rural District from the West Riding of Yorkshire. Cumbria County Council and the seven district councils were abolished in 2023 and replaced by two new unitary authorities, Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council.\nOn 2 June 2010, taxi driver Derrick Bird killed 12 people and injured 11 others in a shooting spree that spanned over along the Cumbrian coastline.\nGeography.\nCumbria is the most northwesterly ceremonial county of England and is mostly mountainous, with large upland areas to the south-west and east. The south-west contains the Lake District, a national park and UNESCO world heritage site which includes Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain at , and Windermere, its longest and largest lake. The Border Moors and North Pennines lie along the county's eastern border. The south-east contains the Orton Fells, Howgill Fells and part of the Yorkshire Dales, which are all within the Yorkshire Dales national park.\nThe Vale of Eden, the valley of the River Eden, runs south-east to north-west between these upland areas, and broadens into the Solway Plain near Carlisle. The county has long coast to the west, which is bordered by a plain for most of its length. In the north-west it borders the Solway Firth, a national landscape, and to the south are the Cartmel and Furness peninsulas. East of the peninsulas, the county contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, also a national landscape. The Lancaster Canal runs from Preston into southern Cumbria and is partly in use. The Ulverston Canal which once reached to Morecambe Bay is maintained although it was closed in 1945.\nThe county contains a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, several of which are grouped into the Lake District High Fells, which is a designated Special Area of Conservation.\nBoundaries and divisions.\nThe northernmost and southernmost points in Cumbria are just west of Deadwater, Northumberland and South Walney respectively. Kirkby Stephen (close to Tan Hill, North Yorkshire) and St Bees Head are the most easterly and westerly points of the county. The boundaries are along the Irish Sea to Morecambe Bay in the west, and along the Pennines to the east. Cumbria's northern boundary stretches from the Solway Firth from the Solway Plain eastward along the border with Scotland.\nCumbria is bordered by Northumberland, County Durham, North Yorkshire, Lancashire in England, and Dumfries and Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale in Scotland.\nEconomy.\nMany large companies and organisations are based in Cumbria. The county council itself employs around 17,000 individuals, while the largest private employer in Cumbria, BAE Systems in Barrow employs around 14,500 with further job growth associated with new contracts expected, the Sellafield nuclear processing site, has a workforce of 10,000.\nTourism.\nThe largest and most widespread industry is tourism, with the county attracting over 47 million visitors annually. The Lake District National Park alone receives some 15.8\u00a0million visitors every year. Despite this, fewer than 50,000 people reside permanently within the Lake District: mostly in Ambleside, Bowness-on-Windermere, Coniston, Gosforth, Grasmere, Keswick, and Windermere. Over 36,000 Cumbrians are employed in the tourism industry, which adds \u00a31.1\u00a0billion a year to the county's economy. The Lake District and the county as a whole attract visitors from across the UK, Europe, North America and the Far East (particularly Japan). The tables below show the twenty most-visited attractions in Cumbria in 2009. (Not all visitor attractions provided data to Cumbria Tourism who collated the list. Those who did not included Furness Abbey, the Lakes Aquarium and South Lakes Safari Zoo, the last of which would almost certainly rank within the top five.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nGovernance.\nLocal.\nCumbria is governed by two unitary authorities, Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council. The Cumberland unitary authority area covers the north and west of Cumbria, and Westmorland and Furness the south and east; they are named after the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, but have different boundaries. Cumberland has had a Labour majority administration since the 2022 Cumberland Council election, and Westmorland and Furness has had a Liberal Democrat majority administration since the 2022 Westmorland and Furness Council election. Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council collaborate through a https:// and the https:// Economic Growth Body. In September 2024, the two councils submitted an expression of interest to form a combined authority. Plans for a mayoral combined authority were agreed by the UK government in February 2025, with the first mayor expected to be elected in May 2026.\nBetween 1974 and 2023 Cumbria was administered by Cumbria County Council and six district councils: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden, and South Lakeland. These were abolished on 1 April 2023, when the two unitary authorities were established.\nThe Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the sovereign, exercises some rights of the Crown in the County Palatine of Lancaster, which includes the Furness area of Cumbria.\nNational.\nUntil the 2024 general election, there were six parliamentary constituencies in Cumbria: Barrow and Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Penrith and the Border, Westmorland and Lonsdale, and Workington. Five were won by the Conservative Party in the 2019 United Kingdom general election, with Westmorland and Lonsdale won by the Liberal Democrats. The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies abolished Copeland, Workington, and Penrith and the Border, replacing them with the new constituencies of Penrith and Solway and Whitehaven and Workington. The three remaining constituencies underwent significant boundary changes, including some electoral wards being transferred from Westmorland and Lonsdale to Morecambe and Lunesdale, making the latter a cross-county constituency (it had previously been exclusively in Lancashire).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nPolitics.\nConservatives and the Liberal Democrats are strongest in rural areas, and Labour is strongest in the industrial towns.\nEducation.\nAlthough secondary schooling in Cumbria has a comprehensive system almost fully, there is one state grammar school in Penrith. There are 42 state secondary schools and 10 independent schools. The more rural secondary schools tend to have sixth forms (although in Barrow-in-Furness district, no schools have sixth forms due to the only sixth form college in Cumbria being located in the town) and this is the same for three schools in Allerdale and South Lakeland, and one in the other districts. Chetwynde is also the only school in Barrow to educate children from nursery all the way to year 11.\nColleges of further education in Cumbria include:\nThe University of Cumbria is one of the UK's newest universities, having been established in 2007. It is at present the only university based in Cumbria and has campuses across the county, together with Lancaster and London.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nThe M6 is the only motorway that runs through Cumbria. Kendal and Penrith are amongst its primary destinations. Further north it becomes the A74(M) at the border with Scotland north of Carlisle. Major A roads within Cumbria include:\nSeveral bus companies run services in Cumbria serving the main towns and villages in the county, with some services running to neighbouring areas such as Lancaster. Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire is the largest; it has depots in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Workington. Stagecoach's flagship X6 route connects Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in south Cumbria.\nAir.\nThere are only two airports in the county: Carlisle Lake District and Barrow/Walney Island. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are Blackpool, Manchester, Liverpool John Lennon and Teesside. North Cumbria is closer to Newcastle, Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow International.\nPorts.\nBarrow-in-Furness is one of the country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the Port of Barrow is only minor, operated by Associated British Ports alongside the Port of Silloth in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.\nRail.\nThe busiest railway stations in Cumbria are Carlisle, Barrow-in-Furness, Penrith and Oxenholme Lake District. The West Coast Main Line runs through the Cumbria countryside, adjacent to the M6 motorway. The Cumbrian Coast Line connects Barrow-in-Furness to Carlisle and is a vital link in the west of the county. Other railways in Cumbria are the Windermere Branch Line, most of the Furness Line and much of the Settle-Carlisle Railway.\nDemography.\nPopulation.\nCumbria's largest settlement and only city is Carlisle, in the north of the county. The largest town, Barrow-in-Furness, in the south, is slightly smaller. The county's population is largely rural: it has the second-lowest population density among English counties, and only five towns with over 20,000 people. Cumbria is one of the country's most ethnically homogeneous counties, with 95% categorised as White British (around 471,000 of the 500,000). The larger towns have ethnic makeups closer to the national average. The 2001 census indicated Christianity was the religion with the most adherents in the county.\n2010 ONS estimates placed the number of foreign-born (non-United Kingdom) people living in Cumbria at around 14,000 and foreign nationals at 6,000. Population trends indicate a gradual decline in younger demographics, with an increasing proportion of elderly residents. The 2001 UK Census showed the following most common countries of birth for residents of Cumbria that year:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nSettlements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSport.\nRunning.\nFell running is a popular sport in Cumbria, with an active calendar of competitions taking place throughout the year.\nCumbria is also home to several of the most active orienteering clubs in the UK as well as the Lakes 5 Days competition that takes place every four years.\nFootball codes.\nWorkington is home to the ball game known as Uppies and Downies, a traditional version of football, with its origins in medieval football or an even earlier form. Players from outside Workington also take part, especially fellow West Cumbrians from Whitehaven and Maryport.\nCumbria formerly had minor American football clubs, the Furness Phantoms (the club is now defunct, its last name was Morecambe Bay Storm) and the Carlisle Kestrels.\nAssociation.\nBarrow and Carlisle United are the only professional football teams in Cumbria. Carlisle United attract support from across Cumbria and beyond, with many Cumbrian \"ex-pats\" travelling to see their games, both home and away.\nWorkington\u2014who are always known locally as \"the reds\"\u2014are a well-supported non-league team, having been relegated from the Football League in the 1970s. Workington made a rapid rise up the non league ladder and in 2007/08 competed with Barrow in the Conference North. Barrow were then promoted to the Conference Premier in 2007/08. In 2020, Barrow were promoted to the Football League as a result of winning the National League.\nRugby codes.\nRugby union is popular in the county's north and east with teams such as Furness RUFC &amp; Hawcoat Park RUFC (South Cumbria), Workington RUFC (Workington Zebras), Whitehaven RUFC, Carlisle RUFC, Creighton RUFC, Aspatria RUFC, Wigton RUFC, Kendal RUFC, Kirkby Lonsdale RUFC, Keswick RUFC, Cockermouth RUFC, Upper Eden RUFC and Penrith RUFC.\nRugby league is a very popular sport in south and West Cumbria. Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington play in the Rugby League Championships. Amateur teams; Wath Brow Hornets, Askam, Egremont Rangers, Kells, Barrow Island, Hensingham and Millom play in the National Conference.\nBat-and-ball.\nCumbria County Cricket Club is one of the cricket clubs that constitute the National Counties in the English domestic cricket structure. The club, based in Carlisle, competes in the National Counties Cricket Championship and the NCCA Knockout Trophy. The club also play some home matches in Workington, as well as other locations. Cumbrian club cricket teams play in the North Lancashire and Cumbria League.\nCumbria is home to the Cartmel Valley Lions, an amateur baseball team based in Cartmel.\nWrestling.\nCumberland and Westmorland wrestling is an ancient and well-practised tradition in the county with a strong resemblance to Scottish Backhold.\nIn the 21st century Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling along with other aspects of Lakeland culture are practised at the Grasmere Sports and Show, an annual meeting held every year since 1852 on the August Bank Holiday.\nThe origin of this form of wrestling is a matter of debate, with some describing it as having evolved from Norse wrestling brought over by Viking invaders, while other historians associate it with the Cornish and Gouren styles indicating that it may have developed out of a longer-standing Celtic tradition.\nRacing.\nCumbria Kart Racing Club is based at the Lakeland Circuit, Rowrah, between Cockermouth and Egremont https://. The track is currently a venue for rounds of both major UK national karting championships https://. Formula One world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button both raced karts at Rowrah many times in the formative stages of their motor sport careers, while other F1 drivers, past and present, to have competed there include Johnny Herbert, Anthony Davidson, Allan McNish, Ralph Firman, Paul di Resta and David Coulthard, who hailed from just over the nearby Anglo-Scottish border and regarded Rowrah as his home circuit, becoming Cumbria Kart Racing Club Champion in 1985 in succession to McNish (di Resta also taking the CKRC title subsequently).\nWorkington Comets were a Workington-based professional speedway team, which competed in the British Speedway Championship.\nThe World Rally Championship team Ford World Rally Team were based in Cumbria until their withdrawal after the 2012 season. A successful team, they won the Championship for manufacturers three times. The M-Sport Ford World Rally Team succeeded this team and have since won the Championship for manufacturers in 2017.\nFood.\nCumbria is the UK county with the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants, with seven in this classification in the Great Britain and Ireland Michelin Guide of 2021. Traditional Cumbrian cuisine has been influenced by the spices and molasses that were imported into Whitehaven in the 18th century. The Cumberland sausage (which has a protected geographical status) is a well-recognised result of this. Other regional specialities include Herdwick mutton and the salt-marsh raised lamb of the Cartmel Peninsula.\nMedia.\nTwo evening newspapers are published daily in Cumbria. The \"News and Star\" focuses largely on Carlisle and the surrounding areas of north and west Cumbria, and the \"North-West Evening Mail\" is based in Barrow-in-Furness and covers news from across Furness and the South Lakes. The \"Cumberland and Westmorland Herald\" and \"The Westmorland Gazette\" are weekly newspapers based in Penrith and Kendal respectively. The Egremont 2Day newspaper, formerly Egremont Today when affiliated with the Labour Party, was a prominent monthly publication \u2013 founded by Peter Watson (and edited by him until his death in 2014) in 1990 until July 2018. In February 2020 The Herdwick News, run by the last editor of The Egremont 2Day, was launched and is an independent online news publication covering the county of Cumbria and the North West.\nDue to the size of Cumbria the county spans two television zones: BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border in the north and centre, and BBC North West and ITV Granada in the south. Heart North West, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland and Smooth Lake District are the most popular local radio stations throughout the county, with BBC Radio Cumbria being the only station that is aimed at Cumbria as a whole. BBC Radio Lancashire can also be received in southern parts of the county.\nCumbria is host to a number of festivals, including Kendal Calling (actually held in Penrith since 2009) and Kendal Mountain Festival.\nSymbols.\nThe county is represented by the Flag of Cumbria, also known as the Cumbria Community Flag. \nThe design features green and gold chevrons symbolising the county's hills, fells and farmland, \na blue field for its lakes, rivers and coastline, and a golden crown representing unity, heritage and civic pride.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the latter period, he was a paid commissioner of Sweden in the Netherlands and he played a dubious but key role in Peter Minuit's expedition that led to the Swedish colonizing of New Sweden. For years Blommaert was involved in the copper trade and industry. In 1645 he was appointed for a third time as a manager of the WIC, being one of the main investors from the beginning.\nEarly life.\nBlommaert was born in Antwerp, Duchy of Brabant, in current-day Belgium but grew up in London. He was the son of Margaretha Hoefnagel (\u20131585) and the wealthy goldsmith/merchant Lodewijk Blommaert (1537\u20131591), who in 1581 was schepen of Antwerp and in 1583 captain at Fort Lillo on the eastern border of the Scheldt; he knew the area very well as his ancestors came from Bergen-op-Zoom. His mother died when Samuel was young and his father moved the family to London when Antwerp was occupied in 1585 by the Duke of Parma. In 1587 he remarried Janneken van Hove but he died four years later. Samuel was apprenticed in Stade with his aunt Susanne, and in Vienna at his uncle Daniel. In 1601 he became \"poorter\" of Amsterdam. In 1602 he visited Benin.\nIn 1603, Samuel enlisted with the Dutch East India Company and traveled to the Dutch East Indies on a ship under admiral Steven van der Hagen. In the years 1605\u20131607 he stayed on Borneo. He was sent by the board (Jacques l'Hermite) to Sukadana West Kalimantan to free merchant Hans Roeff, who had died or left when Blommaert arrived. He returned to Bantam with 633 diamonds he was able to save at the trading post. In 1609/1610 he again stayed on Sambas, Borneo and was able to get a monopoly on diamond trade for the VOC. In September 1610, after seven years, he left sooner than expected and arrived in June 1611 at Texel. Pieter Both had to investigate the case. On 5 June 1612, he married the 22-years-old Catharina Reynst, a daughter of Gerard Reynst, governor of the East Indies. Both were living at Sint Antoniesbreestraat with whom he would have twelve children between 1613 and 1633; two died in an early age.\nEarly career.\nFor many years Blommaert was involved in a company which traded in copper from Angola and the African coast, together with Frans Jacobsz. Hinlopen, and Lucas van der Venne. In 1615 Jacob le Maire carried a letter from his father Isaac le Maire to be presented to Governor Reynst, with an offer to smuggle goods to his son-in-law in Amsterdam. Blommaert was investigated in Amsterdam by the board of the East-India Company on 30 January 1616 about a vessel, named \"Mauritius de Nassau\", sailed from a Dutch port, under the command of Jan Remmertszoon from Purmerend. The ship was ostensibly destined for Angola, but from there she was ordered to direct her course for \"Terra Australis.\" The plan, therefore, was, from the west coast of Africa to sail southward to Tierra del Fuego, and then &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"to explore the whole of the coast : as far as the Straits of Magellanes, on the chance of finding an opening that might allow a passage to the South-sea; and on such opening being found, to run into and through the same, in order to discover whether they could in such manner get into the South-sea; should such passage to the South-sea have been found, they had orders to return home forthwith, but in case adverse circumstances should prevent them from doing so, they were to run on for the East Indies.\"\nAround 1619 he settled on Keizersgracht and bought a lot (30x170 ft) where a new house was built, next to Laurens Reael. In 1620 Isaac Coymans, a broker, became his brother-in-law.\nNew Netherlands.\nBy 1621, he invested in the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch West India Company and was appointed director in October 1622. In 1623 he and Kiliaen van Rensselaer, Samuel Godijn en Albert Coenraetsz. Burgh were investigating the possibility of the slave trade in Angola. In 1624 his grandfather Jacob Hoefnagel became one of the three mayors in Gothenburg and president of the court of justice for a while. Louis de Geer received the official monopoly on the copper and iron trade in Sweden and decided to settle there. In 1627 Blommaert had an argument with Pieter Trip about 34 Swedish guns.\nIn 1628 he collaborated with Van Rensselaer, Godijn and Burgh. Godyn, Van Rensselaer and Samuel Blommaert sent two persons to New Netherland to inspect the country. Gilles Housset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper bargained with the natives for a tract of land reaching from Cape Henlopen to the mouth of the Delaware River. This was in 1629, three years before the charter of Maryland, and is the oldest deed for land in the state of Delaware. The purchase was ratified in 1630 by Peter Minuit and his council at Fort Amsterdam.\nA company was formed to colonize the tract that included Blommaert, Godin, Van Rensselaer, Joannes de Laet (a geographer), and David Pietersen de Vries. A ship of eighteen guns was fitted out to bring over the colonists and subsequently defend the coast, with incidental whale-fishing to help defray expenses. A colony of more than thirty souls was planted on Lewes creek, a little north of Cape Henlopen, and its governorship was entrusted to Gilles Housset. This settlement antedated by several years any in Pennsylvania, and the colony at Lewes practically laid the foundation and defined the singularly limited area of the state of Delaware, the major part of which was included in the purchase. A palisaded fort was built, with the \"red lion, rampant,\" of Holland affixed to its gate, and the country was named \"Swaanendael\" or Zwaanendael Colony, while the water was called Godyn's Bay. The estate was further extended, on 5 May 1630, by the purchase of a tract twelve miles square on the coast of Cape May opposite, and the transaction was duly attested at Fort Amsterdam.\nThe existence of the little colony was short, for the Indians came down upon it in revenge for an arbitrary act on the part of Housset, and it was destroyed, not a soul escaping to tell the tale. According to acknowledged precedent, occupancy of the wilderness served to perfect title; but before the Dutch could reoccupy the desolated site at Lewes, the English were practically in possession.\nBecause of the ongoing Polish\u2013Swedish War (1626\u20131629), no grain could be exported through the city of Dantzig. In 1630 the price of grain remained extremely high due to increasing competition. Albert Burgh tried to ensure a monopoly for the City of Amsterdam in Moscovy. In 1631 Blommaert bought rye in Arkhangelsk. Isaac Coymans, his brother-in-law, moved all his furniture to Keizersgracht 139 as Coymans was in trouble for embezzlement. In 1631 De Geer had a disagreement with his partner Elias Trip. The quarrel was resolved in 1634?\nNew Sweden.\nIn 1635, he started a brass factory in Nacka, outside Stockholm, to boost the export of copper which could be used for making guns and coins. Blommaert tried to attract workers and experts from Aachen and Stolberg. In 1636, Blommaert was reappointed as \"bewindhebber\" of the WIC after its first bankruptcy, but also became the consul for Sweden in Amsterdam. In 1636 the directors of the WIC could not gather because of an outbreak of plague. In 1637 Blommaert secretly invested money in the first Swedish expedition with \"Fogel Grip\" and \"Kalmar Nyckel\" to New Sweden. By doing so, he hoped to avoid paying the Dano-Norwegian Sound Tolls on all foreign merchantmen crossing the Sound. He engaged the former diamond cutter Peter Minuit to command the expedition, without the knowledge or permission of the WIC. Blommaert suggested to Oxenstierna to take part in the WIC, and organize from Gothenburg and trade on Spanish and Portuguese ports. Blommaert was interested in seizing Spanish ships, which sailed from the East or West-Indies to C\u00e1diz or Seville, to make his expeditions and colonization more profitable.\nIn November 1637 two ships belonging to the Swedish South Company with crew and settlers left Gothenburg. Because of a storm the ships could get around Scotland; after a month at sea one arrived at Texel the other at Medemblik. The damage was provisionally repaired; sails and victuals (butter, bread, and beer) needed to be bought. Having arrived on Swedes' Landing on 29 March Minuit acted as he had done before, he did not conquer the land by force but bought it legally from the Lenape or Minqua Indians. What happened next is not very clear. (It seems he was hardly involved in building Fort Christina). Minuit left the colony mid-June, 1638 and sailed to the Caribbean island of St. Christopher where he arrived in early July to barter salt, a ship's cargo of wine and liquor for tobacco. (Meanwhile Cornelis Jol attempted to capture the Spanish treasure fleet near Cuba with four ships but didn't succeed to the disappointment of Blommaert.) On 5 August 1638 Minuit drowned during a hurricane at St. Christopher (today's St. Kitts). About 20 ships drifted out of the harbour. One ship sank near the Azores, the \"Kalmar\" arrived without a mast. A second voyage, which departed on February7, 1640, and arrived at Fort Christina on April17, brought additional settlers for New Sweden. As the two expeditions turned out to be unprofitable for Blommaert, he withdrew in 1641.\nIn 1639 Blommaert and Isaac Coymans sold tobacco and sugar; they were accused of cheating as there were a couple of stones in one of the cases and problems with the tobacco. In 1640 Portuguese Restoration War improved the situation for the Dutch. Blommaert was involved in mining in Dutch Brazil. In 1641 the Zwaanendael Colony was sold to Sweden; all the participants agreed on an equal share. A ship with 211 slaves arrived in Brazil. In 1642 with collaborated with Jan Valkenburgh in Angola. In 1647 he and his wife were portrayed. He told professor Nicolaes Tulp, stories on bestiality he heard on Borneo. In 1651 Blommaert got ill. He died in Amsterdam on 23 December 1651 and was buried in Westerkerk. In 1655 his daughter Constantia (born 1626) married the admiral Isaac Sweers, Catharina married Abraham Elzevir and Anna moved to Malakka with her husband, director of the VOC.\nLegacy.\nBlommaert's thirty-eight letters to Axel Oxenstierna from 1635 to 1641 are of great importance to the history of New Sweden. They mention Willem Usselincx one of the founders of the WIC, who had moved to Gothenburg in 1624 and founded the Swedish South Company; dealt with the Dutch merchants. These letters were published in \"Repertorium Veterrimarum Societatum Litterariarum\" 1870\u20131879 of the Utrecht Historical Society and in \"Bijdragen en Mededeelingen\" (1908).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73026", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73026", "title": "Marie Bashkirtseff", "text": "Artist (1858\u20131884)\nMarie Bashkirtseff, born Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva (; 24 November\u00a0[O.S. 12 November]\u00a01858 \u2013 31 October 1884), was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist who was born into a noble family on their estate near the city of Poltava. She lived and worked in Paris, and died at the age of 25.\nLife and painting career.\nBashkirtseff was born in Gavrontsi (Havrontsi) near Poltava, Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), to a wealthy noble family. Her father was a local marshal of nobility, Konstantin Pavlovich Bashkirtsev. Her mother Maria Stepanovna Babanina (1833\u20141920) also belonged to Russian nobles. Her parents separated when she was 12. As a result, she grew up mostly abroad, traveling with her mother throughout most of Europe, with longer spells in Germany and on the Riviera, until the family settled in Paris. Educated privately and with early musical talent, she lost her chance at a career as a singer when illness destroyed her voice. She then determined to become an artist, and she studied painting in France at the Robert-Fleury studio and at the .\nThe Acad\u00e9mie, as one of the few establishments that accepted female students, attracted young women from all over Europe and the United States. Fellow students at the Acad\u00e9mie included Anna Bili\u0144ska and especially Louise Breslau, whom Bashkirtseff viewed as her only real rival. Bashkirtseff would go on to produce a remarkable, if fairly conventional, body of work in her short lifetime, exhibiting at the Paris Salon as early as 1880 and every year thereafter until her death (except 1883). In 1884, she exhibited a portrait of Paris slum children entitled \"The Meeting\" and a pastel portrait of her cousin, for which she received an honorable mention.\nBashkirtseff's best-known works are \"The Meeting\" (now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) and her 1881 \"In the Studio\", a portrait of her fellow artists at work. Although a large number of Bashkirtseff's works were destroyed by the Nazis during World War II, at least 60 survive. In 2000, a U.S. touring exhibition entitled \"Overcoming All the Obstacles: The Women of Academy Julian\" featured works by Bashkirtseff and her schoolmates.\nAs a painter, Bashkirtseff took her cue from her friend Jules Bastien-Lepage's admiration for realism and naturalism. Where Bastien-Lepage had found his inspiration in nature, Bashkirtseff turned to the urban scene, writing, \"I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien.\" By unlucky chance, both artists succumbed prematurely to chronic illness in the same year, and the later pages of Bashkirtseff's journal record her visits to the dying painter.\nDying of tuberculosis at the age of 25, Bashkirtseff lived just long enough to emerge as an intellectual in Paris in the 1880s. She wrote several articles for Hubertine Auclert's feminist newspaper \"La Citoyenne\" in 1881 under the nom de plume \"Pauline Orrel.\" One of her most-quoted sayings is \"Let us love dogs, let us love only dogs! Men and cats are unworthy creatures.\"\nBashkirtseff died in Paris in 1884, and she is buried in Cimeti\u00e8re de Passy, Paris. Her great friend Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch was present at her deathbed. Her monument is a full-sized artist's studio that has been declared a historic monument by the government of France. Marie Bashkirtseff was included in the 2018 exhibit \"Women in Paris 1850-1900\".\nDiary.\nFrom approximately the age of 13, Bashkirtseff kept a journal, and it is probably for this that she is most famous today. It has been called \"a strikingly modern psychological self-portrait of a young, gifted mind\", and her urgent prose, which occasionally breaks out into dialogue, remains extremely readable. She was multilingual and despite her self-involvement, was a keen observer with an acute ear for hypocrisy, so that her journal also offers a near-novelistic account of the late nineteenth century European bourgeoisie. A consistent theme throughout her journal is her deep desire to achieve fame, inflected by her increasing fear that her intermittent illnesses might turn out to be tuberculosis. In a prefatory section written toward the end of her life, in which she recounts her family history, she writes, \"If I do not die young I hope to live as great artist; but if I die young, I intend to have my journal, which cannot fail to be interesting, published.\" Similarly: \"When I am dead, my life, which appears to me a remarkable one, will be read. (The only thing wanting is that it should have been different).\" In effect, the first half of Bashkirtseff's journal is a coming-of-age story while the second is an account of heroic suffering.\nBashkirtseff's journal was first published in 1887, and was only the second diary by a woman published in France to that date. It was an immediate success, not least because its cosmopolitan confessional style was a marked departure from the contemplative, mystical diaries of the writer Eug\u00e9nie de Gu\u00e9rin that had been published in 1862. An English translation appeared two years later under the title \"Marie Bashkirtseff: The Journal of a Young Artist 1860\u20131884\". Translated by Mary J. Serrano, it was heavily abridged and bowdlerized, her relatives seeing to it that a good deal of material they considered unflattering to the family was removed.\nBritish Prime Minister William Gladstone referred to her journal as \"a book without a parallel\", and another early admirer was George Bernard Shaw. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read the original French version over eight days in June 1890. It remained popular, eventually spinning off both plays and movies based on her life story, including \"The Affairs of Maupassant\", directed by Henry Koster and released in the United States in 1938. Her diary was cited as an inspiration by the American writer Mary MacLane, whose own shockingly confessional diary was written a bare generation later, and it was mentioned as a model by later writers who became known for their diaries, including Pierre Lou\u00ffs, Katherine Mansfield, W.N.P. Barbellion, and Anais Nin.\nHer letters, consisting of her correspondence with the writer Guy de Maupassant (which she had begun under an assumed name) were first published in 1891.\nUntil recently the accepted date of Bashkirtseff's birth was 11 November [23 November New Style], 1860. After the discovery of the original manuscript of Bashkirtseff's journal in the , however, it was found that her journal had been abridged and censored by her family in its first editions. Her date of birth (1858 not 1860) was falsified by her mother to make Bashkirtseff appear even more precocious. An unabridged edition of the complete journal, based on the original manuscript, has been published in French in 16 volumes, and excerpts from the years 1873\u20131876 have been translated into English under the title \"I Am the Most Interesting Book of All\" (see editions listed below).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73034", "revid": "40892312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73034", "title": "Natalia Brasova", "text": "Russian noblewoman\nNatalia Brasova, Countess Brasova (; born Natalia Sergeyevna Sheremetyevskaya, ; 27 June 1880 \u2013 23 January 1952) was a Russian noblewoman who married, as her third husband, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia.\nEarly life.\nNatalia, or Natasha to her friends, was the youngest of three daughters of a Moscow lawyer, Sergei Alexandrovich Sheremetevsky. She was born at a rented summer \"dacha\" at Perovo, on the outskirts of Moscow. Sheremetevsky employed 11 other lawyers, and was a member of the minor Russian nobility, but had no title and was essentially a professional middle-class man. He was a sometime deputy in the Moscow City Duma, and a trustee of the Arbat City School. In the first year of her life, Natalia and her family lived in a rented apartment near the Moscow Kremlin on Ilinka. Their landlord, wealthy industrialist Aleksey Khludov, was also Natalia's godfather. From 1881 to 1893, the family lived at 7 Serebriany Lane, a single-storied wooden house owned by Sheremetevsky. From 1893, the family lived in a succession of rented apartments until Natalia left home on her marriage. She was educated at a private school, and by a French governess employed by her father.\nFirst marriage.\nIn 1902, she married Sergei Mamontov (1 October 1877, Moscow \u2013 30 December 1939, Tallinn), a nephew of Savva Mamontov. Sergei was a rehearsal accompanist for Savva Mamontov's Opera Company, which was renamed Association of Russian Opera after Savva's bankruptcy in 1899, and later at the Bolshoi Theatre. Through her first husband's connections, Natalia became friendly with noted musicians such as Sergei Rachmaninoff and Feodor Chaliapin. The couple moved into 13 Mansurovsky Lane, a new apartment building near the fashionable Prechistenka Street, and had a daughter, Natalia or \"Tata\" to the family, on 2 June 1903. Sergei had a stammer and was of a retiring disposition, but Natalia was keen to socialise. Finding him socially dull, she began to go out unaccompanied by her husband. Russian divorce law followed the teachings of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and in practice divorce was only possible in cases of adultery where the husband was the guilty party. In 1905, Sergei agreed to a divorce and to act in the proceedings as if he was the unfaithful partner. Now free from her first husband, Natalia married her lover, cavalry officer Vladimir Vladimirovich Wulfert ().\nSecond marriage.\nNatalia and Wulfert had known each other as children, but only fell in love after re-meeting in Moscow when Wulfert was on leave. He was an army officer serving in The Dowager Empress's Life Guard Cuirassier Regiment, known as the Blue Cuirassiers from the colour of their uniforms, stationed at Gatchina near Saint Petersburg. Natalia and Wulfert set up home at 7 Baggout Street, Gatchina.\nIn early December 1907, Natalia was introduced to one of her husband's fellow officers in the Blue Cuirassiers: Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, the brother of Tsar Nicholas II. The following month, they met again at the Regimental Winter Ball. From then on, they began to see each other regularly, though Michael was always careful to include Wulfert in his letters and invitations, at least until October 1908, and use the formal form of \"you\" (\"vy\") rather than the familiar one (\"ty\"). Rumours of their affair spread through the regiment, and Wulfert grew resentful. Michael began sending her secret letters to a separate postal address, now writing to her in familiar terms, and Wulfert grew physically violent, as Natalia refused to share his bed. In July 1909, privately in a letter, she accused her husband of rape. She packed luggage, and with her daughter, an elderly female cousin, and two maids, she left Wulfert for a break abroad in Switzerland. Both Michael and Wulfert turned up at the train station to see her off, and Wulfert created a scene by loudly accusing her of ruining him.\nThrough Baron Frederiks, the court minister, Michael tried to buy off Wulfert by offering him a post in Moscow as aide-de-camp to Prince Odoevsky-Maslov at the Kremlin. Wulfert threatened to commit suicide if Natalia did not return to him, and then challenged Michael to a duel. Nicholas II intervened, and transferred Michael from the Blue Cuirassiers to the Chernigov Hussars at Orel, from Saint Petersburg. In August 1909, Michael went to Denmark with his mother, and arranged for Natalia to meet him there. They were reunited in a hotel in Copenhagen, unbeknownst to his mother, and consummated their relationship for the first time.\nRoyal mistress.\nWulfert accepted the Kremlin post, at an enlarged salary, and as Natalia's residence permit was tied to her husband's she also returned to Moscow to live temporarily at a hotel opposite the Kremlin. By November, she was living in an eight-room apartment at 36 Petersburg Road, paid for by Michael, where he visited her about three times a month from Orel. Wulfert was still demanding that Natalia return to him, as well as threatening to shoot her. Against the wishes of Michael and Natalia, Nicholas II insisted that she remain in Moscow, and refused to vary the conditions of her residence permit.\nBy December 1909, Natalia was pregnant. Fearful that her husband would try to claim the child and take it away from her, her desire for a divorce grew stronger. Eventually, after prolonged negotiations and a hefty pay-off (200,000 rubles), Wulfert agreed to a divorce on the pretence that he had been unfaithful. Natalia's divorce petition was submitted to the Moscow Ecclesiastical Consistory Court on 19 February 1910, but by July 1910 it had not been granted. When she gave birth to a son on 24 July 1910, the child was legally Wulfert's. The boy was named George in honour of Michael's late brother. It was said that Wulfert was bought off with a bribe of 200,000 roubles, and the date of their divorce was back-dated, so that George was recognised as Natalia's illegitimate son, though inheriting her noble status, rather than the legitimate child of Wulfert's.\nIn May 1911, Nicholas II granted Natalia the surname \"Brasova\" and the right to live at Michael's estate at Brasovo, from his posting at Orel. Michael, Natalia and her two children moved there immediately. By the end of the year, Michael was posted to a command in Saint Petersburg, and they moved to the capital. He officially lived in regimental quarters while paying for a 28-room apartment at 16 Liteyny Prospekt for her. She felt trapped in the apartment, feared that her letters were opened, and was ostracised by society. After a few months, Michael moved her to a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya, Gatchina, nearer to his base at the Gatchina Palace.\nThird marriage.\nJust as they had done for the previous two years, in summer 1912, Michael and Natalia holidayed in Western Europe. After shaking off agents of Nicholas II's secret police, the Okhrana, Michael and Natalia married in Vienna on 16 October 1912 in a Serbian Orthodox Church. They had successfully planned the wedding without either Nicholas II's or the Okhrana's knowledge. On their eventual arrival in Cannes, after a few days travelling through Venice and Milan, Natalia's two children joined them from Russia. The Grand Duke wrote to his brother, the Tsar, to inform him of the marriage, but because Natalia was divorced and not of royal blood the Tsar refused to approve it. Michael was perceived by the court as being \"under the hypnotic influence of a malicious vamp\". Nicholas II said Natalia was \"such a cunning, wicked beast that it's disgusting even to talk about her\". Michael was removed from the imperial succession, his property was put under sequestration and exiled from Russia in disgrace. Though members of society felt some sympathy for Michael, thinking his punishment severe, there was little sympathy for Natalia. Despite marrying a Grand Duke, she was not entitled to be known as \"Grand Duchess\", and instead used the style \"Madame\" or \"Countess Brasova\".\nUntil September 1913, they stayed in hotels throughout Europe, without any decrease in their standard of living. They met Michael's sister Grand Duchess Xenia and cousin Grand Duke Andrew, and in July 1913, they saw Michael's mother in London who told Natalia \"a few home truths\" according to Xenia's diary. From September 1913, they leased an English country house, Knebworth, north of London. Natalia acted as hostess for any of their guests, which included her friend Chaliapin, the Ballets Russes, and the artist Serge Sudeikin. As a divorc\u00e9e, however, Natalia was often excluded from invitations to social events elsewhere; the divorced were not received at court and could not enter the Royal Enclosure at Ascot.\nWar.\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, Michael requested Nicholas II's permission to return home and to the army, with the understanding his wife and children could accompany him. Nicholas agreed and the family returned to the house on Nikolaevskaya street; Natalia was still not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces. Michael was appointed to the rank of major-general, and given command of the \"Savage Division\" (\u0414\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0414\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u044f) formed from Chechens, Ingushes and Daghestani. The post was perceived as a relatively low position in the Army, and was believed to be Nicholas II's punishment for Michael's marriage.\nAs was expected of women in the imperial family, Natalia founded two hospitals for wounded soldiers and officers, one at Gatchina and one at Saint Petersburg, in properties owned by Michael. In January 1915, her sister Olga died in Moscow, and she went there for the funeral. In February 1915, her eldest sister Vera also died.\nAt her hotel in Moscow, Michael's cousin Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia declared that he was in love with her. Natalia referred to Dmitri as \"Lily-of-the-Valley\". Dmitri had a reputation as a rake, though Natalia was flattered, she turned him down and told her husband of the encounter. Michael was jealous about Natalia's feelings for Dmitri: \"What you are writing to me about Lily-of-the-Valley, i.e., how tenderly, tenderly you love him and also that he comes to see you because he likes you and totally succumbed to your charm and besides, you say that conquering such a heart means much to you\u2014I believe that if you just stop to consider the meaning of these several sentences you have written, you will realise what pain you have given me by writing them.\" Natalia told Michael, \"Believe me, my affection for him does not in the least interfere with my love for you.\"\nIn March 1915, Nicholas II agreed to legitimise George, and grant him the style of Count Brasov, although George still held no claim to the throne. While George was recognized as a count of the Empire, it appears that no such dignity was accorded Natalia. Natalia's social circle expanded as more people began to accept her. As the war began to go badly for the Russians, Natalia was dismayed by the change in Michael's appearance as he abandoned his smart uniforms and decorations and wore a plain uniform with his muddy boots. Michael was \"deeply upset\" by Natalia's criticisms of his decision to be in the frontline of the war. He wrote to her, \"the present time is so hard for Russia that my conscience could not allow me \"not\" to join the frontline service \u2013 and I am convinced that having done that, I also brought you some good in terms of public opinion, which, unfortunately, we can't totally ignore.\"\nNatalia's social circle widened to include deputies in the Duma, and she was perceived as a liberal who supported a constitutional monarchy rather than the Tsar's autocracy. The Tsarina, Alexandra, even feared that Natalia was conspiring to make Michael Emperor. The Tsarina and Dowager Empress still would not accept Natalia. A portrait of her in a Kiev hospital she had funded with her own money was hidden by hospital staff for a visit by the Dowager Empress, and Alexandra had an exhibition of photographs of Michael and Natalia cleared by the imperial police. Natalia was depressed by the snubs, and by her separation from Michael, who was still at the front. In September 1916, they reunited at Mogilev, and spent time at Brasovo and Gatchina for the next six weeks, until Michael fell ill with stomach ulcers. They moved to the Crimea for Michael's recuperation. Christmas 1916 was spent at Brasovo as a family, where Natalia's daughter was \"thrilled to the core\" to hear that Dimitri had helped murder Rasputin, Tsarina Alexandra's self-styled spiritual mentor.\nRevolution.\nAfter the February Revolution in 1917, Nicholas abdicated in Michael's favour, but Michael refused to accept the throne until ratified by the will of the people through the Constituent Assembly. By naming Michael as his successor, Nicholas effectively reversed the long-standing law that morganatically married dynasts forfeited rights of succession, but his actions were ultimately irrelevant. Power lay with the revolutionaries, not with the Tsar, whether it was Nicholas or Michael. Michael and his family were placed under house arrest in Gatchina.\nIn September 1917, the house arrest was lifted. At the end of the following month the Prime Minister, Alexander Kerensky, was deposed in the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks seized power. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former army colleague of Michael's who held a command in Saint Petersburg, the family planned to move to the greater safety of Finland. Valuables were packed and the children were moved to an estate south of Gatchina owned by Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, the brother of one of Natalia's closest friends (Nadine Vonlyarlarskaya) and the father of the famous writer, Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov. The Bolsheviks discovered their plan, however, and their escape was blocked. The children returned to Gatchina, and they were once again under house arrest. Natalia managed to gain access to her safety deposit box, by claiming that she needed to examine some papers at the bank, and thus retrieved as much of her jewellery as she could conceal without arousing suspicion. The house arrest was lifted in November, but on 7 March 1918 Michael and Nicholas Johnson\u2014who had been his secretary since December 1912\u2014were re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police. They were imprisoned at Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute.\nNatalia visited Michael the next two days, 8 and 9 March 1918, with their friend Princess Putyatina. On 9 March, she barged her way into Lenin's office, which was in the same building, to remonstrate with him. In the evening, the Council of the People's Commissars decided to send Michael and Johnson into internal exile. On 11 March, they were sent a thousand miles eastwards to the remote city of Perm.\nConcerned for her entire family's safety, Natalia made plans for the children to be taken abroad. With the help of the Danish embassy, which was next-door to Princess Puyatina's apartment, George was smuggled out of the country to Denmark by his governess, Miss Margaret Neame. The Danes extended diplomatic protection to the villa in Gatchina by pretending to rent it and flying the Danish flag over the house. Natalia wanted to join Michael in Perm, and after repeated pleading received a travel permit to join him. They spent about a week together, until an army of disgruntled Czechs advanced on Perm. The Bolsheviks had attempted to ship prisoners-of-war from Austria-Hungary out of Russia, ethnic Czech troops amongst them. The Czechs, however, were not going home to fight once more for the Austrian empire, but to fight for a separate independent homeland. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, with the result that the Czech forces joined with the White Army, fighting against the Bolsheviks. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped in Perm, possibly in a dangerous situation, and so on 18 May she left for Moscow.\nIn Moscow, Natalia continued to badger Bolshevik Commissars, including Lenin, Trotsky and Sverdlov, for Michael's release, but to no avail. In June 1918, her husband and Johnson were shot by their captors on the outskirts of Perm. To cover their tracks, the Perm authorities distributed a concocted story that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Natalia went to Uritsky in a quest for an explanation, but Uritsky ordered her arrest and incarceration. The Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. Natalia heard the rumours in prison, and chose to believe them. Ten weeks after her imprisonment, in early September, Natalia pretended that she had developed tuberculosis, and was moved to a nursing home. Once there, she escaped and took refuge in the apartment above her brother-in-law's with family friend Princess Vyazemskaya. Uritsky had been murdered in late August, and the Bolsheviks were terrorising Petrograd in what was later called the Red Terror. Natalia's daughter, \"Tata\", was arrested and imprisoned, but released after a few days when it became apparent she had no knowledge of her mother's whereabouts. With no money or food, \"Tata\" made her way to her uncle's apartment, and so was fortuitously re-united with her mother.\nExile.\nThe Germans believed the widespread rumours that Michael was still alive, and plotted to rescue Natalia from Russia in an attempt to gain influence with Michael. Through the German-controlled Ukrainian consulate, Natalia and her daughter were provided with false passports. Natalia's daughter used her own name, while Natalia's passport was in the name of a nun called Frau Tania Klenow. They travelled separately to Kiev, with Natalia disguised as a nun. They were still in Kiev when the war ended with Germany's defeat on 11 November 1918. German authority began to collapse. Natalia and her daughter, along with Princess Vyazemskaya and Natalia's widowed brother-in-law Aleksei Matveev, who had both made it to Kiev as well, fled to Odessa in the hope they could escape by sea. Two British naval vessels at the port, HMS \"Nereide\" and HMS \"Skirmisher\", provided them with sanctuary. Aboard HMS \"Nereide\" they were evacuated to Constantinople.\nBy way of HMS \"Agamemnon\" to Malta, merchant ship to Marseille, and rail to Paris, Natalia arrived in England. Johnson's widowed mother had leased a house, Snape in Wadhurst, Sussex, for Michael's family, and all the furniture and furnishings stored at Paddockhurst were moved in. George arrived from Copenhagen with his nanny in spring 1919, and was sent to an English boarding school. Natalia's daughter, Natalia Mamontova, was enrolled at a convent school in France. For funds, Natalia used money in Michael's bank accounts in Paris and Copenhagen, and started selling her jewellery. She met Michael's mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, who had also escaped Russia, in London, and their meeting this time was courteous. Conflicting rumours about Michael's fate and whereabouts continued without any solid news. In 1920, \"Tata\" was sent to Cheltenham Ladies' College and George was enrolled at Harrow School. Natalia moved out of Snape as the lease ended, and moved to Percy Lodge near Richmond, Surrey.\nOn 12 August 1921, 18-year-old Natalia Mamontova married future BBC broadcaster Val Gielgud, against her mother's wishes and without her foreknowledge. Natalia Mamontova was on school break and returned home as if nothing had happened. When Natalia found out, she ordered her daughter out of her house. Natalia left Percy Lodge and moved into an apartment in Kensington. The Gielguds divorced in 1923, and Natalia Mamontova married composer and music critic Cecil Gray.\nBy 1924, there was still no sign of Michael, and Natalia had him declared legally dead on 5 July 1924. She inherited his estate in Britain, which was valued at a mere \u00a395. The following month, Michael's cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, declared himself Emperor on the basis that he had inherited the throne at the moment of the previous Emperor's death, despite the abolition of the Russian monarchy by the communists. In 1928, he gave Natalia the title of Princess, followed in 1935 by the style \"Her Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaya-Brasova\". He made George a Prince. Cyril's claim to the throne was met with opposition from within the Romanov family because at his birth his mother was a Lutheran and not a member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Furthermore, Cyril had married Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who was a divorc\u00e9e and his first cousin, without the Emperor's consent. The House law that determined the Russian line of succession excluded princes born to non-Orthodox mothers, and princes who married without the Tsar's consent. The Russian Orthodox Church did not recognise Victoria's divorce from her first husband as valid, and did not permit marriage between first cousins. Cyril's title, and by extension Natalia's and George's, were only recognised by Cyril's supporters.\nDecline.\nTo save money, in 1927 Natalia moved to Paris where living costs were lower than in London. George joined her in France, but he was killed after a car accident in 1931. She was at his bedside when he died, though he had not regained consciousness after the crash. She was emotionally devastated. Natalia's granddaughter, Pauline Gray, was born in 1929, but the Grays' marriage also ended in divorce. Natalia Mamontova's third and last marriage was to naval officer Michael Majolier, with whom she had a second daughter, Alexandra, born in 1934.\nNatalia continued attempts to recover Michael's assets. The Polish government had seized Michael's Polish estate, and Natalia sued them for its return or compensation. By the Peace of Riga, the Poles were entitled to any imperial property in the former Russian Poland, but Natalia pointed out that Michael was already dead before the Peace, and so any of Michael's property in Poland was legally hers, as a commoner. In 1937, the court ruled against her. In 1938, she did receive a pay-out from the German courts, when the Tsar's estate in Germany was shared between all his heirs, but hyper-inflation had reduced its value. She continued to sell anything she could in a desperate attempt to raise cash.\nDuring World War II, Natalia and her daughter were separated as Natalia lived in Paris, and her daughter was in Britain. They were unable to communicate with each other until after the war, by which time Natalia was penniless and lived as a refugee in an attic box-room. On 23 January 1952, she died of cancer at the La\u00ebnnec charity hospital in Paris in complete poverty, and was buried in Passy Cemetery (Section 9, near the intersection with the outer wall and Section 8) in Paris beside her son George, Count Brasov.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are associated with specific expansion cards, video connectors, and monitors. \nHistory.\nVarious computer display standards or display modes have been used in the history of the personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a display adapter. Earlier display adapters were simple frame-buffers, but later display standards also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface.\nBeyond display modes, the VESA industry organization has defined several standards related to power management and device identification, while ergonomics standards are set by the TCO.\nStandards.\nA number of common resolutions have been used with computers descended from the original IBM PC. Some of these are now supported by other families of personal computers. These are de facto standards, usually originated by one manufacturer and reverse-engineered by others, though the VESA group has co-ordinated the efforts of several leading video display adapter manufacturers. Video \"standards\" associated with IBM-PC-descended personal computers are shown in the diagram and table below, alongside those of early Macintosh and other makes for comparison. (From the early 1990s onwards, most manufacturers moved over to PC display standards thanks to widely available and affordable hardware).\nDisplay resolution prefixes.\nAlthough the common standard prefixes \"super\" and \"ultra\" do not indicate specific modifiers to base standard resolutions, several others do:\nA quarter of the base resolution. E.g. QVGA, a term for a resolution, half the width and height of VGA, hence the quarter total resolution. The \"Q\" prefix usually indicates \"Quad\" (4 times as many, not 1/4 times as many) in higher resolutions, and sometimes \"q\" is used instead of \"Q\" to specify \"quarter\" (by analogy with SI prefixes m/M), but this usage is not consistent.\nThe base resolution increased by increasing the width and keeping the height constant, for square or near-square pixels on a widescreen display, usually with an aspect ratio of either 16:9 (adding an extra 1/3rd width vs a standard 4:3 display) or 16:10 (adding an extra 1/5th). However, it is sometimes used to denote a resolution that would have roughly the same total pixel count as this, but in a different aspect and sharing neither the horizontal OR vertical resolution\u2014typically for a 16:10 resolution which is narrower but taller than the 16:9 option, and therefore larger in both dimensions than the base standard (e.g., compare and , both commonly labelled as WXGA, vs the base XGA).\nFour times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. twice the horizontal and vertical resolution respectively.\nSixteen times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. four times the horizontal and vertical resolutions respectively.\nVaguer terms denoting successive incremental steps up the resolution ladder from some comparative, more established base, usually somewhat less severe a jump than quartering or Quadrupling\u2014typically less than doubling, and sometimes not even as much of a change as making a \"wide\" version; for example SVGA ( vs ), SXGA ( vs ), SXGA+ ( vs ) and UXGA ( vs - or more fittingly, vs the of SXGA, the conceptual \"next step down\" at the time of UXGA's inception, or the of SXGA+). Given the use of \"X\" in \"XGA\", it is not often used as an additional modifier (e.g. there is no such thing as XVGA except as an alternative designation for SXGA) unless its meaning would be unambiguous.\nThese prefixes are also often combined, as in WQXGA or WHUXGA, with levels of stacking not hindered by the same consideration towards readability as the decline of the added \"X\" - especially as there is not even a defined hierarchy or value for S/X/U/+ modifiers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term can now refer to the computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector, or the resolution characteristic of the VGA hardware.\nVGA was the last IBM graphics standard to which the majority of IBM PC compatible computer manufacturers conformed, making it the lowest common denominator that virtually all post-1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement.\nVGA was adapted into many extended forms by third parties, collectively known as Super VGA, then gave way to custom graphics processing units which, in addition to their proprietary interfaces and capabilities, continue to implement common VGA graphics modes and interfaces to the present day.\nThe VGA analog interface standard has been extended to support resolutions of up to for general usage, with specialized applications improving it further still.\nHardware design.\nThe color palette random access memory (RAM) and its corresponding digital-to-analog converter (DAC) were integrated into one chip (the RAMDAC) and the cathode-ray tube controller (CRTC) was integrated into a main VGA chip, which eliminated several other chips in previous graphics adapters, so VGA only additionally required external video RAM and timing crystals.\nThis small part count allowed IBM to include VGA directly on the PS/2 motherboard, in contrast to prior IBM PC models\u00a0\u2013 PC, PC/XT, and PC AT\u00a0\u2013 which required a separate display adapter installed in a slot in order to connect a monitor. The term \"array\" rather than \"adapter\" in the name denoted that it was not a complete independent expansion device, but a single component that could be integrated into a system.\nUnlike the graphics adapters that preceded it (MDA, CGA, EGA and many third-party options) there was initially no discrete VGA card released by IBM. The first commercial implementation of VGA was a built-in component of the IBM PS/2, in which it was accompanied by 256\u00a0KiB of video RAM, and a new DE-15 connector replacing the DE-9 used by previous graphics adapters. IBM later released the standalone \"IBM PS/2 Display Adapter\", which utilized the VGA but could be added to machines that did not have it built in.\nOn some machines and cables, pin 9 was missing. Pin 9's purpose is to power an EEPROM chip in the monitor which tells the graphics card the capabilities on the monitor. Systems or cables missing this are likely using an older version of VGA.\nCapabilities.\nThe VGA supports all graphics modes supported by the MDA, CGA and EGA cards, as well as multiple new modes.\nStandard graphics modes.\nThe 16-color and 256-color modes had fully redefinable palettes, with each entry selected from an 18-bit (262,144-color) gamut.\nThe other modes defaulted to standard EGA or CGA compatible palettes and instructions, but still permitted remapping of the palette with VGA-specific commands.\ngraphics mode.\nThe resolution (at 256 colors rather than 16) was originally used by IBM in PGC graphics (which VGA offers no backward compatibility for) but did not see wide adoption until VGA was introduced. As the VGA began to be cloned in great quantities by manufacturers who added ever-increasing capabilities, its , 16-color mode became the de facto lowest common denominator of graphics cards. By the mid 1990s, a \u00d716 graphics mode using the VGA memory and register specifications was expected by operating systems such as Windows 95 and OS/2 Warp 3.0, which provided no support for lower resolutions or bit depths, or support for other memory or register layouts without additional drivers. Well into the 2000s, even after the VESA standard for graphics cards became commonplace, the \"VGA\" graphics mode remained a compatibility option for PC operating systems.\nOther graphics modes.\nNonstandard display modes can be implemented, with horizontal resolutions of:\nAnd heights of:\nFor example, high resolution modes with square pixels are available at or in 16 colors, or medium-low resolution at with 256 colors. Alternatively, extended resolution is available with \"fat\" pixels and 256 colors using, e.g. (50\u00a0Hz) or (60\u00a0Hz), and \"thin\" pixels, 16 colors and the 70\u00a0Hz refresh rate with e.g. mode.\n\"Narrow\" modes such as tend to preserve the same pixel ratio as in e.g. mode unless the monitor is adjusted to stretch the image out to fill the screen, as they are derived simply by masking down the wider mode instead of altering pixel or line timings, but can be useful for reducing memory requirements and pixel addressing calculations for arcade game conversions or console emulators.\nThe PC version of Pinball Fantasies has the option to use non-standard, \"high res\" modes, such as , allowing it to display a larger portion of the pinball table on screen. The game Scorched Earth uses a default resolution of , with many other nonstandard resolutions available.\nStandard text modes.\nVGA also implements several text modes:\nAs with the pixel-based graphics modes, additional text modes are possible by programming the VGA correctly, with an overall maximum of about cells and an active area spanning about cells.\nOne variant that is sometimes seen is or , using an or font and an effective pixel display, which trades use of the more flickery 60\u00a0Hz mode for an additional 5 or 10 lines of text and square character blocks (or, at , square half-blocks).\nTechnical details.\nUnlike the cards that preceded it, which used binary TTL signals to interface with a monitor (and also composite, in the case of the CGA), the VGA introduced a video interface using pure analog RGB signals, with a range of 0.7 volts peak-to-peak max. In conjunction with a 18-bit RAMDAC (6-bit per RGB channel), this produced a color gamut of 262,144 colors.\nThe original VGA specifications follow:\nSignal timings.\nThe intended standard value for the horizontal frequency of VGA's mode is exactly double the value used in the NTSC-M video system, as this made it much easier to offer optional TV-out solutions or external VGA-to-TV converter boxes at the time of VGA's development. It is also at least nominally twice that of CGA, which also supported composite monitors.\nAll \"derived\" VGA timings (i.e. those which use the master 25.175 and 28.322\u00a0MHz crystals and, to a lesser extent, the nominal 31.469\u00a0kHz line rate) can be varied by software that bypasses the VGA firmware interface and communicates directly with the VGA hardware, as many MS-DOS based games did. However, only the standard modes, or modes that at least use almost exactly the same H-sync and V-sync timings as one of the standard modes, can be expected to work with the original late-1980s and early-1990s VGA monitors. The use of other timings may in fact damage such monitors and thus was usually avoided by software publishers.\nThird-party \"multisync\" CRT monitors were more flexible, and in combination with \"super EGA\", VGA, and later SVGA graphics cards using extended modes, could display a much wider range of resolutions and refresh rates at arbitrary sync frequencies and pixel clock rates.\nFor the most common VGA mode (, 60\u00a0Hz, non-interlaced), the horizontal timings can be found in the HP Super VGA Display Installation Guide and in other places.\nTypical uses of selected modes.\n @ 70\u00a0Hz is traditionally the video mode used for booting VGA-compatible x86 personal computers that show a graphical boot screen, while text-mode boot uses @ 70\u00a0Hz.\nThis convention has been eroded in recent years, however, with POST and BIOS screens moving to higher resolutions, taking advantage of EDID data to match the resolution to a connected monitor.\n @ 60\u00a0Hz is the default Windows graphics mode (usually with 16\u00a0colors), up to Windows 2000. It remains an option in XP via the boot menu \"low resolution video\" option and per-application compatibility mode settings, despite newer versions of Windows now defaulting to and generally not allowing any resolution below to be set.\nThe need for such a low-quality, universally compatible fallback has diminished since the turn of the millennium, as .\n at 70\u00a0Hz was the most common mode for early 1990's PC games, with pixel-doubling and line-doubling performed in hardware to present a at 70\u00a0Hz signal to the monitor.\nThe Windows 95/98/Me LOGO.SYS boot-up image was 320\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400 resolution, displayed with pixel-doubling to present a at 70\u00a0Hz signal to the monitor. The 400-line signal was the same as the standard text mode, which meant that pressing to return to text mode didn't change the frequency of the video signal, and thus the monitor did not have to resynchronize (which could otherwise have taken several seconds).\nConnector.\nThe standard VGA monitor interface is a 15-pin D-subminiature connector in the \"E\" shell, variously referred to as \"DE-15\", \"HD-15\" and erroneously \"DB-15(HD)\".\nAll VGA connectors carry analog RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals. Modern connectors also include VESA DDC pins, for identifying attached display devices.\nBecause VGA uses low-voltage analog signals, signal degradation becomes a factor with low-quality or overly long cables. Solutions include shielded cables, cables that include a separate internal coaxial cable for each color signal, and \"broken out\" cables utilizing a separate coaxial cable with a BNC connector for each color signal.\nBNC breakout cables typically use five connectors, one each for Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync, and do not include the other signal lines of the VGA interface. With BNC, the coaxial wires are fully shielded end-to-end and through the interconnect so that virtually no crosstalk and very little external interference can occur. The use of BNC RGB video cables predates VGA in other markets and industries.\nColor palette.\nThe VGA color system uses register-based palettes to map colors in various bit depths to its 18-bit output gamut. It is backward compatible with the EGA and CGA adapters, but supports extra bit depth for the palette when in these modes.\nFor instance, when in EGA 16-color modes, VGA offers 16 palette registers, and in 256-color modes, it offers 256 registers. Each palette register contains a 3\u00d76 bit RGB value, selecting a color from the 18-bit gamut of the DAC.\nThese color registers are initialized to default values IBM expected to be most useful for each mode. For instance, EGA 16-color modes initialize to the default CGA 16-color palette, and the 256-color mode initializes to a palette consisting of 16 CGA colors, 16 grey shades, and then 216 colors chosen by IBM to fit expected use cases.\nAfter initialization they can be redefined at any time without altering the contents of video RAM, permitting palette cycling.\nIn the 256-color modes, the DAC is set to combine four 2-bit color values, one from each plane, into an 8-bit-value representing an index into the 256-color palette. The CPU interface combines the 4 planes in the same way, a feature called \"chain-4\", so that each pixel appears to the CPU as a packed 8-bit value representing the palette index.\nUse.\nThe video memory of the VGA is mapped to the PC's memory via a window in the range between segments 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF in the PC's real mode address space (A000:0000 and B000:FFFF in segment:offset notation). Typically, these starting segments are:\nA typical VGA card also provides this port-mapped I/O segment:\nDue to the use of different address mappings for different modes, it is possible to have a monochrome adapter (i.e. MDA or Hercules) and a color adapter such as the VGA, EGA, or CGA installed in the same machine.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, this was typically used to display Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in high-resolution text on a monochrome display and associated graphics on a low-resolution CGA display simultaneously. Many programmers also used such a setup with the monochrome card displaying debugging information while a program ran in graphics mode on the other card. Several debuggers, like Borland's Turbo Debugger, D86 and Microsoft's CodeView could work in a dual monitor setup. Either Turbo Debugger or CodeView could be used to debug Windows.\nThere were also device drivers such as codice_1, which implemented a serial interface simulation on the monochrome display and, for example, allowed the user to receive crash messages from debugging versions of Windows without using an actual serial terminal.\nIt is also possible to use the \"MODE MONO\" command at the command prompt to redirect the output to the monochrome display. When a monochrome adapter was not present, it was possible to use the 0xB000\u20130xB7FF address space as additional memory for other programs.\nA VGA-capable PCI / PCIe graphics card can provide legacy VGA registers in its PCI configuration space, which may be remapped by BIOS or operating system.\nProgramming.\n\"Unchaining\" the 256\u00a0KB VGA memory into four separate \"planes\" makes VGA's 256\u00a0KB of RAM available in 256-color modes. There is a trade-off for extra complexity and performance loss in some types of graphics operations, but this is mitigated by other operations becoming faster in certain situations:\nSoftware such as Fractint, Xlib and ColoRIX also supported tweaked 256-color modes on standard adaptors using freely-combinable widths of 256, 320, and 360\u00a0pixels and heights of 200, 240 and 256 (or 400, 480 and 512)\u00a0lines, extending still further to 384 or 400 pixel columns and 576 or 600 (or 288, 300). However, was the best known and most frequently used, as it offered a standard 40-column resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio with square pixels. \"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\" resolution was commonly called Mode X, the name used by Michael Abrash when he presented the resolution in Dr. Dobb's Journal.\nThe highest resolution modes were only used in special, opt-in cases rather than as standard, especially where high line counts were involved. Standard VGA monitors had a fixed line scan (H-scan) rate\u00a0\u2013 \"multisync\" monitors being, at the time, expensive rarities\u00a0\u2013 and so the vertical/frame (V-scan) refresh rate had to be reduced in order to accommodate them, which increased visible flicker and thus eye strain. For example, the highest mode, being otherwise based on the matching SVGA resolution (with 628 total lines), reduced the refresh rate from 60\u00a0Hz to about 50\u00a0Hz (and , the theoretical maximum resolution achievable with 256\u00a0KB at 16 colors, would have reduced it to about 48\u00a0Hz, barely higher than the rate at which XGA monitors employed a double-frequency interlacing technique to mitigate full-frame flicker).\nThese modes were also outright incompatible with some monitors, producing display problems such as picture detail disappearing into overscan (especially in the horizontal dimension), vertical roll, poor horizontal sync or even a complete lack of picture depending on the exact mode attempted. Due to these potential issues, most VGA tweaks used in commercial products were limited to more standards-compliant, \"monitor-safe\" combinations, such as (square pixels, three video pages, 60\u00a0Hz), (double resolution, two video pages, 70\u00a0Hz), and (highest resolution compatible with both standard VGA monitors and cards, one video page, 60\u00a0Hz) in 256 colors, or double the horizontal resolution in 16-color mode.\nHardware manufacturers.\nSeveral companies produced VGA compatible graphic board models.\nSuccessors.\nSuper VGA (SVGA).\nSuper VGA (SVGA) is a display standard developed in 1988, when NEC Home Electronics announced its creation of the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The development of SVGA was led by NEC, along with other VESA members including ATI Technologies and Western Digital. SVGA enabled graphics display resolutions up to 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0600 pixels, 56% more than VGA's maximum resolution of 640\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0480 pixels.\nExtended Graphics Array (XGA).\nExtended Graphics Array (XGA) is an IBM display standard introduced in 1990. Later it became the most common appellation of the 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0768 pixels display resolution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The archipelago forms the northern limit of the Celebes Sea and southern limit of the Sulu Sea. The Sulu Archipelago islands are within the Mindanao island group, consisting of the Philippines provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; hence the archipelago is sometimes referred to as Basulta, derived from the first syllables of the three provinces.\nThe archipelago is not, as is often supposed, the remains of a land bridge between Borneo and the Philippines. Rather, it is the exposed edge of small submarine ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom. Basilan, Jolo, Tawi-Tawi and other islands in the group are extinct volcanic cones rising from the southernmost ridge. Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost island of the group, has a serpentine basement-complex core with a limestone covering. This island chain is an important migration route for birds.\nThe largest municipalities in the area are on the island of Jolo. The larger island of Palawan to its north, the coastal regions of the westward-extending Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao, and the north-eastern part of the island of Borneo were formerly parts of the thalassocratic Sultanate of Sulu.\nThe archipelago is the home of the indigenous Tausug people; various group of Samal (or Sama) people including the semi-nomadic Badjaw; the land-based Sama; the related Yakan people; and the Jama Mapun people. The Tausug language is spoken widely in the Sulu Archipelago as both first and second languages throughout these islands. The Yakan language is spoken mainly in Basilan Island. Numerous dialects of Sinama are spoken throughout the archipelago, from the Tawi-Tawi Island group, to the Mapun island group (Mapun), to the coast of Mindanao and beyond.\nGeography.\nThe archipelago is geographically subdivided into several groups, most significantly those around the main islands Basilan, Jolo and Tawi-Tawi. There are, however, other groups containing mostly small islands; not all of these are inhabited:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nThe Sulu Archipelago was once part of Majapahit Empire and mentioned in the Old Javanese eulogy of Nagarakretagama by the name \"Solot\". After that, it became part of the Bruneian Empire before gaining its own independence on 1578. Many Tausugs and other native Muslims of Sulu Archipelago already interacted with Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslims called Luzones based in Brunei, and there were intermarriages between them.\nThe region then became part of the independent Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405. The arrival of Western powers later became a conflict when the Spanish start to impose the rule of Spanish East Indies over the Sulu Archipelago. Spanish military expeditions against the sultanate were launched over the centuries of the colonial Philippines period (1565\u20131946). The Moro Rebellion (1899\u20131913) independence movement continued the Islamic Moro conflict, against the United States occupation in areas of the Moro people in the archipelago and southwestern Philippines.\n1405\u20131844: Sulu Sultanate and Spanish East Indies.\nThe Sulu Archipelago was part of the Islamic Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405 by Shari\u2019ful Hashem Syed Abu Bak\u2019r. The sultanate also included portions of Borneo, Mindanao, Palawan, and other islands in the region.\nFrom the first Spanish encounters with Jolo island, the Spanish\u2013Moro conflict met firm and organised resistance from the Sultanate of Sulu. Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi had established a colony in Cebu in May 1565, however the initial focus of the Spanish conquest to establish the Spanish East Indies was northwards. In June 1578 Francisco de Sande, Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies, dispatched captain Esteban Rodr\u00edguez de Figueroa and the Jesuit priest Juan del Campo and the coadjutor Gaspar G\u00f3mez to Jolo, resulting in a negotiated compromise where the Sulu sultan paid a regular tribute in pearls. The following year, Figueroa was awarded the sole right to colonise Mindanao. In 1587, during a campaign against Borneo launched by Sande, Figueroa attacked and burned down Jolo. The Spaniards left Jolo after a few days.\nThe Joloanos resolved to resist Spanish intrusions. In response to attacks, Joloanos raided Spanish settlements and reducciones. In 1593, the first permanent Roman Catholic mission was established on the Zamboanga Peninsula, and three years later, the Spanish Army launched another attack on Jolo, which was repelled by the army of Rajah Bongsu. In November 1593, the Spanish Empire sent Juan Ronquillo to Tampakan to thwart the slave raiders. The following year, the Spanish Army troops relocated to Caldera Bay (Recodo), Mindanao. In 1598, another expedition was launched against Jolo, but was repelled by the Joloanos. In late 1600, Captain Juan Gallinato with a group of about 200 Spanish soldiers attacked Jolo but were unsuccessful. By 1601, after three months of heavy fighting, the Spanish troops retreated. In 1628, a larger raiding force of about 200 Spanish army officers and 1,600 soldiers was organised to attack Jolo to defeat the Moslem slave raiders and traders, but the Spanish again failed to take Jolo. Again on 17 March 1630, a large Spanish force of 2,500 soldiers attacked Jolo but to no avail. When its commander Lorenzo de Olazo was wounded, the Spaniards retreated.\nOn 4 January 1638, Governor Sebasti\u00e1n Hurtado de Corcuera led a naval and military expedition of about 80 ships and 2,000 troops to attack Jolo, but Sultan Wasit put up stiff resistance. However, Sultan Wasit's kuta army suffered a serious epidemic of tropical disease and he and his chieftains sought refuge in the Dungun area of Tawi-Tawi. The Spanish Army easily occupied Jolo, and a small garrison was left there to control the area. The garrison was withered away by frequent raids launched by Sultan Wasit, and by 1645, this garrison had been wasted away. This was the first time that Jolo had been occupied by the Spaniards for an appreciable length of time. From 1663 to 1718, an interregnum of peace occurred because the Spanish troops were ordered to abandon the Zamboanga Peninsula, and forts south of that\u2014and regroup in Manila to prepare for the impending attack of Koxinga\u2014which never happened.\nHostilities resumed in the 18th century, triggered by the 1718 decision by governor Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante to reconstruct the fort Real Fuerza de San Jos\u00e9 in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga. The fort was completed in 1719, renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar is its popular name today), and inaugurated on 16 April. Three years later in 1722, the Spaniards launched another expedition against Jolo led by Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda; this expedition failed. In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege, but the Spaniards again left after a few days. In 1755, a force of 1,900 Spanish soldiers led by the captains Sime\u00f3n Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo in revenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din, but the Spaniards were defeated. In 1775, after a Moro raid on Zamboanga, Captain Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo, but his force was repulsed.\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Great Britain became a new player in the archipelago After occupying Manila from 1762 to 1764, during the Seven Years' War between Spain, Great Britain and other European powers, the British Army withdrew to the south and established trading alliances between the Sulu Sultanate and the British East India Company. During that time, Sulu Sultanate surrendered Basilan to Spain in 1762. Spanish attacks on Jolo were now directed at weakening British trading interests in the south. In 1784, Aguilar conducted a series of unsuccessful assaults against Jolo and in 1796, Spanish admiral Jos\u00e9 Alava was sent from Madrid with a powerful naval fleet to stop the slave-raiding attacks from the Sulu Sea. The British presence was signalled when in 1798, the British Royal Navy, which had established a base in Sulu, bombarded Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. In 1803, Lord Richard Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, ordered Robert J. Farquhar to transfer trading and military operations to Balambangan island near Borneo; the resulting outpost lasted only until 1806. By 1895, the Great Britain had withdrawn its army and navy from the Sulu Sea.\nIn 1815, the galleon trade across the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Mexico ended, since Mexico had declared its independence in 1810, and an extended war of independence was in progress. Most of the other Spanish-ruled areas of the Americas had also rebelled against their colonial masters. In 1821, the Philippine Islands were administered directly from Madrid, rather than via the Viceroy of Mexico, since Mexico and its southern neighbours had won their independence from Spain. The Spanish Empire sought to end the \"Moro threat\". In 1824, the Marina Sutil, a light and manoeuvrable naval force under Capitan Alonso Morgado was sent to confront the slave raiders in the Sulu Sea.\n1844\u20131898: Spanish occupation.\nIn 1844, Governor General Narciso Claveria led yet another expedition against Jolo and in 1848, Claveria with powerful gunboats Magallanes, El Cano, and Reina de Castilla brought from Europe supervised the attack on the Balangingi stronghold in Tungkil. The raid resulted in the capture of many Sama Balangingi and the exile of many to the tobacco fields of Cagayan Valley. The leader of the Sama, Paglima Taupan, was not captured. With the fall of the Balangingi, a powerful ally of the Sulu Sultanate was decimated, beginning the decline of the sultanate's maritime sea power. In 1850, Governor General Juan Urbiztondo continued with Claveria's campaign and annihilated the remaining Balangingi strongholds at Tungkil. A raid on Jolo that year was a failure. On 28 February 1851, Urbiztondo launched another campaign against Jolo, razed the whole town and confiscated 112 pieces of artillery. The Spanish troops later withdrew. Also, in 1851, a peace treaty was signed between the Sulu Sultanate and the Spanish, though the terms were understood differently by each party.\nIn 1876, the Spanish launched a campaign to occupy Jolo. Spurred by their need to curb slave raiding, and concerned about other European colonial efforts in the region, the Spanish made a final bid to consolidate their rule in their southern frontier. The British had established trading centres in Jolo by the 19th century and the French were offering to purchase Basilan Island from the Spanish government. On 21 February 1876, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent against Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers in 11 transports, 11 gunboats, and 11 steamboats. Headed by Admiral Jose Malcampo, they captured Jolo and established a Spanish settlement.\nCaptain Pascual Cervera was appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor; he served from March 1876 to December 1876 followed by Jose Paulin (December 1876 \u2013 April 1877), Carlos Martinez (Sept 1877 \u2013 Feb 1880), Rafael de Rivera (1880\u201381), Isidro G. Soto (1881\u201382), Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Julian Parrado (1882\u201384), Francisco Castilla (1884\u201386), Juan Arolas (1886\u201393), Caesar Mattos (1893), Venancio Hernandez (1893\u201396), and Luis Huerta (1896\u201399).\nThe Spaniards were never secured in Jolo, and by 1878 they had fortified the town with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta Espa\u00f1a, and Puerta Alfonso XII, and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina when Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty on Sulu and Tawi-tawi in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements. Troops, including a cavalry unit with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective walls. In 1880 Colonel Rafael Gonzales de Rivera, who was appointed by the Governor General, dispatched the 6th Regiment to Siasi and Bongao Islands.\nThe Spaniards' stronghold was sporadically attacked. On 22 July 1883, it was reported that three unnamed men had succeeded in penetrating Jolo's town plaza and killed three Spaniards. The word \u201cAjuramentado\u201d was coined by the Spanish colonel Juan Arolas after witnessing several such raids while serving with the Jolo garrison.\n1898\u20131946: American occupation.\nIn 1898, the war between Spain and America broke out. Commodore George Dewey of the US Navy defeated the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay, following which the American army occupied Manila. The United States took possession of the Philippines under international law after the 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the war.\nThe Philippine\u2013American War followed in 1898 for three months, during which the American military fought and defeated the Philippine forces under Emilio Aguinaldo for control of the Philippines.\nAfter the Philippine\u2013American War, the Moro Rebellion (1899\u20131913) independence movement continued the Spanish\u2013Moro conflict, now against the United States occupation of the Philippines. The Sulu Archipelago was considered part of Islamic Moroland by the movement.\nWorld War II.\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked the United States in the Philippines and at Pearl Harbor, and the United States declared war on Japan as part of World War II. Japan conquered the Philippines in 1942, in the Philippines campaign (1941\u20131942). In 1944 the Allies' Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345) against the Japanese occupation began with the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Allied forces eventually drove the Japanese from the islands.\n1946\u2013present: Philippine Independence.\nOn 4 July 1946, the Philippines became an independent nation. The fortifications of Jolo remained in good state during the American occupation when its walls, gates, and the buildings within it were photographed. Early 20th century photographs of Jolo show a well-ordered town, neatly laid out in a grid of streets and blocks\u2014characteristics of Spanish urbanism applied with a military rigidity. In the postwar years the walls degraded.\nJolo suffered major destruction due to bombardment and fire during the military operations against the Moro Islamic independence forces in Jolo in 1973. As of 2013[ [update]], short stretches of degraded perimeter wall still exist, but are covered by buildings or are partially demolished to less than in height.\nAutonomy.\nThe archipelago was part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao from 2006 until its abolition in 2008.\nBangsamoro, officially known as the Autonomous Government of Bangsamoro (Filipino: Nagsasariling Pamahalan ng Bangsamoro), is a proposed autonomous political entity within the Philippines. The proposal is part of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, a preliminary peace agreement signed between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Philippine government.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73056", "revid": "14145604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73056", "title": "Canonical LR parser", "text": "Algorithm used to analyze and process programming languages\nA canonical LR parser (also called a LR(1) parser) is a type of bottom-up parsing algorithm used in computer science to analyze and process programming languages. It is based on the LR parsing technique, which stands for \"left-to-right, rightmost derivation in reverse.\"\nFormally, a canonical LR parser is an LR(k) parser for \"k=1\", i.e. with a single lookahead terminal. The special attribute of this parser is that any LR(k) grammar with \"k&gt;1\" can be transformed into an LR(1) grammar. However, back-substitutions are required to reduce k and as back-substitutions increase, the grammar can quickly become large, repetitive and hard to understand. LR(k) can handle all deterministic context-free languages. In the past this LR(k) parser has been avoided because of its huge memory requirements in favor of less powerful alternatives such as the LALR and the LL(1) parser. Recently, however, a \"minimal LR(1) parser\" whose space requirements are close to LALR parsers, is being offered by several parser generators.\nLike most parsers, the LR(1) parser is automatically generated by compiler-compilers like GNU Bison, MSTA, Menhir, HYACC, and LRSTAR.\nHistory.\nIn 1965 Donald Knuth invented the LR(k) parser (Left to right, Rightmost derivation parser) a type of shift-reduce parser, as a generalization of existing precedence parsers. This parser has the potential of recognizing all deterministic context-free languages and can produce both left and right derivations of statements encountered in the input file. Knuth proved that it reaches its maximum language recognition power for k=1 and provided a method for transforming LR(k), k &gt; 1 grammars into LR(1) grammars.\nCanonical LR(1) parsers have the practical disadvantage of having enormous memory requirements for their internal parser-table representation. In 1969, Frank DeRemer suggested two simplified versions of the LR parser called LALR and SLR. These parsers require much less memory than Canonical LR(1) parsers, but have slightly less language-recognition power. LALR(1) parsers have been the most common implementations of the LR Parser.\nHowever, a new type of LR(1) parser, some people call a \"Minimal LR(1) parser\" was introduced in 1977 by David Pager who showed that LR(1) parsers can be created whose memory requirements rival those of LALR(1) parsers. Recently, some parser generators are offering Minimal LR(1) parsers, which not only solve the memory requirement problem, but also the mysterious-conflict-problem inherent in LALR(1) parser generators. In addition, Minimal LR(1) parsers can use shift-reduce actions, which makes them faster than Canonical LR(1) parsers.\nOverview.\nThe LR(1) parser is a deterministic automaton and as such its operation is based on static state transition tables. These codify the grammar of the language it recognizes and are typically called \"parsing tables\".\nThe parsing tables of the LR(1) parser are parameterized with a lookahead terminal. Simple parsing tables, like those used by the LR(0) parser represent grammar rules of the form\n A1 \u2192 A B\nwhich means that if we go have input \"A\" followed by \"B\" then we will reduce the pair to \"A1\" regardless of what follows. After parameterizing such a rule with a lookahead we have:\n A1 \u2192 A B, a\nwhich means that the reduction will now be performed only if the lookahead terminal is \"a\". This allows for richer languages where a simple rule can have different meanings depending on the lookahead context. For example, in a LR(1) grammar, all of the following rules perform a different reduction in spite of being based on the same state sequence.\n A1 \u2192 A B, a\n A2 \u2192 A B, b\n A3 \u2192 A B, c\n A4 \u2192 A B, d\nThe same would not be true if a lookahead terminal was not being taken into account. Parsing errors can be identified without the parser having to read the whole input by declaring some rules as errors. For example,\n E1 \u2192 B C, d\ncan be declared an error, causing the parser to stop. This means that the lookahead information can also be used to catch errors, as in the following example:\n A1 \u2192 A B, a\n A1 \u2192 A B, b\n A1 \u2192 A B, c\n E1 \u2192 A B, d\nIn this case A B will be reduced to A1 when the lookahead is a, b or c and an error will be reported when the lookahead is d.\nThe lookahead can also be helpful in deciding when to reduce a rule. The lookahead can help avoid reducing a specific rule if the lookahead is not valid, which would probably mean that the current state should be combined with the following instead of the previous state. That means in the following example\n A1 \u2192 A B\n A2 \u2192 B C\nthe sequence can be reduced to\n A A2\ninstead of\n A1 C\nif the lookahead after the parser went to state B wasn't acceptable, i.e. no transition rule existed. Reductions can be produced directly from a terminal as in\n X \u2192 y\nwhich allows for multiple sequences to appear.\nLR(1) parsers have the requirement that each rule should be expressed in a complete LR(1) manner, i.e. a sequence of two states with a specific lookahead. That makes simple rules such as\n X \u2192 y\nrequiring a great many artificial rules that essentially enumerate the combinations of all the possible states and lookahead terminals that can follow. A similar problem appears for implementing non-lookahead rules such as\n A1 \u2192 A B\nwhere all the possible lookaheads must be enumerated. That is the reason why LR(1) parsers cannot be practically implemented without significant memory optimizations.\nConstructing LR(1) parsing tables.\nLR(1) parsing tables are constructed in the same way as LR(0) parsing tables with the modification that each Item contains a lookahead terminal. This means, contrary to LR(0) parsers, a different action may be executed, if the item to process is followed by a different terminal.\nParser items.\nStarting from the production rules of a language, at first the item sets for this language have to be determined. In plain words, an item set is the list of production rules, which the currently processed symbol might be part of. An item set has a one-to-one correspondence to a parser state, while the items within the set, together with the next symbol, are used to decide which state transitions and parser action are to be applied. Each item contains a marker, to note at which point the currently processed symbol appears in the rule the item represents. For LR(1) parsers, each item is specific to a lookahead terminal, thus the lookahead terminal has also been noted inside each item.\nFor example, assume a language consisting of the terminal symbols 'n', '+', '(', ')', the nonterminals 'E', 'T', the starting rule 'S' and the following production rules:\n S \u2192 E\n E \u2192 T\n E \u2192 ( E )\n T \u2192 n\n T \u2192 + T\n T \u2192 T + n\nItems sets will be generated by analog to the procedure for LR(0) parsers. The item set 0 which represents the initial state will be created from the starting rule:\n [S \u2192 \u2022 E, $]\nThe dot '\u2022' denotes the marker of the current parsing position within this rule. The expected lookahead terminal to apply this rule is noted after the comma. The '$' sign is used to denote 'end of input' is expected, as is the case for the starting rule.\nThis is not the complete item set 0, though. Each item set must be 'closed', which means all production rules for each nonterminal following a '\u2022' have to be recursively included into the item set until all of those nonterminals are dealt with. The resulting item set is called the closure of the item set we began with.\nFor LR(1) for each production rule an item has to be included for each possible lookahead terminal following the rule. For more complex languages this usually results in very large item sets, which is the reason for the large memory requirements of LR(1) parsers.\nIn our example, the starting symbol requires the nonterminal 'E' which in turn requires 'T', thus all production rules will appear in item set 0. At first, we ignore the problem of finding the lookaheads and just look at the case of an LR(0), whose items do not contain lookahead terminals. So the item set 0 (without lookaheads) will look like this:\n [S \u2192 \u2022 E]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 T]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 ( E )]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n]\nFIRST and FOLLOW sets.\nTo determine lookahead terminals, so-called FIRST and FOLLOW sets are used.\nFIRST(A) is the set of terminals which can appear as the first element of any chain of rules matching nonterminal A. FOLLOW(I) of an Item I [A \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 B \u03b2, x] is the set of terminals that can appear immediately after nonterminal B, where \u03b1, \u03b2 are arbitrary symbol strings, and x is an arbitrary lookahead terminal. FOLLOW(k,B) of an item set k and a nonterminal B is the union of the follow sets of all items in k where '\u2022' is followed by B. The FIRST sets can be determined directly from the closures of all nonterminals in the language, while the FOLLOW sets are determined from the items under usage of the FIRST sets.\nIn our example, as one can verify from the full list of item sets below, the first sets are:\n FIRST(S) = { n, '+', '(' }\n FIRST(E) = { n, '+', '(' }\n FIRST(T) = { n, '+' }\nDetermining lookahead terminals.\nWithin item set 0 the follow sets can be found to be:\n FOLLOW(0,S) = { $ }\n FOLLOW(0,E) = { $ }\n FOLLOW(0,T) = { $, '+' }\nFrom this the full item set 0 for an LR(1) parser can be created, by creating for each item in the LR(0) item set one copy for each terminal in the follow set of the LHS nonterminal. Each element of the follow set may be a valid lookahead terminal:\n [S \u2192 \u2022 E, $]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 T, $]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 ( E ), $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, +]\nCreating new item sets.\nThe rest of the item sets can be created by the following algorithm\n 1. For each terminal and nonterminal symbol A appearing after a '\u2022' in each already existing item set k, create a new item set m by adding to m all the rules of k where '\u2022' is followed by A, but only if m will not be the same as an already existing item set after step 3.\n 2. shift all the '\u2022's for each rule in the new item set one symbol to the right\n 3. create the closure of the new item set\n 4. Repeat from step 1 for all newly created item sets, until no more new sets appear\nIn the example we get 5 more sets from item set 0, item set 1 for nonterminal E, item set 2 for nonterminal T, item set 3 for terminal n, item set 4 for terminal '+' and item set 5 for '('.\nItem set 1 (E):\n [S \u2192 E \u2022, $]\nItem set 2 (T):\n [E \u2192 T \u2022, $]\n [T \u2192 T \u2022 + n, $]\n [T \u2192 T \u2022 + n, +]\nItem set 3 (n):\n [T \u2192 n \u2022, $]\n [T \u2192 n \u2022, +]\nItem set 4 ('+'):\n [T \u2192 + \u2022 T, $]\n [T \u2192 + \u2022 T, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, $]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, +]\nItem set 5 ('('):\n [E \u2192 ( \u2022 E ), $]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 T, )]\n [E \u2192 \u2022 ( E ), )]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, )]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 n, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, )]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 + T, +]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, )]\n [T \u2192 \u2022 T + n, +]\nFrom item sets 2, 4 and 5 several more item sets will be produced. The complete list is quite long and thus will not be stated here. Note that this particular grammar is not LR(1), as two of the item sets (not listed above) contain shift/reduce conflicts. Detailed LR(k) treatment of this grammar can e.g. be found in http://.\nGoto.\nThe lookahead of an LR(1) item is used directly only when considering reduce actions (i.e., when the \u2022 marker is at the right end).\nThe core of an LR(1) item [S \u2192 a A \u2022 B e, c] is the LR(0) item S \u2192 a A \u2022 B e. Different LR(1) items may share the same core.\nFor example, in item set 2\n [E \u2192 T \u2022, $]\n [T \u2192 T \u2022 + n, $]\n [T \u2192 T \u2022 + n, +]\nthe parser is required to perform the reduction [E \u2192 T] if the next symbol is '$', but to do a shift if the next symbol is '+'. Note that a LR(0) parser would not be able to make this decision, as it only considers the core of the items, and would thus report a shift/reduce conflict.\nA state containing [A \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 X \u03b2, a] will move to a state containing [A \u2192 \u03b1 X \u2022 \u03b2, a] with label X.\nEvery state has transitions according to Goto.\nShift actions.\nIf [A \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 b \u03b2, a] is in state Ik and Ik moves to state Im with label b, then we add the action\n action[Ik, b] = \"shift m\"\nReduce actions.\nIf [A\u2192\u03b1 \u2022, a] is in state Ik, then we add the action\n action[Ik, a] = \"reduce A \u2192 \u03b1\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Here, the mind flayer is described as \"a super-intelligent, man-shaped creature with four tentacles by its mouth which it uses to strike its prey.\" When it hits prey with a tentacle, the tentacle penetrates to the brain and draws it forth, allowing the monster to devour it. A mind flayer's major weapon is given as the Mind Blast, a 5-foot radius wave of \"Psi force\" which affects each opponent differently based on how intelligent it is; possible effects include permanent insanity, rage, confusion, coma, and death. The first illustration depicting mind flayers was by artist Tracy Lesch, who envisioned them \"like a Ming the Merciless with the mental powers of a Professor X\", which appeared in the \"Blackmoor\" (1975) supplement. Game statistics for mind flayers were also included in the \"Eldritch Wizardry\" supplement.\n\"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 1st edition (1977\u20131988).\nThe mind flayer appears in the first edition \"Monster Manual\" (1977). Roger E. Moore authored \"The Ecology of the Mind Flayer,\" which featured in \"Dragon\" #78 (October 1983).\n\"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 2nd edition (1989\u20131999).\nThe mind flayer appears first in the \"Monstrous Compendium Volume One\" (1989), and is reprinted in the \"Monstrous Manual\" (1993).\n\"The Complete Psionics Handbook\" (1991) presented ways on using mind flayers with psionic powers.\nThe \"alhoon\", also known as the \"illithilich\" or \"mind flayer lich\", was introduced in the \"Menzoberranzan\" boxed set, in the booklet \"Book One: The City\" (1992).\nThe book \"The Illithiad\" (April 1998), and the Monstrous Arcana module series that accompanies it, greatly develops the mind flayer further. \"The Illithiad\" introduced the illithid \"elder brain\" and the illithid-roper crossbreed, the \"urophion\". The module \"Dawn of the Overmind\" featured an origin story for the illithids.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 3.0 edition (2000\u20132002).\nThe mind flayer appears in the \"Monster Manual\" for this edition (2000). \"Savage Species\" (2003) added the mind flayer \"racial class\", allowing Mind Flayers to be played from level 1 onward until they reached parity with normal Mind Flayers, and added the \"Illithid Savant\" prestige class.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 3.5 edition (2003\u20132007).\nThe mind flayer appears in the revised \"Monster Manual\" for this edition (2003), in both playable and non-playable forms. One of the differences between the playable Mind Flayer in the \"Monster Manual\" and the Mind Flayer racial class in \"Savage Species\" is that the racial class has only itself as a favored class, while the normal Mind Flayer has wizard as a favored class. The mind flayer received its own chapter in the book \"Lords of Madness: The Book of Aberrations\" (2005).\nThe \"Expanded Psionics Handbook\" (2004) re-introduced the psionic mind flayer, detailing the differences between psionic and normal mind flayers, although creating a Psionic Mind Flayer still requires the information from the \"Monster Manual\".\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 4th edition (2008\u20132014).\nThe mind flayer appears in the \"Monster Manual\" for this edition (2008).\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th edition (2014\u2013present).\nThe mind flayer appears in the \"Monster Manual\" for this edition (2014). Additional information about the mind flayers is found in \"Volo's Guide to Monsters\" (2016). The information includes details about their origins, their reproduction, their dispositions and behaviors, and their elder brain. The book also details this edition's Alhoon, Ulitharid, Mindwitness and Neothelid. The limited edition alternate cover of \"Volo's Guide to Monsters\" features an Illithid illustration by Hydro74. On the fictional canon of mind flayers, 5th Edition designer Chris Perkins, in a 2019 interview, stated:If something has been consistently true about a monster throughout the game's history, it's a good bet that it holds true in Fifth Edition. Everything that we know is true about mind flayers in Fifth Edition can be found in the 5E \"Monster Manual\" and the \"Mind Flayers: Scourge of Worlds\" section of \"Volo's Guide to Monsters\". The latter resource, in particular, picks up elements of mind flayer lore from earlier sourcebooks, including \"The Illithiad\" [from 2E] and \"Lords of Madness\" [from 3.5E].\"ComicBook.com\" reported that the \"big bads\" of the module \"Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk\" (2023) are mind flayers, with the adventure including new variants of mind flayers. Christian Hoffer of \"ComicBook.com\" commented that mind flayers \"have appeared in many 5E adventures over the last decade\", however, this module is the first in the edition to have them as the \"central villain of the campaign instead of merely one of many side threats. What's more, these mind flayers have a goal somewhat similar to one of the central threats faced by players in \"Baldur's Gate 3 -\" ceremorphosis, the process of becoming a mind flayer\".\nFictional physical characteristics.\nIllithids have a humanoid body with an octopus-like head, which has been observed as a similarity to H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu. \nOne of their most feared powers is the dreaded \"Mind Blast\", where the illithid emits a cone-shaped psionic shock wave with its mind in order to incapacitate any creature for a short amount of time. \nBiology.\nIllithids are hermaphroditic creatures who each spawn a mass of larvae two or three times in their life. The larvae resemble miniature illithid heads or four-tentacled tadpoles. Larvae are left to develop in the pool of the Elder Brain. The ones that survive after 10 years are inserted into the brain of a sapient creature. Hosts are determined in a very specific manner. Hosts generally are humanoid creatures that are between 5 feet 4\u00a0inches and 6 feet 2\u00a0inches. The most desirable of races for hosts are humans, drow, elves, githzerai, githyanki, grimlocks, gnolls, goblinoids, and orcs. Upon being implanted (through any cranial orifice), the larva then grows and consumes the host's brain, absorbing the host's physical form entirely and becoming sapient itself, a physically mature (but mentally young) illithid. This process is called \"ceremorphosis\".\nVariants.\nAlhoon.\nAlhoons (also called illithiliches) are illithids that choose to focus on developing arcane abilities in addition to their psionic ones, and have grown powerful enough in magic to become undead liches. Alhoons are generally pariahs in illithid society because they go against most illithids' eventual goal: to merge with the Elder Brain, both physically and psionically. Alhoons, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own personal survival. When discovered near illithid communities, alhoons are mercilessly hunted down.\nThe alhoon first appeared in second edition \"AD&amp;D\" for the Forgotten Realms setting in the \"Menzoberranzan\" boxed set, in the booklet \"Book One: The City\" (1992), and reprinted in \"Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Three\" (1996). The creature was further detailed in the supplement \"The Illithiad\" (1998). The alhoon also appeared in third edition in \"Monsters of Faer\u00fbn\" (2001) and \"Lords of Madness\" (2005).\nVampiric illithids.\nThe origins of these unique undead mind flayers are unclear. All that is known of these creatures is that they cannot create spawn, need both fresh blood and fresh brains to survive, are more feral than typical illithids, and are barely intelligent. One possible origin is given in the Ravenloft adventure \"Thoughts of Darkness\", where \"vampiric mind flayers are either the result of a Mind Flayer tadpole infecting a vampiric host or a host that becomes a vampire before the tadpole fully converts them\". These creatures are hated and feared by typical illithids. Christian Hoffer, \"for ComicBook.com\", wrote, \"Not only do the vampiric mind flayers possess the psionic powers of a mind flayer, they also have the undead strength and bloodlust of a vampire, making them twice as deadly\". Hoffer also highlighted that they \"were created when Lyssa von Zarovich (a descendant of Strahd) attempted to create a creature powerful enough to overthrow her great uncle\". Jacob Creswell, for \"CBR\", highlighted that \"Vampiric Mind Flayers are a classic \"Dungeon &amp; Dragons\" monster that combines two terrifying concepts. [...] Originally known as vampiric illithids, vampiric mind flayers were a force to be reckoned with in \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". Their superior strength stat meant that they'd be able to overpower most adventurers\". Creswell included them on list of the seven best monsters introduced in the 5th Edition campaign guide \"Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft\".\nRelated creatures.\nBrainstealer Dragon: A mix of illithid and dragon, these powerful wyrms occasionally rule over illithid communities that lack an elder brain.\nIllithocyte: Illithid tadpoles that survived the fall of a mind flayer empire, they evolved into a new life form and now crawl about in groups seeking psychic radiation on which to feed.\nKezreth: A living troop transport and battle platform created from the severed head of a shamed illithid. They serve in this capacity in the hope of redeeming themselves and being allowed to return to the elder brain.\nMind Worm: Created by illithids to serve as assassins and bounty-hunters, these powerful psionic creatures resemble smaller purple worms. They can attack from far distances with their probe worms.\nNerve Swimmers: Derived from immature illithid tadpoles, these entities are living instruments of torture and interrogation.\nUstilagor: Mind flayers farm these larval intellect devourers for food and sentries.\nVampire Squid: Servitor creatures created by illithids to extend their reach below the surface of Underdark waters. They have a maw of sharp teeth which can be turned inside out and function as defensive spikes.\nFictional history.\nThe 3.5 Edition \"D&amp;D\" supplement \"Lords of Madness\" provides that the Illithid were a star-faring people who existed at the end of time. Facing annihilation, the Illithid traveled to the past, arriving roughly 2000 years before the present in any given \"D&amp;D\" campaign.\nGith was betrayed by one of her own generals, Zerthimon, who believed she had grown tyrannical and over-aggressive. Civil war erupted, and the race factionalised into the githyanki and the githzerai (and in the Spelljammer campaign setting the Pirates of Gith).\nThe background material of the \"Chainmail\" game places the gith forerunners in a subterranean empire called Zarum in Western Oerik, where they dominated many other races from their capital city of Anithor. \nReligion.\nTraditionally, illithids revere a perverse deity named Ilsensine. In 2nd edition, they have a second deity named Maanzecorian, who is later killed by Tenebrous (Orcus) in the Planescape adventure module \"Dead Gods\". Although Ilsensine is the illithid patron deity, few mind flayers actively worship it, thinking themselves the most powerful creatures in the universe.\nActivities.\nCurrently, the illithids are in a period of intense study and experimentation, gathering knowledge of all sorts that will enable them to eventually reconquer the universe and hold it for good. They frequently meddle in the politics of other races through subtle psychic manipulation of key figures, not to cause chaos but so as to better understand the dynamics of civilization. They regularly probe the minds of surface dwellers so as to gather intelligence and learn about new advances in magic and technology. They also do a good deal of research themselves, mainly focused on developing new psychic powers.\nIllithids regularly conduct raids on all sentient settlements to acquire new thralls.\nIn various campaign settings.\nIn \"Dragonlance\".\nThe yaggol are a variant presented in the \"Dragonlance\" campaign setting.\nIn \"Ravenloft\".\nIllithids are the rulers of a domain in the \"Ravenloft\" campaign setting called Bluetspur, where their God-Brain is the darklord. In the 5th Edition campaign guide \"Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft\", it is revealed that an elder brain became diseased by discovering a \"malignant truth\" and it began to prey \"upon its peers [...]. Horrified by an affliction that infected only them, the other elder brains united and psionically expelled the diseased brain from existence. Or so they thought. From a place without time or reality, the Dark Powers plucked the dying elder brain and planted it upon a tormented world\". \"Polygon\" highlighted that Bluetspur is \"a world of cosmic horror populated by malevolent mind flayers that will make your heroes question their own memories\".\nIn \"Spelljammer\".\nAccording to Ken Rolston, the beholder and the mind flayer \"win starring roles as intergalactic menaces\" in Spelljammer, describing the mind flayers as \"evil, brain-sucking horrors who have polished up their social skills sufficiently to present a dubiously neutral facade to trading partners as they secretly scheme toward the day when all intelligent races will be their vassals and brain-food\". \"D&amp;D\" chroniclers Michael Witwer \"et al.\" commented on their appearance in the setting, already featured on the cover of \"AD&amp;D Adventures in Space\": \"the illithid, the race of the mind flayers, finally return home to space\".\n\"Pharagos: The Battleground\".\nIn a proposed campaign setting, Pharagos is a lightly populated Earth-like world with three continents and numerous chains of islands. The one remarkable feature of this world is the presence of an immense petrified corpse of a god previously worshiped by the Forerunner civilization before it was crushed by the illithid empire. A vast stony column of forgotten beliefs, it is buried deep in the ground. The current inhabitants of Pharagos have no knowledge of the planet's past; the illithid empire's rule over Pharagos and the origin of the gith races on this world are lost to history. They are unaware that the source of mystical power for their numerous cults comes from the presence of the dead god under their land.\nCritical reception.\nThe mind flayer was ranked fourth among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies\". They referred to this unique creation of the \"D&amp;D\" game as the \"quintessential evil genius\" and the \"perfect evil overlord\". Games journalist David M. Ewalt found them \"one of D&amp;D's most popular monsters\". Academic Philip J. Clements considered mind flayers one of the \"game's signature monsters\", while \"Backstab\" reviewer Philippe Tessier called it a \"classic of \"D&amp;D\"\" and Witwer \"et al.\" \"iconic \"D&amp;D\" monsters\".\n\"The Stranger\" writer Cienna Madrid described the Mind Flayer as one of D&amp;D's \"ghastly fiends\". Reviewer Julien Blondel for \"Backstab\" described them as vile brain-eating creatures full of psionic energy. He found them delightful creatures for a sadistic Dungeon Master to use, and a useful bridge between classic game worlds and the planes, as illithids abound in both.\nRob Bricken of \"io9\" named the mind flayer as the 9th most memorable D&amp;D monster. \"SyFy Wire\" in 2018 called it one of \"The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", saying that \"Mind flayers are another classic monster like the beholder.\" \"Screen Rant\" compiled a list of the game's \"10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked\" in 2018, calling the elder brain one of the strongest, saying that while the 5th \"edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has toned down the elder brain a lot\", it \"still represents a grave threat to most adventuring parties, thanks to its range of powerful enchantment spells and psionic attacks, but it isn't quite the epic level threat that it once was.\" Reviewer Scott Baird also found that the illithids in general \"are considered to be one of the most disliked creatures in all of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\"\nIn other media.\nMind flayers appear in other role-playing games, including \"Angband\", \"Bloodborne\", \"Demon's Souls\", \"Final Fantasy\", \"NetHack\", \"Lost Kingdoms\", \"Kingdom of Loathing\" and \"Lost Souls\", and the one-player gamebook RPG series \"Fighting Fantasy\" includes a creature similar to the illithid, the Brain Slayer.\nLicensing.\nThe illithid is considered \"Product Identity\" by Wizards of the Coast and as such is not released under its Open Game License.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
