It was one of the first alphabets, attested in Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions found across the Mediterranean basin. In the history of writing systems, the Phoenician script also marked the first to have a fixed writing direction\u2014while previous systems were multi-directional, Phoenician was written horizontally, from right to left. It developed directly from the Proto-Sinaitic script used during the Late Bronze Age, which was derived in turn from Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nThe Phoenician alphabet was used to write Canaanite languages spoken during the Early Iron Age, sub-categorized by historians as Phoenician, Hebrew, Moabite, Ammonite and Edomite, as well as Old Aramaic. It was widely disseminated outside of the Canaanite sphere by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean, where it was adopted and adapted by other cultures. The Phoenician alphabet proper was used in Ancient Carthage until the 2nd century\u00a0BC, where it was used to write the Punic language. Its direct descendant scripts include the Aramaic and Samaritan alphabets, several Alphabets of Asia Minor, and the Archaic Greek alphabets.\nThe Phoenician alphabet proper uses 22 consonant letters\u2014as an abjad used to write a Semitic language, it leaves vowel sounds implicit\u2014though late varieties sometimes used to denote some vowels. As its letters were originally incised using a stylus, their forms are mostly angular and straight, though cursive forms increased in use over time, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet used in Roman North Africa.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe earliest known proto-alphabetic inscriptions are the Proto-Sinaitic script sporadically attested in the Sinai Peninsula and in Canaan in the late Middle and Late Bronze Age. The script was not widely used until the rise of Syro-Hittite states in the 13th and 12th centuries\u00a0BC.\nThe Phoenician alphabet is a direct continuation of the \"Proto-Canaanite\" script of the Bronze Age collapse period. The inscriptions found on the Phoenician arrowheads at al-Khader near Bethlehem and dated c.\u20091100\u00a0BC offered the epigraphists the \"missing link\" between the two. The Ahiram epitaph, whose dating is controversial, engraved on the sarcophagus of king Ahiram in Byblos, Lebanon, one of five known Byblian royal inscriptions, shows essentially the fully developed Phoenician script, although the name \"Phoenician\" is by convention given to inscriptions beginning in the mid-11th century\u00a0BC.\nSpread and adaptations.\nBeginning in the 9th century\u00a0BC, adaptations of the Phoenician alphabet thrived, including Greek, Old Italic and Anatolian scripts. The alphabet's attractive innovation was its phonetic nature, in which one sound was represented by one symbol, which meant only a few dozen symbols to learn. The other scripts of the time, cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, employed many complex characters and required long professional training to achieve proficiency; which had restricted literacy to a small elite.\nAnother reason for its success was the maritime trading culture of Phoenician merchants, which spread the alphabet into parts of North Africa and Southern Europe. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa. Later finds indicate earlier use in Egypt.\nThe alphabet had long-term effects on the social structures of the civilizations that came in contact with it. Its simplicity not only allowed its easy adaptation to multiple languages, but it also allowed the common people to learn how to write. This upset the long-standing status of literacy as an exclusive achievement of royal and religious elites, scribes who used their monopoly on information to control the common population. The appearance of Phoenician disintegrated many of these class divisions, although many Middle Eastern kingdoms, such as Assyria, Babylonia and Adiabene, would continue to use cuneiform for legal and liturgical matters well into the Common Era.\nAccording to Herodotus, the Phoenician prince Cadmus was accredited with the introduction of the Phoenician alphabet\u2014 'Phoenician letters'\u2014to the Greeks, who adapted it to form their Greek alphabet. Herodotus claims that the Greeks did not know of the Phoenician alphabet before Cadmus. He estimates that Cadmus lived 1600 years before his time, while the historical adoption of the alphabet by the Greeks was barely 350 years before Herodotus.\nThe Phoenician alphabet was known to the Jewish sages of the Second Temple era, who called it the \"Old Hebrew\" (Paleo-Hebrew) script.\nNotable inscriptions.\nThe conventional date of 1050\u00a0BC for the emergence of the Phoenician script was chosen because there is a gap in the epigraphic record; there are not actually any Phoenician inscriptions securely dated to the 11th century. The oldest inscriptions are dated to the 10th century.\nThe General Directorate of Antiquities of Lebanon has assembled a list of inscribed objects from different time periods that together illustrate the evolution of the Phoenician alphabet. The objects are Lebanese state property and displayed in the National Museum of Beirut, with occasional loans to other institutions. The oldest of them is the Ahiram sarcophagus. This collection formed the basis of a nomination of the Phoenician alphabet to the Memory of the World International Register. UNESCO accepted the nomination in 2005, recognising the alphabet as documentary heritage of global importance.\nModern rediscovery.\nThe Phoenician alphabet was deciphered in 1758 by Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy, but its relation to the Phoenicians remained unknown until the 19th century. It was at first believed that the script was a direct variation of Egyptian hieroglyphs, which were deciphered by Champollion in the early 19th century.\nHowever, scholars could not find any link between the two writing systems, nor to hieratic or cuneiform. The theories of independent creation ranged from the idea of a single individual conceiving it, to the Hyksos people forming it from corrupt Egyptian. It was eventually discovered that the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet was inspired by the model of hieroglyphs.\nTable of letters.\nThe chart shows the graphical evolution of Phoenician letter forms into other alphabets. The sound values also changed significantly, both at the initial creation of new alphabets and from gradual pronunciation changes which did not immediately lead to spelling changes. The Phoenician letter forms shown are idealized: actual Phoenician writing is less uniform, with significant variations by era and region.\nWhen alphabetic writing began, with the early Greek alphabet, the letter forms were similar but not identical to Phoenician, and vowels were added to the consonant-only Phoenician letters. There were also distinct variants of the writing system in different parts of Greece, primarily in how those Phoenician characters that did not have an exact match to Greek sounds were used. The Ionic variant evolved into the standard Greek alphabet, and the Cumae variant into the Italic alphabets (including the Latin alphabet).\nThe Runic alphabet is derived from Italic, the Cyrillic alphabet from medieval Greek. The Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic scripts are derived from Aramaic (the latter as a medieval cursive variant of Nabataean). Ge'ez is from South Arabian.\nLetter names.\nPhoenician used a system of acrophony to name letters: a word was chosen with each initial consonant sound, and became the name of the letter for that sound. These names were not arbitrary: each Phoenician letter was based on an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an Egyptian word; this word was translated into Phoenician (or a closely related Semitic language), then the initial sound of the translated word became the letter's Phoenician value. For example, the second letter of the Phoenician alphabet was based on the Egyptian hieroglyph for \"house\" (a sketch of a house); the Semitic word for 'house' was \"bet\"; hence the Phoenician letter was called \"bet\" and had the sound value \"b\".\nAccording to a 1904 theory by Theodor N\u00f6ldeke, some of the letter names were changed in Phoenician from the Proto-Canaanite script. This includes:\nYigael Yadin (1963) went to great lengths to prove that there was actual battle equipment similar to some of the original letter forms named for weapons (samek, zayin).\nLater, the Greeks kept approximations of the Phoenician names, albeit they did not mean anything to them other than the letters themselves; on the other hand, the Latins (and presumably the Etruscans from whom they borrowed a variant of the Western Greek alphabet) and the Orthodox Slavs (at least when naming the Cyrillic letters, which came to them from the Greek by way of the Glagolitic) based their names purely on the letters' sounds.\nNumerals.\nThe Phoenician numeral system consisted of separate symbols for 1, 10, 20, and 100. The sign for 1 was a simple vertical stroke (\ud802\udd16). Other numerals up to 9 were formed by adding the appropriate number of such strokes, arranged in groups of three. The symbol for 10 was a horizontal line or tack (\ud802\udd17\u200e). The sign for 20 (\ud802\udd18) could come in different glyph variants, one of them being a combination of two 10-tacks, approximately Z-shaped. Larger multiples of ten were formed by grouping the appropriate number of 20s and 10s. There existed several glyph variants for 100 (\ud802\udd19). The 100 symbol could be multiplied by a preceding numeral, e.g. the combination of 4 and 100 yielded 400. The system did not contain a numeral zero.\nDerived alphabets.\nPhoenician was prolific. Many of the writing systems in use today can ultimately trace their descent to it, so ultimately to Egyptian hieroglyphs. The Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian and Georgian scripts are derived from the Greek alphabet, which evolved from Phoenician; the Aramaic alphabet, also descended from Phoenician, evolved into the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. It has also been theorised that the Brahmi and subsequent Brahmic scripts of the Indian cultural sphere also descended from Aramaic, effectively uniting most of the world's writing systems under one family, although the theory is disputed.\nEarly Semitic scripts.\nThe Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet was used to write early Hebrew. Both writing systems developed in parallel, being slight regional variants of the same script. The Samaritan alphabet is a direct development of Paleo-Hebrew, emerging in the 6th century\u00a0BC. The South Arabian script may be derived from a stage of the Proto-Sinaitic script predating the mature development of the Phoenician alphabet proper. The Ge\u02bdez script developed from South Arabian.\nSamaritan alphabet.\nThe Phoenician alphabet continued to be used by the Samaritans and developed into the Samaritan alphabet, that is an immediate continuation of the Phoenician script without intermediate non-Israelite evolutionary stages. The Samaritans have continued to use the script for writing both Hebrew and Aramaic texts until the present day. A comparison of the earliest Samaritan inscriptions and the medieval and modern Samaritan manuscripts clearly indicates that the Samaritan script is a static script which was used mainly as a book hand.\nAramaic-derived.\nThe Aramaic alphabet, used to write Aramaic, is an early descendant of Phoenician. Aramaic, being the lingua franca of the Middle East, was widely adopted. It later split off into a number of related alphabets, including Hebrew, Syriac, and Nabataean, the latter of which, in its cursive form, became an ancestor of the Arabic alphabet. The Hebrew alphabet emerges in the Second Temple period, from around 300 BC, out of the Aramaic alphabet used in the Persian empire. There was, however, a revival of the Phoenician mode of writing later in the Second Temple period, with some instances from the Qumran Caves, such as the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll dated to the 2nd or 1st century\u00a0BC.\nBy the 5th century\u00a0BC, among Jews the Phoenician alphabet had been mostly replaced by the Aramaic alphabet as officially used in the Persian empire (which, like all alphabetical writing systems, was itself ultimately a descendant of the Proto-Canaanite script, though through intermediary non-Israelite stages of evolution). The \"Jewish square-script\" variant now known simply as the Hebrew alphabet evolved directly out of the Aramaic script by about the 3rd century\u00a0BC (although some letter shapes did not become standard until the 1st century\u00a0AD).\nThe Kharosthi script is an Aramaic-derived alphasyllabary used in the Indo-Greek Kingdom in the 3rd century\u00a0BC. The Syriac alphabet is the derived form of Aramaic used in the early Christian period. The Sogdian alphabet is derived from Syriac. It is in turn an ancestor of the Old Uyghur. The Manichaean alphabet is a further derivation from Sogdian.\nThe Arabic script is a medieval cursive variant of Nabataean, itself an offshoot of Aramaic.\nBrahmic scripts.\nIt has been proposed, notably by Georg B\u00fchler (1898), that the Brahmi script of India (and by extension the derived Indic alphabets) was ultimately derived from the Aramaic script, which would make Phoenician the ancestor of virtually every alphabetic writing system in use today, with the notable exception of hangul.\nIt is certain that the Aramaic-derived Kharosthi script was present in northern India by the 4th century BC, so that the Aramaic model of alphabetic writing would have been known in the region, but the link from Kharosthi to the slightly younger Brahmi is tenuous. B\u00fchler's suggestion is still entertained in mainstream scholarship, but it has never been proven conclusively, and no definitive scholarly consensus exists.\nGreek-derived.\nThe Greek alphabet is derived from the Phoenician. With a different phonology, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script to represent their own sounds, including the vowels absent in Phoenician. It was possibly more important in Greek to write out vowel sounds: Phoenician being a Semitic language, words were based on consonantal roots that permitted extensive removal of vowels without loss of meaning, a feature absent in the Indo-European Greek. However, Akkadian cuneiform, which wrote a related Semitic language, did indicate vowels, which suggests the Phoenicians simply accepted the model of the Egyptians, who never wrote vowels. In any case, the Greeks repurposed the Phoenician letters of consonant sounds not present in Greek; each such letter had its name shorn of its leading consonant, and the letter took the value of the now-leading vowel. For example, \"\u02be\u0101leph\", which designated a glottal stop in Phoenician, was repurposed to represent the vowel ; \"he\" became , \"\u1e25et\" became (a long vowel), \"\u02bfayin\" became (because the pharyngeality altered the following vowel), while the two semi-consonants \"wau\" and \"yod\" became the corresponding high vowels, and . (Some dialects of Greek, which did possess and , continued to use the Phoenician letters for those consonants as well.)\nThe Alphabets of Asia Minor are generally assumed to be offshoots of archaic versions of the Greek alphabet.\nThe Latin alphabet was derived from Old Italic (originally derived from a form of the Greek alphabet), used for Etruscan and other languages. The origin of the Runic alphabet is disputed: the main theories are that it evolved either from the Latin alphabet itself, some early Old Italic alphabet via the Alpine scripts, or the Greek alphabet. Despite this debate, the Runic alphabet is clearly derived from one or more scripts that ultimately trace their roots back to the Phoenician alphabet.\nThe Coptic alphabet is mostly based on the mature Greek alphabet of the Hellenistic period, with a few additional letters for sounds not in Greek at the time. Those additional letters are based on the Demotic script.\nThe Cyrillic script was derived from the late (medieval) Greek alphabet. Some Cyrillic letters (generally for sounds not in medieval Greek) are based on Glagolitic forms.\nPaleohispanic scripts.\nThese were an indigenous set of genetically related semisyllabaries, which suited the phonological characteristics of the Tartessian, Iberian and Celtiberian languages. They were deciphered in 1922 by Manuel G\u00f3mez-Moreno but their content is almost impossible to understand because they are not related to any living languages. While G\u00f3mez-Moreno first pointed to a joined Phoenician-Greek origin, following authors consider that their genesis has no relation to Greek.\nThe most remote script of the group is the Tartessian or Southwest script which could be one or several different scripts. The main bulk of PH inscriptions use, by far, the Northeastern Iberian script, which serves to write Iberian in the levantine coast North of Contestania and in the valle of the river Ebro (Hiber). The Iberic language is also recorded using two other scripts: the Southeastern Iberian script, which is more similar to the Southwest script than to Northeastern Iberian; and a variant of the Ionic Greek Alphabet called the Greco-Iberian alphabet. Finally, the Celtiberian script registers the language of the Celtiberians with a script derived from Northeastern Iberian, an interesting feature is that it was used and developed in times of the Roman conquest, in opposition to the Latin alphabet.\nAmong the distinctive features of Paleohispanic scripts are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He led the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then ruled the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814, and briefly again in 1815. He was King of Italy from 1805 to 1814, Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine from 1806 to 1813, and Mediator of the Swiss Confederation from 1803 to 1813.\nBorn on the island of Corsica to a family of Italian origin, Napoleon moved to mainland France in 1779 and was commissioned as an officer in the French Royal Army in 1785. He supported the French Revolution in 1789 and promoted its cause in Corsica. He rose rapidly through the ranks after winning the siege of Toulon in 1793 and defeating royalist insurgents in Paris on 13 Vend\u00e9miaire in 1795. In 1796, he commanded a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies in the War of the First Coalition, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. He led an invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798, which served as a springboard to political power. In November 1799, Napoleon engineered the Coup of 18 Brumaire against the French Directory and became First Consul of the Republic. He won the Battle of Marengo in 1800, which secured France's victory in the War of the Second Coalition, and in 1803, he sold the territory of Louisiana to the United States. In December 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French, further expanding his power.\nThe breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens led to the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered the coalition with a decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon defeated Prussia at the Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt in 1806, marched his into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in 1807 at the Battle of Friedland. Seeking to extend his trade embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and installed his brother Joseph as King of Spain in 1808, provoking the Peninsular War. In 1809, the Austrians again challenged France in the War of the Fifth Coalition, in which Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after winning the Battle of Wagram. In the summer of 1812, he launched an invasion of Russia, briefly occupying Moscow before conducting a catastrophic retreat of his army that winter. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russia in the War of the Sixth Coalition, in which Napoleon was decisively defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. They exiled him to the Mediterranean island of Elba and restored the Bourbons to power. Ten months later, Napoleon escaped from Elba on a brig, landed in France with a thousand men, and marched on Paris, again taking control of the country. His opponents responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon was exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died of stomach cancer in 1821, aged 51.\nNapoleon is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history, and Napoleonic tactics are still studied at military schools worldwide. His legacy endures through the modernizing legal and administrative reforms he enacted in France and Western Europe, embodied in the Napoleonic Code. He established a system of public education, abolished the vestiges of feudalism, emancipated Jews and other religious minorities, abolished the Spanish Inquisition, enacted the principle of equality before the law for an emerging middle class, and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities. His conquests acted as a catalyst for political change and the development of nation states. However, he is controversial because of his role in wars which devastated Europe, his looting of conquered territories, and his mixed record on civil rights. He abolished the free press, ended directly elected representative government, exiled and jailed critics of his regime, reinstated slavery in French colonies, banned the entry of black people and mulattos into France, reduced the civil rights of women and children in France, reintroduced a hereditary monarchy and nobility, and violently repressed popular uprisings against his rule.\nEarly life.\nNapoleon's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family who emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century. His maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a noble family from Lombardy. Napoleon's parents, Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, lived in the Maison Bonaparte in Ajaccio, where Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769. He had an elder brother, Joseph, and six younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me. Five more siblings were stillborn or did not survive infancy. Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic under the name \"Napoleone di Buonaparte\". In his youth, his name was also spelled as \"Nabulione\", \"Nabulio\", \"Napolionne\", and \"Napulione\".\nNapoleon was born one year after the Republic of Genoa ceded Corsica to France through the Treaty of Versailles. His father supported Pasquale Paoli during the Corsican war of independence against France. After the Corsican defeat at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769 and Paoli's exile to Britain, Carlo became friends with the French governor Charles Louis de Marbeuf, who became his patron and a godfather to Napoleon. With Marbeuf's support, Carlo was named Corsican representative to the court of Louis XVI, and Napoleon obtained a royal bursary to a military academy in mainland France.\nThe dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child. Later in life, Napoleon said, \"The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.\" Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.\nIn January 1779, aged 9, Napoleon moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious school in Autun to improve his French, his mother tongues being Corsican and Italian. Although he eventually became fluent in French, he spoke it with a Corsican accent, and his French spelling was poor. In May, he transferred to the military academy at Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau where he was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms, and poor French. He became reserved and melancholic, applying himself to reading. An examiner observed that Napoleon \"has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography\u00a0... This boy would make an excellent sailor\".\nOne story of Napoleon at the school is that he led junior students to victory against senior students in a snowball fight, which allegedly showed his leadership abilities. But the story was only told after Napoleon had become famous. In his later years at Brienne, Napoleon became an outspoken Corsican nationalist and admirer of Paoli.\nIn September 1784 Napoleon was admitted to the \"\u00c9cole militaire\" in Paris where he trained to become an artillery officer. He excelled at mathematics and read widely in geography, history and literature. However, he was poor at French and German. His father's death in February 1785 cut the family income and forced him to complete the two-year course in one year. In September he was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace and became the first Corsican to graduate from the \"\u00c9cole militaire\".\nEarly career.\nReturn to Corsica.\nUpon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in \"La F\u00e8re\" artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but spent long periods of leave in Corsica, which fed his Corsican nationalism. In September 1789 he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause. Paoli returned to the island in July 1790, but he had no sympathy for Bonaparte, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence.\nBonaparte plunged into a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists. He became a supporter of the Jacobins and joined the pro-French Corsican Republicans who opposed Paoli's policy and his aspirations to secede. He was given command over a battalion of Corsican volunteers and promoted to captain in the regular army in 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and a dispute between his volunteers and the French garrison in Ajaccio.\nIn February 1793, Bonaparte took part in the failed French expedition to Sardinia. Following allegations that Paoli had sabotaged the expedition and that his regime was corrupt and incompetent, the French National Convention outlawed him. In early June, Bonaparte and 400 French troops failed to capture Ajaccio from Corsican volunteers, and the island came under the control of Paoli's supporters. When Bonaparte learned that the Corsican assembly had condemned him and his family, the Buonapartes fled to Toulon on the French mainland.\nSiege of Toulon.\nBonaparte returned to his regiment in Nice and was made captain of a coastal battery. In July 1793 he published a pamphlet, \"Le souper de Beaucaire\" (Supper at Beaucaire), demonstrating his support for the National Convention which was heavily influenced by the Jacobins.\nIn September, with the help of his fellow Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces sent to recapture the port of Toulon, which was occupied by allied forces. He quickly increased the available artillery and proposed a plan to capture a hill fort where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the allies to evacuate. The successful assault on the position on 16\u201317 December led to the capture of the city.\nToulon brought Bonaparte to the attention of powerful men including Augustin Robespierre, the younger brother of Maximilien Robespierre, a leading Jacobin. He was promoted to brigadier general and put in charge of defences on the Mediterranean coast. In February 1794, he was made artillery commander of the Army of Italy and devised plans to attack the Kingdom of Sardinia.\nThe French army carried out Bonaparte's plan in the Second Battle of Saorgio in April 1794 and then advanced to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, it headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to determine the country's intentions towards France.\n13 Vend\u00e9miaire.\nAfter the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794, Bonaparte's association with leading Jacobins made him politically suspect to the new regime. He was arrested on 9 August but released two weeks later. He was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions as part of France's war with Austria, and in March 1795 he took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the Royal Navy.\nFrom 1794, Bonaparte was in a romantic relationship with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary, whose sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph. In April 1795 Bonaparte was assigned to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vend\u00e9e\u2014a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in the Vend\u00e9e region. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general, and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella \"Clisson et Eug\u00e9nie\", about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Clary.\nIn August, he obtained a position with the Bureau of Topography, where he worked on military planning. On 15 September, he was removed from the list of generals in regular service for refusing to serve in the Vend\u00e9e campaign. He sought a transfer to Constantinople to offer his services to Sultan Selim III. The request was eventually granted, but he never took up the post.\nOn 3 October royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention. Paul Barras, a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, knew of Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and made him second in command of the forces defending the convention in the Tuileries Palace. Bonaparte had seen the massacre of the king's Swiss Guard during the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence. He ordered a young cavalry officer, Joachim Murat, to seize cannons, and Bonaparte deployed them in key positions. On 5 October 1795\u2014\"13 Vend\u00e9miaire An IV\" in the French Republican calendar\u2014he fired on the rebels with canister rounds (described by Thomas Carlyle as \"the whiff of grapeshot\"). About 300 to 1,400 rebels died in the uprising. Bonaparte's role in defeating the rebellion earned him and his family the patronage of the new government, the French Directory. On 26 October, he was promoted to commander of the Army of the Interior, and in January 1796, he was appointed head of the Army of Italy.\nWithin weeks of the \"Vend\u00e9miaire\" uprising\",\" Bonaparte was romantically involved with Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, the former mistress of Barras. Josephine had been born in the French colonies in the Lesser Antilles, and her family owned slaves on sugar plantations. The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony. Bonaparte began to habitually style himself \"Napoleon Bonaparte\" rather than using the Italian form \"Napoleone di Buonaparte.\"\nFirst Italian campaign.\nTwo days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the Kingdom of Sardinia in Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of victories during the Montenotte campaign, he knocked the Piedmontese out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians, laying siege to Mantua. The Austrians launched offensives against the French to break the siege, but Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, winning the Battle of Castiglione, the Battle of Bassano, the Battle of Arcole, and the Battle of Rivoli. The French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, Austria lost 43% of its soldiers dead, wounded or taken prisoner.\nThe French then invaded the heartlands of the House of Habsburg. French forces in southern Germany had been defeated by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen in 1796, but Charles withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning of Bonaparte's assault. In their first encounter, Bonaparte pushed Charles back and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. Alarmed by the French thrust that reached Leoben, about 100\u00a0km from Vienna, the Austrians sued for peace. The preliminary peace of Leoben, signed on 18 April, gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries and promised to partition the Republic of Venice with Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and , ending 1,100 years of Venetian independence. He authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark.\nIn this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 standards. The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics. Bonaparte extracted an estimated 45\u00a0million French pounds from Italy during the campaign, another 12\u00a0million pounds in precious metals and jewels, and more than 300 paintings and sculptures.\nDuring the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and one for circulation in France. The royalists attacked him for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator. Bonaparte sent General Charles-Pierre Augereau to Paris to support a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" that purged royalists from the legislative councils on 4 September\u2014the Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his republican allies in control again, but more dependent upon Bonaparte, who finalized peace terms with Austria by the Treaty of Campo Formio. Bonaparte returned to Paris on 5 December 1797 as a hero. He met Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, France's foreign minister, and took command of the Army of England for the planned invasion of Britain.\nEgyptian expedition.\nAfter two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an enemy of the British. Bonaparte assured the Directory that \"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions\". The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to the Indian subcontinent.\nIn May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists, with mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and geodesists among them. Their discoveries included the Rosetta Stone, and their work was published in the \"Description de l'\u00c9gypte\" in 1809. En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached Hospitaller Malta on 9 June 1798, then controlled by the Knights Hospitaller. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim surrendered after token resistance, and Bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men.\nBonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July. He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt's ruling military caste. This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July, about from the pyramids. Bonaparte's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks' Egyptian cavalry. Twenty-nine French and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed. The victory boosted the French army's morale.\nOn 1 August 1798 the British fleet under Sir Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two vessels of the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile, preventing Bonaparte from strengthening the French position in the Mediterranean. His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings. In early 1799 he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly on parole, so he ordered the garrison and some 1,500\u20135,000 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning. Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.\nBonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men. 1,500 were reported missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease\u2014mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. Bonaparte was alleged to have ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium to speed the retreat. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.\nBonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. On 24 August 1799, fearing that the Republic's future was in doubt, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris. The army was left in the charge of Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber.\nRuler of France.\n\"18 Brumaire\".\nUnknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return from Egypt with his army to ward off a possible invasion of France, but these messages never arrived. By the time he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The republic, however, was bankrupt, and the ineffective Directory was unpopular. Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome. The Directory discussed Bonaparte's desertion but was too weak to punish him.\nBonaparte formed an alliance with Talleyrand and leading members of the Council of Five Hundred and Directory\u2014Lucien Bonaparte, Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s, Roger Ducos and Joseph Fouch\u00e9\u2014to overthrow the government. On 9 November 1799 (\"18 Brumaire\" according to the revolutionary calendar), the conspirators launched a coup and the following day, backed by grenadiers with fixed bayonets, forced the Council of Five Hundred to dissolve the Directory and appoint Bonaparte, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos provisional consuls.\nFrench Consulate.\nOn 13 December, Bonaparte introduced the Constitution of the Year VIII, under which three consuls were appointed for 10 years. Real power lay with Bonaparte as first consul, and his preferred candidates Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun were appointed as second and third consuls who only had an advisory role. The constitution also established a Legislative Body and Tribunate which were selected from indirectly elected candidates, and a Senate and Council of State which were effectively nominated by the executive. The constitution was approved by plebiscite on 7 February 1800. The official count was over three million in favour and 1,562 against. Lucien, however, had doubled the count of the \"yes\" vote to give the false impression that a majority of those eligible to vote had approved the constitution.\nHistorians have variously described Bonaparte's regime as \"dictatorship by plebiscite\", \"absolutist rule decked out in the spirit of the age\", and \"soft despotism\". Local and regional administration was reformed to concentrate power in the central government, censorship was introduced, and most opposition newspapers were closed down to stifle dissent. Royalist and regional revolts were dealt with by a combination of amnesties for those who lay down their arms and brutal repression of those who continued to resist. Bonaparte also improved state finances by securing loans under a promise to defend private property, raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol and salt, and extracting levies from France's satellite republics.\nBonaparte believed that the best way to secure his regime was by a victorious peace. In May 1800, he led an army across the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Bonaparte was still in Egypt. After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French captured Milan on 2 June. The French confronted an Austrian army under Michael von Melas at the battle of Marengo on 14 June. The Austrians fielded about 30,000 soldiers while Bonaparte commanded 24,000 troops. The Austrians' initial attack surprised the French who were gradually driven back. Late in the afternoon, however, a full division under French General Louis Desaix arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle. The Austrian army fled leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrians signed an armistice and agreed to abandon northern Italy. \nWhen peace negotiations with Austria stalled, Bonaparte reopened hostilities in November. A French army under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory over the Austrians at the battle of Hohenlinden in December. The Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. On 26 January 1802, following the Consulte de Lyon, Napoleon was declared president of the Italian Republic.\nBonaparte's triumph at Marengo increased his popularity and political authority. However, he still faced royalist plots and feared Jacobin influence, especially in the army. Several assassination plots, including the \"Conspiration des poignards\" (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise two months later, gave him a pretext to arrest about 100 suspected Jacobins and royalists, some of whom were shot and many others deported to penal colonies.\nTemporary peace in Europe.\nAfter a decade of war, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Under the treaty, Britain agreed to withdraw from most of the colonies it had recently captured from France and her allies, and France agreed to evacuate Naples. In April, Bonaparte publicly celebrated the peace and his controversial Concordat of 1801 with Pope Pius VII under which the pope recognized Bonaparte's regime and the regime recognized Catholicism as the majority religion of France. In a further step towards national reconciliation (known as \"fusion\"), Bonaparte offered an amnesty to most \u00e9migr\u00e9s who wished to return to France.\nWith Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte became increasingly popular, both domestically and abroad. In May 1802, the Council of State recommended a new plebiscite asking the French people to make \"Napoleon Bonaparte\" consul for life. (It was the first time his first name was officially used by the regime.) About 3.6 million voted \"yes\" and 8,374 \"no.\" 40\u201360% of eligible Frenchmen voted, the highest turnout for a plebiscite since the revolution.\nFrance had regained her overseas colonies under Amiens but did not control them all. The French National Convention had voted to abolish slavery in February 1794, but in May 1802 Bonaparte reintroduced it in all the recovered colonies except Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe which were under the control of rebel generals. A French military expedition under Antoine Richepanse regained control of Guadeloupe, and slavery was reintroduced there on 16 July.\nSaint-Domingue was the most profitable of the colonies \u2013 a major source of sugar, coffee and indigo \u2013 but was under the control of the former slave Toussaint Louverture. Bonaparte sent the Saint-Domingue expedition under his brother-in-law General Charles Leclerc to retake the colony, and they landed there in February 1802 with 29,000 men. Although Toussaint was captured and sent to France in July, the expedition ultimately failed due to high rates of disease and a string of defeats against rebel commander Jean-Jacques Dessalines. In May 1803 Bonaparte acknowledged defeat, and the last 8,000 French troops left the island. The former slaves proclaimed the independent republic of Haiti in 1804.\nAs war with Britain again loomed in 1803, Bonaparte realized that his American colony of Louisiana would be difficult to defend. In need of funds, he agreed to the Louisiana Purchase with the United States, doubling the latter's size. The price was $15\u00a0million. The peace with Britain was uneasy. Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation (19 February), which established a Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly, as did Bonaparte's occupation of Holland and apparent ambitions in India. The dispute culminated in a declaration of war by Britain in May 1803. Bonaparte responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne and ordering the arrest of every British male between 18 and 60 years old in France and its dependencies as a prisoner of war.\nFrench Empire.\nBonaparte becomes Napoleon I.\nIn February 1804 Bonaparte's police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince. On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though there was no proof he had been involved in the plot. Enghien's kidnapping and execution infuriated royalists and monarchs throughout Europe and drew a formal protest from Russia.\nFollowing the royalist plot, Bonaparte's supporters convinced him that creating a hereditary regime would help to secure it in case of his death, make it more acceptable to constitutional monarchists, and put it on the same footing as other European monarchies. On 18 May the senate proclaimed Napoleon \"Emperor of the French\" and approved a new constitution. The following day, Napoleon appointed 18 of his leading generals Marshals of the Empire.The hereditary empire was confirmed by a plebiscite in June. The official result showed 3.5 million voted \"yes\" and 2,569 voted \"no\". The yes count, however, was falsely inflated by 300,000 to 500,000 votes. The turnout, at 35%, was below the figure for the previous plebiscite. Britain, Russia, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire refused to recognize Napoleon's title. Austria, however, recognized Napoleon as Emperor of the French in return for his recognition of Francis I as Emperor of Austria.\nNapoleon's coronation, with the participation of Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre Dame de Paris on 2 December 1804. After having been anointed by the pope, Napoleon crowned himself with a replica of Charlemagne's crown. He then crowned Jos\u00e9phine, who became the second woman in French history, after Marie de' Medici, to be crowned and anointed. He then swore an oath to defend the territory of the republic; to respect the Concordat, freedom of worship, political and civil liberty and the sale of nationalized lands; to raise no taxes except by law; to maintain the Legion of Honour; and to govern in the interests, wellbeing and the glory of the French people.\nOn 17 March 1805 Napoleon declared himself King of Italy and crowned himself with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Cathedral of Milan. Austria saw this as a provocation because of its own territorial interests in Italy. When Napoleon incorporated Genoa and Liguria into his empire, Austria formally protested against this violation of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville.\nWar of the Third Coalition.\n By September 1805 Sweden, Russia, Austria, Naples and the Ottoman Empire had joined Britain in a coalition against France. In 1803 and 1804 Napoleon had assembled a force around Boulogne for an invasion of Britain. They never invaded, but the force formed the core of Napoleon's \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\", created in August 1805. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, artillery and cavalry reserves, and the \u00e9lite Imperial Guard. By August 1805 the had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\nTo facilitate the invasion, Napoleon planned to lure the Royal Navy from the English Channel by a diversionary attack on the British West Indies. However, the plan unravelled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve retreated to C\u00e1diz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel. Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, Napoleon abandoned his invasion of England and sought to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in southern Germany before their Russian ally could arrive in force. On 25 September, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of .\nAustrian commander Karl Mack von Leiberich had gathered most of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon's army, however, moved quickly and outflanked the Austrian positions. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack surrendered. With 2,000 French casualties, Napoleon had captured 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching. For the French, this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. After Trafalgar, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by Napoleon's fleet.\nFrench forces occupied Vienna in November, capturing 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. Napoleon then sent his army north in pursuit of the allies. Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Francis I decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. At the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December, Napoleon deployed his army below the Pratzen Heights. He ordered his right wing to feign retreat, enticing the allies to descend from the heights in pursuit. The French centre and left wing then captured the heights and caught the allies in a pincer movement. Thousands of Russian troops fled across a frozen lake to escape the trap, and 100 to 2,000 of them drowned. About a third of the allied forces were killed, captured or wounded.\nThe disaster at Austerlitz led Austria to seek an armistice. By the subsequent Treaty of Pressburg, signed on 26 December, Austria left the coalition, lost substantial territory to the Kingdom of Italy and Bavaria, and was forced to pay an indemnity of 40\u00a0million francs. Alexander's army was granted safe passage back to Russia. Napoleon went on to say, \"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought\". Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \"personal Napoleonic one\". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, \"he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen\".\nMiddle-Eastern alliances.\nNapoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, possibly by forming an alliance with the Ottoman Empire. In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognized Napoleon as emperor. He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France \"our sincere and natural ally\". That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar. It collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia formed an unexpected alliance. In the end, Napoleon made no effective alliances in the Middle East.\nWar of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit.\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon increased his political power in Europe. In 1806, he deposed the Bourbon king of Naples and installed his elder brother, Joseph, on the throne. He then made his younger brother, Louis, king of Holland. On 12 July he established the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe. The creation of the confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire.\nNapoleon's growing influence in Germany threatened the status of Prussia as a great power and in response Frederick William III decided on war with France. Prussia and Russia signed a military alliance creating the fourth coalition against France. Prussia, however, committed a strategic blunder by declaring war when French troops were still in southern Germany and months before sufficient Russian troops could reach the front. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards thus cutting the Prussians off from Berlin and the slowly approaching Russians. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which quickly disintegrated.\nIn the following month, the French captured 140,000 soldiers and over 2,000 cannon. Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight. Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign. In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and fought a bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807. After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive.\nOn 14 June Napoleon obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, inflicting casualties of up to 30% of the Russian army. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. The two emperors began peace negotiations on 25 June at the town of Tilsit during a meeting on a raft floating in the middle of the River Niemen which separated the French and Russian troops and their respective spheres of influence. Napoleon offered Alexander relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. In contrast, Prussia was treated harshly. It lost half its territory and population and underwent a two-year occupation costing it about 1.4 billion francs. From former Prussian territory, Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia, ruled by his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and the Duchy of Warsaw. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused lasting resentment against France in that country. The treaty was also unpopular in Russia, putting pressure on Alexander to end the alliance with France. Nevertheless, the Treaties of Tilsit gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.\nPeninsular War and Erfurt.\nAfter Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to Portugal, which was reluctant to strictly enforce the blockade against its traditional ally Britain. On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Jean-Andoche Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish consent and headed towards Portugal to enforce the blockade. Junot occupied Lisbon in November; the Portuguese royal family had already fled to Brazil with the Portuguese fleet.\nIn March 1808 a palace coup led to the abdication of the Spanish king, Carlos IV, in favour of his son Fernando VII. The following month, Napoleon summoned Carlos and Fernando to Bayonne, where in May he forced them both to relinquish their claims to the Spanish throne. Napoleon then made his brother Joseph King of Spain. By then, there were 120,000 French troops garrisoned in the peninsula and widespread Spanish opposition to the occupation and the overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons. On 2 May an uprising against the French broke out in Madrid and spread throughout Spain in the following weeks. In the face of brutal French repression, the uprising developed into a sustained conflict. Joseph travelled to Madrid where he was proclaimed King of Spain on 24 July. However, following news of a French defeat by regular Spanish forces at the Battle of Bail\u00e9n, Joseph fled Madrid several days later. The following month, a British force landed in Portugal and on 21 August they defeated the French at the Battle of Vimiero. Under the Convention of Cintra, the French evacuated Portugal.\nThe defeats at Bail\u00e9n and Vimiero convinced Napoleon that he had to take command of the Iberian campaign. Before leaving for Spain, he attempted to strengthen the alliance with Russia and obtain a commitment from Alexander that Russia would declare war on Austria if she attacked France. At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808, Napoleon and Alexander reached an agreement that recognized the Russian conquest of Finland and called upon Britain to cease its war against France. However, Alexander failed to provide a firm commitment to make war with Austria.\nOn 6 November Napoleon was in Vitoria and took command of 240,000 French-led troops. After a series of victories over Anglo-Spanish forces, they retook Madrid on 4 December. Napoleon then pursued a retreating British army which was eventually evacuated at Corunna in January 1809. He left for France on 17 January, leaving Joseph in command. Napoleon never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. In April, the British sent another army to the peninsula under Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. British, Portuguese and Spanish troops engaged the French in a protracted series of conflicts, while a brutal guerrilla war engulfed much of the Spanish countryside, a conflict in which atrocities were committed by both sides. Napoleon later called the Peninsular campaign, \"the unlucky war [that] ruined me.\" It tied up some 300,000 French-led troops from 1808 to 1812. By 1814, the French had been driven from the peninsula, with over 150,000 casualties in the campaign.\nWar of the Fifth Coalition.\nThe overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons caused alarm in Austria over Napoleon's ambitions while France's military difficulties in the Peninsular encouraged Austria to go to war. In the early morning of 10 April 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The Austrian advance was disorganized, and they were unable to defeat the Bavarian army before the French could concentrate their forces. Napoleon arrived from Paris on 17 April to lead the French campaign. In the following Battle of Eckm\u00fchl he was slightly wounded in the heel, but the Austrians were forced to retreat across the Danube. The French occupied Vienna on 13 May, but most of the population had fled and the retreating army had destroyed all four bridges across the river.\nOn 21 May, the French attempted to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other, and the French were forced back. The battle was reported in European capitals as a defeat for Napoleon and damaged his aura of invincibility. After six weeks of preparations, Napoleon made another attempt at crossing the Danube. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram (5\u20136 July) the Austrians were forced to retreat, but the French and Austrians each suffered losses of 37,000 to 39,000 killed, wounded or captured. The French caught up with the retreating Austrians at the Battle of Znaim on 10 July, and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July. In August, a British force landed in Holland but lost 4,000 men, mainly to illness, before withdrawing in December.\nThe Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn in October 1809 was harsh for Austria which lost substantial territory and over three million subjects. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports of Trieste and Fiume (Rijeka); the part of Poland annexed by Austria in the third partition in 1795, known at the time as West Galicia, was given to the Polish-ruled Duchy of Warsaw; and the territory of the former Archbishopric of Salzburg went to Bavaria. Austria was required to pay an indemnity of 200 million francs, and its army was reduced to 150,000 men.\nConsolidation of the empire.\nNapoleon's union with Jos\u00e9phine had not produced a child, and he decided to secure the dynasty and strengthen its position in Europe by a strategic marriage into one of Europe's major royal houses. In November 1809, he announced his decision to divorce Jos\u00e9phine, and the marriage was annulled in January 1810. Napoleon had already commenced negotiations for the marriage of Tsar Alexander's sister Anna, but the tsar responded that she was too young. Napoleon then turned to Austria, and a marriage to the Austrian emperor's daughter, Marie Louise, was quickly agreed. The marriage was formalized in a civil ceremony on 1 April and a religious service at the Louvre on the following day. The marriage to Marie Louise was widely seen as a shift in French policy towards stronger ties with Austria and away from the already strained relationship with Russia. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to the heir apparent, Fran\u00e7ois Charles Joseph Napoleon, King of Rome.\nWith the annexation of the Papal States (May 1809, February 1810), Holland (July 1810) and the northern coastal regions of Westphalia (August 1810), mainland France further increased its territory. Napoleon now ruled about 40% of the European population either directly or indirectly through his satellite kingdoms.\nInvasion of Russia.\nTsar Alexander saw the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, Napoleon's marriage alliance with Austria, and the election of the French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden as attempts to contain Russia. In December 1810 Napoleon annexed the Duchy of Oldenburg, which Alexander considered an insult as his uncle was the duke. Alexander responded by allowing neutral shipping into Russian ports and banning most French imports. Russia feared that Napoleon intended to restore the Kingdom of Poland while Napoleon suspected Russia of seeking an alliance with Britain against France.\nIn late 1811 Napoleon began planning an invasion of Russia. A Franco-Prussian alliance signed in February 1812 forced Prussia to provide 20,000 troops for the invasion, and in March Austria agreed to provide 30,000 men. Napoleon's multinational \"grande arm\u00e9e\" comprised around 450,000 frontline troops of which about a third were native French speakers. Napoleon called the invasion the \"Second Polish War,\" but he refused to guarantee an independent Poland for fear of alienating his Austrian and Prussian allies.\nOn 24 June Napoleon's troops began crossing the Nieman river into Russian Lithuania with the aim of luring the Russians into one or two decisive battles. The Russians retreated 320 kilometres east to the Dvina river and implemented a scorched earth policy, making it increasingly difficult for the French to forage food for themselves and their horses. On 18 August, Napoleon captured Smolensk with the loss of 9,000 of his men, but the Russians were able to withdraw in good order.\nThe Russians, commanded by Field Marshall Mikhail Kutuzov, made a stand at Borodino, outside Moscow, on 7 September. The battle resulted in 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, in one of the bloodiest days of battle in Europe up to that time. The Russians withdrew overnight, and Napoleon later stated, \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves worthy of victory, and the Russians worthy of being invincible\".\nThe Russians retreated to Tarutino, and Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September. The following evening, the city was set on fire on the orders of Governor Feodor Rostopchin. Alexander, in St Petersburg, refused to negotiate a peace, and after six weeks Napoleon's army evacuated Moscow. After capturing Maloyaroslavets with the loss of 4,000 to 10,000 men, Napoleon retreated towards Smolensk. The French were attacked by Cossacks and peasants and suffered from the intense cold, disease and lack of food and water. Around 40,000 to 50,000 troops reached Smolensk on 9 November, a loss of about 60,000 in three weeks. Napoleon also heard that an attempted coup by General Claude Fran\u00e7ois de Malet in Paris had only narrowly failed.\nFrom Smolensk, Napoleon's army headed for Vilnius, where there was a French garrison of 20,000. In late November, under attack from all sides by Russian forces, the \"grande arm\u00e9e\" managed to cross the Berezina river on pontoon bridges in temperatures reaching . On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left his disintegrating army for Paris. In the following weeks, the remnants of the \"grande arm\u00e9e\", about 75,000 troops, crossed the Nieman into allied territory. Russian military losses in the campaign were up to 300,000, and total military deaths from both sides were up to one million.\nWar of the Sixth Coalition.\nThe French, pursued by the Russians, withdrew from most of Poland and Prussia over the winter of 1812\u201313 while both sides rebuilt their forces. Sweden and Prussia declared war on France in March 1813. In April Napoleon assumed command of an army of 200,000 troops and defeated the coalition at the battles of L\u00fctzen and Bautzen. Britain formally joined the coalition in June followed by Austria in August, but the allies were again defeated in the Battle of Dresden in August. The coalition, however, had a growing advantage in infantry, cavalry, reserves and armaments. In the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, the coalition was victorious at the Battle of Leipzig (19 October). Although coalition casualties were 54,000 men, the French lost 38,000 killed or wounded and 15,000 taken prisoner. Up to 50,000 more were lost to death, illness and desertion during the French retreat to the Rhine.\nThe Frankfurt proposals were peace terms offered by the coalition in November 1813 under which Napoleon would remain emperor but France would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers.\" That meant that France would retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the west bank of the Rhine, while withdrawing from Spain, Holland, Italy and Germany. Napoleon did not accept the terms, and the allies crossed the Rhine into French territory on 1 January 1814. Wellington's British forces had already crossed the Pyrenees into south-western France. In north-eastern France, Napoleon led about 70,000 troops against a coalition army of 200,000. After a defeat at the Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re, the French won a series of victories in February which induced the coalition to offer peace on the basis of France's 1791 frontiers. Napoleon, however, decided to fight on.\nAfter a series of battles in March, the allies forced Napoleon to retreat at the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube (20\u201321 March). The coalition then moved towards Paris, whose defence was under the command of Joseph Bonaparte. On 29 March, a coalition army of 200,000 began their attack on the Belleville and Montmartre heights. Empress Marie Louise fled Paris that evening with her son, the king of Rome. With an army of only 38,000 to defend the capital, Joseph authorized the French marshal Auguste de Marmont to capitulate on 31 March. The following day, the allies accepted Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord as head of a provisional government. On 2 April the French Senate passed the \"Acte de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'Empereur\", which declared Napoleon deposed. Meanwhile, Napoleon was in Fontainebleau with an army of 40,000 to 60,000. He contemplated a march on Paris, but on 4 April his senior commanders persuaded him to abdicate in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. Tsar Alexander, however, demanded an unconditional abdication, and Napoleon reluctantly complied on 6 April.\nIn his farewell address to the soldiers of the Old Guard on 20 April, Napoleon said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Soldiers of my Old Guard, I have come to bid you farewell. For twenty years you have accompanied me faithfully on the paths of honor and glory. ...With men like you, our cause was [not] lost, but the war would have dragged on interminably, and it would have been a civil war. ... So I am sacrificing our interests to those of our country. ...Do not lament my fate; if I have agreed to live on, it is to serve our glory. I wish to write the history of the great deeds we have done together. Farewell, my children!\"\nExile to Elba.\nWith the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 11 April 1814, the allies exiled Napoleon to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, off the Tuscan coast, where they made him sovereign. The following night, Napoleon attempted suicide with poison he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow. Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled, while his wife and son took refuge in Austria. He was conveyed to the island on HMS \"Undaunted\" and disembarked at Portoferraio on 4 May. In the first few months on Elba, he drew up plans for administrative reforms, road and building works, and improvements to the island's mines and agriculture, but results were limited by lack of funds. When Napoleon learned that Jos\u00e9phine had died in France on 29 May, he was distraught and locked himself in his room for two days.\nNapoleon understood that French King Louis XVIII was unpopular. Realizing that his wife and son would not be joining him in exile, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba in the brig \"Inconstant\" on 26 February 1815 with about 1,000 men and a flotilla of seven vessels.\nHundred Days.\nOn 1 March 1815 Napoleon and his followers landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and headed for Grenoble through the foothills of the Alps, taking the route now known as Route Napol\u00e9on. The 5th Regiment intercepted him just south of Grenoble on 7 March. Napoleon approached the battalion alone and called to them, \"Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish!\" The soldiers responded with, \"Vive l'empereur!\" and joined Napoleon's men. On 14 March Marshall of the Empire Michel Ney\u2014who had boasted that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage\u2014joined Napoleon along with an army of 6,000.\nOn 13 March the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw. Four days later, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia each pledged to put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule. Louis XVIII, however, fled Paris for Belgium in the early hours of 20 March after realizing that he did not have enough reliable troops to oppose Napoleon. Napoleon entered Paris that evening. Napoleon appointed a government and introduced constitutional changes which were approved by plebiscite in May. A Chamber of Representatives was also indirectly elected that month on a highly restrictive property franchise. Napoleon's priority was to raise an army to face the coalition, but the law did not allow conscription and he was only able to raise about 300,000 men, mostly raw recruits and national guards.\nOn 12 June Napoleon led about 124,000 men, known as the Army of the North, into Belgium, aiming to drive a wedge between Wellington's army of 112,000 British, German and Dutch troops and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher's force of 130,000 Prussians and Saxons. After engagements at the Battle of Ligny and Battle of Quatre Bras, Napoleon confronted Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French until, late in the afternoon, Bl\u00fccher's Prussians arrived in force on Napoleon's right flank. The coalition forces broke through Napoleon's lines, inflicting a devastating defeat.\nNapoleon returned to Paris and found that the legislature had turned against him. Realizing that his position was untenable, he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son. He left Paris three days later and settled at Jos\u00e9phine's former palace in Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison. By 28 June, the Prussian army was at Senlis, just north of Paris. When Napoleon heard that Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive, he fled to Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, considering an escape to the United States. However, when he found that British ships were blockading the port, he surrendered to Frederick Lewis Maitland on on 15 July 1815.\nExile on Saint Helena.\nNapoleon was held in British custody and transferred to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, from the west coast of Africa. Napoleon and 27 followers arrived at Jamestown in October 1815 on board HMS \"Northumberland\". The prisoner was guarded by a garrison of 2,100 soldiers while a squadron of 10 ships continuously patrolled the waters to prevent escape. In the following years, there were rumours of escape plots, but no serious attempts were made.\nNapoleon stayed for two months at a pavilion in Briars before he was moved to Longwood House, a 40-room wooden bungalow. The location and interior of the house were damp, windswept, rat-infested and unhealthy. \"The Times\" published articles insinuating the British government was trying to hasten his death. Napoleon often complained of his living conditions in letters to the island's governor Hudson Lowe while his attendants complained of \"colds, catarrhs, damp floors and poor provisions\".\nNapoleon insisted on imperial formality. When he held a dinner party, men were expected to wear military dress and \"women [appeared] in evening gowns and gems. It was an explicit denial of the circumstances of his captivity\". He formally received visitors, read, and dictated his memoirs and commentaries on military campaigns. He studied English under Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases, for a few months but gave up as he was poor at languages.\nNapoleon circulated reports of poor treatment in the hope that public opinion would force the allies to revoke his exile on Saint Helena. Under instructions from the government, Lowe cut Napoleon's expenditure, refused to recognize him as a former emperor, and made his supporters sign a guarantee they would stay with him indefinitely. Accounts of Napoleon's treatment led in March 1817 to a debate in the British Parliament where Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, made a call for a public inquiry.\nIn mid-1817, Napoleon's health worsened. His physician, Barry O'Meara, diagnosed chronic hepatitis and warned Lowe that he could die from the poor climate and lack of exercise. Lowe thought O'Meara was exaggerating and dismissed him in July 1818. In November 1818, the allies announced that Napoleon would remain a prisoner on Saint Helena for life. When he learnt the news, he became depressed and more isolated, spending longer periods in his rooms, which further undermined his health. Much of his entourage left Saint Helena, including Las Cases in December 1816, General Gaspard Gourgaud in March 1818 and Albine de Montholon\u2014who was possibly Napoleon's lover\u2014in July 1819. In September 1819, two priests and the physician Fran\u00e7ois Carlo Antommarchi joined Napoleon's retinue.\nDeath.\nNapoleon's health continued to worsen, and in March 1821 he was confined to bed. In April he wrote two wills declaring that he had been assassinated by the \"English oligarchy\", that the Bourbons would fall, and that his son would rule France. He left his fortune to 97 legatees and asked to be buried by the Seine. On 3 May he was given the last rites but could not take communion due to his illness. He died on 5 May 1821 at age 51. His last words, variously recorded by those present, were either \"France, l'arm\u00e9e, t\u00eate d'arm\u00e9e, Jos\u00e9phine\" (\"France, the army, head of the army, Jos\u00e9phine\"), or \"qui recule\"...\"\u00e0 la t\u00eate d'arm\u00e9e\" (\"who retreats... at the head of the army\") or \"France, my son, the Army.\"\nAntommarchi and the British wrote separate autopsy reports, each concluding that Napoleon had died of internal bleeding caused by stomach cancer, the disease that had killed his father. A later theory, based on high concentrations of arsenic found in samples of Napoleon's hair, held that Napoleon had died of arsenic poisoning. However, subsequent studies also found high concentrations of arsenic in hair samples from Napoleon's childhood and from his son and Jos\u00e9phine. Arsenic was widely used in medicines and products such as hair creams in the 19th century. A 2021 study by an international team of gastrointestinal pathologists once again concluded that Napoleon died of stomach cancer.\nNapoleon was buried with military honours in the Valley of the Geraniums. Napoleon's heart and intestines were removed and sealed inside his coffin. Napoleon's penis was allegedly removed during the autopsy and sold and exhibited. In 1840, the British government gave Louis Philippe I permission to return Napoleon's remains to France. Napoleon's body was exhumed and found to be well preserved as it had been sealed in four coffins (two of metal and two of mahogany) and placed in a masonry tomb. On 15 December 1840, a state funeral was held in Paris with 700,000 to 1,000,000 attendees who lined the route of the funeral procession to the chapel of Les Invalides. The coffin was later placed in the cupola in St J\u00e9r\u00f4me's Chapel, where it remained until Napoleon's tomb, designed by Louis Visconti, was completed. In 1861, during the reign of Napoleon III, his remains were entombed in a sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.\nReligion.\nReligious beliefs.\nNapoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771 and raised a Roman Catholic. He began to question his faith at age 13 while at Brienne. Biographers have variously described him from that time as a deist, a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"natural religion\" or a believer in destiny. He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator.\nHe understood the power of organized religion in social and political affairs and later sought to use it to support his regime. His attitude to religion is often described as utilitarian. In 1800 he stated, \"it was by making myself a Catholic that I won the war in the Vend\u00e9e, by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt, by making myself an ultramontane that I turned men's hearts towards me in Italy. If I were to govern a nation of Jews I would rebuild the Temple of Solomon.\"\nNapoleon had a civil marriage with Jos\u00e9phine in 1796 and, at the pope's insistence, a private religious ceremony with her the day before his coronation as emperor in 1804. This marriage was annulled by tribunals under Napoleon's control in January 1810. In April 1810, Napoleon married Austrian princess Marie Louise in a Catholic ceremony. Napoleon was excommunicated by the pope through the bull \"Quum memoranda\" in 1809. His will in 1821 stated, \"I die in the Apostolical Roman religion, in the bosom of which I was born, more than fifty years since.\" Napoleon read the Quran in translation and had an interest in Islam and the Orient. He also defended Muhammad (\"a great man\") against Voltaire's \"Mahomet\".\nConcordat.\nSeeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, Napoleon and Pope Pius VII agreed to the Concordat of 1801. The agreement recognized the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and in return the Church recognized Napoleon's regime, undercutting much of the ground from royalists. The Concordat confirmed the seizure of Church lands and endowments during the revolution, but reintroduced state salaries for the clergy. The government also controlled the nomination of bishops for investiture by the pope. Bishops and other clergy were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime.\nWhen the Concordat was published on 8 April 1802, Napoleon presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles which further increased state control over the French Church. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially in Italy and Germany.\nArrest of Pope Pius VII.\nNapoleon progressively occupied and annexed the Papal States from 1805. When he annexed Rome in May 1809, the pope excommunicated him the following month. In July, French officials arrested the pope in the Vatican and exiled him to Savona. In 1812 the pontiff was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau in France. In January 1813, Napoleon pressured the pope to sign a new \"Concordat of Fontainebleau\" which was soon repudiated by the pontiff. The pope was not released until 1814.\nReligious emancipation.\nIn February 1795, the National Convention proclaimed religious equality for France's Protestant churches and other religions. In April 1802, Napoleon published laws increasing state control of Calvinist congregations and Lutheran directories, with their pastors to be paid by the state. With Napoleon's military victories, formal religious equality and civil rights for religious minorities spread to the conquered territories and satellite states, although their implementation varied with the local authorities.\nJews in France had been granted full civil rights in September 1791 and religious equality in 1795. The revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes abolished Jewish ghettoes in the territories they conquered. Napoleon wished to assimilate Jews into French society and convened an assembly of Jewish notables in 1806 to that end. In 1807, he summoned a Sanhedrin to adapt the law of Moses to those of the empire. An imperial decree of March 1808 organized Jewish worship into consistories, limited usury and encouraged Jews to adopt a family name, intermarriage, and civil marriage and divorce. Jews, however, were still subject to discrimination in many parts of the empire and satellite states.\nPersonality.\nPieter Geyl wrote in 1947, \"It is impossible that two historians, especially two historians living in different periods, should see any historical personality in the same light.\" There is no dispute that Napoleon was ambitious, although commentators disagree on whether his ambition was mostly for his own power and glory or for the welfare of France. Historians agree that Napoleon was highly intelligent with an excellent memory and was a superior organizer who could work efficiently for long hours. In battle, he could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates, keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point.\nHe was an inspiring leader who could obtain the best from his soldiers and subordinates. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers. He could charm people when he needed to but could also publicly humiliate them and was known for his rages when his plans were frustrated. The historian McLynn sees him as a misogynist with a cruel streak which he often inflicted on women, children and animals.\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was an outsider who never felt at home in France or with other people. Hippolyte Taine said Napoleon saw others only as instruments and was cut off from feelings of admiration, sympathy or pity. Arthur L\u00e9vy replied that Napoleon genuinely loved Jos\u00e9phine and often showed humanity and compassion to his enemies or those who had let him down. He had the normal middle class virtues and understood the common man.\nHistorians are divided over whether Napoleon was consistently ruthless when his power was threatened or surprisingly indulgent in some cases. Those arguing for a ruthless personality point to episodes such as his violent suppression of revolts in France and conquered territories, his execution of the Duc d'Enghien and plotters against his rule, and his massacre of Turkish prisoners of war in Syria in 1799. Others point to his mild treatment of disloyal subordinates such as Bernadotte, Talleyrand, and Fouch\u00e9.\nMany historians see Napoleon as pragmatic and a realist, at least in the early years of his rule. He was not driven by ideology and promoted capable men irrespective of their political and social background, as long as they were loyal. As an expert in military matters, he valued technical expertise and listened to the advice of experts in other fields. However, there is a consensus that once he dominated Europe he became more intolerant of other views and surrounded himself with \"yes men\". Towards the end of his reign he lost his realism and ability to compromise.\nSome historians talk of Napoleon's dual nature: a rationalist with a strong romantic streak. He took a team of scholars, artists and engineers with him to Egypt in order to scientifically study the country's culture and history, but at the same time was struck by romantic \"orientalism\". \"I was full of dreams,\" he stated. \"I saw myself founding a religion, marching into Asia, riding an elephant, a turban on my head and in my hand a new Koran that I would have composed to suit my need.\"\nNapoleon was superstitious. He believed in omens, numerology, fate and lucky stars, and always asked of his generals: \"is he lucky?\" Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805\u201306 left him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility. \"I am of the race that founds empires\", he once boasted, deeming himself an heir to the Ancient Romans.\nVarious psychologists have attempted to explain Napoleon's personality. Alfred Adler cites Napoleon to describe an inferiority complex in which short people adopt over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term \"Napoleon complex\". Adler, Erich Fromm and Wilhelm Reich ascribe his nervous energy to sexual dysfunction. Harold T. Parker speculated that rivalry with his older brother and bullying when he moved to France led him to develop an inferiority complex which made him domineering.\nAppearance and image.\nIn his youth, Bonaparte was consistently described as small and thin. Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied him in 1797 and 1798, notes \"Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking; his face, too, was very thin, with a dark complexion... his black, unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders\", but that, despite his slight and unkempt appearance, \"his looks and expression were earnest and powerful.\"\nThe English painter Joseph Farington, who met him in 1802, said Bonaparte's eyes were \"lighter, and more of a grey, than I should have expected from his complexion\", \"his person is below middle size\", and \"his general aspect was milder than I had before thought it.\" In his later years Napoleon gained weight and had a sallow complexion. The novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811, called Napoleon \"yellow, obese, and bloated\". He is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat\u2014sideways\u2014with a hand-in-waistcoat gesture\u2014a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the British press depicted Napoleon as a dangerous tyrant, poised to invade. A nursery rhyme warned children that he ate naughty people; the \"bogeyman\". He was mocked as a short-tempered small man and was nicknamed \"Little Boney in a strong fit\". In fact, at about 168\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 6 in), he was of average height.\nReforms.\nNapoleon instituted numerous reforms, many of which had a lasting influence on France, Europe, and the world. He reformed the French administration, codified French law, implemented a new education system, and established the first French central bank, the Banque de France. He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the majority Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France. He also implemented civil and religious equality for Protestants and Jews. In May 1802 he instituted the Legion of Honour to encourage civilian and military achievements. The order is still the highest decoration in France. He introduced three French constitutions culminating in the reintroduction of a hereditary monarchy and nobility.\nAdministration.\nNapoleon introduced a series of centralizing administrative reforms soon after taking power. In 1800, he established prefects appointed to run France's regional departments, sub-prefects to run districts and mayors to run towns. Local representative bodies were retained, but their powers were reduced and indirect elections with a high property qualification replaced direct elections. Real power in the regions was now in the hands of the prefects who were judged by how they met the main priorities of Napoleon's government: efficient administration, law and order, stimulating the local economy, gathering votes for plebiscites, conscripting soldiers and provisioning the army.\nAn enduring reform was the foundation, in December 1799, of the Council of State, an advisory body of experts which could also draft laws for submission to the legislative body. Napoleon drew many of his ministers and ambassadors from the council. It was the council which undertook the codification of French law.\nAfter several attempts by revolutionary governments, Napoleon officially introduced the metric system in France in 1801, and it was spread through western Europe by his armies. The system was unpopular in some circles, so in 1812 he introduced a compromise system in the retail trade called the \"mesures usuelles\" (traditional units of measurement). In December 1805, Napoleon abolished the revolutionary calendar, with its ten-day week, which had been introduced in 1793.\nNapoleonic Code.\nNapoleon's civil code of laws, known from 1807 as the Napoleonic Code, was implemented in March 1804. It was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s, the \"Second Consul\". Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The code introduced a clearly written and accessible set of national laws to replace the various regional and customary law systems that had operated in France.\nThe civil code entrenched the principles of equality before the law, religious toleration, secure property rights, equal inheritance for all legitimate children, and the abolition of the vestiges of feudalism. However, it also reduced the rights of women and children and severely restricted the grounds for divorce.\nA criminal code was promulgated in 1808, and eventually seven codes of law were produced under Napoleon. The Napoleonic Code was carried by Napoleon's armies across Europe and influenced the law in many parts of the world. Alfred Cobban describes it as, \"the most effective agency for the propagation of the basic principles of the French Revolution.\"\nWarfare.\nIn the field of military organization, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed what was already in place. He continued the revolutionary policies of conscription and promotion based primarily on merit.\nCorps replaced divisions as the largest army units, mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid, and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine. These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare.\nNapoleon was regarded by the influential military theorist Carl von Clausewitz as a genius in the art of war, and many historians rank him as a great military commander. Wellington considers him the greatest military commander of all time, and Henry Vassall-Fox calls him \"the greatest statesman and the ablest general of ancient or modern times\". Cobban states that he showed his genius in moving troops quickly and concentrating them on strategic points. His principles were to keep his forces united, keep no weak point unguarded, seize important points quickly, and seize his chance. Owen Connelly, however, states, \"Napoleon's personal tactics defy analysis.\" He used his intuition, engaged his troops, and reacted to what developed.\nNapoleon was an aggressive commander with a preference for the offensive. Under Napoleon, the focus shifted towards destroying enemy armies rather than simply outmanoeuvering them. Wars became more costly and decisive as invasions of enemy territory occurred on larger fronts. The political cost of war also increased, as defeat for a European power meant more than just losing isolated territories. Peace terms were often punitive, sometimes involving regime change, which intensified the trend towards total war since the revolutionary era.\nEducation.\nNapoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of secondary and tertiary education in France and throughout much of Europe. He synthesized academic elements from the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", The Enlightenment, and the French Revolution. His education laws of 1802 left most primary education in the hands of religious or communal schools which taught basic literacy and numeracy for a minority of the population. He abolished the revolutionary central schools and replaced them with secondary schools and elite lyc\u00e9es where the curriculum was based on reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, natural history, classics, and ancient history.\nHe retained the revolutionary higher education system, with \"grandes \u00e9coles\" in professions including law, medicine, pharmacy, engineering and school teaching. He introduced \"grandes \u00e9coles\" in history and geography, but opposed one in literature because it was not vocational. He also founded the military academy of Saint Cyr. He promoted the advanced centres, such as the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and advanced research in science.\nIn 1808, he founded the Imperial University, a supervisory body with control over curriculum and discipline. The following year he introduced the baccalaureate. The system was designed to produce the efficient bureaucrats, technicians, professionals and military officers that the Napoleonic state required. It outperformed its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French system. Female education, in contrast, was designed to be practical and religious, based on home science, the catechism, basic literacy and numeracy, and enough science to eradicate superstition.\nNobility and honours.\nIn May 1802, Bonaparte created the Legion of Honour whose members would be military personnel and civilians with distinguished service to the state. The institution was unpopular with republicans, and the measure passed by 14 votes to 10 in the Council of State. The Legion of Honour became an order of chivalry after the empire was proclaimed in 1804. In August 1806, Napoleon created an hereditary imperial nobility including princes, dukes, counts, barons and knights. Eventually the empire had over 3,000 nobles and more than 30,000 members of the Legion of Honour.\nMemory and evaluation.\nCriticism.\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\". He was compared to Adolf Hitler by Pieter Geyl in 1947 and Claude Ribbe in 2005. Most modern critics of Napoleon, however, reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents. Nevertheless, David A. Bell and McLynn condemn his killing of 3,000\u20135,000 Turkish prisoners of war in Syria.\nHistorians have argued that his expansionist foreign policy was a major factor in the Napoleonic wars, which cost six million lives and caused economic disruption for a generation. McLynn and Correlli Barnett suggest that Napoleon's reputation as a military genius is exaggerated. Cobban and Susan P. Conner argue that Napoleon had insufficient regard for the lives of his soldiers and that his battle tactics led to excessive casualties.\nCritics also cite Napoleon's exploitation of conquered territories. To finance his wars, Napoleon increased taxes and levies of troops from annexed territories and satellite states. He also introduced discriminatory tariff policies which promoted French trade at the expense of allies and satellite states. He institutionalized plunder: French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon's forces from across Europe. Artefacts were brought to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre for a grand central museum; an example which would later be followed by others.\nMany historians have criticized Napoleon's authoritarian rule, especially after 1807, which included censorship, the closure of independent newspapers, the bypassing of direct elections and representative government, the dismissal of judges showing independence, and the exile of critics of the regime. Historians also blame Napoleon for reducing the civil rights of women, children and people of colour, and reintroducing the legal penalties of civil death and confiscation of property. His reintroduction of an hereditary monarchy and nobility remains controversial. His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's colonies in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean adversely affect his reputation.\nPropaganda and memory.\nNapoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power, legitimated his regime, and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship and control of the press, books, theatre, and art were part of his propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing peace and stability to France. Propaganda focused on his role first as a general then as a civil leader and emperor. He fostered a relationship with artists, commissioning and controlling different forms of art to suit his propaganda goals. Napoleonic propaganda survived his exile to Saint Helena. Las Cases, who was with Napoleon in exile, published \"The Memorial of Saint Helena\" in 1822, creating a legend of Napoleon as a liberal, visionary proponent of European unification, deposed by reactionary elements of the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\".\nNapoleon remained a central figure in the romantic art and literature of the 1820s and 1830s. The Napoleonic legend played a key role in collective political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815\u20131830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the French Revolution. The defiance manifested itself in seditious materials, displaying the tricolour and rosettes. There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of Napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations.\nBell sees the return of Napoleon's remains to France in 1840 as an attempt by Louis-Phillipe to prop up his unpopular regime by associating it with Napoleon, and that the regime of Napoleon III was only possible with the continued resonance of the Napoleonic legend. Venita Datta argues that following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Writers and critics of the \"Belle \u00c9poque\" exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends. In the 21st century, Napoleon appears regularly in popular fiction, drama and advertising. Napoleon and his era remain major topics of historical research with a sharp increase in historical books, articles and symposia during the bicentenary years of 1999 to 2015.\nLong-term influence outside France.\nNapoleon was responsible for spreading many of the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially through the Napoleonic Code. After the fall of Napoleon, it continued to influence the law in western Europe and other parts of the world including Latin America, the Dominican Republic, Louisiana and Quebec.\nNapoleon's regime abolished remnants of feudalism in the lands he conquered and in his satellite states. He liberalized property laws, ended manorialism, abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalized divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and ended the Spanish Inquisition. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality before the law was proclaimed for all men.\nNapoleon reorganized what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of about three hundred \"Kleinstaaten\", into a more streamlined forty-state Confederation of the Rhine; this helped promote the German Confederation and the unification of Germany in 1871, as it sparked a new wave of German nationalism that opposed the French intervention. The movement toward Italian unification was similarly sparked by Napoleonic rule. These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the nation state.\nThe Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy had a significant effect on Spanish America. Many local elites sought to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate monarch. Napoleon indirectly began the process of Latin American independence when the power vacuum was filled by local political leaders such as Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn. Such leaders embraced nationalistic sentiments influenced by French nationalism and led successful independence movements in Latin America. Napoleon's reputation is generally favourable in Poland, which is the only country in the world to evoke him in its national anthem, Poland Is Not Yet Lost.\nChildren.\nNapoleon married Jos\u00e9phine in 1796, but the marriage produced no children. In 1806 he adopted his step-son Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais and his second cousin St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais, and he arranged dynastic marriages for them.\nNapoleon's marriage to Marie Louise produced one child, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles (Napoleon II), known from birth as the King of Rome. When Napoleon abdicated in 1815 he named his son his successor as \"Napoleon II\", but the allies refused to recognize him. He was awarded the title of the Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21, with no children.\nNapoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son: Charles L\u00e9on by El\u00e9onore Denuelle de La Plaigne. Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, the son of his Polish mistress Maria Walewska, was also widely known to be his child, as DNA evidence has confirmed. He may have had further illegitimate offspring.\nArms.\nOn becoming emperor, Napoleon adopted the French Imperial Eagle as his arms.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nBiographical studies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography and memory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpecialty studies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

{"id": "69882", "revid": "31519789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69882", "title": "Alexander of Battenberg", "text": "Prince of Bulgaria from 1879 to 1886\nAlexander Joseph (; 5 April 1857 \u2013 17 November 1893), known as Alexander of Battenberg, was the first prince (\"knyaz\") of the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria from 1879 until his abdication in 1886.\nThe Bulgarian Grand National Assembly elected him as Prince of autonomous Bulgaria in 1879. He dissolved the assembly the following year and suspended the Constitution in 1881, considering it too liberal. He restored the Constitution in 1883, leading to open conflict with Russia that made him popular in Bulgaria. Unification with Eastern Rumelia was achieved and recognised by the powers in 1885. A coup carried out by pro-Russian Bulgarian Army officers forced him to abdicate in September 1886. He later became a general in the Austrian army.\nEarly life.\nAlexander was the second son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by the latter's morganatic marriage with Countess Julia von Hauke. The Countess and her descendants gained the title of Princess of Battenberg (derived from an old residence of the Grand Dukes of Hesse) and the style \"Durchlaucht\" (\"Serene Highness\") in 1858. \nPrince Alexander was a nephew of Russia's Tsar Alexander II, who had married a sister of Prince Alexander of Hesse. His mother, member of the Hauke family, the daughter of Polish general Hans Moritz von Hauke, had been lady-in-waiting to the Tsaritsa. Alexander was known to his family, and many later biographers, as \"Sandro\" or \"Drino\".\nAlexander's brother, Prince Louis of Battenberg, married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Their children included Queen Louise of Sweden, Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Princess Alice of Battenberg, the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II.\nAlexander's other brother, Prince Henry of Battenberg, married Queen Victoria's youngest daughter Princess Beatrice. Among their children was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain.\nPrince of Bulgaria.\nIn his boyhood and early youth, Alexander frequently visited Saint Petersburg, and he accompanied his uncle, Tsar Alexander II, who was much attached to him, during the Bulgarian campaign of 1877.\nWhen, under the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Bulgaria became an autonomous principality under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, the Tsar recommended his nephew to the Bulgarians as a candidate for the newly created throne, and the Grand National Assembly unanimously elected Prince Alexander as Prince of Bulgaria (29 April 1879). At that time he held a commission as a lieutenant in the Prussian life-guards at Potsdam. \nBefore proceeding to Bulgaria, Prince Alexander paid visits to the Tsar at Livadia, to the courts of the Great Powers. After paying a visit to the Ottoman Sultan's court, a Russian warship conveyed him to Varna where he took an oath to the Tarnovo Constitution at Veliko Tarnovo (8 July 1879) and then proceeded to Sofia. People everywhere en route greeted him with immense enthusiasm.\nReign.\nThe new ruling prince had not had any previous experience in government, and a range of problems confronted him. He found himself caught between the Russians, who wanted him to be a do-nothing king (a \"roi fain\u00e9ant\"), and the Bulgarian politicians, who actively pursued their own quarrels with a violence that threatened the stability of Bulgaria. One of his servants was the Bessarabian boyar Stefan Uvaliev from the C\u0103z\u0103ne\u0219ti village, who supported him financially.\nIn 1881, a marriage was suggested between Alexander and Princess Viktoria of Prussia, the daughter of the United Kingdom's Victoria, Princess Royal, the latter of whom was then crown princess of the German Empire and was the oldest daughter of the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria. While the would-be bride's mother and maternal grandmother supported the prospective marriage, her German relatives \n\u2013 her paternal grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I; her brother, later Kaiser Wilhelm II (Kaiser Wilhelm I's grandson); and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck \u2013 opposed it, fearing that it would offend the Russian ruling house, most notably Prince Alexander's cousin Tsar Alexander III. Alexander III had recently ascended to the Russian throne and, unlike his father, was far from kindly disposed to the prince. Prince Alexander was later ordered to make a formal declaration renouncing the betrothal.\nAfter attempting to govern under these conditions for nearly two years, the prince, with the consent of the Russian Tsar, assumed absolute power, having suspended the Constitution (9 May 1881). A specially convened assembly voted (13 July 1881) for suspension of the ultra-democratic constitution for a period of seven years. The experiment, however, proved unsuccessful; the monarchical coup infuriated Bulgarian Liberal and Radical politicians, and real power passed to two Russian generals, Sobolev and Kaulbars, specially dispatched from Saint Petersburg. After vainly endeavouring to obtain the recall of the generals, the prince restored the constitution with the concurrence of all Bulgarian political parties (19 September 1883). A serious breach with Russia followed, and the part which the prince subsequently played in encouraging Bulgarian national aspirations widened that breach.\nThe revolution of Plovdiv (18 September 1885), which brought about the union of Eastern Rumelia with Bulgaria, took place with Alexander's consent, and he at once assumed the government of the province. In the year which followed, the prince gave evidence of considerable military and diplomatic ability. He rallied the Bulgarian army, now deprived of its Russian officers (withdrawn by Tsar Alexander III), which Alexander replaced by graduates of the Bulgarian Military Academy to resist the Serbian invasion (later known as \"The Victory of Bulgarian Cadets vs. Serbian Generals\"). Alexander mobilised his troops standing at the Turkish frontier and ordered them to go north to Slivnitsa as fast as possible. In the meantime, he ordered his troops already deployed there to fortify the garrison. Having ensured the smooth running of operations. Alexander returned after repelling a Serbian attack near Sofia threatening Bulgarian lines from the hinterland. He returned just in time to conduct a final counterattack against Serbian troops, followed by pursuing them deep into their own territory. The Bulgarians won a decisive victory at Slivnitsa (19 November), after which Bulgarian troops advanced as far as Pirot, capturing it on 27 November. Although the intervention of Austria protected Serbia from the consequences of defeat, Prince Alexander's success sealed the union with Eastern Rumelia. After long negotiations, Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II nominated him as governor-general of that province for five years (5 April 1886).\nLoss of Throne.\nThis arrangement, however, cost Alexander much of his popularity in Bulgaria, while discontent prevailed among a number of his officers, who considered themselves slighted in the distribution of rewards at the close of the campaign. Encouraged by the promise of Tsar Alexander III to keep their Bulgarian rank in the Russian army and receiving common Russian salary these officers formed a military plot, and on the night of 20 August 1886 the conspirators seized the prince in the palace at Sofia and compelled him to sign his abdication; they then hurried him to the Danube at Oryahovo, transported him on his yacht to Reni, and handed him over to the Russian authorities, who allowed him to proceed to Lemberg. \nHowever, he soon returned to Bulgaria as a result of the success of the counter-revolution led by Stefan Stambolov, which overthrew the provisional government set up by the Russian party at Sofia. His position, however, had become untenable. His cousin Tsar Alexander III wrote to him in the days after, \u201cI cannot agree to your return to Bulgaria. Your Majesty knows well what he should do.\" The attitude of Bismarck, who, in conjunction with the Russian and Austrian governments, forbade him to punish the leaders of the military conspiracy, also undermined Alexander's position. He therefore issued a manifesto resigning the throne and left Bulgaria on 8 September 1886.\nAfter his abdication from the Bulgarian throne, Alexander I claimed the title Prince of Tarnovo and used it until his death.\nLater years.\nAlexander then retired into private life. A few years later he married Johanna Loisinger, an actress, and assumed the style of Count von Hartenau (6 February 1889). They had a son \"Assen\", Count von Hartenau (1890-1965) and a daughter Countess Marie Therese Vera \"Zwetana\" von Hartenau (1893\u20131935). The last years of his life he spent principally at Graz, where he held a local command in the Austrian army, and where he died of a ruptured appendix on 17 November 1893. His remains, brought to Sofia, received a public funeral there, and were buried in a mausoleum erected to his memory.\nHonours.\nBattenberg Hill on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Prince Alexander Battenberg of Bulgaria.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69886", "revid": "522013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69886", "title": "Charles Taze Russell", "text": "Founder of the Bible Student movement (1852\u20131916)\nCharles Taze Russell (February 16, 1852\u00a0\u2013 October 31, 1916), or Pastor Russell, was an American Adventist minister from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and founder of the Bible Student movement. He was an early Christian Zionist.\nIn July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious magazine, \"Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\". In 1881, he co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president. In 1884 the corporation was registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six-volume Bible study series titled \"Millennial Dawn\", later renamed \"Studies in the Scriptures\", nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime. (A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, Joseph Rutherford, and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell's writings in 1927, though his books are still published by several independent groups.\nAfter Russell's death, a crisis surrounding Rutherford's leadership of the society culminated in a movement-wide schism. As many as three-quarters of the approximately 50,000 Bible Students associated in 1917 had left by 1931. This resulted in the formation of several groups with variations of the name \"Bible Students\". Those who remained associated with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name \"Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the Pastoral Bible Institute in 1918, the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1919, and the Dawn Bible Students Association in 1929.\nEarly life.\nCharles Taze Russell was born to Scotch-Irish parents, immigrant Joseph Lytle/Lytel Russell and Ann Eliza Birney, on February 16, 1852, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was nine years old.\nThe Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. When Charles was in his early teens, his father made him partner of his Pittsburgh haberdashery store. By age twelve, Russell was writing business contracts for customers and given charge of some of his father's other clothing stores. At age thirteen, Russell left the Presbyterian Church to join the Congregational Church. In his youth he was known to chalk Bible verses on fence boards and city sidewalks in an attempt to convert unbelievers; he particularly noted the punishment of hell awaiting the unfaithful.\nAt age sixteen, a discussion with a childhood friend on faults perceived in Christianity (such as contradictions in creeds, along with medieval traditions) led Russell to question his faith. He investigated various other religions, but concluded that they did not provide the answers he was seeking. In 1870, at age eighteen, he attended a presentation by Adventist minister Jonas Wendell. Russell later said that, although he had not entirely agreed with Wendell's arguments, the presentation had inspired him with a renewed zeal and belief that the Bible is the word of God.\nMarriage.\nOn March 13, 1879, Russell married Maria Frances Ackley after a few months' acquaintance. The couple separated in 1897. Russell blamed the marriage breakup on disagreements over Maria Russell's insistence on a greater editorial role in \"Zion's Watch Tower\" magazine. A later court judgment noted that he had labelled the marriage \"a mistake\" three years before the dispute over her editorial ambitions had arisen.\nMaria Russell filed a suit for legal separation in the Pennsylvania courts of common pleas at Pittsburgh in June 1903. In 1906 she filed for divorce under a claim of mental cruelty. She was granted a separation, with alimony, in 1908. Maria Russell died at the age of 88 in St. Petersburg, Florida, on March 12, 1938, from complications related to Hodgkin's disease.\nMinistry.\nRussell was a charismatic figure, but claimed no special revelation or vision for his teachings and no special authority on his own behalf. He stated that he did not seek to found a new denomination, but intended to gather together those who were seeking the truth of God's Word \"during this harvest time\". He wrote that the \"clear unfolding of truth\" within his teachings was due to \"the simple fact that God's due time has come; and if I did not speak, and no other agent could be found, the very stones would cry out.\"\nHe viewed himself\u2014and all other Christians anointed with the Holy Spirit\u2014as \"God's mouthpiece\" and an ambassador of Christ. Later in his career he accepted without protest that many Bible Students viewed him as the \"faithful and wise servant\" of Matthew 24:45. After his death, the \"Watch Tower\" said that he had been made \"ruler of all the Lord's goods\".\nBeginnings.\nAbout 1870, Russell and his father established a group with a number of acquaintances to undertake an analytical study of the Bible and the origins of Christian doctrine, creed, and tradition. The group, strongly influenced by the writings of Millerite Adventist ministers George Storrs and George Stetson, who were also frequent attendees, concluded that many of the primary doctrines of the established churches, including the Trinity, hellfire, and inherent immortality of the soul, were not substantiated by the scriptures.\nAround January 1876, Russell received a copy of Nelson Barbour's \"Herald of the Morning\" in the mail. Barbour was an influential Adventist writer and publisher. Russell telegraphed Barbour to set up a meeting. Barbour and John Henry Paton visited in Allegheny in March 1876 at Russell's expense so that he could hear their arguments, and compare the conclusions that each side had made in their studies. Russell sponsored a speech by Barbour in St. George's Hall, Philadelphia in August 1876 and attended other lectures by Barbour.\nAmong the teachings Barbour introduced was the view that Christians who had died would be raised in April 1878. Russell, who had previously rejected prophetic chronology, was moved to devote his life to what he was convinced were now the last two years before the invisible, spiritual return of Christ. He sold his five clothing stores for approximately $300,000 (current value $). With Russell's encouragement and financial backing, Barbour wrote an outline of their views in \"Three Worlds and the Harvest of This World\", published in 1877. A text Russell had previously written, titled \"The Object and Manner of our Lord's Return\", was published concurrently through the offices of the \"Herald of the Morning\". Russell was eager to lead a Christian revival and called two separate meetings of Christian leaders in Pittsburgh. Russell's ideas, particularly stressing the imminence of the rapture and the second advent of Christ, were rejected both times.\nSplit with Barbour.\nWhen 1878 arrived, failure of the expected rapture brought great disappointment for Barbour and Russell, and their associates and readers. But one of Russell's associates claimed that Russell was not upset.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While talking with Russell about the events of 1878, I told him that Pittsburgh papers had reported he was on the Sixth Street bridge dressed in a white robe on the night of the Memorial of Christ's death, expecting to be taken to heaven together with many others. I asked him, \"Is that correct?\" Russell laughed heartily and said: \"I was in bed that night between 10:30 and 11:00 pm. However, some of the more radical ones might have been there, but I was not. Neither did I expect to be taken to heaven at that time, for I felt there was much work to be done preaching the Kingdom message to the peoples of the earth before the church would be taken away.\u2014\u200a\nConfused by what was perceived to be an error in calculation, Russell re-examined the doctrine to see if he could determine whether it had biblical origins or was simply Christian tradition. He concluded that the doctrine was Christian tradition. Through the pages of the \"Herald\", he wrote about what he had concluded on the subject. Barbour, embarrassed by the failure of their expectations, rejected Russell's explanation. They conducted a debate in successive issues of the journal from early 1878 to mid-1879. In a matter of months, Barbour changed some of the views which he and Russell had previously shared, and no longer relied on prophetic chronology. They began to debate over the issue of 'Christ's ransom', and the two eventually separated because of their disagreements.\nRussell withdrew his financial support and started his own journal, \"Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\", publishing his first issue in July 1879. Barbour formed The Church of the Strangers that same year, continuing to publish \"Herald of the Morning\".\nWatch Tower Society.\nIn 1881, Russell founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, with William Henry Conley as president and Russell as secretary-treasurer; they intended to disseminate tracts, papers, doctrinal treatises and Bibles. All materials were printed and bound by Russell's privately owned Tower Publishing Company for an agreed price, then distributed by colporteurs. The Society was incorporated in 1884, with Russell as president, and in 1886 its name was changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.\nIn 1908, Russell transferred the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to Brooklyn, New York where it remained until 2016, when it was relocated to Warwick, New York.\nPublications.\nWith the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him \"Pastor\", and commonly referred to him as \"Pastor Russell\". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition.\nIn 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: \"Food for Thinking Christians.\" The 162-page \"pamphlet\" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately $40,000 (current value $). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5\u00a0million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published \"Tabernacle and its Teachings\" which was quickly expanded and reissued as \"Tabernacle Shadows of the \"Better Sacrifices\"\", outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880.\nIn 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15\u00a0million in the United States and Canada.\nIn 1910, the secular journal \"Overland Monthly\" calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 \"The Continent\", a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation \"than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America\".\nRussell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period.\n\"Studies in the Scriptures\".\nRussell devoted nearly a tenth of his fortune, along with contributed funds, in publishing and distributing \"Food for Thinking Christians\" in 1881. That year he also published \"The Tabernacle and its Teachings\" and \"Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices\". In 1886, after reportedly not making back most of the money spent publishing these three titles, he began publication of what was intended to be a seven-volume series. The volumes were collectively called \"Millennial Dawn\", later renamed \"Studies in the Scriptures\" to clarify that they were not novels. Russell published six volumes in the series:\nThe delayed publication of the seventh volume became a source of great anticipation and mystery among Bible Students. Following Russell's death in 1916, a seventh volume titled \"The Finished Mystery\" was published in 1917; this was advertised as his \"posthumous work\". This seventh volume was a detailed interpretation of the Book of Revelation, but also included interpretations of Ezekiel and the Song of Solomon. Controversy quickly surrounded both its publication and content. It soon became known that much of the contents were written and compiled by two of Russell's associates, Clayton J. Woodworth and George H. Fisher, and edited by Joseph Rutherford, by then the new president of the Watch Tower Society.\n\"Photo Drama of Creation\".\nRussell directed the production of a worldwide roadshow presentation titled \"The Photo-Drama of Creation\", an innovative eight-hour religious film in four parts. It was the first major screenplay to incorporate synchronized sound, moving film, and color slides. Production began as early as 1912, and the \"Drama\" was introduced in 1914 by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. A book by the same name was also published. The project's expenses put the organization under some financial pressures; the full cost was estimated at US$300,000 (current value $).\nTheology and teachings.\nFollowing his examination of the Bible, Russell and other Bible Students came to regard Christian creeds and traditions as harmful errors. They saw their own work as restoring Christianity to the purity of its first century. Many contemporary Church leaders and scholars considered his views heretical. Russell agreed with other Protestants on the primacy of the Bible, and on justification by faith alone, but thought that errors had been introduced in interpretation. Russell agreed with many 19th-century Protestants, including Millerites, in the concept of a Great Apostasy that began in the first century AD. He also agreed with many other contemporary Protestants in belief in the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and in Armageddon.\nRussell's scriptural interpretations differed from those of Catholics, and of many Protestants, in the following areas: \nDeath.\nRussell's health declined markedly in the three years leading up to his death. During his final ministerial tour of the western and southwestern United States, he became increasingly ill with cystitis, but ignored advice to abandon the tour. Russell died on October 31, 1916, at age 64 near Pampa, Texas, while returning to Brooklyn by train.\nAn associate of Russell stated that Russell's body at age 64 was more worn out than that of his father who died at age 84. He was buried outside of Pittsburgh in United Cemetery, Ross Township, Pennsylvania. The gravesite is marked by a headstone. Nearby stood a pyramid memorial erected by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1921. The pyramid memorial was vandalized and subsequently removed in September 2021.\nLegacy.\nIn January 1917, Joseph Franklin Rutherford was elected president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, despite disputes over the election process. Further disputes arose over interpretation of sections of Russell's will dealing with the future contents of \"Zion's Watch Tower\" magazine, as well as who, if anyone, had authority to print new literature. By the end of the 1920s, nearly three-quarters of the Bible Student congregations had rejected Rutherford's on-going changes in organizational structure, doctrinal interpretations, and congregational practices, some of which began to appear in material printed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as early as 1917. Many Bible Students were disaffected by Rutherford's rejection of Russell's views regarding his role in the restoration of the \"truth\" and support of the Great Pyramid as having been built under God's direction.\nThose remaining supportive of Rutherford adopted the new name \"Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931. They renamed their magazine as \"The Watchtower\". Many of the most prominent Bible Students who had left the society held their own meeting in October 1929 to gather other dissenters; the First Annual Bible Students Reunion Convention was held in the old Pittsburgh \"Bible House\" long used by Russell. These conventions were held yearly, but the process of 'regathering' took nearly twenty years.\nControversies.\nLeadership style.\nAs early as 1892, Russell's views and management style were strongly criticized by certain individuals associated with his ministry. In 1893, a paper was written and circulated to Bible Students in Pittsburgh by associates Otto van Zech, Elmer Bryan, J. B. Adamson, S. G. Rogers, Paul Koetitz, and others. It accused Russell of being a dictatorial leader, a shrewd businessman who appeared eager to collect funds from the selling of the \"Millennial Dawn\" books, of cheating one of them financially, and of issuing thousands of \"Millennial Dawn\" books under a female pseudonym.\nRussell wrote a booklet \"A Conspiracy Exposed and Harvest Siftings\" in response, issuing it as an extra to the April 1894 \"Zion's Watch Tower\" magazine. He intended to pre-empt efforts by his critics to circulate their views to a wider audience of Bible Students. Russell printed copies of letters he had received from these former associates to show that their claims were false, and that those involved 'were guided by Satan in an attempt to subvert his work' as a \"minister of the gospel\".\nAllegation of immoral conduct.\nIn 1897, Russell's wife, Maria, left him after a disagreement over the management of \"Zion's Watch Tower\" magazine. According to Russell's successor Joseph Franklin Rutherford, she believed that, as his wife, she should have equal control over its administration and equal privilege in writing articles, preaching, and traveling abroad as his representative. In 1903, she filed for legal separation on the grounds of mental cruelty, referring to forced celibacy and frequent cold, indifferent treatment by him. The separation was granted in 1906, with Russell charged to pay alimony.\nDuring the trial Mrs. Russell's attorney alleged that in 1894 Mr. Russell had engaged in \"improper intimacy\" with Rose Ball, by then a 25-year-old woman. The Russells had cared for her as a foster daughter said to be an orphan. Mrs. Russell alleged that Ball had told her Mr. Russell claimed to be an amorous \"jellyfish floating around\" to different women until someone responded to his advances. Mr. Russell denied the accusations and said he had never used such language to describe himself. When the judge asked Mrs. Russell if she was accusing her husband of adultery, she replied, \"No\".\n\"The Washington Post\" and the \"Mission Friend\" of Chicago reprinted the \"jellyfish\" story while also accusing Russell of immoral conduct. Russell sued the papers for libel; the jury decided in his favor, awarding him one dollar. Following an appeal, Russell received a cash settlement of $15,000 (current value $) plus court costs, and an agreement that the two papers publish his weekly syndicated sermons as well as a retraction defending his character.\nRose Ball later married and lived in Australia. As Rose Ball Henninges, she died November 22, 1950, at the age of 81 in Melbourne. For several years she had written articles for \"The People's Paper\" and was associated with the Bible Students in Australia until her death.\n'Miracle Wheat'.\nOn March 22, 1911, \"The Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" reported that Russell was accused of gaining profit from a strain of wheat named \"Miracle Wheat\" by K.B. Stoner of Fincastle, Virginia, who claimed to have discovered this strain. Russell sold the wheat for $60 per bushel, far above the average cost of wheat at the time. Throughout 1912 and 1913, the \"Eagle\" continued to report on Russell's alleged fraud. Russell sued the \"Eagle\" for libel, but lost. A government expert investigated the \"Miracle Wheat\" and said it \"was low in the Government tests\". Prior to entering the court, the \"Eagle\" declared that \"at the trial it will show that 'Pastor' Russell's religious cult is nothing more than a money-making scheme.\"\nRussell defended himself publicly, and in writing, claiming that the wheat was donated to the Watch Tower Society. He said that although sold for $1 per pound, Mr. Stoner allegedly routinely sold it for a $1.25 per pound. Russell claimed to have no financial connection to the wheat, and said that no one claimed a refund although he had offered one for up to a year later for any who were dissatisfied with their purchase. In 1975, the Watch Tower Society stated that gross receipts from the \"Miracle Wheat\" fundraiser totaled \"about $1800\" (current value $), of which \"Russell himself did not get a penny\". It also said that \"the Society itself made no claim for the wheat on its own knowledge and the mo\u2026ney received went as a donation into Christian missionary work.\"\nQualifications.\nIn June 1912, Rev. J. J. Ross (1871\u20131935), Pastor of the James Street Baptist Church in Hamilton, Ontario, published and widely distributed a four-page leaflet titled \"Some Facts about the Self-Styled \"Pastor\" Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame).\" He alleged that Russell was involved in questionable business practices, had defrauded his estranged wife, and denounced his qualifications, legitimacy and moral example as a pastor. Russell sued Ross for defamatory libel on December 2, 1912.\nAfter several delays the case came before Police Court Magistrate George H. Jelfs on March 17, 1913. During cross-examination Russell said that he had attended public school for seven years, having left when he was about fourteen years of age, after which he received instruction through private tutors. He said that he was versed in Latin terms \"to an extent\" but did not know Hebrew or Greek, that he had never been ordained by any bishop or minister, and had never attended a theological seminary or any schools of higher learning.\nThe Hamilton and Toronto Ontario newspapers reported the claims made by Ross and provided a brief outline of the court proceedings. They did not refer to any alleged misconduct on the part of Russell. They criticized Ross for having fled Ontario when summoned and not being present during any of the court proceedings.\nOn April 1, 1913, the High Court of Ontario returned a verdict of \"No Bill\" ruling that Russell was not entitled to damages because, the libel was not likely to result in any violence within Canada. Following the libel case, Ross published an expanded edition of 48-pages titled, \"Some Facts and More Facts about the Self-Styled \"Pastor\" Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame)\". In this work, Ross claimed that during the proceedings on March 17, 1913, Russell had repeatedly lied under oath by affirming that he was ordained, but denying the same when cross-examined, by affirming that he knew the Greek language, but when shown by Counselor Staunton an extract from the New Testament in Greek by Westcott &amp; Hort, he was unable to recognize it, and that he had not been divorced from his wife, but retracted the statement under cross-examination.\nIn response, Russell stated through various printed and public sources that he had never claimed knowledge of the Greek language, merely the alphabet and that early Christians were also criticized by the religious authorities for being unlearned and ignorant. He believed that his ordination was \"of God\" according to the biblical pattern, not requiring any denominational approval or theological training. He suggested that his annual election as \"Pastor\" by over 500 congregations worldwide constituted him as properly ordained. Russell contended that Ross and others were attacking him because they were unable to answer his theological arguments, preferring instead to resort to slander and character assassination.\nUse of Masonic symbolism.\nSome have claimed that various symbols Russell employed in his published literature are Masonic in nature, and that such associations implied he engaged in occult activity. In later editions of the \"Studies in the Scriptures\" series a winged solar disk was stamped on the front cover, a symbol that is also associated with Freemasonry. However, Russell's use of the winged solar-disk originated from his understanding of Malachi 4:2, which denotes a sun with wings, as a symbol that Christ's millennial Kingdom had begun to emerge.\nSome critics also claim that the pyramid that stood near Russell's gravesite was Masonic because of its shape and its use of the Cross and Crown symbol, although this remains disputed. The Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon has said that Russell was not a Freemason, and notes that the symbols pre-date the fraternity.\nIn June 1913, during a transcontinental speaking tour, Russell lectured in a Masonic hall in San Francisco, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Although I have never been a Mason\u2026 Something I do seems to be the same as Masons do, I don't know what it is; but they often give me all kinds of grips and I give them back, then I tell them I don't know anything about it except just a few grips that have come to me naturally.\nThroughout his ministry he said that he believed Christian identity is incompatible with Freemasonry. He described Freemasonry, Knights of Pythias, Theosophy, and other such groups as \"grievous evils\" and \"unclean\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is west of the City of London and north of the River Thames, in which many of the city's major tourist attractions, shops, businesses, government buildings and entertainment venues, including West End theatres, are concentrated - and as such the term \"West End\" is used internationally as a metonym for London's theatre district and associated performing arts scene - just as \"Broadway\" is used to describe that of New York City.\nThe term was first used in the early 19th century to describe fashionable areas to the west of Charing Cross.\nWhile the City of London is the main financial district in London, the West End is the main commercial and entertainment centre of the city. It is the largest central business district in the United Kingdom. It is one of the most expensive locations in the world in which to rent commercial and office space.\nHistory.\nOver time they came to form the centre of modern London, although each kept its own distinct character and its separate legal identity (for example, the City of London has its own police force and is a distinct county). The City of London became a centre for the banking, financial, legal and professional sectors, while Westminster became associated with the leisure, shopping, commerce, and entertainment sectors, the government, and home to universities and embassies. The modern West End is closely associated with this area of central London.\nLying to the west of the historic Roman and medieval City of London, the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City. It was close to the royal seat of power at the Palace of Westminster (now home to parliament) and is largely contained within the City of Westminster (one of the 32 London boroughs).\nThe Great Fire of London did not directly affect the West End a great deal, but the huge loss of housing in the City of London led to a building boom in the west. This began with an initial development by Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans in the 1660s. Then, during the late 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, it was built as a series of palaces, expensive town houses, fashionable shops and places of entertainment. The areas closest to the City around Holborn, Seven Dials, and Covent Garden contained poorer communities that were cleared and redeveloped in the 19th century.\nBoundaries.\nAs the West End is a term used colloquially by Londoners and is not an official geographical or municipal definition, its exact constituent parts are debatable. Westminster City Council's 2005 report \"Vision for the West End\" included the following areas in its definition: Covent Garden, Soho, Chinatown, Leicester Square, the shopping streets of Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street, the area encompassing Trafalgar Square, the Strand and Aldwych, and the district known as Theatreland. The Edgware Road to the north-west and the Victoria Embankment to the south-east were also covered by the document but were treated as \"adjacent areas\" to the West End.\nAccording to Ed Glinert's \"West End Chronicles\" (2006) the districts falling within the West End are Mayfair, Soho, Covent Garden, Fitzrovia and Marylebone. By this definition, the West End borders Temple, Holborn and Bloomsbury to the east, Regent's Park to the north, Paddington, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge to the west, and Victoria and Westminster to the south. Other definitions include Bloomsbury within the West End.\nOne of the City of Westminster wards is called \"West End\". This electoral unit includes some of the most prosperous areas of the borough, including Soho, Mayfair and parts of southern Marylebone. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 10,575.\nAs part of the London Government Act 1963, the West End covers parts of the boroughs of Westminster and Camden.\nNotable streets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable squares and circuses.\nThe West End is laid out with many notable public squares and circuses.\nTransport.\nLondon Underground stations in the West End include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69888", "revid": "51057686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69888", "title": "New World Translation", "text": "Jehovah's Witnesses Bible translation\nThe New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT, also simply NW) is a translation of the Bible published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society; it is used and distributed by Jehovah's Witnesses. The New Testament portion was released first in 1950 as the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, with the complete \"New World Translation\" of the Bible released in 1961.\nIt is not the first Bible to be published by the Watch Tower Society, but it is its first translation into English. Commentators have noted that scholarly effort went into producing the translation but many have described it as \"biased\".\nHistory.\nUntil the release of the \"New World Translation\", Jehovah's Witnesses in English-speaking countries primarily used the \"King James Version\". According to the publishers, one of the main reasons for producing a new translation was that most Bible versions in common use, including the \"Authorized Version\" (King James), employed archaic language. The stated intention was to produce a fresh translation, free of archaisms. Additionally, over the centuries since the \"King James Version\" was produced, more copies of earlier manuscripts of the original texts in the Hebrew and Greek languages had become available. According to the publishers, better manuscript evidence had made it possible to determine with greater accuracy what the original writers intended, particularly in more obscure passages, allowing linguists to better understand certain aspects of the original languages.\nA fresh translation of the New Testament, which Jehovah's Witnesses usually refer to as the \"Christian Greek Scriptures\", was proposed in October 1946 by the president of the Watch Tower Society, Nathan H. Knorr. Work began on December 2, 1947, when the \"New World Bible Translation Committee\" was formed, composed of Jehovah's Witnesses who professed to be anointed. The Watch Tower Society is said to have \"become aware\" of the committee's existence a year later. The committee agreed to turn over its translation to the Society for publication and on September 3, 1949, Knorr convened a joint meeting of the board of directors of both the Watch Tower Society's New York and Pennsylvania corporations where he again announced to the directors the existence of the committee and that it was now able to print its new modern English translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Several chapters of the translation were read to the directors, who then voted to accept it as a gift. The \"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures\" was released at a Jehovah's Witness convention at Yankee Stadium, New York, on August 2, 1950.\nThe translation of the Old Testament, which Jehovah's Witnesses refer to as the \"Hebrew Scriptures\", was released in five volumes in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958, and 1960. The complete \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\" was released as a single volume in 1961, and has since undergone various revisions. Cross references that had appeared in the six separate volumes were updated and included in the complete volume in the 1984 revision.\nIn 1961, the Watch Tower Society began to translate the \"New World Translation\" into Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; the New Testament in these languages was released simultaneously in July 1963 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1989, the \"New World Translation\" was translated into eleven languages, with more than 56,000,000 copies printed.\nFor many years, the \"New World Translation\" was thought to be the Watch Tower Society's first original translation of ancient Biblical Hebrew, Koine Greek, and Old Aramaic biblical texts, until the re-discovery of the German (\"Magdeburg Bible\"), formally called (\"The Holy Scriptures\"). \nTranslators.\nThe \"New World Translation\" was produced by the New World Bible Translation Committee, formed in 1947. This committee is said to have comprised unnamed members of multinational backgrounds. The committee requested that the Watch Tower Society not publish the names of its members, stating that they did not want to \"advertise themselves but let all the glory go to the Author of the Scriptures, God,\" adding that the translation, \"should direct the reader, not to the translators, but to the Bible\u2019s Author, Jehovah God\". The publishers stated that \"the particulars of [the New World Bible Translation Committee's members] university or other educational training are not the important thing\" and that \"the translation testifies to their qualification\".\nFormer high-ranking Watch Tower staff have identified various members of the translation team. In 1983 former Governing Body member Raymond Franz listed Nathan H. Knorr, Fredrick W. Franz, Albert D. Schroeder, George D. Gangas, and Milton G. Henschel as members of the translation team, adding that only Frederick Franz had sufficient knowledge in biblical languages. Referring to the identified members, evangelical minister Walter Ralston Martin said in 1997, \"The New World Bible translation committee had no known translators with recognized degrees in Greek or Hebrew exegesis or translation... None of these men had any university education except Franz, who left school after two years, never completing even an undergraduate degree.\" Fredrick Franz had stated that he was familiar with not only Hebrew, but with Greek, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French for the purpose of biblical translation. In 2003, Jason BeDuhn noted, \"the members of the translation team remain anonymous, just as they do for the NKJB and the Lockman Foundation's NASB\".\nTranslation Services Department.\nIn 1989, a Translation Services Department was established at the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, overseen by the Writing Committee of the Governing Body. The goal of the Translation Services Department was to accelerate Bible translation with the aid of computer technology. Previously, some Bible translation projects lasted twenty years or more. Under the direction of the Translation Services Department, translation of the Old Testament in a particular language may be completed in as little as two years. During the period from 1963 to 1989, the \"New World Translation\" became available in ten additional languages. Since the formation of the Translation Services Department in 1989, there has been a significant increase in the number of languages in which the \"New World Translation\" has been made available.\n2013 revision.\nAt the Watch Tower Society's annual meeting on October 5, 2013, a significantly revised translation was released. Referring to the new revision, the publishers stated, \"There are now about 10 percent fewer English words in the translation. Some key Biblical terms were revised. Certain chapters were changed to poetic format, and clarifying footnotes were added to the regular edition.\"\nThe Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53 \u2013 8:11) and the Short and Long Conclusions of Mark 16 (Mark 16:8\u201320)\u2014offset from the main text in earlier editions\u2014were removed. The new revision was also released as part of an app called \"JW Library\". The 2013 edition of the \"New World Translation\" has been translated, in whole or in part, into more than 326 languages.\nTranslation.\nAccording to the Watch Tower Society, the \"New World Translation\" attempts to convey the intended sense of original-language words according to the context. The original \"New World Translation\" employs nearly 16,000 English expressions to translate about 5,500 biblical Greek terms, and over 27,000 English expressions to translate about 8,500 Hebrew terms. The translators state that, where possible in the target language, the \"New World Translation\" prefers literal renderings and does not paraphrase the original text.\nTextual basis.\nThe master text used for translating the Old Testament into English was Kittel's Biblia Hebraica. The Hebrew texts, Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia and Biblia Hebraica Quinta were used for preparing the latest version of this translation. Other works consulted in preparing the translation include Aramaic Targums, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Torah, the Greek Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, the Masoretic Text, the Cairo Codex, the Aleppo Codex, Christian David Ginsburg's Hebrew Text, and the Leningrad Codex.\nThe Greek master text by the Cambridge University scholars B. F. Westcott and F. J. A. Hort (1881) was used as the basis for translating the New Testament into English. The committee also referred to the Novum Testamentum Graece (18th edition, 1948) and to works by Jesuit scholars Jos\u00e9 M. Bover (1943), and Augustinus Merk (1948). The United Bible Societies' text (1975) and the Nestle-Aland text (1979) were used to update the footnotes in the 1984 version. Additional works consulted in preparing the \"New World Translation\" include the Armenian Version, Coptic Versions, the Latin Vulgate, Sistine and Clementine Revised Latin Texts, Textus Receptus, the Johann Jakob Griesbach's Greek text, the Emphatic Diaglott, and various papyri.\nOther languages.\nTranslation into other languages is based on the English text, supplemented by comparison with the Hebrew and Greek text. The complete \"New World Translation\" has been published in more than one hundred languages or scripts, with the New Testament available in more than fifty additional languages.\nWhen the Writing Committee approves the translation of the Bible into a new language, it appoints a group of baptized Jehovah's Witnesses to serve as a translation team. Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English \"New World Translation\" with related English words grouped together (e.g. \"atone\", \"atonement\", or \"propitiation\"). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target language. Further editing and translation are then performed to produce a final version.\nFeatures.\nThe layout resembles the 1901 edition of the American Standard Version. The translators use the terms \"Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures\" and \"Christian Greek Scriptures\" rather than \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\", stating that the use of \"testament\" was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14. Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an \"Outline of Contents\" introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.\nSquare brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun \"you\" was printed in small capitals (i.e., ) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The \"New World Translation\" attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as \"proceeded to rest\" in Genesis 2:2 instead of \"rested\". The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.\nUse of the name \"Jehovah\".\nThe name \"Jehovah\" is a translation of the Tetragrammaton (, transliterated as \"YHWH\", though the original pronunciation is unknown). The \"New World Translation\" uses the name \"Jehovah\" 6,979 times in the Old Testament. According to the Watch Tower Society, the Tetragrammaton appears in \"the oldest fragments of the Greek Septuagint\". In reference to the \"Septuagint\", biblical scholar Paul E. Kahle stated, \"We now know that the Greek Bible text as far as it was written by Jews for Jews did not translate the Divine name by Kyrios, but the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in such MSS (manuscripts). It was the Christians who replaced the Tetragrammaton by Kyrios when the divine name written in Hebrew letters was not understood any more.\" However, according to professor Albert Pietersma, since pre-Christian times \"Adonai\" and the Tetragrammaton were considered equivalent to the Greek term \"kyrios\". Pietersma stated, \"The translators felt no more bound to retain the tetragram in written form than they felt compelled to render distinctively Hebrew el, Elohim or Shaddai.\" He also considers that old manuscripts containing the tetragram, like the papyrus Fouad 266, \"is evidence of a secondary stage.\"\nThe \"New World Translation\" also uses the name \"Jehovah\" 237 times in the New Testament where the extant texts use only the Greek words \"kyrios\" (\"Lord\") and \"theos\" (\"God\"). The use of \"Jehovah\" in the New Testament is very rare, but not unique to the \"New World Translation\". Walter Martin, an evangelical minister, wrote, \"It can be shown from literally thousands of copies of the Greek New Testament that not once does the tetragrammaton appear.\" However, the translators of the \"New World Translation\" believed that the name \"Jehovah\" was present in the original manuscripts of the New Testament when quoting from the Old Testament, but replaced with the other terms by later copyists. Based on this reasoning, the translators consider to have \"restored the divine name\", though it is not present in any extant manuscripts.\nEditions.\nIn 1984, a \"Reference\" edition of the \"New World Translation\" was released in addition to a revision of the regular volume. The regular edition includes several appendices containing arguments for various translation decisions, maps, diagrams and other information; and over 125,000 cross references. The reference edition contains the cross references and adds footnotes about translation decisions and additional appendices that provide further detail relating to certain translation decisions and doctrinal views. The \"Reference\" edition is out of print as of the release of the 2013 revision of the \"New World Translation\", but is available online.\n\"Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures\".\nThe New World Bible Translation Committee included the English text from the \"New World Translation\" in its 1969 and 1985 editions of \"The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures\". It also incorporates the Greek text published by Westcott and Hort in \"The New Testament in the Original Greek\" and a literal word-for-word translation.\nNon-print editions.\nIn 1978, the Watch Tower Society began producing recordings of the \"New World Translation\" on audio cassette, with the New Testament released by 1981 and the Old Testament in three albums released by 1990. In 2004, the NWT was released on compact disc in MP3 format in major languages. Since 2008, audio downloads of the NWT have been made available in 18 languages in MP3 and AAC formats, including support for podcasts.\nIn 1983, the English Braille edition of the \"New World Translation\"'s New Testament was released; the complete English Braille edition was released by 1988. NWT editions have since become available in several additional Braille scripts. Production of the NWT in American Sign Language began in 2006; the New Testament was made available by 2010, and the complete ASL edition was released in February 2020.\nIn 1992, a digital edition of the \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\u2014With References\" was released on floppy disk. Since 1994, the \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\u2014With References\" has been included in the \"Watchtower Library on CD-ROM\". Both editions of the \"New World Translation\" are available online in various languages and digital formats.\nSince 2015, a \"Study Edition\" of the \"New World Translation\" has been gradually released online starting with the books of the New Testament, based on the 2013 revision with additional reference material.\nCritical review.\nBiblical scholars have noted the New World Translation's attempts at accurate conservative translation, its critical apparatus, and its use of modern critical editions of the biblical manuscripts. Criticism of the New World Translation focuses mainly on Christological issues in its rendering of the New Testament: the translation of the word \"Kyrios\" (Greek: \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) as \"Jehovah\" \u2014usually translated as \"Lord\" by classical translators, its rendering of passages related to the doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ such as , and for its difficult-to-understand formal equivalence. Critics of the movement claim that the NWT is scholastically dishonest.but\nOverall review.\nIn its review of Bible translations released from 1955 to 1985, \"The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary\" listed the \"New World Translation\" among the major modern translations.\nIn 1982, Pentecostal theologian Gordon Fee and Douglas K. Stuart in their \"How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth\" refer to the \"New World Translation\" as being an \"extremely literal translation\" filled with \"heretical doctrines\". In 1985, Alan Stewart Duthie responded to the assertion by Fee &amp; Stuart that the NWT is \"filled with the heretical doctrines of this cult\", stating that although \"there are some heretical doctrines to be found ... [it] does not reach even 0.1% of the whole, which is very far from 'full'\". Duthie adds \"if your purpose is to study the Bible in detail [...] then you can be recommended to use NJB or NAB for their accessibility and commentary features, or study edition of other translations. If your study interest is more in the original wording, then you could use RSV or NWT or NASV\".\nIn October 1996, James B. Parkinson compared various translations and gave scores for accuracy for 30 Old Testament translations and 51 New Testament translations. Parkinson gave a score of 76 to the NWT Old Testament (1960). For the New Testament he gave the NWT (1950) overall: 75, manuscripts: 99 and translation: 66.5. He scored the \"Kingdom Interlinear Translation\" (1985) overall: 80, manuscripts: 99 and translation: 73.5. Parkinson stated, \"the Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation (NWT, 1950) offers a relatively accurate translation from a different theological perspective. Like Rotherham, though, it is often not smooth reading.\"\nJason BeDuhn stated in 2003 that the differences between Jehovah's Witnesses' theology and that of mainstream denominations, \"creates a hostile atmosphere in which every representative of that mainstream theology charges that any variation in the NW from more familiar translation must serve the ulterior motives of distorting the 'truth'\".\nIn 2004, Anthony Byatt and Hal Flemings published their anthology \"'Your Word is Truth', Essays in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (1950, 1953)\". They included essays responding to criticism of the \"New World Translation\" from non-Witnesses, and a bibliography of reviews of the work.\nGeorge D. Chryssides stated in 2019 that the unfavourable criticisms by Harold Henry Rowley (1953), Julius R. Mantey (1974) and William Barclay (1953) \"were extremely vague\", but that Bruce M. Metzger (1953) \"mentioned a few specific passages which he believed were wrongly translated.\"\nOld Testament.\nRegarding the \"New World Translation\"'s use of English in the first volume of the \"New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures\" (\"Genesis to Ruth\", 1953), biblical scholar Harold Henry Rowley was critical of what he called \"wooden literalism\" and \"harsh construction\". He characterized these as \"an insult to the Word of God\", citing various verses of Genesis as examples. Rowley concluded, \"From beginning to end this [first] volume is a shining example of how the Bible should not be translated.\" He added in a subsequent review that \"the second volume shows the same faults as the first.\" While a member of the denomination, Rolf Furuli\u2014a former professor in Semitic languages\u2014said that a literal translation that follows the sentence structure of the source language rather than target language must be somewhat wooden and unidiomatic. Furuli added that Rowley's assessment based on his own preference for idiomatic translations ignores the NWT's stated objective of being as literal as possible.\nSamuel Haas, in his 1955 review of the first volume of the NWT in the \"Journal of Biblical Literature\", stated that he did not agree with the introduction of the name Jehovah: \"religious bias is shown most clearly in the policy of translating the tetragrammaton as Jehovah.\" He concluded, \"this work indicates a great deal of effort and thought as well as considerable scholarship, it is to be regretted that religious bias was allowed to colour many passages.\"\nIn 1960, Frederick William Danker wrote, \"not to be snubbed is the \"New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, Rendered from the Original by the New World Translation Committee\"... 'the orthodox' do not possess all the truth, yet one does well to 'test the spirits'.\"\nIn 1981, biblical scholar Benjamin Kedar-Kopfstein stated that the Old Testament work is largely based on the formal structure of biblical Hebrew. In 1989, Kedar-Kopfstein said, \"In my linguistic research in connection with the Hebrew Bible and translations, I often refer to the English edition of what is known as the 'New World Translation.' In so doing, I find my feeling repeatedly confirmed that this work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as accurate as possible. Giving evidence of a broad command of the original language, it renders the original words into a second language understandably without deviating unnecessarily from the specific structure of the Hebrew. ... Every statement of language allows for a certain latitude in interpreting or translating. So the linguistic solution in any given case may be open to debate. But I have never discovered in the 'New World Translation' any biased intent to read something into the text that it does not contain.\" In 1993 Kedar-Kopfstein said that the NWT is one of his occasionally quoted reference works.\nNew Testament.\nEdgar J. Goodspeed, translator of the New Testament in \"\", positively evaluated the New World translation. According to the October 15, 1999 issue of \"The Watchtower\", Goodspeed wrote to the Watch Tower Society in 1950 stating, \"I am interested in the mission work of your people, and its world wide scope, and much pleased with the free, frank and vigorous translation. It exhibits a vast array of sound serious learning, as I can testify.\"\nSteven T. Byington said in 1950, \"Jehovah's Witnesses have made their own translation of the book for which they consider 'New Testament' an illegitimate name. It is well supplied with faults and merits.\" Byington reports that he agrees with the translation of some words and not others. Regarding the introduction of the name Jehovah instead of lord, Byington says: \"fifteen pages of the preface present the arguments to justify this. I think the justification insufficient; but the 'Jehovah' does not shock a reader\". He also says that the arrangement of the verse numbers escapes confusion \"by making its verse numbers much lighter\" and adds that \"the use of a cheap quality of paper enables the publishers to cut the price below the already low price of the\" Revised Standard Version. Byington concludes: \"the book does not give enjoyable continuous reading; but if you are digging for excellent or suggestive renderings, this is among the richer mines.\"\nIn 1952, religious writer Alexander Thomson wrote of the \"New World Translation\": \"The translation is evidently the work of skilled and clever scholars, who have sought to bring out as much of the true sense of the Greek text as the English language is capable of expressing. ... We heartily recommend the \"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures\", published in 1950 by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.\" In 1959, Thomson added that on the whole the version was quite a good one, even though it was padded with many English words which had no equivalent in the Greek or Hebrew.\nAllen Wikgren (member of the \"New Revised Standard Version\" committee, as well as the committee which produced the USB Greek text) said in 1952, \"independent readings of merit often occur in other modern speech versions, such as Verkyl's New Testament (1945) and the Jehovah's Witnesses' edition of the New Testament (1950)\". \nIn 1953, former American Bible Society board member Bruce M. Metzger stated that the translation was written to support Jehovah's Witness doctrines, with \"several quite erroneous renderings of the Greek\", and cited 6 examples (John 1:1, Col. 1:15-17, Phil. 2:6, Titus 2:13, 2 Pet. 1:1, and Rev. 3:14). In 1964, Metzger again reviewed the NWT and concluded, \"on the whole, one gains a tolerably good impression of the scholarly equipment of the translators (their names are not divulged). They refer not only to modern translations [...] but to ancient translations as well. Frequently an intelligent use of a critical information is apparent\". Metzger noted that the consistency in the decision to translate \"the same Greek word by the same word in English as a specious show of faithfulness to the original tends to produce a certain woodenness, resulting in the distortion of the effect of the original\". Metzger considered the rendering of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as Jehovah in the New World Translation to be indefensible: \"Some of the translations which are simply indefensible include the following. The introduction of the word 'Jehovah' into the New Testament text\". He added, \"it is entirely without critical significance to be told that modern translations of the New Testament\" render 'Lord' by the Tetragrammaton. Metzger also criticized the NWT's renderings of three verses: John 1:1 and Colossians 1:16, as in 1953, and adds Jude 11\u201315.\nJ. Carter Swaim in 1953 wrote that \"objection is sometimes made to new translations on the ground that to abolish archaic phrases tends to cheapen the Scripture\". Referring to the \"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures\" he added: \"it is a translation that has its own peculiarities, and its own excellences too. The Witnesses, who are enthusiastic in the spread of their tenets, regard this as one of their most effective devices\".\nTheologian William Barclay concluded in 1953, \"the deliberate distortion of truth by this sect is seen in their New Testament translations. John 1:1 is translated: '...the Word was a god,' a translation which is grammatically impossible... It is abundantly clear that a sect which can translate the New Testament like that is intellectually dishonest\".\nIn 1954, Unitarian theologian Charles Francis Potter stated about the \"New World Translation\": \"Apart from a few semantic peculiarities like translating the Greek word \"stauros\" as 'stake' instead of 'cross', and the often startling use of the colloquial and the vernacular, the anonymous translators have certainly rendered the best manuscript texts, both Greek and Hebrew, with scholarly ability and acumen.\"\nFrederick E. Mayer wrote in 1954: \"It is a version that lends support to denial of doctrines which the Christian churches consider basic, such as the co-equality of Jesus Christ with the Father, the personhood of the Holy Spirit, and the survival of the human person after physical death. It teaches the annihilation of the wicked, the non-existence of hell, and the purely animal nature of man's soul.\"\nIn 1961 F. F. Bruce stated: \"some of its distinctive renderings reflect the biblical interpretations which we have come to associate with Jehovah's Witnesses (e. g. 'the Word was a god\" in John 1:1)\". He also stated that \"some of the renderings which are free from a theological tendency strike one as quite good\".\nIn his review in \"Andover Newton Quarterly\" Robert M. McCoy reported in 1963: \"in not a few instances the \"New World Translation\" contains passages which must be considered as 'theological translations.' This fact is particularly evident in those passages which express or imply the deity of Jesus Christ.\" He concludes: \"The translation of the New Testament is evidence of the presence in the movement of scholars qualified to deal intelligently with the many problems of Biblical translation. This translation, as J. Carter Swaim observes, has its peculiarities and its excellences. All in all, it would seem that a reconsideration of the challenge of this movement to the historic churches is in order.\" \nIn 1963, theologian Anthony A. Hoekema wrote, \"Their New World Translation of the Bible is by no means an objective rendering of the sacred text into modern English, but is a biased translation in which many of the peculiar teachings of the Watchtower Society are smuggled into the text of the Bible itself.\"\nSamuel MacLean Gilmour said in 1966: \"in 1950 the Jehovah's Witnesses published their New World Translation of The New Testament, and the preparation of the New World Old Testament translation is now far advanced. The New Testament translation was made by a committee whose membership has never been revealed\u2014a committee that possessed an unusual competence in Greek and that made the Westcott and Hort Greek text basic to their translation. It is clear that doctrinal considerations influenced many turns of phrase, but the work is no crack-pot or pseudo-historical fraud\".\nIn 1967, Robert H. Countess wrote that the \"NWT has certain praiseworthy features\u2014for example, an \"apparatus criticus\"\u2014everyone must admit\", but described the NWT's rendering of \"a god\" at John 1:1 as \"most unfortunate for several reasons\". In 1982, in his critical analysis \"The Jehovah's Witness' New Testament\" he wrote that the NWT \"must be viewed as a radically biased piece of work. At some points it is actually dishonest. At others it is neither modern nor scholarly.\" Rolf Furuli, while a member of the denomination, responded, \"Countess ascribes to the NWT translators rules for translation which they have never expressed, and then he shows inconsistently the translators have followed these rules [...] His account of the NWT, therefore, is not a balanced, scholarly presentation; rather, it surrenders both to emotionally inspired caricature and a partisan spirit\".\nJulius R. Mantey, the co-author of \"A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament\" and \"A Hellenistic Greek Reader\", said in 1980 that the NWT's rendering of John 1:1 is \"a shocking mistranslation\" and \"Obsolete and incorrect\".\nIn 2003, theologians John Weldon and John Ankerberg reviewed the \"New World Translation\", stating: \"it is our goal in this article to briefly critique the English translation of the Jehovah's Witnesses' Watchtower Bible and Tract Society's The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT)\". Weldon and Ankerberg accused the \"New World Translation\"'s translators of renderings that conform \"to their own preconceived and unbiblical theology\", citing several examples that they considered to support theological views in favor of accurate translation.\nThe 2003 edition of the \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" states, \"[Jehovah's Witnesses] are allowed no other books than the Bible and the society's own publications, which includes its own translation of the Bible with an impressive critical apparatus. The work is excellent except when scientific knowledge comes into conflict with the accepted doctrines of the movement. In their so-called \"New World Translation\", the term \"Kyrios\" is rendered Jehovah instead of Lord everywhere in the New Testament (237 times) except at Philippians 2.11, where St. Paul refers the word to Christ.\"\nIn 2004, historian Jason BeDuhn examined New Testament passages in which he believed \"bias is most likely to interfere with translation\" from nine of \"the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world\". BeDuhn compared the \"King James\", the \"(New) Revised Standard\", the \"New International\", the \"New American Bible\", the \"New American Standard Bible\", the \"Amplified Bible\", the \"Living Bible\", \"Today's English\" and the NWT versions in Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:6, Colossians 1:15\u201320, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58, John 1:1. For each passage, he compared the Greek text with the renderings of each English translation, and looked for biased attempts to change the meaning. BeDuhn said that the \"New World Translation\" was \"not bias free\", adding that whilst the general public and various biblical scholars might assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias, he considered it to be \"the most accurate of the translations compared\", and a \"remarkably good translation\". He added that \"most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation\". Despite his positive review, BeDuhn said the introduction of the name \"Jehovah\" into the New Testament 237 times was \"not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy\", and that it \"violate[s] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God\". In rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticized BeDuhn's positive review of the \"New World Translation\", stating that BeDuhn's main goal is to deny the deity of Christ. According to Howe, \"in this critical evaluation, BeDuhn's arguments are challenged and his conclusions called into question\".\nIn 2008, Kenneth J. Baumgarten and Kevin Gary Smith published an article in the South African Theological Seminary's journal, \"Conspectus\", entitled, \"An Examination of the Consistency of the New World Translation with the Stated Philosophy of the Translators\", in which they studied the use of \"the Greek term \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 in reference to Jesus Christ\" and concluded that \"in seven of the nine sample texts, the NWT violates one or more of its stated translation values and principles. They said the most common violation is its pervasive tendency to subvert the most natural understanding of the Greek text in favour of a 'preferred religious view'.\"\nGeorge D. Chryssides noted in 2016 that the New World Translation's rendering of passages about Christ's role in the creation of the world\u2014for example, Colossians 1:15-17\u2014are phrased in such a way as to suggest that Christ was created and not, as the Nicene Creed states, \"begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God.\"\nCommentary about non-English versions.\nCees Houtman wrote of the Dutch translation in 1984: \"respect and knowledge are the requirements that a translator must meet. It was noted above that in the past distrust was often expressed regarding the translation work of persons belonging to a different modality or denomination and there was a fear of the theological points of view being reflected in the translation. A purely objective evaluation of translations, however, must conclude that only in very exceptional cases can passages be pointed out in which the confessional (or political and social) point of view of the translators shines through. Even the New World Translation of the Jehovah's Witnesses can survive the scrutiny of the critics. In this context, one should also note, for example, that Remonstrants and Mennonites were able to use the SV [(Statenvertaling)]. Scripture and religious beliefs tend to come to light in notes and introductions to translations.\"\nThe Evangelical German Bible Society reviewed the German-language edition of 1986 and described the NWT as a \"translation that is accurate in many respects, but tendentious in the sense of the special teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses\".\nIn 2004, Xabier Pikaza wrote of the Spanish translation, \"Traducci\u00f3n del Nuevo Mundo ... is the name given by Jehovah's Witnesses to their version of the Bible, which is based on the conviction that the other versions, in all languages, are somehow tainted by the presuppositions of the various churches and Christian confessions. Only this version would reflect the exact content of the Scriptures in the original languages, because 'The Bible is the Word of God as long as it is well translated'. It is not a direct translation from the original languages, but is made from the English text (published in 1960), although the editors claim to have faithfully consulted the original Hebrew and Greek texts. The edition, in two columns, is very well cared for; it includes a critical apparatus and numerous intertextual references. Many Catholic and Protestant scholars have accused this Bible of flaws and biased interpretations. But, on the whole, it offers a reliable vision of the Word of God, which can lead men to the New World, that is, to the Messianic Kingdom\".\nSverre B\u00f8e in 2011 said, \"the Norwegian version of The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT) by Jehovah's Witnesses intends to be 'accurate', literal and precise, and in many respects it really is. A number of dogmatic concerns, however, break with such principles, often based on an anti-trinitarian understanding\".\n\"Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures\".\nThomas Nelson Winter considered the \"Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures\" to be a \"highly useful aid toward the mastery of \"koine\" (and classical) Greek,\" adding that the translation \"is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate.\"\nJulius R. Mantey stated that the KIT \"changed the readings in scores of passages to state what Jehovah's Witnesses believe and teach. That is a distortion not a translation.\"\nAccording to the February 1, 1998 issue of \"The Watchtower\", Jason BeDuhn ordered copies of the KIT for his students at Indiana University Bloomington, and wrote that \"it is the best interlinear New Testament available\".\nControversial passages.\nMuch criticism of the \"New World Translation\" involves the rendering of certain texts in the New Testament considered to be biased in favor of specific Witness practices and doctrines. These include:\nRussia ban.\nThe New World Translation, along with the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, was banned in Russia in 2017, after the prosecution used quotes from Wikipedia to argue that the translation is extremist and not a true Bible. This decision was questioned by international observers, and even by Alexander Dvorkin, who had previously asked for the Jehovah's Witnesses' organization to be banned.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Binary heaps are a common way of implementing priority queues. The binary heap was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964 as a data structure for implementing heapsort.\nA binary heap is defined as a binary tree with two additional constraints:\nHeaps where the parent key is greater than or equal to (\u2265) the child keys are called \"max-heaps\"; those where it is less than or equal to (\u2264) are called \"min-heaps\". Efficient (that is, logarithmic time) algorithms are known for the two operations needed to implement a priority queue on a binary heap:\nBinary heaps are also commonly employed in the heapsort sorting algorithm, which is an in-place algorithm as binary heaps can be implemented as an implicit data structure, storing keys in an array and using their relative positions within that array to represent child\u2013parent relationships.\nHeap operations.\nBoth the insert and remove operations modify the heap to preserve the shape property first, by adding or removing from the end of the heap. Then the heap property is restored by traversing up or down the heap. Both operations take O(log \"n\") time.\nInsert.\nTo insert an element to a heap, we perform the following steps:\nSteps 2 and 3, which restore the heap property by comparing and possibly swapping a node with its parent, are called \"the up-heap\" operation (also known as \"bubble-up\", \"percolate-up\", \"sift-up\", \"trickle-up\", \"swim-up\", \"heapify-up\", \"cascade-up\", or \"fix-up\").\nThe number of operations required depends only on the number of levels the new element must rise to satisfy the heap property. Thus, the insertion operation has a worst-case time complexity of O(log \"n\"). For a random heap, and for repeated insertions, the insertion operation has an average-case complexity of O(1).\nAs an example of binary heap insertion, say we have a max-heap\nand we want to add the number 15 to the heap. We first place the 15 in the position marked by the X. However, the heap property is violated since 15 &gt; 8, so we need to swap the 15 and the 8. So, we have the heap looking as follows after the first swap:\nHowever the heap property is still violated since 15 &gt; 11, so we need to swap again:\nwhich is a valid max-heap. There is no need to check the left child after this final step: at the start, the max-heap was valid, meaning the root was already greater than its left child, so replacing the root with an even greater value will maintain the property that each node is greater than its children (11 &gt; 5; if 15 &gt; 11, and 11 &gt; 5, then 15 &gt; 5, because of the transitive relation).\nExtract.\nThe procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) while retaining the heap property is as follows:\nSteps 2 and 3, which restore the heap property by comparing and possibly swapping a node with one of its children, are called the \"down-heap\" (also known as \"bubble-down\", \"percolate-down\", \"sift-down\", \"sink-down\", \"trickle down\", \"heapify-down\", \"cascade-down\", \"fix-down\", \"extract-min\" or \"extract-max\", or simply \"heapify\") operation.\nSo, if we have the same max-heap as before\nWe remove the 11 and replace it with the 4.\nNow the heap property is violated since 8 is greater than 4. In this case, swapping the two elements, 4 and 8, is enough to restore the heap property and we need not swap elements further:\nThe downward-moving node is swapped with the \"larger\" of its children in a max-heap (in a min-heap it would be swapped with its smaller child), until it satisfies the heap property in its new position. This functionality is achieved by the Max-Heapify function as defined below in pseudocode for an array-backed heap \"A\" of length \"length\"(\"A\"). \"A\" is indexed starting at 1.\n // Perform a down-heap or heapify-down operation for a max-heap\n // \"A\": an array representing the heap, indexed starting at 1\n // \"i\": the index to start at when heapifying down\n Max-Heapify(\"A\", \"i\"):\n \"left\" \u2190 2\u00d7\"i\"\n \"right\" \u2190 2\u00d7\"i\" + 1\n \"largest\" \u2190 \"i\"\n if \"left\" \u2264 \"length\"(\"A\") and \"A\"[\"left\"] &gt; A[\"largest\"] then:\n \"largest\" \u2190 \"left\"\n if \"right\" \u2264 \"length\"(\"A\") and \"A\"[\"right\"] &gt; \"A\"[\"largest\"] then:\n \"largest\" \u2190 \"right\"\n if \"largest\" \u2260 \"i\" then:\n swap \"A\"[\"i\"] and \"A\"[\"largest\"]\n Max-Heapify(\"A\", \"largest\")\nFor the above algorithm to correctly re-heapify the array, no nodes besides the node at index \"i\" and its two direct children can violate the heap property. The down-heap operation (without the preceding swap) can also be used to modify the value of the root, even when an element is not being deleted.\nIn the worst case, the new root has to be swapped with its child on each level until it reaches the bottom level of the heap, meaning that the delete operation has a time complexity relative to the height of the tree, or O(log \"n\").\nInsert then extract.\nInserting an element then extracting from the heap can be done more efficiently than simply calling the insert and extract functions defined above, which would involve both an codice_1 and codice_2 operation. Instead, we can do just a codice_2 operation, as follows:\nPython provides such a function for insertion then extraction called \"heappushpop\", which is paraphrased below. The heap array is assumed to have its first element at index 1.\n // Push a new item to a (max) heap and then extract the root of the resulting heap. \n // \"heap\": an array representing the heap, indexed at 1\n // \"item\": an element to insert\n // Returns the greater of the two between \"item\" and the root of \"heap\".\n Push-Pop(\"heap\": List&lt;T&gt;, \"item\": T) -&gt; T:\n if \"heap\" is not empty and heap[1] &gt; \"item\" then: // &lt; if min heap\n swap \"heap\"[1] and \"item\"\n _downheap(\"heap\" starting from index 1)\n return \"item\"\nA similar function can be defined for popping and then inserting, which in Python is called \"heapreplace\":\n // Extract the root of the heap, and push a new item \n // \"heap\": an array representing the heap, indexed at 1\n // \"item\": an element to insert\n // Returns the current root of \"heap\"\n Replace(\"heap\": List&lt;T&gt;, \"item\": T) -&gt; T:\n swap \"heap\"[1] and \"item\"\n _downheap(\"heap\" starting from index 1)\n return \"item\"\nSearch.\nFinding an arbitrary element takes O(n) time.\nThis can be easily proved by considering that the heap is not sorted so we need to look through the whole tree to find the target element.\nDelete.\nDeleting an arbitrary element can be done as follows:\nDecrease or increase key.\nThe decrease key operation replaces the value of a node with a given value with a lower value, and the increase key operation does the same but with a higher value. This involves finding the node with the given value, changing the value, and then down-heapifying or up-heapifying to restore the heap property.\nDecrease key can be done as follows:\nIncrease key can be done as follows:\nBuilding a heap.\nBuilding a heap from an array of n input elements can be done by starting with an empty heap, then successively inserting each element. This approach, called Williams' method after the inventor of binary heaps, is easily seen to run in \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") time: it performs n insertions at \"O\"(log \"n\") cost each.\nHowever, Williams' method is suboptimal. A faster method (due to Floyd) starts by arbitrarily putting the elements on a binary tree, respecting the shape property (the tree could be represented by an array, see below). Then starting from the lowest level and moving upwards, sift the root of each subtree downward as in the deletion algorithm until the heap property is restored. More specifically if all the subtrees starting at some height formula_4 have already been \"heapified\" (the bottommost level corresponding to formula_5), the trees at height formula_6 can be heapified by sending their root down along the path of maximum valued children when building a max-heap, or minimum valued children when building a min-heap. This process takes formula_7 operations (swaps) per node. In this method most of the heapification takes place in the lower levels. Since the height of the heap is formula_8, the number of nodes at height formula_4 is formula_10. Therefore, the cost of heapifying all subtrees is:\nformula_11\nThis uses the fact that the given infinite series formula_12 converges.\nThe exact value of the above (the worst-case number of comparisons during the heap construction) is known to be equal to:\nformula_13,\nwhere \"s\"2(\"n\") is the sum of all digits of the binary representation of n and \"e\"2(\"n\") is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n.\nThe average case is more complex to analyze, but it can be shown to asymptotically approach 1.8814\u00a0\"n\" \u2212 2 log2\"n\" + \"O\"(1) comparisons.\nThe Build-Max-Heap function that follows, converts an array \"A\" which stores a complete\nbinary tree with \"n\" nodes to a max-heap by repeatedly using Max-Heapify (down-heapify for a max-heap) in a bottom-up manner.\nThe array elements indexed by\n\"floor\"(\"n\"/2) + 1, \"floor\"(\"n\"/2) + 2, ..., \"n\"\nare all leaves for the tree (assuming that indices start at 1)\u2014thus each is a one-element heap, and does not need to be down-heapified. Build-Max-Heap runs\nMax-Heapify on each of the remaining tree nodes.\n Build-Max-Heap (\"A\"):\n for each index \"i\" from \"floor\"(\"length\"(\"A\")/2) downto 1 do:\n Max-Heapify(\"A\", \"i\")\nHeap implementation.\nHeaps are commonly implemented with an array. Any binary tree can be stored in an array, but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be stored compactly. No space is required for pointers; instead, the parent and children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices. These properties make this heap implementation a simple example of an implicit data structure or Ahnentafel list. Details depend on the root position, which in turn may depend on constraints of a programming language used for implementation, or programmer preference. Specifically, sometimes the root is placed at index 1, in order to simplify arithmetic.\nLet \"n\" be the number of elements in the heap and \"i\" be an arbitrary valid index of the array storing the heap. If the tree root is at index 0, with valid indices 0 through \"n \u2212 \"1, then each element \"a\" at index \"i\" has\nAlternatively, if the tree root is at index 1, with valid indices 1 through \"n\", then each element \"a\" at index \"i\" has\nThis implementation is used in the heapsort algorithm which reuses the space allocated to the input array to store the heap (i.e. the algorithm is done in-place). This implementation is also useful as a Priority queue. When a dynamic array is used, insertion of an unbounded number of items is possible.\nThe codice_1 or codice_2 operations can then be stated in terms of an array as follows: suppose that the heap property holds for the indices \"b\", \"b\"+1, ..., \"e\". The sift-down function extends the heap property to \"b\"\u22121, \"b\", \"b\"+1, ..., \"e\".\nOnly index \"i\" = \"b\"\u22121 can violate the heap property.\nLet \"j\" be the index of the largest child of \"a\"[\"i\"] (for a max-heap, or the smallest child for a min-heap) within the range \"b\", ..., \"e\".\nBy swapping the values \"a\"[\"i\"] and \"a\"[\"j\"] the heap property for position \"i\" is established.\nAt this point, the only problem is that the heap property might not hold for index \"j\".\nThe sift-down function is applied tail-recursively to index \"j\" until the heap property is established for all elements.\nThe sift-down function is fast. In each step it only needs two comparisons and one swap. The index value where it is working doubles in each iteration, so that at most log2 \"e\" steps are required.\nFor big heaps and using virtual memory, storing elements in an array according to the above scheme is inefficient: (almost) every level is in a different page. B-heaps are binary heaps that keep subtrees in a single page, reducing the number of pages accessed by up to a factor of ten.\nThe operation of merging two binary heaps takes \u0398(\"n\") for equal-sized heaps. The best you can do is (in case of array implementation) simply concatenating the two heap arrays and build a heap of the result. A heap on \"n\" elements can be merged with a heap on \"k\" elements using O(log \"n\" log \"k\") key comparisons, or, in case of a pointer-based implementation, in O(log \"n\" log \"k\") time. An algorithm for splitting a heap on \"n\" elements into two heaps on \"k\" and \"n-k\" elements, respectively, based on a new view\nof heaps as an ordered collections of subheaps was presented in. The algorithm requires O(log \"n\" * log \"n\") comparisons. The view also presents a new and conceptually simple algorithm for merging heaps. When merging is a common task, a different heap implementation is recommended, such as binomial heaps, which can be merged in O(log \"n\").\nAdditionally, a binary heap can be implemented with a traditional binary tree data structure, but there is an issue with finding the adjacent element on the last level on the binary heap when adding an element. This element can be determined algorithmically or by adding extra data to the nodes, called \"threading\" the tree\u2014instead of merely storing references to the children, we store the inorder successor of the node as well.\nIt is possible to modify the heap structure to make the extraction of both the smallest and largest element possible in formula_14formula_15 time. To do this, the rows alternate between min heap and max-heap. The algorithms are roughly the same, but, in each step, one must consider the alternating rows with alternating comparisons. The performance is roughly the same as a normal single direction heap. This idea can be generalized to a min-max-median heap.\nDerivation of index equations.\nIn an array-based heap, the children and parent of a node can be located via simple arithmetic on the node's index. This section derives the relevant equations for heaps with their root at index 0, with additional notes on heaps with their root at index 1.\nTo avoid confusion, we define the level of a node as its distance from the root, such that the root itself occupies level 0.\nChild nodes.\nFor a general node located at index i (beginning from 0), we will first derive the index of its right child, formula_16.\nLet node i be located in level L, and note that any level l contains exactly formula_17 nodes. Furthermore, there are exactly formula_18 nodes contained in the layers up to and including layer l (think of binary arithmetic; 0111...111 = 1000...000 - 1). Because the root is stored at 0, the kth node will be stored at index formula_19. Putting these observations together yields the following expression for the index of the last node in layer l.\nformula_20\nLet there be j nodes after node i in layer L, such that\nformula_21\nEach of these j nodes must have exactly 2 children, so there must be formula_22 nodes separating i's right child from the end of its layer (formula_23).\nformula_24\nNoting that the left child of any node is always 1 place before its right child, we get formula_25.\nIf the root is located at index 1 instead of 0, the last node in each level is instead at index formula_18. Using this throughout yields formula_27 and formula_28 for heaps with their root at 1.\nParent node.\nEvery non-root node is either the left or right child of its parent, so one of the following must hold:\nHence,\nformula_31\nNow consider the expression formula_32.\nIf node formula_1 is a left child, this gives the result immediately, however, it also gives the correct result if node formula_1 is a right child. In this case, formula_35 must be even, and hence formula_36 must be odd.\nformula_37\nTherefore, irrespective of whether a node is a left or right child, its parent can be found by the expression:\nformula_38\nRelated structures.\nSince the ordering of siblings in a heap is not specified by the heap property, a single node's two children can be freely interchanged unless doing so violates the shape property (compare with treap). Note, however, that in the common array-based heap, simply swapping the children might also necessitate moving the children's sub-tree nodes to retain the heap property.\nThe binary heap is a special case of the d-ary heap in which d = 2.\nSummary of running times.\nHere are time complexities of various heap data structures. The abbreviation am. indicates that the given complexity is amortized, otherwise it is a worst-case complexity. For the meaning of \"O\"(\"f\")\" and \"\"\u0398\"(\"f\")\" see Big O notation.

Originally designed by Yisrael Galili and Yakov Lior in the late 1960s, the Galil was first produced by the state-owned Israel Military Industries and is now exported by the privatized Israel Weapon Industries.\nThe first Galil rifle was manufactured using RK 62 receivers. Moreover, the Galil design is largely based on the Finnish rifle RK 62 (a derivative of the AK-47).\nThe Israeli Army initially deployed the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO Galil in three basic configurations; the automatic rifle machine-gun (ARM), the automatic rifle (AR), and the short automatic rifle (SAR). A modernised, redesigned version of the Galil is produced since 2008, known as the Galil ACE.\nHistory.\nThe Belgian FN FAL battle rifle had initially been adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces in the late 1950s (chambered for the 7.62\u00d751mm cartridge). The FAL had its limitations, a common complaint being that the abundant local sand and dust exposure would cause weapon malfunction (later attributed to lack of stringent maintenance). Overall, however, the FN FAL was considered long and bulky. Its length and malfunctions became such consistent issues that during the 1973 Yom Kippur War some soldiers began arming themselves with the much smaller Uzi.\nDuring the Six-Day War the Israelis captured thousands of primarily Egyptian AK-47s. This rifle was proven reliable and controllable. The required maintenance was low enough that conscripted troops had less stringent regulations on the weapon's care.\nWhen the IDF began the process of procuring a new, automatic rifle, the AK-47 was considered, but the difficulty of procurement limited its viability. Hence the IDF specifically sought a weapon that would offer the same benefits as AK-47, such as low maintenance requirements, but would also have the accuracy of the M16 and FN FAL. The would-be standard weapon was originally named the Balashnikov, after the weapon's designer Yisrael Galili, whose last name was coincidentally similar to Kalashnikov before he changed it to the more Hebrew sounding Galili. Several weapons were tendered to the Israeli Army, in response to its specifications for a standard-issue assault rifle. These included the M16A1 and Stoner 63 from the US, and the HK33 (West Germany). An indigenous design was offered by Uziel Gal, creator of the Uzi submachine gun. This was found complex and unreliable.\nThe successful design was offered by Yisrael Galili and Yakov Lior, based on the 7.62\u00d739mm Valmet RK 62, an AK-47 derivative from Finland. (The first Galils were manufactured with Valmet RK 62 receivers.) At the time, the US was replacing European countries (especially France) as Israel's main partner and weapons supplier. Hence, Galil's rifle was chambered for the US 5.56\u00d745mm round (originally the US M193 55-grain version). Tests conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili's rifle emerging as the winner. However, issuance of the Galil was delayed by the sudden onset of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.\nThe Israeli army first used the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO caliber Galil in three basic configurations:\nAlthough the Galil was the official service rifle of Israel from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, it was never the principal rifle used (in terms of numbers). Around 1975, 60,000 M16A1s from the U.S. Military Aid Program (MAP) began to arrive in Israel that were quickly integrated into IDF service. The cost of producing the Galil for all IDF forces was very expensive, and Israel continued to purchase M16s and later M4s with military credit from the US, which had replaced many Galils then in service. In general, Israeli troops preferred the M16, because it was lighter and more accurate, if not quite as rugged and reliable. When the M4 came along, this weapon (with its short length and light weight) became even more attractive, along with the M4's versatility in using different optics without losing zeroing when the weapon was disassembled, plus other rail-mounted accessories. The M16 and M4 also proved to be better suited to the grenade launching role, using the US M203 integrated 40mm launcher. Israeli paratroops in particular preferred the M4 carbine to the Galil, while the M16 was retained for training recruits, reservists, Artillery Corps, and the Armored Corps (Heil HaShiryon).\nBy 2000, both the Galil ARM and AR variants were phased out from standard issue and replaced by M4 and M16 variants. The Galil SAR (\"G'lilon\") was kept in use by some rear-line services, including the Knesset Guard and the Artillery and Armored Corps, until around 2004.\nFor a short time, the Galil was licensed by NWM (Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek) De Kruithoorn N.V. for sales to a NATO country.\nCurrently they are only manufactured in Colombia by Indumil, alongside the Galil Ace and the Galil C\u00f3rdova, the latter of which was designed by Indumil.\n400 Galil rifles were purchased through the Antiguan government for the Medelin cartel.\nDesign details.\nOperating mechanism.\nThe Galil series of rifles are selective fire weapons operated by a Kalashnikov-pattern gas-driven long-stroke piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a rotary bolt with two locking lugs that lock into recesses milled into the receiver.\nWhen fired, a portion of the propellant gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a port, drilled at a 30\u00b0 angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier on the right side of the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.\nThe ejection of spent cases from the Galil is sometimes a violent action. Cases can be dented by the ejector and be thrown as much as 40\u00a0ft away from the rifle in some cases, depending on position.\nFeatures.\nThe Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American M1 Garand. The rifle's fire selector switch has three positions: S-A-R. The standard AK-47 style selector is retained on the right face of the receiver, and a dual thumb-selector is present on the left face above the pistol grip for easier manipulation. Pushing the left-selector to the rear position \"R\" (British terminology for \"repetition\"), provides semi-automatic fire. Pushing it to the middle position \"A\" produces fully automatic fire. Pushing the lever fully forward to \"S\" will activate the safety. Some models use a reverse-linkage RAS mechanism that performs the opposite action; pushing forward sets the rifle to Repetition or Automatic, and pulling rearward engages the safety,\nThe Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted sheet metal steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block, and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.\nThe Gas-Block, handguard retainers and folding-stock mechanism components are cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.\nThe weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.\nBarrel.\nEarly production models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized for use with M193 ammunition), while recent production models feature a 178mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted flash suppressor with 6 ports and can be used to launch rifle grenades (such as the BT/AT 52) or mount a bayonet lug attachment (it will accept the M7 bayonet).\nFeeding.\nThe Galil is fed from a curved, steel box magazine with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with ballistite (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end first in a similar manner to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type STANAG magazines. Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted that it is difficult to engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.\nSights.\nThe L-shaped rear sight has two apertures preset for firing at 0\u2013300\u00a0m and 300\u2013500\u00a0m respectively (the rear sight can only be adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous tritium capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100\u00a0m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter that is used to mount various optical sights.\nStock.\nThe standard stock found on the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin and spring pivoting mechanism; to fold the stock, the \"L\" bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the buttstock hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.\nThe bracket and knuckle assemblies feature camming surfaces that allow the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the buttstock rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead to the stock wobbling in both positions.\nThere were six different types of Galil folding stock (not including the Micro or Galatz models) that were utilized over time on the Galil and R4 series of weapons. Wooden AK47 type buttstocks were also offered by request, although none are known to have been used by any militaries and were mostly relegated to the civilian market.\nContrary to popular belief, all Galil folding stocks are made of tubular aluminum like its FAL rendition; steel was never used, as it would have added too much additional weight, and the aluminum stocks were more than durable for standard firing and rifle-grenade usage.\nVariants.\nGalil AR.\nThis variant is the standard rifle version, fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip, a side-folding tubular metal skeleton stock that folds to the right side (fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper). The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.\nGalil SAR.\nThis variant (aka: G'lilon) is configured with a shorter barrel. Due to having a shorter barrel, a corresponding shorter piston and gas tube as well as a unique gas block are also found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being used with the Armored Corps until 2005. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel. While the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.\nGalil ARM.\nThis variant is additionally equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler in temperature during sustained automatic fire, and also has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, can be used to open bottles by design (in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose, which damaged them). The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.\nMicro Galil.\nThe most recent addition to the Galil family of weapons is the MAR compact carbine, which retains the internal features of the original Galil with a completely new frame, operating system and an even shorter barrel. Introduced to the public at the second International Defence Industry Exhibition in Poland in 1994, the weapon was developed for use with the army and police special units, vehicle crews, army staff, special operations personnel and airborne infantry.\nThe MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size version of the Galil SAR (706\u00a0mm stock extended / 465\u00a0mm folded), weighing 2.98\u00a0kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel , receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has a cyclic rate of fire of around 650\u2013750 RPM (rounds per minute), which is a bit higher than the full sized rifles. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located on both sides of the receiver) has four settings: \"S\"\u2014weapon is safe, \"A\"\u2014automatic fire, \"B\"\u20143-round burst, \"R\"\u2014semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0\u2013300\u00a0m and beyond 300\u00a0m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer, and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164\u00a0kg, or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.\nThe MAR has undergone several changes over time, and it is worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the bolt carrier and protrudes through a slot cut in the receiver cover that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the bolt carrier is forward.\nGalil Sniper.\nThe 7.62mm Galil Sniper (aka: \"Galil Tzalafim\" or \"Galatz\") is a derivative of the ARM that is used in conjunction with high-quality 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ammunition for consistent accuracy.\nThe precision rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with a similar operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a proprietary 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a flash suppressor and a muzzle brake. It can be replaced with a sound suppressor, which requires the use of subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.\nThe weapon was modified with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds to the right side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6\u00d740) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing), and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.\nThe Galatz was first introduced in 1983. The SR-99 is a modernized version of the Galatz featuring an adjustable skeleton stock instead of a wooden stock, synthetic handguard, and a synthetic pistol grip. It is somewhat less rugged but more ergonomic.\nThe Galatz is made under license by Punj Lloyd Raksha Systems and the Z111 Factory in Vietnam.\nForeign variants.\nItalian variants.\nThe Italian firearms manufacturing firm Vincenzo Bernardelli manufactured under license quantities of the Galil assault rifle in two different models for governmental use in the 1980s. The Bernardelli Mod.377 VB-STD assault rifle was an outright clone of the Galil AR/ARM variant.\nThe Bernardelli Mod.378 VB-SR assault carbine was a modified clone of the Galil SAR with a different magazine well that accepted STANAG magazines, much similar in concept and look to the above-mentioned optional magazine adapter currently available for the Israeli-made models, except that the Bernardelli VB-SR could be manufactured with permanent STANAG magazine well modification on demand. The rifles competed to the trial for the adoption of a new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO caliber rifle, but lost to the Beretta 70/90 assault weapons system.\nBoth rifles have the A-R-S trigger group (S-E-F; Safe, Semi-Auto, Full-Auto). The STD can be adapted to mount the M203.\nThe VB-SR's parts can be changed with the R5 and the Galil SAR.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can occur as a migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache. There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.\nHeadaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society, which classifies it into more than 150 types of primary and secondary headaches. Causes of headaches may include dehydration; fatigue; sleep deprivation; stress; the effects of medications (overuse) and recreational drugs, including withdrawal; viral infections; loud noises; head injury; rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage; and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis).\nTreatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves analgesic (pain medication), especially in case of migraine or cluster headaches. A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.\nAbout half of adults have a headache in a given year. Tension headaches are the most common, affecting about 1.6\u00a0billion people (21.8% of the population) followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million (11.7%).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCauses.\nThere are more than 200 types of headaches. Some are harmless and some are life-threatening. The description of the headache and findings on neurological examination, determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best.\nHeadaches are broadly classified as \"primary\" or \"secondary\". Primary headaches are benign, recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems. For example, migraine is a type of primary headache. While primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability, they are not dangerous from a physiological point of view. Secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease, like an infection, head injury, vascular disorders, brain bleed, stomach irritation, or brain tumor. Secondary headaches can be dangerous. Certain \"red flags\" or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous.\nPrimary.\nNinety percent of all headaches are primary headaches. Primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old. The most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches. They have different characteristics. Migraines typically present with pulsing head pain, nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head, not accompanied by other symptoms. Such kind of headaches may be further classified into-episodic and chronic tension type headaches Other very rare types of primary headaches include:\nSecondary.\nHeadaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck. Some of these are not harmful, such as cervicogenic headache (pain arising from the neck muscles). The excessive use of painkillers can paradoxically cause worsening painkiller headaches.\nMore serious causes of secondary headaches include the following:\nGastrointestinal disorders may cause headaches, including Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, and hepatobiliary disorders. The treatment of the gastrointestinal disorders may lead to a remission or improvement of headaches.\nMigraine headaches are also associated with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). CVS is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting, and often occur alongside symptoms similar to those of migraine headaches (photophobia, abdominal pain, etc.).\nPathophysiology.\nThe brain itself is not sensitive to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth, and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.\nHeadaches often result from traction or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The pain receptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumours and cause headaches. Blood vessel spasms, dilated blood vessels, inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate pain receptors. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fibre to the nerve cells in the brain, signalling that a part of the body hurts.\nPrimary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches. The exact mechanisms which cause migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known. There have been different hypotheses over time that attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches.\nMigraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain. Previously, migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain. This vascular theory, which was developed in the 20th century by Wolff, suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels (vessels inside the brain), and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels (vessels just outside the brain). Dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves, causing a headache. The vascular theory is no longer accepted. Studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation, but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation.\nCurrently, most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain. Auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex (a part of the brain) known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity. Some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides or serotonin, causing inflammation in arteries, dura and meninges and also cause some vasodilation. Triptans, medications that treat migraines, block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels.\nPeople who are more susceptible to experiencing migraines without headaches are those who have a family history of migraines, women, and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy.\nTension headaches are thought to be caused by the activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles.\nCluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain, but the exact cause is unknown.\nDiagnosis.\nMost headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone. If the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous, further testing with neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be necessary. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not useful for headache diagnosis.\nThe first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new. A \"new headache\" can be a headache that has started recently, or a chronic headache that has changed character. For example, if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head, and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head, they have a new headache.\nRed flags.\nIt can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk, benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.\nThe American College for Emergency Physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches. They are as follows:\nA number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage. These \"red flag\" symptoms mean that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests.\nIn general, people complaining of their \"first\" or \"worst\" headache warrant imaging and further workup. People with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging, as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing, pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain. People with neurological findings on exam, such as weakness, also need further workup.\nThe American Headache Society recommends using \"SSNOOP\", a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache:\nOther red flag symptoms include:\nOld headaches.\nOld headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous. They are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches. Migraines are often unilateral, pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea or vomiting. There may be an aura (visual symptoms, numbness or tingling) 30\u201360 minutes before the headache, warning the person of a headache. Migraines may also not have auras. Tension-type headaches usually have bilateral \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting. However, some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap. It is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different.\nThe mnemonic 'POUND' helps distinguish between migraines and tension-type headaches. POUND stands for: \nOne review article found that if 4\u20135 of the POUND characteristics are present, a migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than a tension-type headache (likelihood ratio 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension-type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension-type headache: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as a headache trigger, and cheese as a headache trigger.\nCluster headaches are relatively rare (1 in 1000 people) and are more common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).\nTemporomandibular jaw pain (chronic pain in the jaw joint), and cervicogenic headache (headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck) are also possible diagnoses.\nFor chronic, unexplained headaches, keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers, such as association with menstrual cycle, exercise and food. While mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common, a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise.\nCephalalgiaphobia is fear of headaches or getting a headache.\nNew headaches.\nNew headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches. They can, however, simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome, like migraine or a tension headache.\nOne recommended diagnostic approach is as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual impairment, new seizures, new weakness, or new confusion, further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography scan (CT scan) to look for a brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. In an older person, if there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness, a temporal artery biopsy should be performed to look for temporal arteritis, immediate treatment should be started, if results of the biopsy are positive.\nNeuroimaging.\nOld headaches.\nThe US Headache Consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches. Most old, chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging. If a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine, neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality. If the person has neurological findings, such as weakness, on exam, neuroimaging may be considered.\nNew headaches.\nAll people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.\nThe American College of Radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations:\nLumbar puncture.\nA lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle. A lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have increased intracranial pressure), or other causes of increased intracranial pressure. In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.\nClassification.\nHeadaches are most thoroughly classified by the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which published the second edition in 2004. The third edition of the International Headache Classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version. This classification is accepted by the WHO.\nOther classification systems exist. One of the first published attempts was in 1951. The US National Institutes of Health developed a classification system in 1962.\nICHD-2.\nThe International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the International Headache Society. It contains explicit (operational) diagnostic criteria for headache disorders. The first version of the classification, ICHD-1, was published in 1988. The current revision, ICHD-2, was published in 2004. The classification uses numeric codes. The top, one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups. The first four of these are classified as primary headaches, groups 5-12 as secondary headaches, cranial neuralgia, central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups.\nThe ICHD-2 classification defines migraines, tension-types headaches, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough, exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.\nSecondary headaches are classified based on their cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headache may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system.\nICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.\nThe ICHD-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category. According to this system, there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain. Moreover, the ICHD-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified.\nAlthough the ICHD-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches (primarily primary headaches), it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner.\nNIH.\nThe NIH classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches.\nThe NIH system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches. In this case, primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural causes. According to this classification, primary headaches can only be vascular, myogenic, cervicogenic, traction, and inflammatory.\nManagement.\nPrimary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments. In those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit.\nSecondary headaches (caused by another disease).\nTreatment of secondary headaches involves treating their underlying cause. For example, a person with meningitis will require antibiotics, and a person with a brain tumor may require surgery, chemotherapy or brain radiation. The possible origins of a headache have been studied and classified.\nMigraines.\nMigraines can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes, but most people require medicines to control their symptoms. Medications are either to prevent getting migraines, or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts.\nPreventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month, headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling. Possible therapies include beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs. The type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has. For example, if the person also has depression, an antidepressant is a good choice.\nRescue (also known as abortive) treatment for migraines may be oral or sublingual (under the tongue) if the migraine is mild to moderate; if more severe, intravenous, rectal, or intramuscular administration may be needed. Mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication that mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.\nSphenopalatine ganglion block (SPG block, also known nasal ganglion block or pterygopalatine ganglion blocks) can abort and prevent migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches. It was originally described by American ENT surgeon Greenfield Sluder in 1908. Both blocks and neurostimulation have been studied as treatment for headaches.\nSeveral complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training, electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment, along with medications.\nTension-type headaches.\nTension-type headaches can usually be managed with NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and aspirin) an/or acetaminophen. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.\nCluster headaches.\nAbortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.\nFor people with extended periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1\u20132 hours before an attack.\nNeuromodulation.\nPeripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine. How it may work is still being looked into.\nEpidemiology.\nLiterature reviews find that approximately 64\u201377% of adults have had a headache at some point in their lives. During each year, on average, 46\u201353% of people have headaches. However, the prevalence of headache varies widely depending on how the survey was conducted, with studies finding lifetime prevalence of as low as 8% to as high as 96%. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. Only approximately 1\u20135% of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause.\nMore than 90% of headaches are primary headaches. Most of these primary headaches are tension headaches. Most people with tension headaches have \"episodic\" tension headaches that come and go. Only 3.3% of adults have chronic tension headaches, with headaches for more than 15 days in a month.\nApproximately 12\u201318% of people in the world have migraines. More women than men experience migraines. In Europe and North America, 5\u20139% of men experience migraines, while 12\u201325% of women experience migraines.\nCluster headaches are relatively uncommon. They affect only 1\u20133 per thousand people in the world. Cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded classification system was published by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a medical scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity. He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a sudden onset, temporary headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head.\nAnother classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by Thomas Willis, in \"De Cephalalgia\" in 1672. In 1787 Christian Baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic (primary headaches) and symptomatic (secondary ones), and defined 84 categories.\nChildren.\nIn general, children experience the same types of headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headaches in children is similar to that of adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well. If a young child is fussy, they may have a headache.\nApproximately 1% of emergency department visits for children are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4\u20136.9% of kids with a headache have a serious cause.\nJust as in adults, most headaches are benign, but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.\nWhen children complain of headaches, many parents are concerned about a brain tumor. Generally, headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting. One study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are: headache for greater than 6 months, headache related to sleep, vomiting, confusion, no visual symptoms, no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam.\nSome measures can help prevent headaches in children. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day, avoiding caffeine, getting enough and regular sleep, eating balanced meals at the proper times, and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches. Treatments for children are similar to those for adults, however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children.\nChildren who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults. In one study of 100 children with headache, eight years later 44% of those with tension headache and 28% of those with migraines were headache free. In another study of people with chronic daily headache, 75% did not have chronic daily headaches two years later, and 88% did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later.\nCardiac Cephalgia in Heart Attack.\nCardiac cephalgia is a rare type of headache occurring during myocardial infarction, characterized by sudden, severe head pain that typically develops during or immediately following a heart attack. The pain is usually located in the occipital or frontal regions and can be accompanied by other cardiac symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or radiating arm pain. This specific headache type is considered a potential warning sign of cardiac distress and requires immediate medical attention to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the island of [[Great Britain]], it is bordered by the [[Irish Sea]] to the north and west, [[England]] to the [[England\u2013Wales border|east]], the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south, and the [[Celtic Sea]] to the south-west. As of 2021[ [update]], it had a population of 3.2 million. It has a total area of and over of [[Coastline of Wales|coastline]]. It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including [[Snowdon]] (), its highest summit. The country lies within the [[Temperate climate|north temperate zone]] and has a changeable, [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Cardiff]].\nA distinct [[Culture of Wales|Welsh culture]] emerged among the [[Celtic Britons]] after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]] was completed by King [[Edward I of England]] in 1283, though [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] led the [[Welsh Revolt]] against [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|English rule]] in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was [[Annexation|annexed]] by England and incorporated within the [[English law|English legal system]] under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]. Distinctive [[Politics of Wales|Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century. [[Welsh Liberal Party|Welsh Liberalism]], exemplified in the late 19th and early 20th century by [[David Lloyd George]], was displaced by the growth of [[socialism]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a [[nationalist]] party, , was formed in 1925, and the [[Welsh Language Society]] in 1962. A governing system of [[Welsh devolution]] is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of [[Welsh law|devolved policy matters]].\nAt the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution in Wales|Industrial Revolution]], development of the [[Mining in Wales|mining]] and [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] industries transformed the country from an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] into an [[Industrial society|industrial]] one; the [[South Wales Coalfield]]'s exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales's population. Two-thirds of the population live in [[South Wales]], including Cardiff, [[Swansea]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and the [[South Wales Valleys|nearby valleys]]. The [[North East Wales|eastern region]] of [[North Wales]] has about a sixth of the overall population, with [[Wrexham]] being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are [[Population density|sparsely populated]]. Since decline of the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries, the [[public sector]], light and service industries, and [[Tourism in Wales|tourism]] play major roles in its [[Economy of Wales|economy]]. [[Agriculture in Wales]] is largely livestock-based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national [[Autarky|agricultural self-sufficiency]].\nBoth [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and English are [[official language]]s. A majority of the population of Wales speaks English. Welsh is the dominant language in parts of the [[North Wales|north]] and [[West Wales|west]], with a total of 538,300 [[Welsh language#Status|Welsh speakers]] across the entire country. Wales has [[List of World Heritage Sites in Wales|four UNESCO world heritage sites]], of which three are in the north.\nEtymology.\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same [[Old English]] root (singular , plural ), a descendant of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] , which was itself derived from the name of the [[Gauls]] known to the Romans as . This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Anglo-Saxons]] came to use the term to refer to the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in particular; the plural form evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. Historically in [[Great Britain|Britain]], the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. [[Cornwall]]) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. [[Walworth, County Durham|Walworth]] in County Durham and [[Walton, Leeds|Walton]] in West Yorkshire).\nThe modern Welsh name for themselves is , and is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced ) are descended from the [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] word , meaning 'fellow-countrymen', and probably came into use before the 7th century. In literature, they could be spelt or , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. The [[Romanization (cultural)|Latinised]] forms of these names, \"Cambrian\", \"Cambric\" and \"[[Cambria]]\", survive as names such as the [[Cambrian Mountains]] and the [[Cambrian]] geological period.\nHistory.\n[[File:Caradog (5227657).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Caratacus|Caradog]] (depicted by Thomas Prydderch), leader of the north Wales Celtic tribe the [[Ordovices]].]]\nAlthough the Welsh nation did not arise until the Middle Ages, the territory of Wales was permanently settled from the end of the last ice age onwards. These first farmers left many impressive funerary monuments, as well as settlement sites that speak to a dispersed culture. With the arrival of the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Great Orme]] in North Wales became Britain's premier producer of copper, one of the key ores for smelting bronze. It is likely that the wealth of mineral resources in Britain, and especially Wales, attracted the Roman invasion, but by this time the island had become distinctively Celtic in culture, and the [[Neolithic]] population was largely replaced. It was this [[Iron Age]] Celtic culture, and their common language, that were called the Britons by the Romans.\nWith the departure of the Romans, Britain fractured into various kingdoms. Despite this, there is a sense in which the Roman withdrawal of 383 created a post-Roman nation of Britons, with [[Magnus Maximus]] proclaimed Roman emperor in Britannia and Gaul. Although long before the term Cymry (the Welsh term for the Welsh) had been adopted, the concept of a British people, from which the Welsh would emerge, was created here.\nEncroachment by Germanic [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] gradually displaced the indigenous culture and language of the Britons, and one group of these Britons became isolated by the geography of the western peninsula, bounded by the sea and English neighbours. It was these English neighbours who named the land Wallia, and the people Welsh.\nThe people of Wallia, medieval Wales, remained divided into separate kingdoms that fought with each other as much as they fought their English neighbours.15 Neither were the communities homogeneously Welsh. Place name, historical records and archaeological evidence point to coastal Viking/Norse settlement in places such as Swansea, Fishguard and Anglesey, and Saxons settled inland amongst the Welsh in places such as Presteigne.\n[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.1.v) King Hywel cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Hywel Dda]] enthroned]]\nIn the 10th century, Hywel ap Cadell, later known as [[Hywel Dda]], formed the kingdom of Deheubarth from inheritances in Dyfed and Seisyllwg, and then gained control of the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys in 942. With control of nearly all the territory of Wales,22 he codified Welsh law, a law code that survived the later fracture of his kingdom, and that became a significant step in the creation of the nation.29 With a common culture and an external threat, the kingdoms of Wales began to see themselves as one people.30\nA century later the Kingdom of Gwynedd was in ascendency, and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn subdued all opposition by 1057, becoming the only king to unite all of Wales, and parts of England on the border. \"Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\"100\nThe kingdom did not last, and Gruffydd met his death as a result of a surprise attack by Tostig, brother of the English King, Harold. After Gruffydd's death, Harold married his widow, but she would be widowed again by the Norman invasion of England in 1066.\nThe Normans followed their invasion of England with incursions into Wales, forming the semi-independent Norman [[Welsh marches]] (from the French for borderlands), and dividing them from the unconquered Pura Wallia.25 The fortunes of Welsh marcher lords and various Welsh princes ebbed and flowed, until Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) forced all other Welsh princes to submit to him in 1216. Yet Wales was divided again after his death, and it was left for his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd to secure the supremacy once more, recognised as Prince of Wales by the English king, Henry III, in the treaty of Montgomery of 1267.\nRelations with Henry's successor, Edward I, broke down and led to a war of conquest, concluding in 1283 with English victory. The following year the statute of Rhuddlan ended Welsh independence. Wales was divided between principality, ruled by Edward; and the marches, ruled by feudal marcher lords. This persisted, despite the [[Glynd\u0175r rebellion|Welsh rebellion]] under Owain Glynd\u0175r of 1400\u20131415, until the rise of the Tudors, with Welsh support. With the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|Laws in Wales Acts]] of Henry VIII, the Welsh became full citizens in the Kingdom of England, with parliamentary representation. The Welsh border was also formally defined and the territory reunited.\n[[File:George Childs Dowlais Ironworks 1840.jpg|right|thumbnail|\"Dowlais Ironworks\" (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875)]]\nIn 1707 the act of union created the Kingdom of Great Britain. The industrial revolution and the beginning of empire led to the rapid increase in mining and exploitation of Welsh natural materials \u2013 metals, coal and slate. The population of Wales expanded rapidly and Wales moved to the centre of the British economy, but the changes bred resentment, this time towards industrialists and not the English state.61 Meanwhile, a series of religious revivals transformed the character of the nation, beginning a tradition of non-conformism. This carried over into the political sphere too. The rapid industrialisation of parts of Wales gave rise to strong and [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] Welsh [[working class]] movements which led to the [[Merthyr Rising 1831|Merthyr Rising of 1831]], the widespread support for [[Chartism]], and the [[Newport Rising]] of 1839. Strong liberal traditions were forged and later replaced by socialism. Since 1922 Wales has voted Labour in every general election.\nFrom the mid 19th century until 1914, Wales experienced a strengthened political culture, religious and cultural revival, renewed interest in Welsh literature, the revival of [[eisteddfodau]]. There was a thriving economy, a renewed interest in Welsh language, and music, non-conformist Christianity and the emergence of strong national identity, along with the founding of many national institutions. However, the period also saw the publication of a report on education that became known as the [[Treachery of the Blue Books]]. The report blamed Welsh language and non-conformism for poor educational standards. This fed the rise of the Welsh nationalist movement, expressed in the [[Cymru Fydd]] movement, which advocated for greater autonomy and recognition of Welsh identity within the United Kingdom. Calls for [[Welsh devolution|devolution]] grew over the course of a century, and in 1998 the Government of Wales Act created a devolved Welsh assembly for the first time, now renamed the Senedd or Welsh Parliament.\nGovernment and politics.\n[[File:Senedd.JPG|thumb|The [[Senedd building]], designed by [[Richard Rogers]], opened on [[Saint David's Day|St David's Day]] 2006.]]\nWales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom. [[ISO 3166-2:GB]] formerly defined Wales as a principality, with England and Scotland defined as countries and Northern Ireland as a province. However, this definition was raised in the Welsh Assembly in 2010 and the then [[Counsel General for Wales]], [[John Griffiths (Welsh politician)|John Griffiths]], stated, 'Principality is a misnomer and that Wales should properly be referred to as a country.' In 2011, ISO 3166-2:GB was updated and the term 'principality' was replaced with 'country'. UK Government toponymic guidelines state that, 'though there is a Prince of Wales, this role is deemed to be titular rather than exerting executive authority, and therefore Wales is described as a country rather than a principality.'\nIn the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] \u2013 the 650-member [[lower house]] of the UK Parliament \u2013 there are 32 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] (MPs) who [[List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (2024\u2013present)|represent Welsh constituencies]]. At the [[2024 United Kingdom general election in Wales|2024 general election]], 27 [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] and [[Labour Co-op]] MPs were elected, along with 4 [[Plaid Cymru]] MPs and 1 [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] MP from Wales. The [[Wales Office]] is a department of the UK government responsible for Wales, whose minister, the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] (Welsh secretary), sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|UK cabinet]].\nWales has a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]], [[unicameral]] legislature known as the [[Senedd]] (Senedd Cymru \u2013 Welsh Parliament) which holds devolved powers from the UK Parliament via a reserved powers model.\nFor the purposes of [[Local government in Wales|local government]], Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" are responsible for the provision of all local government services.\nDevolved Government.\n[[File:First Minister meeting with First Minister of Wales - 52943408033.jpg|thumb|right|First Minister [[Mark Drakeford]] meets with First Minister of Scotland [[Humza Yousaf]] in Edinburgh, 2023]]\nFollowing [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] in 1997, the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] created a Welsh devolved assembly, the [[National Assembly for Wales]], with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered. Eight years later, the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] reformed the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly. Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament's approval of legislative competence. It also gained powers to raise taxes. In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" or \"the Welsh Parliament\", commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh.\nDevolved areas of responsibility include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. The Welsh Government also promotes Welsh interests abroad.\nLaw.\n[[File:The Old Court House Ruthin Wales.jpg|thumb|The Old Court House, [[Ruthin]], Denbighshire, built 1401, following [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s attack on the town|alt=A half timbered building of two floors, with four sets of leaded windows to the front aspect and one set to the side. The build has a steep, slate roof, with a single chimney placed left of centre. Steps and a ramp lead up to its single visible entrance]]\n[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.4.r) Judge cropped.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a Welsh judge from the \"[[Laws of Hywel Dda]]\"]]By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at [[Whitland]] around 930 by [[Hywel Dda]], king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The '[[Cyfraith Hywel|law of Hywel Dda]]' (), as it became known, codified the previously existing [[Celtic Law|folk laws and legal customs]] that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. Other than in the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], where [[March law]] was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284. [[Edward I of England]] annexed the [[Principality of Wales]] following the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until [[Henry VIII of England]] annexed the whole of Wales under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]] (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. The [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]]) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of [[England and Wales]] since 1536.\nEnglish law is regarded as a [[common law]] system, with no major [[Codification (law)|codification]] of the law and legal [[precedent]]s are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The [[Courts of England and Wales#Senior Courts of England and Wales|Senior Courts of England and Wales]] is the highest [[Trial court|court of first instance]] as well as an [[appellate court]]. The three divisions are the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]], and the [[Crown Court]]. Minor cases are heard by [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s or the [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court]]. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the [[Circuits of England and Wales|Wales and Cheshire Circuit]] before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single [[jurisdiction]] of [[England and Wales]].\nThe [[Senedd]] has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliamentary]] system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum]] held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an [[Act of Senedd Cymru]] in relation to twenty subjects listed in the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the [[Welsh Government]] can then also enact more specific [[secondary legislation|subordinate legislation]].\nWales is served by four regional police forces: [[Dyfed-Powys Police]], [[Gwent Police]], [[North Wales Police]], and [[South Wales Police]]. There are five [[prisons in Wales]]: four in the southern half of the country, and [[HM Prison Berwyn|one]] in [[Wrexham Industrial Estate|Wrexham]]. Wales has no women's prisons: female inmates are imprisoned in England.\nGeography and natural history.\n[[File:Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) from Crib Goch, Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri National Park, Cymru (Wales) 09.jpg|thumb|292x292px|[[Snowdon]] () [[Gwynedd]], the highest mountain in Wales]]\nWales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain. It is about north to south. The oft-quoted \"[[The size of Wales|size of Wales]]\" is about . Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the [[Irish Sea]] to the north and west, [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]] to the southwest and the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south. Wales has about of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]] and [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holyhead]]. [[List of islands of Wales|Over 50 islands]] lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west.\nMuch of Wales's diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the [[Devensian glaciation]]. The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Snowdonia]] (), of which five are over . The highest of these is [[Snowdon]] (), at . The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including [[Carnedd Gwenllian]]\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low [[topographic prominence]]\u00a0\u2013 over high are known collectively as the [[Welsh 3000s]] and are located in a small area in the north-west. The highest outside the 3000s is [[Aran Fawddwy]], at , in the south of Snowdonia. The [[Brecon Beacons]] () are in the south (highest point [[Pen y Fan]], at ), and are joined by the [[Cambrian Mountains]] in [[Mid Wales]] (highest point [[Pumlumon]], at ).\n[[File:Map of Wales.svg|thumb|Relief map of Wales:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Topography above&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0[[National parks of Wales|National Parks]]]]\nWales has [[National parks of Wales|three national parks]]: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons, and [[Pembrokeshire Coast]] (). It has [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Wales|five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]: Anglesey, the [[Clwydian Range and Dee Valley]], the [[Gower Peninsula]], the [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]], and the [[Wye Valley]]. The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], in 1956. As of 2019, the [[coastline of Wales]] had 40 [[Blue Flag beach]]es, three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. The south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic [[westerlies]]/south-westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the \"[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]\" off Anglesey in which 459 people died. The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, [[Milford Haven]] and Swansea. Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the [[Sea Empress oil spill|\"Sea Empress\" oil spill]] in 1996.\nThe first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The [[Act of Union 1536]] formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the [[River Dee, Wales|Dee]] to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]], which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.\nGeology.\nThe earliest geological period of the [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] era, the [[Cambrian]], takes its name from the [[Cambrian Mountains]], where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. In the mid-19th century, [[Roderick Murchison]] and [[Adam Sedgwick]] used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of [[stratigraphy]] and [[palaeontology]]. The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]], were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.\nClimate.\n[[File:Milvus milvus R(ThKraft).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A [[Red kite]], considered one of the [[national symbols of Wales]] and voted the nation's favourite bird]]\nWales lies within the [[Temperateness|north temperate zone]]. It has a changeable, [[maritime climate]] and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. \nFlora and fauna.\nWales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of [[northern gannet|gannet]]s, [[Manx shearwater]], [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwakes]], [[European shag|shags]] and [[razorbill]]s. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including [[common raven|raven]] and [[ring ouzel]]. [[Birds of prey]] include the [[merlin (bird)|merlin]], [[hen harrier]] and the [[red kite]], a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the [[RSPB]] reserve at [[Conwy]], including seasonal visitors. Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the [[yellow-necked mouse]] and the [[hazel dormouse|dormouse]], are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. The [[pine marten]], which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The [[European polecat|polecat]] was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. [[Feral goat]]s can be found in Snowdonia. In March 2021, [[Natural Resources Wales]] (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six [[beaver]]s in the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], the first official beaver release in Wales.\nBelieved to be home to some of Wales's rarest land invertebrates, some 2,500 disused coal tips are the subject of study by the Welsh Government; the tips are home to a wide variety of other wildlife.\nThe waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including [[basking sharks]], Atlantic [[grey seal]]s, leatherback turtles, dolphins, [[porpoises]], jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, and [[New Quay]] has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. Freshwater fish of note include [[Salvelinus|char]], eel, [[salmon]], [[shad]], [[European smelt|sparling]] and [[Arctic char]], while the [[gwyniad]] is unique to Wales, found only in [[Bala Lake]]. Wales is known for its shellfish, including [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], [[limpet]], [[mussel]]s and [[Common periwinkle|periwinkles]]. [[Herring]], [[mackerel]] and [[hake]] are the more common of the country's marine fish. The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 \"[[Gagea serotina]]\" \u2013 and other [[alpine climate|alpine]] species such as \"[[Saxifraga cespitosa]]\", \"[[Saxifraga oppositifolia]]\" and \"[[Silene acaulis]]\". Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose \"[[Tuberaria guttata]]\" on Anglesey and \"[[Draba aizoides]]\" on the Gower.\nEconomy.\n[[File:Profile of Wales.png|thumb|right|A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012]]\n[[File:This is Trade and Investment. This is Wales. Welsh Government video.webm|thumb|A 2021 introduction to some of the largest companies based in Wales, including: Airbus, bipsync, HCI Pharmaceutical, ReNeuron, Deloitte, Coaltown Coffee, DMM International and Freudenberg]]\nOver the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from an [[Agriculture in Wales|agricultural country]] to an industrial, and then to a [[post-industrial economy]]. In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as Ireland's; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales. Since the Second World War, the [[service sector]] has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was \u00a375\u00a0billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017. GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was \u00a323,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017. This compares to Italy's GDP/capita of \u00a325,000, Spain \u00a322,000, Slovenia \u00a320,000 and New Zealand \u00a330,000. In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults [[employment rate|were employed]], compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the [[Welsh fiscal deficit]] accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP.\nIn 2019, Wales was a net exporter of electricity. It produced 27.9 TWh of electricity while only consuming 14.7 TWh. In 2021, the Welsh government said that more than half the country's energy needs were being met by renewable sources, 2 per cent of which was from 363 [[hydroelectric power|hydropower]] projects.\nBy UK law, Wales contributes to items that do not directly benefit Wales e.g. over \u00a35\u00a0billion for [[HS2]] \"which will damage the Welsh economy by \u00a3200m pa\", according to the UK and Welsh Government's transport adviser Mark Barry. Wales also pays more in military costs than most similar-sized countries e.g. Wales pays twice the amount Ireland spends on the military. The UK government spends \u00a31.75bn per year on the military in Wales, which is almost as much as Wales spends on education every year (\u00a31.8\u00a0billion in 2018/19) and five times as much as the total amount spent on the police in Wales (\u00a3365\u00a0million).\nFrom the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was the dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the [[South Wales coalfield]], mining 56 million tons of coal. Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. In the 1920s, over 40 per cent of the male Welsh population worked in [[heavy industry]]. According to [[Phil Williams (Welsh politician)|Phil Williams]], the [[Great Depression]] \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in [[light industry]] and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of [[foreign direct investment]] in the UK. Much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly-paid jobs in the company are elsewhere.\nPoor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing, so livestock farming has been the focus of farming. About 78 per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture. The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and [[Blue Flag beach]]es, attracts [[Tourism in Wales|large numbers of tourists]], who bolster the economy of rural areas. Wales, like Northern Ireland, has relatively few high [[value-added]] employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of \"economic mass\" (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK: in 2002 it stood at 90 per cent of the EU25 average and around 80 per cent of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation to be awarded [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade status]].\nThe [[pound sterling]] is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century: the last bank to do so closed in 1908. Since then the [[Bank of England]] has had a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. The [[Bank of Wales|Commercial Bank of Wales]], established in Cardiff by [[Julian Hodge|Sir Julian Hodge]] in 1971, was taken over by the [[Bank of Scotland]] in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. The [[Royal Mint]], which issues the [[Coins of the pound sterling|coinage]] circulating through the whole of the UK, has been based at a single site in [[Llantrisant]] since 1980. Since [[decimalisation]], in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one pound coin. As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008.\nTransport.\nRail.\n[[File:Rail network of Wales 2021.svg|thumb|Rail network of Wales, 2021|226x226px]] [[Rail transport in Wales]] includes the [[Wales &amp; Borders franchise]], which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by [[Transport for Wales Rail]]. The Cardiff region has its own [[Valley Lines|urban rail network]]. [[Beeching cuts]] in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east\u2013west travel connecting with the [[Irish Sea]] ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of [[Chester]] and [[Hereford]] and towns of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Gobowen railway station|Gobowen for Oswestry]] and along the [[Welsh Marches Line]], with trains on the [[Heart of Wales Line]] from [[Swansea railway station|Swansea]] to [[Llandovery railway station|Llandovery]], [[Llandrindod Wells railway station|Llandrindod]] and [[Knighton railway station|Knighton]], connecting with the [[Welsh Marches line]] at [[Craven Arms railway station|Craven Arms]]. Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the [[South Wales Main Line]] branch of the [[Great Western Main Line]] used by services from [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] to Cardiff has [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line|undergone electrification]], although the programme experienced significant delays and cost overruns. Many of the Valley Lines are also undergoing electrification, under the [[South Wales Metro]] project. A [[Proposed Wales North-South railway|North-South railway]] has been suggested to better link North and South Wales.\nAir and ferries.\n[[Cardiff Airport]] is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and Asian destinations, it is about southwest of [[Cardiff city centre]], in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by [[Eastern Airways]]; as of 2022, those flights are no longer available. Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from [[Holyhead]], [[Pembroke Dock]] and [[Fishguard]]. The Swansea to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012.\nEducation.\n[[File:Llanbedr Pont Steffan.jpg|thumb|right|St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]] (). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales.]] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as [[Ruthin]], Brecon and Cowbridge. One of the first successful schooling systems was started by [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]], who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. In the early 19th century, English became the usual language of instruction at schools in Wales. While the country's working class was largely Welsh-speaking at the time, Welsh public opinion wished for children to learn English. Many schools used corporal punishment to stop children from speaking Welsh in the first half of the 19th century; the practice declined in the second half of the century. The British government never prohibited the use of Welsh at schools but it treated English as the assumed language of instruction. More Welsh was gradually used at schools in Welsh-speaking areas in the mid to late 19th century and teaching of the language began to receive moderate government support from the late 19th century.\nThe [[Aberystwyth University|University College of Wales]] opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]] and [[Bangor University|Bangor]] followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the [[University of Wales]]. The [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889|Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889]] created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales's state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the [[Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol]] (Welsh-language National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2021\u20132022, there were 1,470 maintained schools in Wales. In 2021\u201322, the country had 471,131 pupils taught by 25,210 full-time equivalent teachers.\nHealthcare.\n[[File:University Hospital of Wales, Heath Park - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1736088.jpg|thumb|[[University Hospital of Wales]], Cardiff]]\nPublic healthcare in Wales is provided by [[NHS Wales]] (), through [[List of NHS Wales trusts and health boards|seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts]]. It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]], but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the [[Minister for Health and Social Services]]. Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer. The National Survey for Wales in 2021\u201322 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health. The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were [[smoking|smokers]], 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight.\nDemography.\nPopulation history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially [[Glamorganshire]], which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase can be attributed to the [[demographic transition]] seen in most industrialising countries during the [[Industrial Revolution in Wales|Industrial Revolution]], as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including [[Welsh Italians|Italians]], who migrated to South Wales. Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in the 20th century, and [[Black British people|African-Caribbean]] and [[British Asian|Asian]] communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. In 2021, [[Poland]] continued to be the most frequent country of birth outside Wales. The biggest percentage increase since 2011 was seen among people who identified [[Romania]] as their country of birth. The number of residents in Wales born in Romania grew nearly five times (469.9%) from 2011 to 2021, rising by 7,025 individuals. In 2021, 5.1% (3,630) identified as [[White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller|Gypsy or Irish Traveller]].\nThe population in 1972 stood at 2.74\u00a0million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net [[Human migration|migration]] out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to [[population growth]] than [[Sub-replacement fertility|natural change]]. The resident population of Wales in 2021 according to the [[2021 United Kingdom census|census]] was 3,107,500 (1,586,600 female and 1,521,000 male), an increase of 1.4 per cent over 2011. A decreased change from the 5 per cent increase between 2001 and 2011. Wales accounted for 5.2 per cent of the [[Demographics of the United Kingdom|population of England and Wales]] in 2021. [[List of cities in Wales|Wales has seven cities]]: Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Wrexham, [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[St Asaph]] and [[St Davids]]. (The last two of these have [[city status in the United Kingdom]] despite their small populations.) Wrexham, north Wales's largest settlement, became Wales's newest and seventh city in September [[Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours|2022]].\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\n[[File:Welsh speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census who said they could speak Welsh|217x217px]]Welsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd. The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to 18.9 per cent in 1981. The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century. In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991). Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However, this figure was still higher than the 508,000 people (or 18.7 per cent of the population) who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.\n[[File:Welsh spelling on road sign, Newtown, Powys - geograph.org.uk - 1319438.jpg|thumb|Bilingual [[road sign]] in Welsh and English]]\nAccording to the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 census]], the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 17.8 per cent (538,300 people) and nearly three-quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills. Other estimates suggest that 29.7 per cent (899,500) of people aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in June 2022.\nEnglish is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. [[Code-switching]] is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. \"[[Welsh English|Wenglish]]\" is the Welsh dialect of the English language. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. Although [[Monolingualism|monoglotism]] in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.\nSince [[Poland]] joined the European Union, Wales has seen a significant increase in Polish immigrants. This has made [[Polish language|Polish]] the most common main language in Wales after English and Welsh, at 0.7 per cent of the population.\nReligion.\n[[File:StDavidsCathedral Tower&amp;SouthTransept.JPG|upright=0.75|thumb|[[St. David's Cathedral]], Pembrokeshire]]\nForms of [[Christianity in Wales|Christianity]] have dominated religious life in what is now Wales for more than 1,400 years.\nThe 2021 census recorded that 46.5 per cent had \"No religion\", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011. The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census. The [[patron saint]] of Wales is [[Saint David]] (), with [[Saint David's Day]] () celebrated annually on 1 March. The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival]], which started through the evangelism of [[Evan Roberts (minister)|Evan Roberts]] and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity.\nThe [[Church in Wales]] with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. It is a province of the [[Anglican Communion]], and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]]. The first [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Independent Church]] in Wales was founded at [[Llanvaches]] in 1638 by [[William Wroth]]. The [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]] was born out of the [[Welsh Methodist revival]] in the 18th century and seceded from the [[Church of England]] in 1811. The second largest attending faith in Wales is [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]], with an estimated 43,000 adherents.\nNon-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Islam]] is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. There are also communities of [[Hinduism in the United Kingdom|Hindus]] and [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikhs]], mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] is in the western rural county of [[Ceredigion]]. [[History of the Jews in Wales|Judaism]] was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.\nEthnicity.\n[[File:Shirley Bassey (1971).jpg|thumb|Singer [[Shirley Bassey]]|195x195px]]\nThe 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as \"White\", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011. 90.6 per cent of the population identified as \"White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\" in 2021. The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was \"Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British\" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011. 1.6 per cent of the population identified as \"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as \"Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African\", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as \"Other ethnic group\" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011. The local authorities with the highest proportions of \"high-level\" ethnic groups other than \"White\" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011.\nIn 2021, the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman outdoors was raised for Wales's first black headteacher, [[Betty Campbell]]. In 2023, [[Patti Flynn]] (a contemporary of [[Shirley Bassey]], both of [[Tiger Bay]], Cardiff) became the first black Welsh woman to be awarded a purple plaque.\nIn 2024, [[Vaughan Gething]] was elected First Minister of Wales becoming the first black head of government in Europe; he had previously served as Secretary for Finance.\nNational identity.\nThe 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as \"Welsh only\" and 8.1 per cent identified as \"Welsh and British\", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh. The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001. A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree.\nCulture.\nWales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music. There are four [[List of World Heritage Sites in Wales|UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales]]: [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd]]; [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] and Canal; the [[Blaenavon Industrial Landscape]]; and [[The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales]].\nMythology.\nRemnants of native Celtic [[mythology]] of the pre-Christian [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] was passed down orally by the \"cynfeirdd\" (the early poets). Some of their work survives in later [[Medieval Welsh literature|medieval Welsh manuscripts]]: the [[Black Book of Carmarthen]] and the [[Book of Aneirin]] (both 13th-century); the [[Book of Taliesin]] and the [[White Book of Rhydderch]] (both 14th-century); and the [[Red Book of Hergest]] (c.\u00a01400). The [[prose]] stories from the White and Red Books are known as the \"[[Mabinogion]]\". Poems such as \"[[Cad Goddeu]]\" (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the \"[[Welsh Triads]]\" and the \"[[Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain]]\", also contain mythological material. These texts include the earliest forms of the [[Arthurian legend]] and the traditional history of post-[[Roman Britain]]. Other sources of Welsh [[folklore]] include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation \"[[Historia Britonum]]\" (the History of the Britons) and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century Latin [[chronicle]] (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as \"The Welsh Fairy Book\" by W. Jenkyn Thomas.\nLiterature.\n[[File:Black Book of Carmarthen (f.4.r).jpg|thumb|Welsh poetry from the 13th-century [[Black Book of Carmarthen]].]]\nWales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe going back to the sixth century and including [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Gerald of Wales]], regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets [[Taliesin]] and [[Aneirin]], survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions. Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the [[Medieval Welsh literature#Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 c. 1300)|Poets of the Princes]] (c.\u20091100\u20131280) and then the [[Medieval Welsh literature#Poets of the Nobility, or Cywyddwyr (c. 1300 \u2013 c. 1600)|Poets of the Gentry]] (c.\u20091350\u20131650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the [[cywydd]] metre. The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]. After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.\nDespite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. Renaissance scholars such as [[William Salesbury]] and [[John Davies (Mallwyd)|John Davies]] brought [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] ideals from English universities. In 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] became the first person to translate the [[Welsh Bible|Bible into Welsh]]. From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.\nDevelopments in 19th-century Welsh literature include [[Lady Charlotte Guest]]'s translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of \"[[Rhys Lewis (novel)|Rhys Lewis]]\" by [[Daniel Owen]], credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as [[Thomas Gwynn Jones]]'s \"[[Ymadawiad Arthur]]\". The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by [[T. H. Parry-Williams]] and [[R. Williams Parry]]. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of [[Rhydwen Williams]] who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by [[Saunders Lewis]], for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.\nThe careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]], [[Vernon Watkins]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], whose most famous work \"[[Under Milk Wood]]\" was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of [[Saunders Lewis]] and the burning of the Bombing School on the [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]] in 1936. In poetry [[R. S. Thomas]] (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". Major writers in the second half of the 20th century include [[Emyr Humphreys]] (1919\u20132020), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921\u20131988).\nMuseums and libraries.\n[[File:National Library of Wales.jpg|right|thumb|The [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]]]]\n[[Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 Museum Wales]] was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales. It operates at seven sites: [[National Museum Cardiff]], [[St Fagans National History Museum]], [[Big Pit National Coal Museum]], [[National Wool Museum]], [[National Slate Museum]], [[National Roman Legion Museum]], and the [[National Waterfront Museum]]. Entry to all sites is free. The [[National Library of Wales]], based in [[Aberystwyth]], houses important collections of printed works, including the [[National Library of Wales#Sir John Williams Collection|Sir John Williams Collection]] and the [[Shirburn Castle]] collection, as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, [[ephemera]] and [[Ordnance Survey]] maps.\nVisual arts.\nWorks of [[Celtic art]] have been found in Wales. In the [[Early Medieval]] period, the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Wales was part of the [[Insular art]] of the [[British Isles]]. A number of [[illuminated manuscript]]s [[:Category:Illuminated manuscripts of Welsh origin|from Wales]] survive, including the 8th-century [[Hereford Gospels]] and [[Lichfield Gospels]]. The 11th-century [[Ricemarch Psalter]] (now in [[Dublin]]) is certainly Welsh, made in [[St David's]], and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.\nSome Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of [[landscape art]] grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the [[Celtic Revival]].\n[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|\"The Bard\", 1774, by [[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]] (1742\u20131803).]]\nAn [[Act of Parliament]] in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff|Cardiff School of Art]] opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but [[Betws-y-Coed]] became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped to form the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]] in 1881. The sculptor Sir William [[Goscombe John]] made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]], whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. [[Thomas E. Stephens (artist)|Thomas E. Stephens]] and [[Andrew Vicari]] had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France.\nWelsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. [[Augustus John]] and his sister [[Gwen John]] lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir [[Kyffin Williams]] and [[Peter Prendergast (artist)|Peter Prendergast]] lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. [[Ceri Richards]] was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including [[Surrealism]]. Various artists have moved to Wales, including [[Eric Gill]], the London-Welshman [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], and the sculptor [[Jonah Jones (sculptor)|Jonah Jones]]. [[The Kardomah Gang]] was an intellectual circle in Swansea, centred on the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and the poet and artist [[Vernon Watkins]], which also included the painter [[Alfred Janes]].\nSouth Wales had several notable [[pottery|potteries]], one of the first important sites being the [[Ewenny#Potteries|Ewenny Pottery]] in [[Bridgend]], which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available, more refined ceramics were produced: this was led by the [[Cambrian Pottery]] (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\"), and later [[Nantgarw Pottery]] near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1820 making fine [[porcelain]], and then utilitarian pottery from 1833 until 1920. [[Portmeirion Pottery]], founded in 1960 by [[Susan Williams-Ellis]] (daughter of [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], creator of the Italianate village of [[Portmeirion]], [[Gwynedd]]) is based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England.\nNational symbols and identity.\n[[File:Welsh Dragon (Y Ddraig Goch).svg|thumb|The [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]], a popular symbol in Wales.]]\nWales is regarded as a modern [[Celtic nations|Celtic nation]] which contributes to its national identity, with Welsh artists regularly appearing at [[List of Celtic festivals|Celtic festivals]]. The [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation. The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the [[Historia Brittonum]]. [[Vortigern]] (), [[King of the Britons|King of the Celtic Britons]], is interrupted while attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Ambrosius to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the [[Celtic Britons]], and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons. Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.\nAs an emblem, the red dragon of Wales has been used since the reign of [[Cadwaladr]], [[List of rulers of Wales|King of Gwynedd]] from around 655\u00a0AD, and appears prominently on the national [[flag of Wales]], which became an official flag in 1959. The banner of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] is associated with Welsh nationhood; it was carried into battle by Welsh forces during [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|Glynd\u0175r's battles]] against the English, and includes four lions on red and gold. The standard is similar to the arms of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] (Llywelyn the Last), the last Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England]]. The design may also be influenced by the arms of Glynd\u0175r's parents, both of whom had lions in their arms. [[Owain Glynd\u0175r Day]] is celebrated on 16 September in Wales and there have been calls to make it a national bank holiday. The [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] is also used in Wales: it consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet, and the German motto \"Ich dien\" (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including [[Logo of the Welsh Rugby Union|the Welsh rugby union]], and Welsh regiments in the [[British Army]], including the [[Royal Welsh]], use the badge or a stylised version of it.\nOn 1 March, Welsh people celebrate [[Saint David's Day]], commemorating the death of the country's patron saint in 589. It is not a recognised [[bank holiday]] although there have been calls to make it so. The day is celebrated by schools and cultural societies across Wales, and customs include the wearing of a [[leek]] or a [[daffodil]], which are two national emblems of Wales. Children also wear the national costume. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by [[David Lloyd George]]. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leeks, , and that for daffodils, or St. Peter's leeks. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. Other Welsh festivals include [[G\u0175yl Mabsant|Mabsant]] when parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church, although this is now rarely observed, and a more modern celebration, [[Dydd Santes Dwynwen]] (St Dwynwen's Day), observed on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day.\n\"\" () is the \"de facto\", national anthem of Wales and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team, as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. \"\" (\"Wales forever\") is a popular Welsh motto. Another Welsh motto \"Y [[Welsh Dragon|Ddraig Goch]] Ddyry Cychwyn\" (\"the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] inspires action\") has been used on the [[Royal Badge of Wales]] when it was created in 1953.\nSport.\n[[File:Millennium Stadium (aerial view).jpg|thumb|[[Millennium Stadium]], Cardiff]]\nMore than 50 [[Governing bodies of sports in Wales|national governing bodies]] regulate and organise their sports in Wales. Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Rugby World Cup]], [[Rugby League World Cup]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. At the [[Olympic Games]], Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. These include the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958 Commonwealth Games]], the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], the [[2010 Ryder Cup]] and the [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final]].\nAlthough football has traditionally been the more popular sport in [[North Wales]], [[rugby union in Wales|rugby union]] is seen as a symbol of [[Welsh national identity|Welsh identity]] and an expression of national consciousness. The [[Wales national rugby union team]] takes part in the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] and has also competed in every [[Rugby World Cup]], hosting the tournament in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]]. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Dragons (rugby union)|Dragons]], [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]] and [[Scarlets]]. The Welsh regional teams play in the [[United Rugby Championship]], the [[Heineken Champions Cup]] if they qualify and the [[European Rugby Challenge Cup]], again dependent on qualification. [[Rugby league in Wales]] dates back to 1907. A professional [[Welsh League]] existed from 1908 to 1910.\nWales has had [[football in Wales|its own football]] league, the [[Welsh Premier League]], since 1992. For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the [[English football league system]]: [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], [[Newport County A.F.C|Newport County]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], and [[Merthyr Town F.C. (2010)|Merthyr Town]]. The country has produced a considerable number of [[List of Wales international footballers|footballers]] who have played at international level. At [[UEFA Euro 2016]], the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals.\nIn international [[cricket]], Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB), called the [[England cricket team]], or simply 'England'. Occasionally, a separate [[Wales national cricket team|Wales team]] play limited-overs competitions. [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]] is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. Wales has produced notable participants of individual sports including [[snooker]], track and field, [[Cycle sport|cycling]], and [[List of Welsh boxing champions|boxing]].\nMedia.\n[[File:Filming \"Torchwood\" in Cardiff (2).jpg|thumb|A number of BBC productions, such as \"[[Doctor Who]]\" and \"[[Torchwood]]\", have been filmed in Wales.]]\nWales became the UK's first [[digital television]] nation in 2010. [[BBC Cymru Wales]] is the national broadcaster, producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English. It has also produced programmes such as \"[[Life on Mars (British TV series)|Life on Mars]]\", \"[[Doctor Who]]\" and \"[[Torchwood]]\" for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded [[ITV Cymru Wales]]. [[S4C]] began broadcasting in 1982. Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with [[Channel 4]] at other times. Since the [[digital television transition|digital switchover]] the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [[BBC Radio Cymru]] is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales. A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday ([[Radio Maldwyn]]) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ([[Swansea Sound]]) to essentially bilingual stations such as [[Heart Cymru]] and [[Radio Ceredigion]].16\u201318\nMost of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The \"[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]\" is Wales's only print national daily newspaper. Wales-based regional daily newspapers include the \"[[Daily Post (North Wales)|Daily Post]]\" (which covers North Wales), the \"[[South Wales Evening Post]]\" (Swansea), the \"[[South Wales Echo]]\" (Cardiff), and the \"[[South Wales Argus]]\" (Newport). \"[[Y Cymro]]\" is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly.22\u201323 \"Wales on Sunday\" is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper that covers the whole of Wales. The [[Books Council of Wales]] is the Welsh-Government-funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature in Welsh and English. The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. Around 650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers.34 Wales's main publishing houses include [[Gomer Press]], [[Gwasg Carreg Gwalch]], [[Honno (press)|Honno]], the [[University of Wales Press]] and [[Y Lolfa]].34 Journals with a Welsh focus include \"Cambria\" (a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English), \"Planet,\" and \"[[Poetry Wales]]\". Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles \"[[Golwg]]\" (\"View\"), published weekly, and \"[[Barn (Welsh magazine)|Barn]]\" (\"Opinion\"), published monthly. \"Y Wawr\" (\"The Dawn\") is published quarterly by \"[[Merched y Wawr]]\", the national organisation for women. \"[[Y Traethodydd]]\" (\"The Essayist\"), a quarterly publication by the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]], first appeared in 1845 and is the oldest Welsh publication still in print.\nCuisine.\n[[File:Cawl Cymreig.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cawl]], a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales.|179x179px]]\nTraditional Welsh dishes include [[laverbread]] (made from \"[[Porphyra umbilicalis]]\", an edible [[seaweed]]), [[bara brith]] (fruit bread), [[cawl]] (a lamb stew), [[cawl cennin]] ([[leek soup]]), and [[Welsh cake]]s. [[Cockle (bivalve)|Cockles]] are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of [[Indian cuisine|India]], [[Chinese cuisine|China]] and the [[Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. [[Chicken tikka masala]] is the country's favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell [[fish and chips]] as takeaways.\nPerforming arts.\nMusic and festivals.\n[[File:Sir Tom Jones at The Queen's Birthday Party (cropped-2).jpg|thumb|233x233px|Singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]]]\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its [[Men's chorus|male voice choirs]] and its harpists. The annual \"[[National Eisteddfod]]\" is the country's main performance festival. The \"Llangollen [[International Eisteddfod]]\" provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes. Traditional instruments of Wales include the \"telyn deires\" ([[triple harp]]), fiddle, \"[[crwth]]\" (bowed lyre) and the \"pibgorn\" (hornpipe). Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country. Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs.\nThe [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] performs in Wales and internationally. The [[Welsh National Opera]] is based at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in [[Cardiff Bay]], while the [[National Youth Orchestra of Wales]] was the first of its type in the world. Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers in both the classical and pop arenas, as well as some popular bands. The Welsh [[folk music]] scene has enjoyed a resurgence in the 21st century.\nDrama.\n[[File:Catherine Zeta-Jones VF 2012 Shankbone 2.jpg|thumb|195x195px|[[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], born in [[Swansea]]]]\nThe earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval [[miracle play]]s, \"Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen\" (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and \"Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad\" (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an [[Play (theatre)|interlude]], a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two-thirds. Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. Plays by [[Emlyn Williams]] and [[Alun Owen]] and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including [[Richard Burton]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], were establishing international reputations. Wales has also produced some well-known comedians.\nDance.\n[[File:Traditional Welsh dance and dress, Senedd, St David's Day 2009 Gwisgoedd a dawnsio traddodiadol Gymreig, Senedd, Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi 2009 (3678719264).jpg|thumb|232x232px|Welsh dancer at the Senedd building]]\nTraditional dances include Welsh [[Welsh dance|folk dancing]] and [[Welsh stepdance|clog dancing]]. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by [[Gerald of Wales|Giraldus Cambrensis]], but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. In the 20th century a revival was led by [[Lois Blake]] (1890\u20131974). Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949. [[Contemporary dance]] grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s. The [[National Dance Company Wales]], formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Wales| ]]\n[[Category:Celtic nations]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Great Britain]]\n[[Category:Countries and territories where English is an official language]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:NUTS 1 statistical regions of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom by country]]\n[[Category:Autonomous areas of Europe]]\n[[Category:Regions of Europe with multiple official languages]]"}
{"id": "69895", "revid": "1317791030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69895", "title": "Interpolation search", "text": "Searching algorithm\nInterpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys (\"key values\"). It was first described by W. W. Peterson in 1957. Interpolation search resembles the method by which people search a telephone directory for a name (the key value by which the book's entries are ordered): in each step the algorithm calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key, usually via a linear interpolation. The key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought. If it is not equal, then depending on the comparison, the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. This method will only work if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible.\nBy comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought \u2014 it does not require numerical values for the keys, just a total order on them. The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start, ignoring any sorting.\nOn average the interpolation search makes about log(log(\"n\")) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where \"n\" is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(\"n\") comparisons.\nIn interpolation-sequential search, interpolation is used to find an item near the one being searched for, then linear search is used to find the exact item.\nPerformance.\nUsing big-O notation, the performance of the interpolation algorithm on a data set of size \"n\" is \"O\"(\"n\"); however under the assumption of a uniform distribution of the data on the linear scale used for interpolation, the performance can be shown to be \"O\"(log log \"n\").\nDynamic interpolation search extends the \"o\"(log log \"n\") bound to other distributions and also supports \"O\"(log \"n\") insertion and deletion.\nPractical performance of interpolation search depends on whether the reduced number of probes is outweighed by the more complicated calculations needed for each probe. It can be useful for locating a record in a large sorted file on disk, where each probe involves a disk seek and is much slower than the interpolation arithmetic.\nIndex structures like B-trees also reduce the number of disk accesses, and are more often used to index on-disk data in part because they can index many types of data and can be updated online. Still, interpolation search may be useful when one is forced to search certain sorted but unindexed on-disk datasets.\nAdaptation to different datasets.\nWhen sort keys for a dataset are uniformly distributed numbers, linear interpolation is straightforward to implement and will find an index very near the sought value.\nOn the other hand, for a phone book sorted by name, the straightforward approach to interpolation search does not apply. The same high-level principles can still apply, though: one can estimate a name's position in the phone book using the relative frequencies of letters in names and use that as a probe location.\nSome interpolation search implementations may not work as expected when a run of equal key values exists. The simplest implementation of interpolation search won't necessarily select the first (or last) element of such a run.\nBook-based searching.\nThe conversion of names in a telephone book to some sort of number clearly will not provide numbers having a uniform distribution (except via immense effort such as sorting the names and calling them name #1, name #2, etc.) and further, it is well known that some names are much more common than others (Smith, Jones,) Similarly with dictionaries, where there are many more words starting with some letters than others. Some publishers go to the effort of preparing marginal annotations or even cutting into the side of the pages to show markers for each letter so that at a glance a segmented interpolation can be performed.\nSample implementation.\nThe following C++ code example is a simple implementation. At each stage it computes a probe position then as with the binary search, moves either the upper or lower bound in to define a smaller interval containing the sought value. Unlike the binary search which guarantees a halving of the interval's size with each stage, a misled interpolation may reduce/i-case efficiency of O(\"n\").\nimport &lt;cassert&gt;;\nimport std;\nusing std::vector;\narr[low, high) is sorted, search the data \"key\" in this array,\nif \"key\" is found, return the corresponding index (NOT necessarily the highest possible index);\nif \"key\" is not found, just return low - 1\nHow to verify that the algorithm is correct?\nProof:\nFist, high &lt;--- high - 1\nscenario 1. when low = high\nscenario 2. when low &lt; high, arr[low] = arr[high]\nscenario 3. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt; arr[high], key &lt; arr[low] or key &gt; arr[high]\nscenario 4. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt; arr[high], arr[low] &lt;= key &lt;= arr[high]\nNow let's analyze scenario 4:\nOnce entering the \"while\" loop, low &lt;= middle &lt;= high\n let's analyse after one loop(if we don't return), whether \"low &gt; high\" will occur\n After one loop:\n case a1: \"low\" branch has been executed in this loop\n arr[middle] &lt; key &lt;= arr[high]\n so we have middle &lt; high\n so after this loop, we have\n low &lt;= high\n case a2: \"high\" branch has been executed in this loop\n arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[middle]\n so we have low &lt; middle\n so after this loop, we have\n low &lt;= high\n so after one loop(if we don't return), we have \"low &lt;= high\"\n when we exit the \"while\" loop:\n case b1: arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]\n In the last loop, if \"low\" branch is executed, we know\n arr[low - 1] &lt; k &lt;= arr[high]\n arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]\n low &lt;= high\n so we have \n arr[low - 1] &lt; k &lt;= arr[low] = arr[high]\n In the last loop, if \"high\" branch is executed, we know\n arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high + 1]\n arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]\n low &lt;= high\n so we have\n arr[low] = arr[high] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high + 1]\n case b2: (arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (arr[low] &gt; key):\n In the last loop, \"low\" must have been changed\n so we have\n arr[low - 1] &lt; key\n so we have \n arr[low - 1] &lt; key &lt; arr[low]\n case b3: (arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (key &gt; arr[high])\n In the last loop, \"high\" must have been changed\n so we have\n key &lt; arr[high + 1]\n so we have\n arr[low] &lt; arr[high] &lt; key &lt; arr[high + 1]\n// version 1\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nstatic Rank interpolationSearch(vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; arr, const T&amp; key, Rank low, Rank high) {\n high -= 1;\n int middle;\n int initialLow = low;\n while ((arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (arr[low] &lt;= key) &amp;&amp; (key &lt;= arr[high])) {\n middle = low + ((key - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low]);\n assert((low &lt;= middle) &amp;&amp; (middle &lt;= high));\n if (arr[middle] &lt; key) {\n low = middle + 1;\n } else if (key &lt; arr[middle]) {\n high = middle - 1;\n } else {\n return middle;\n if (key == arr[low]) {\n return low;\n } else {\n return initialLow - 1;\n/*\nsearch \"key\" in the sorted array arr[low, high),\nreturn: the highest index i such that arr[i] &lt;= key\nHow to verify that the algorithm is correct?\nProof:\nfiniteness: after one loop, the width of [low, high] decreases strictly \nFist, high &lt;---- high - 1\nscenario 1. when low = high\nscenario 2. when low &lt; high, key &lt; arr[low] or arr[high] &lt;= key\nscenario 3. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high]\nNow let's analyze scenario 3:\nOnce entering the \"while\" loop, low &lt;= middle &lt; high\nwhen we exit the \"while\" loop:\n case a1: key &lt; arr[low]\n so \"low\" is changed in the last loop, we know\n arr[low - 1] &lt;= key &lt; arr[low]\n case a2: arr[high] &lt;= key\n so \"high\" is changed in the last loop, we know\n key &lt; arr[high], impossible\nconclusion: we should return \"low - 1\"\n// version 2\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt; \nstatic Rank interpolationSearch(vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; arr, const T&amp; key, Rank low, Rank high) {\n high -= 1;\n assert(low &lt;= high);\n Rank middle;\n if(key &lt; arr[low]) {\n return low - 1;\n if(arr[high] &lt;= key) {\n return high;\n // now low &lt; high , arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high]\n while ((arr[low] &lt;= key) &amp;&amp; (key &lt; arr[high])) {\n middle = low + ((high - low) * (key - arr[low])) / (arr[high] - arr[low]);\n assert((low &lt;= middle) &amp;&amp; (middle &lt; high));\n if(key &lt; arr[middle]) {\n high = middle;\n } else {\n low = middle + 1;\n return low - 1;\nNotice that having probed the list at index \"mid\", for reasons of loop control administration, this code sets either \"high\" or \"low\" to be not \"mid\" but an adjacent index, which location is then probed during the next iteration. Since an adjacent entry's value will not be much different, the interpolation calculation is not much improved by this one step adjustment, at the cost of an additional reference to distant memory such as disk.\nEach iteration of the above code requires between five and six comparisons (the extra is due to the repetitions needed to distinguish the three states of &lt; &gt; and = via binary comparisons in the absence of a three-way comparison) plus some messy arithmetic, while the binary search algorithm can be written with one comparison per iteration and uses only trivial integer arithmetic. It would thereby search an array of a million elements with no more than twenty comparisons (involving accesses to slow memory where the array elements are stored); to beat that, the interpolation search, as written above, would be allowed no more than three iterations."}

The treaty and associated pacts were named after the Lateran Palace, where they were signed on 11 February 1929. The Italian Parliament ratified them on 7 June 1929. \nThe treaty recognised Vatican City as an independent state under the sovereignty of the Holy See. Italy also agreed to give the Catholic Church financial compensation for the loss of the Papal States. In 1948, the Lateran Treaty was recognized in the Constitution of Italy as regulating the relations between the Italian Republic and the Catholic Church. While the treaty was significantly revised in 1984, ending the status of Catholicism as the sole state religion of Italy, the Vatican remains a distinct sovereign entity to the present day.\nContent.\nThe Lateran Pacts are often presented as three treaties: a 27-article treaty of conciliation, a three-article financial convention, and a 45-article concordat; however, the website of the Holy See presents the financial convention as an annex of the treaty of conciliation, considering the pacts as two documents:\nThe treaty defines only part of the public funding of the Catholic Church in Italy.\nHistory.\nDuring the unification of Italy in the mid-19th century, the Papal States under Pope Pius IX resisted incorporation into the new nation, even as almost all the other Italian countries joined it; Camillo Cavour's dream of proclaiming the Kingdom of Italy from the steps of St. Peter's Basilica did not come to pass. The nascent Kingdom of Italy invaded and occupied Romagna (the eastern portion of the Papal States) in 1860, leaving only Lazio (\"Latium\") in the pope's domains. \nLatium, including Rome itself, was occupied and annexed in 1870. For the following sixty years, relations between the Papacy and the Italian government were hostile, and the sovereign rights of the pope became known as the Roman question.\nUnder the terms of the Law of Guarantees of 1871, the Italian government offered to Pius IX and his successors the use of, but not sovereignty over, the Vatican and Lateran Palaces and a yearly income of 3,250,000 Lire. The Holy See refused this settlement, on the grounds that the pope's spiritual jurisdiction required clear independence from any political power, and thereafter each pope considered himself a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". The Lateran Treaty ended this impasse.\nNegotiations for the settlement of the Roman question began in 1926 between the Holy See and the Italian fascist government led by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and culminated in the agreements of the Lateran Pacts, signed\u2014the Treaty says\u2014for King Victor Emmanuel III by Mussolini and for Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri, on 11 February 1929. It was ratified on 7 June 1929.\nThe agreements included a political treaty which created the state of the Vatican City and guaranteed full and independent sovereignty to the Holy See. The Pope was pledged to perpetual neutrality in international relations and to abstention from mediation in a controversy unless specifically requested by all parties. In the first article of the treaty, Italy reaffirmed the principle established in the 1848 Constitution of the Kingdom of Italy, that \"the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Religion is the only religion of the State\". \nThe attached financial agreement was accepted as settlement of all the claims of the Holy See against Italy from the loss of temporal power over the Papal States in 1870, though the sum agreed to was actually less than Italy had offered in 1871. To commemorate the successful conclusion of the negotiations, Mussolini commissioned the \"Via della Conciliazione\" (\"Road of the Conciliation\"), which would symbolically link the Vatican City to the heart of Rome.\nAfter 1946.\nThe post-World War II Constitution of the Italian Republic, adopted in 1948, states that relations between the State and the Catholic Church \"are regulated by the Lateran Treaties\". In 1984, the concordat was significantly revised. Both sides declared: \"The principle of the Catholic religion as the sole religion of the Italian State, originally referred to by the Lateran Pacts, shall be considered to be no longer in force.\"\nThe exclusive state financial support for the Church was ended, and replaced by financing through a dedicated personal income tax called the \"otto per mille\", under which Italian taxpayers devolve a compulsory 0.8% from their annual income tax return to a religious group recognized by Italy, or a state-run social assistance program. To gain access to the tax funds, a religion must formally agree to participating in the program by signing a document called \"stipulation of intese\", along with the Prime Minister, which must then be ratified by Parliament. As of 2023, there were 13 religious groups with access: Confederation of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, Seventh-day Adventists, Assemblies of God, Jews, Baptists, Lutherans, the Church of Jesus Christ, Orthodox Church of the Constantinople Patriarchate, Italian Apostolic Church, Buddhist Union, Soka Gakkai Buddhists, Hindus, and the Anglican Church. Although two of the largest minority religions in Italy are excluded from this system: Jehovah's Witnesses and Islam. Although two Prime Ministers have signed \"intese\" agreements with the Jehovah's Witnesses, in both instances Parliament neglected to put the matter up to a vote for ratification, leading the Witnesses to take legal action against this apparent discrimination with the European Court of Human Rights. The Italian government has attempted to negotiate a \"intese\" with Islamic groups on at least two occasions, but the negotiations were unsuccessful, as the numerous Islamic associations in Italy could not agree upon the terms needed to a establish a unified organization that could sign an \"intesa\" and receive the 0.8 percent tax.\nThe revised concordat regulated the conditions under which the state accords legal recognition to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages. The agreement also ended state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the Holy See, the right of the state to request ecclesiastical honours for those chosen to perform religious functions for the state or the royal household, and the right of the state to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops. In 2008, it was announced that the Vatican would no longer immediately adopt all Italian laws, citing conflict over right-to-life issues, partially attributed to the November, 2008 Italian court ruling in the trial and ruling of the Eluana Englaro case.\nViolations.\nThe Italian racial laws of 1938 prohibited marriages between Jews and non-Jews, including Catholics: the Vatican viewed this as a violation of the Concordat, which gave the church the sole right to regulate marriages involving Catholics. Article 34 of the Concordat specified that marriages performed by the Catholic Church would always be considered valid by civil authorities. The Holy See understood this to apply to all marriages in Italy celebrated by Roman Catholic clergy, regardless of the faiths of those being married.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArchival sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The later circuit dissolved before the 1964 season and refounded itself as the Southern League. Following MLB's reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, it operated as the Double-A South for one season before switching back to its previous moniker in 2022.

It operated at various times as a Class B league (equivalent to short-season Class A before 2021, and Low-A since 2021). Fraught with financial problems, teams regularly dropped out before the season's end. After being nonoperational in 1891, 1892, and 1897, it disbanded permanently after halting play during the 1899 season.\nThe Southern Association was formed in 1901 as a Class B circuit operating in nearly the same footprint as the first Southern League. It was elevated to Class A in 1902, Class A1 in 1936, and Double-A in 1946. The Southern Association remained a premier Southern baseball league until Major League Baseball radio and television broadcasts began to undercut attendance in the 1950s. The league disbanded after 1961.\nThe original South Atlantic League, nicknamed the \"SALLY League\" and not related to the current South Atlantic League (formerly the Western Carolinas League), was formed in 1904. It operated at Class C until it was elevated to Class B in 1921 and Class A in 1946. A year after the Southern Association's disbandment, the SALLY League took its place at the Double-A level in 1963.\nThe modern league (1964\u2013present).\nThe Double-A SALLY League dissolved after the 1963 season and refounded itself as the Southern League. The newly minted league wanted to distance itself from the SALLY League's past history in the low minors. Additionally, many leagues had contributed to its legacy. For these reasons, it elected to start with a clean slate and does not claim the original SALLY League's history or records as its own. In its inaugural campaign, the six-team Southern League consisted of the Asheville Tourists, Birmingham Barons, Charlotte Hornets, Chattanooga Lookouts, Columbus Confederate Yankees, Knoxville Smokies, Lynchburg White Sox, and Macon Peaches. Sam C. Smith, the last president of the SALLY League, served as president of the new Southern League. \nFrom 1967 to 1969, the league was reduced to six teams. It went back to eight clubs in 1970, but dropped to seven in 1971. With an odd number of teams, the Southern League joined forces with the Double-A Texas League as the Dixie Association in 1971. The two leagues played an interlocking schedule with individual league champions determined at the end of the season. Up to this point, the Southern League pennant had simply gone to the team with the best record at the end of the regular season. For the first time, the top two Southern League teams met in a best-of-three series to determine champions. The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Asheville Tourists, 2\u20131, and then defeated the Texas League champion Arkansas Travelers, 3\u20130, to win the Dixie Association championship. The partnership was dissolved after the season.\nPresident Smith died suddenly in April 1971, and Billy Hitchcock became the new president that August. Hitchcock introduced a number of changes that are still in use today. In 1972, the Southern League was split into two divisions, Eastern and Western. The playoffs, which began in the Dixie Association, were continued and expanded to a best-of-five series. The league also began selecting postseason All-Star teams and issuing awards for the Most Valuable Player, Most Outstanding Pitcher, and Manager of the Year. In 1976, it introduced a split-season format with the schedule divided in half and first and second half champions from each division being crowned. This expanded the playoffs to two rounds with the winners of each half competing for each division's championship and those winners meeting for the league championship. With the addition of two teams in 1978, the Southern League grew to 10\u00a0teams. Other improvements under Hitchcock's presidency included stadium refurbishments and efforts to make the league more family-friendly. Attendance figures rose dramatically during his tenure.\nJim Bragan became president in 1981 after Hitchcock's retirement. Over his 14\u00a0years leading the Southern League, attendance continued to grow as several cities built new ballparks. In 1994, Arnie Fielkow succeeded Bragan as president, and Don Mincher took over in 2000. Lori Webb became president in 2012 after Mincher's death that March.\nCOVID-19 impact and takeover by Major League Baseball (2020\u2013present).\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Southern League was reduced to eight teams and temporarily renamed the \"Double-A South\" for the 2021 season. Following MLB's acquisition of the rights to the historical names of the minor leagues, the Double-A South was renamed the Southern League effective with the 2022 season.\nCurrent teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nStructure and season.\nThe Southern League is currently divided into two divisions, North and South, of four teams each. Previously, from 1972 to 2004, the league was split into Eastern and Western divisions. There were no divisions in place from 1964 to 1970. As of 2020, each club had 140 games scheduled per season. Utilizing a split-season schedule, each half consisted of 70 games. The season typically began during the first or second week of April and concluded in the first week of September on Labor Day.\nPlayers.\nThe Southern League uses a salary cap. As of the 2024 season, clubs are required to spend a maximum of US$1,360,000 on player compensation, with a minimum salary of $30,250 per player. For players aged 23 and younger on standard contracts, only 50% of their salary counts towards the cap (up to $200,000 total). There is also a separate salary cap for coaches and technical staff. Rosters are limited to a size of 28 players on Opening Day weekend, although up to 9 players can be signed on the roster before the transactions date limit.\nAll-Star Game.\nThe Southern League All-Star Game was an annual midsummer game between two teams of the league's players, one made up of All-Stars from North Division teams and the other from South Division teams. First held in 1964, the event predominantly consisted of a single team of the league's All-Stars versus a Major League Baseball team through 1998. The division versus division format was used continuously from 1999 to 2019. No game was held from 1991 to 1995 as the Southern League and the other two Double-A leagues, the Eastern League and Texas League, participated in the Double-A All-Star Game instead.\nTeams timeline.\nLeague members Dixie Association Other active league Other Defunct League\nAll-time teams.\nA \"^\" indicates that team's article redirects to an article of an active team formerly of the Southern League\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChampions.\nLeague champions have been determined by different means since the Southern League's formation in 1964. Through 1970, champions were the regular-season pennant winners\u2014the team with the best win\u2013loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. The 1971 title was decided in a postseason series between the two teams with the best records. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each of two divisions competed in a series to determine champions. The league operated using a split season format from 1976 to 2020. Under this format, the winners of each half within each division played for the division championship, and the division winners met to play for the SL title. The 2021 winner was crowned via a series between the two teams with the best full-season records. The 2022 championship will be decided through the same split-season divisional format used for most of the league's existence.\nThe Birmingham Barons have won 9 Southern League championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Jacksonville Suns (6) and the Montgomery Rebels (5).\nAwards.\nThe SL recognizes outstanding players and team personnel annually near the end of each season.\nMVP Award.\nThe Most Valuable Player Award is given to honor the best player in the league.\nPitcher of the Year Award.\nThe Pitcher of the Year Award, originally known as the Most Outstanding Pitcher Award, serves to recognize the league's best pitcher.\nManager of the Year Award.\nThe Manager of the Year Award is given to the league's top manager.\nTop MLB Prospect Award.\nThe Top MLB Prospect Award, created in 2021, is given to the league's top rookie prospect.\nPresidents.\nSix presidents led the Southern League since its formation:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Extreme events are based on a location's recorded weather history. The main types of extreme weather include heat waves, cold waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation or storm events, such as tropical cyclones. Extreme weather can have various effects, from natural hazards such as floods and landslides to social costs on human health and the economy. Severe weather is a particular type of extreme weather which poses risks to life and property.\nWeather patterns in a given region vary with time, and so extreme weather can be attributed, at least in part, to the natural climate variability that exists on Earth. For example, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are climate phenomena that impact weather patterns worldwide. Generally speaking, one event in extreme weather cannot be attributed to any one single cause. However, certain system wide changes to global weather systems can lead to increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.\nClimate change might make some extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. This applies in particular to heat waves and cold waves. The extreme event attribution sector looks at possible explanations behind extreme events. Climate models indicate that rising temperatures might make extreme weather events worse worldwide. \nExtreme weather has serious impacts on human society and on ecosystems. There is loss of human lives, damage to infrastructure and ecosystem destruction. Some human activities can exacerbate the effects, for example poor urban planning, wetland destruction, and building homes along floodplains.\nDefinition.\nExtreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as follows: \"An event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.\" \nIn contrast, the World Meteorological Organization define \"severe weather\" as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life, property or requires the intervention of authorities. Severe weather is thus a particular type of extreme weather.\nTypes.\nDefinitions of extreme weather vary in different parts of the community, changing the outcomes of research from those fields. Types of extreme weather can include, but are not limited to, heavy precipitation, droughts, heat waves, cold waves, tornadoes, and hurricanes. \nHeat waves.\nHeat waves are periods of abnormally high temperatures and heat index. Definitions of a heatwave vary because of the variation of temperatures in different geographic locations. Excessive heat is often accompanied by high levels of humidity, but can also be catastrophically dry.\nBecause heat waves are not visible as other forms of severe weather, like hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, they are one of the less known forms of extreme weather. Severely hot weather can damage populations and crops due to potential dehydration or hyperthermia, heat cramps, heat expansion, and heat stroke. Dried soils are more susceptible to erosion, decreasing lands available for agriculture. Outbreaks of wildfires can increase in frequency as dry vegetation has an increased likelihood of igniting. The evaporation of bodies of water can be devastating to marine populations, decreasing the size of the habitats available as well as the amount of nutrition present within the waters. Livestock and other animal populations may decline as well.\nDuring excessive heat, plants shut their leaf pores (stomata), a protective mechanism to conserve water but also curtails plants' absorption capabilities. This leaves more pollution and ozone in the air, which leads to higher mortality in the population. It has been estimated that extra pollution during the hot summer of 2006 in the UK, cost 460 lives. The European heat waves from summer 2003 are estimated to have caused 30,000 excess deaths, due to heat stress and air pollution. Over 200 U.S cities have registered new record high temperatures. The worst heat wave in the US occurred in 1936 and killed more than 5000 people directly. The worst heat wave in Australia occurred in 1938\u201339 and killed 438. The second worst was in 1896.\nPower outages can also occur within areas experiencing heat waves due to the increased demand for electricity (i.e. air conditioning use). The urban heat island effect can increase temperatures, particularly overnight.\nCold waves.\nA cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection for agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year. Cold waves generally are capable of occurring at any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams.\nA cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach necessary food and water, and die of hypothermia or starvation. Cold waves often necessitate the purchase of fodder for livestock at a considerable cost to farmers. Human populations can be inflicted with frostbite when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs.\nExtreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipes to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor plumbing may rupture as frozen water expands within them, causing property damage. Fires, paradoxically, become more hazardous during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult.\nCold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth. This results in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically. Such cold waves have caused famines. Cold waves can also cause soil particles to harden and freeze, making it harder for plants and vegetation to grow within these areas. One extreme was the so-called Year Without a Summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions reduced incoming sunlight.\nIn some cases more frequent extremely cold winter weather \u2013 i.e. across parts of Asia and North America including the February 2021 North American cold wave \u2013 can be a result of climate change such as due to changes in the Arctic. However, conclusions that link climate change to cold waves are considered to still be controversial. The JRC PESETA IV project concluded in 2020 that overall climate change will result in a decline in the intensity and frequency of extreme cold spells, with milder winters reducing fatalities from extreme cold, even if individual cold extreme weather may sometimes be caused by changes due to climate change and possibly even become more frequent in some regions.\nAccording to a 2023 study, \"weak extreme cold events (ECEs) significantly decrease in frequency, projection area and total area over the north hemisphere with global warming. However, the frequency, projection area and total area of strong ECEs show no significant trend, whereas they are increasing in Siberia and Canada.\"\nLess rain than usual.\nA shift in rainfall patterns can lead to greater amounts of precipitation in one area while another experiences much hotter, drier conditions, which can lead to drought. This is because an increase in temperatures also lead to an increase in evaporation at the surface of the earth, so more precipitation does not necessarily mean universally wetter conditions or a worldwide increase in drinking water.\nCauses and attribution.\nAttribution research.\nGenerally speaking, one event in extreme weather cannot be attributed to any one cause. However, certain system wide changes to global weather systems can lead to increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.\nEarly research in extreme weather focused on statements about predicting certain events. Contemporary research focuses more on the attribution of causes to trends in events. In particular the field is focusing on climate change alongside other causal factors for these events.\nA 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, recommended investing in improved shared practices across the field working on attribution research, improving the connection between research outcomes and weather forecasting.\nAs more research is done in this area, scientists have begun to investigate the connection between climate change and extreme weather events and what future impacts may arise. Much of this work is done through climate modeling. Climate models provide important predictions about the future characteristics of the atmosphere, oceans, and Earth using data collected in the modern day. However, while climate models are vital for studying more complex processes such as climate change or ocean acidification, they are still only approximations. Moreover, weather events are complex and cannot be tied to a singular cause\u2014there are often many atmospheric variables such as temperature, pressure, or moisture to note on top of any influences from climate change or natural variability.\nNatural variability.\nAspects of our climate system have a certain level of natural variability, and extreme weather events can occur for several reasons beyond human impact, including changes in pressure or the movement of air. Areas along the coast or located in tropical regions are more likely to experience storms with heavy precipitation than temperate regions, although such events can occur. \nThe atmosphere is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by several factors such as the natural tilt and orbit of the Earth, the absorption or reflection of solar radiation, the movement of air masses, and the water cycle. Due to this, weather patterns can experience some variation, and so extreme weather can be attributed, at least in part, to the natural climate variability that exists on Earth. \nClimatic phenomena such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) impact weather patterns in specific regions of the world, influencing temperature and precipitation. The record-breaking extreme weather events that have been catalogued throughout the past two hundred years most likely arise when climate patterns like ENSO or NAO work \"in the same direction as human\u2010induced warming.\"\nClimate change.\nSome studies assert a connection between rapidly warming arctic temperatures and thus a vanishing cryosphere to extreme weather in mid-latitudes. In a study published in Nature in 2019, scientists used several simulations to determine that the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could affect overall sea level and sea temperature. Other models have shown that modern temperature rise and the subsequent addition of meltwater to the ocean could lead to a disruption of the thermohaline circulation, which is responsible for the movement of seawater and distribution of heat around the globe. A collapse of this circulation in the northern hemisphere could lead to an increase in extreme temperatures in Europe, as well as more frequent storms by throwing off natural climate variability and conditions. Thus, as increasing temperatures cause glaciers to melt, mid-latitudes could experience shifts in weather patterns or temperatures.\nThere were around 6,681 climate-related events reported during 2000\u20132019, compared to 3,656 climate-related events reported during 1980\u20131999. In this report, a 'climate-related event' refers to floods, storms, droughts, landslides, extreme temperatures (like heat waves or freezes), and wildfires; it excludes geophysical events such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or mass movements. While there is evidence that a changing global climate, such as an increase in temperature, has impacted the frequency of extreme weather events, the most significant effects are likely to arise in the future. This is where climate models are useful, for they can provide simulations of how the atmosphere may behave over time and what steps need to be taken in the present day to mitigate any negative changes.\nThe increasing probability of record week-long heat extremes occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level.\nSome researchers attribute increases in extreme weather occurrences to more reliable reporting systems. A difference in what qualifies as 'extreme weather' in varying climate systems could also be argued. Over or under reporting of casualties or losses can lead to inaccuracy in the impact of extreme weather. However, the UN reports show that, although some countries have experienced greater effects, there have been increases in extreme weather events on all continents. Current evidence and climate models show that an increasing global temperature will intensify extreme weather events around the globe, thereby amplifying human loss, damages and economic costs, and ecosystem destruction.\nTropical cyclones and climate change.\nIn 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. government predicted that, over the 21st Century, the frequency of tropical storms and Atlantic hurricanes would decline by 25 percent while their maximum intensity would rise by 5 percent.\nFloods.\nClimate change has led to an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of certain types of extreme weather. Storms such as hurricanes or tropical cyclones may experience greater rainfall, causing major flooding events or landslides by saturating soil. This is because warmer air is able to 'hold' more moisture due to the water molecules having increased kinetic energy, and precipitation occurs at a greater rate because more molecules have the critical speed needed to fall as rain drops.\nHuman activities that exacerbate the effects.\nThere are plenty of anthropogenic activities that can exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events. Urban planning often amplifies urban flooding impacts, especially in areas that are at increased risk of storms due to their location and climate variability. First, increasing the amount of impervious surfaces, such as sidewalks, roads, and roofs, means that less of the water from incoming storms is absorbed by the land. The destruction of wetlands, which act as a natural reservoir by absorbing water, can intensify the impact of floods and extreme precipitation. This can happen both inland and at the coast. However, wetland destruction along the coast can mean decreasing an area's natural 'cushion,' thus allowing storm surges and flood waters to reach farther inland during hurricanes or cyclones. Building homes below sea level or along a floodplain puts residents at increased risk of destruction or injury in an extreme precipitation event.\nMore urban areas can also contribute to the rise of extreme or unusual weather events. Tall structures can alter the way that wind moves throughout an urban area, pushing warmer air upwards and inducing convection, creating thunderstorms. With these thunderstorms comes increased precipitation, which, because of the large amounts of impervious surfaces in cities, can have devastating impacts. Impervious surfaces also absorb energy from the sun and warm the atmosphere, causing drastic increases in temperatures in urban areas. This, along with pollution and heat released from cars and other anthropogenic sources, contributes to urban heat islands.\nEffects.\nExtreme weather affects a range of issues, from the economy to human health, and can lead to the occurrence of natural hazards, such as floods and landslides.\nEconomic cost.\nIn the face of record breaking extreme weather events, climate change adaptation efforts fall short while economists are confronted with inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, and economic uncertainty. In 2011 the IPCC estimated, that annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few billion to above US$200\u00a0billion, with the highest economic losses occurring in 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina. The global weather-related disaster losses, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses.\nThe World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey 2023\u20132024 (GRPS) found that 66 percent of respondents selected extreme weather as top risk. The survey was conducted after the 2023 heat waves. According to the GRPS results, the perception of necessary short and long-term risk management varies. Younger respondents prioritize environmental risks, including extreme weather, in the short-term. Respondents working in the private sector prioritize environmental risks as long-term.\nCasualties.\nThe death toll from natural disasters has declined over 90 percent since the 1920s, according to the International Disaster Database, even as the total human population on Earth quadrupled, and temperatures rose 1.3\u00a0\u00b0C. In the 1920s, 5.4\u00a0million people died from natural disasters while in the 2010s, just 400,000 did.\nThe most dramatic and rapid declines in deaths from extreme weather events have taken place in south Asia. Where a tropical cyclone in 1991 in Bangladesh killed 135,000 people, and a 1970 cyclone killed 300,000, the similarly-sized Cyclone Ampham, which struck India and Bangladesh in 2020, killed just 120 people in total.\nOn July 23, 2020, Munich Re announced that the 2,900 total global deaths from natural disasters for the first half of 2020 were a record-low, and \"much lower than the average figures for both the last 30 years and the last 10 years.\"\nA 2021 study found that 9.4% of global deaths between 2000 and 2019 \u2013 ~5\u00a0million annually \u2013 can be attributed to extreme temperature with cold-related ones making up the larger share and decreasing and heat-related ones making up ~0.91% and increasing.\nA 2023 study published in \"The Lancet Planetary Health\" estimates that extreme cold events contributed to over 200,000 excess deaths and extreme heat events contributed to over 20,000 excess deaths in European urban areas between 2000 and 2019.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The remaining boat in the class, , was decommissioned in December 2010. The six boats of the class were not replaced, although the seven boats of the successor \"Trafalgar\"-class submarines are in the process of being replaced by seven boats of the \"Astute\"-class submarines.\nA few were upgraded with the capability to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles in addition to their original armaments of torpedoes, mines and anti-ship missiles. They were also the first class of Royal Navy submarines to be built with shrouded pump-jet propulsors.\nDesign history.\nThe , and classes all had a \"whale-shaped hull\", of \"near-perfect streamlining giving maximum underwater efficiency\". The hulls were of British design, \"based on the pioneering work of the US Navy in and .\" The hull of the \"Swiftsure\" class was a different shape and maintained its diameter for a much greater length than previous classes. Compared with the \"Valiant\"s the \"Swiftsure\"s were \"shorter with a fuller form, with the fore-planes set further forward, with one less torpedo tube and with a deeper diving depth.\"\nA second major change was in propulsion. Rather than the seven/nine-bladed propeller used by the previous classes, all but the first of the \"Swiftsure\"-class submarines used a shrouded pump-jet propulsor. The prototype propulsor had powered . It is not clear why was the only one of the class not fitted with a propulsor. The propulsor was perhaps as much as 50% more efficient than a propeller, producing the same speed at lower revolutions, thus reducing the noise signature. In addition all pipework connections to equipment on the main machinery raft had expansion/flexible coupling connections, which also reduced noise. The US Navy secured a licence to copy the main shaft flexible coupling arrangement in US-built submarines.\nOperational history.\nCombat history.\nBoth \"Splendid\" and \"Spartan\" were ordered to sail south for the Falkland Islands two days before the Argentine invasion of the islands on 30 March 1982. \"Spartan\" was the first boat to arrive in the islands and began to enforce a maritime exclusion zone imposed by the British. Shortly after, \"Spartan\" sighted Argentine merchant shipping mining the harbour at Stanley, but was not ordered to attack. This was partly due to British concerns about escalating the war too early, but also to avoid scaring off more valuable targets such as the Argentine aircraft carrier . Unlike , neither \"Spartan\" nor \"Splendid\" fired in anger during the Falklands War, but they did provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements and the submarines' presence effectively restricted the freedom of action of the Argentine Navy which spent most of the war confined to port.\nIn the late 1990s, \"Splendid\" became the first British vessel to be armed with American-built Tomahawk cruise missiles. In 1999 the BBC was allowed on board the boat to record her firing Tomahawks in battle against Yugoslav targets in Belgrade during the Kosovo War, becoming the first British submarine in the conflict to do so. She again fired these weapons against Iraqi targets in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nIncidents.\nIn the early 1980s \"Sceptre\" collided with a Soviet submarine and her reactor's protection systems would have performed an automatic emergency shutdown (scrammed the reactor), but her captain ordered the safety mechanisms overridden (battleshort enabled). The crew were told to say that they had hit an iceberg. This incident was disclosed when David Forghan, \"Sceptre\"'s former weapons officer, gave a television interview which was broadcast on 19 September 1991. The Soviet submarine involved was probably \"K-211 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky\" of the Delta III class, which on 23 May 1981 collided with an unknown submarine, identified at the time as an unknown American .\n\"Sovereign\" underwent an extensive refit in the mid-1990s and was rededicated in January 1997. Cracks were discovered in the tailshaft during post-refit sea trials and she was sent to Rosyth for 14 weeks of emergency repairs in June 1998 before returning to Faslane.\nOn 6 March 2000 \"Sceptre\" suffered a serious accident while inside a drydock at the Rosyth yards while undergoing trials towards the end of a major refit. The test involved flooding the drydock, and running the main engines slowly with steam supplied from the shore. However, too much steam was used and the engines over-sped. \"Sceptre\" broke her moorings and moved forward off the cradle she rested on. The steam line ruptured, scaffolding buckled, a crane was pushed forward some , and the submarine moved forward some inside the dock.\nOn 26 May 2008, \"Superb\" hit an underwater pinnacle in the Red Sea, south of the Suez Canal. She remained watertight, and none of the 112 crew were injured; however, she was unable to resubmerge due to damage to her sonar. After undertaking initial repairs at the Souda Bay NATO base on Crete on 10 June 2008, she passed through the Mediterranean, with a pause (at night) some miles off Gibraltar to disembark some less critical crew. \"Superb\" then continued back to the UK, arriving at HMNB Devonport on 28 June 2008. After surveying the damage, the Royal Navy decided to decommission \"Superb\" slightly ahead of schedule on 26 September 2008.\nIn fiction.\nHMS \"Sceptre\" acts as a \"nom de guerre\" for the \"Red October\" in Tom Clancy's eponymous novel, as she enters the Norfolk Naval Station.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien's writings\nMithril is a fictional metal found in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth writings. It is described as resembling silver, but being stronger and lighter than steel. It was used to make armour, such as the helmets of the citadel guard of Minas Tirith, and \"ithildin\" alloy, used to decorate gateways with writing visible only by starlight or moonlight. Always extremely valuable, by the end of the Third Age it was beyond price, and only a few artefacts made of it remained in use.\nImpenetrable armour occurs in Norse mythology in \"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\", a story that Tolkien certainly knew and could have used for his mithril mail-coat. Mithril is the only invented mineral in his Middle-earth writings. Chemists note mithril's remarkable properties, strong and light like titanium, perhaps when made into alloys with elements such as titanium or nickel, and in its pure form malleable like gold.\nThe scholar Charles A. Huttar states that Tolkien treats mineral treasures as having the potential for both good and evil, recalling the association of mining and metalwork in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" with Satan. The scholar Paul Kocher interprets the Dwarves' intense secrecy around mithril as an expression of sexual frustration, given that they have very few dwarf-women.\nThe metal appears in many derivative fantasy works by later authors.\nTolkien.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"mithril\" comes from two words in Tolkien's Sindarin language\u2014\"mith\", meaning \"grey\", and \"ril\", meaning \"glitter\". The Dwarves kept their own name for the material secret.\nProperties.\nIn \"The Hobbit\", Thorin Oakenshield described some Dwarven treasures as \"coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable\" and \"a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel.\" A little later the narrator describes \"a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril\".\nIn \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", the wizard Gandalf explained mithril to the rest of the Fellowship in Moria:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Mithril!\" All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of \"mithril\" did not tarnish or grow dim.\nThe Noldor of Eregion, the Elvish land to the west of Moria, made an alloy from it called \"ithildin\" (\"star moon\"), used to decorate gateways, portals and pathways. It was visible only by starlight or moonlight. The West Gate of Moria bore inlaid \"ithildin\" designs and runes.\nAbundance.\nIn Tolkien's Middle-earth, mithril is extremely rare by the end of the Third Age, as it was now found only in Khazad-d\u00fbm. Once the Balrog destroyed Khazad-d\u00fbm, the kingdom of the Dwarves in Moria, the only source of new mithril ore was cut off. Before Moria was abandoned by the Dwarves, while it was still being actively mined, mithril was worth ten times its weight in gold. After the Dwarves abandoned Moria and production of new mithril stopped entirely, it became priceless.\nTolkien hints that mithril was found in the lost island kingdom of N\u00famenor and the inaccessible continent of Aman.\nThe mithril-coat.\nThe principal item made of mithril in the works of Tolkien is the \"small coat of mail\" that Thorin Oakenshield gave to Bilbo Baggins after it had been retrieved from the hoard of Smaug the dragon. Gandalf stated that the value of this mithril-coat was \"greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it\". The mail-shirt was first described in \"The Hobbit\" in 1937, but without any mention of mithril. Tolkien first described the shirt as being made of mithril in \"The Lord of the Rings\" in 1954, and it was retrospectively mentioned in the third, revised edition of \"The Hobbit\" in 1966. In the first 1937 edition, the mail shirt given to Bilbo Baggins is described as being made of \"silvered steel\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBilbo wore the mithril shirt during the Battle of the Five Armies. He donated it to the Mathom-house, a museum in Michel Delving. However he later reclaimed it, and took it with him when he left the Shire for his journey to Rivendell. There, some years later, he gave the shirt to Frodo Baggins when the younger hobbit embarked on his quest in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Frodo wore the mail underneath his tunic and other shirt unbeknownst to the rest of the fellowship. The mail saved Frodo's life when he was struck by an orc chieftain's spear thrust during the battle in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and again when orc-arrows struck him while escaping Moria and while crossing the River Anduin.\nWhen Sam Gamgee believed Frodo to be dead outside Shelob's Lair, he left the shirt with Frodo. Frodo was taken by the orcs, who fought over the shirt. Frodo was saved, but one of the orcs escaped with the shirt. In both Tolkien's and versions, the shirt was, along with Frodo's other possessions, shown to Frodo's allies at the Battle of the Morannon to imply falsely that he was imprisoned in Barad-d\u00fbr. Gandalf took the shirt and other tokens, but refused any offer of parley.\nAt the end of the story, Frodo wore the shirt at the celebrations and on the trip home. The shirt saved his life one last time when Saruman, who had taken over the Shire, tried to stab Frodo after Frodo spared his life. When he left to sail to Elvenhome, he gave all his possessions to Sam.\nOther objects.\nNenya, the Ring of Power wielded by Galadriel, was made of mithril.\nThe guards of the citadel of Minas Tirith wore helmets of mithril, \"heirlooms from the glory of old days\". They were the only soldiers in Gondor who still bore the emblems of the lost kings during the days of the stewards.\nAs Aragorn's ships sailed up the Anduin to relieve the besieged Minas Tirith during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the standard flying on his ship showed a crown made of mithril and gold.\nAfter Gimli became lord of Aglarond, he and his Dwarves forged great gates of mithril and steel to replace the gates of Minas Tirith, which had been broken by the Witch-king of Angmar.\nThe \"Elendilmir\", the Star of Arnor, was a \"white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril\". It was made for Silmari\u00ebn, mother of Valandil; it passed down to Elendil. It was found in Orthanc when the Ents returned the tower to King Aragorn, evidence that Saruman had found and apparently destroyed Isildur's remains.\nGreatest of all, according to legend, was the ship of E\u00e4rendil, Vingil\u00f3t\u00eb, which he sailed into the sky, making the gleam of \"truesilver\" visible to the world as the Evening and Morning Star. The \"Song of E\u00e4rendil\", written by Bilbo and Aragorn, contains the lines \"A ship then new they built for him / of mithril and of elven-glass\". The linguist of Elvish languages Anthony Appleyard wrote that this machine, with \"no shaven oar nor sail\", was evidently of an advanced technology, \"sound[ing] suspiciously like most people's image of a spaceship.\"\nAnalysis.\nOrigins.\nNorse culture contains myths of impenetrable armour, such as the shirt made by elves and used in battle by \u00d6rvar-Oddr (\u00d8rvar Odd), as related in the \"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\". The saga was translated by Christopher Tolkien, with a commentary, and his father was certainly familiar with the text.\nThe mining executive Dani\u00e8le Barberis notes that Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in a busy mining region. She writes that it is \"impossible ... not to make parallels\" between Tolkien's descriptions of the deep mines of Moria and the exceptional depth of South African mines, some as much as deep.\nMetallurgy.\nThe chemist Suze Kundu describes mithril as a metal, a pure chemical element with \"a range of amazing chemical and physical properties\" not matched by any real metal, and many applications. Of those that approach it, titanium is light (has a low density) and strong, but it is not malleable (able to be beaten into shape) like mithril. In Kundu's view the nearest material would be a stainless steel alloy of iron with enough nano-scale carbon to make it hard.\nThe metallurgist James Owen suggests that Mithril could be \"an fcc [face-centred cubic] metal like aluminium or nickel, or possibly a bcc [body-centred cubic]\" metal like titanium\". Owen comments that it could form \"strong, stiff, tough alloys\" with those elements, suitable for \"light sword blades and armour\", or used as the pure element, when \"it would be soft and malleable\" like copper or gold. The geologist William Sarjeant, however, notes that mithril crystallises out \"at so high a temperature that it is only found in veins at great depths\", and proposes that it may be a native alloy of platinum with another metal, which might be palladium.\nSignificance.\nThe scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that \"mithril\" was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the caves at Helm's Deep or the mines of Moria, \"beauty and terror [were] side by side\". Greed for \"mithril\" could unleash the terror of the Balrog, by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for \"mithril\" with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the dragons in \"The Hobbit\" and \"Beowulf\" for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil \"inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth\", just as mining and metalwork are associated with Satan in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (I, 670\u2013751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: \"Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane.\"\nThe Tolkien critic Paul Kocher interprets the Dwarves' intense secrecy around mithril and their devotion to artistry in metal and stone as \"a sublimation of their sexual frustration\", given that they have very few dwarf-women and love beauty with a \"jealous possessiveness\", or (quoting Tolkien) \"being engrossed in their crafts\".\nThe name \"mithril\" (also spelt \"mith\", \"mithral\", or \"mythril\") is used in multiple fictional contexts influenced by Tolkien. For example, the \"Final Fantasy\" game series, begun in 1987, involves dwarves and mithril.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dam's key experiment involved feeding a cholesterol-free diet to chickens. He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC). McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that\u2014together with the cholesterol\u2014a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as \"Koagulationsvitamin\".\nHe received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute (now the Technical University of Denmark) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen's Physiological Laboratory. He studied microchemistry at the University of Graz under Fritz Pregl in 1925, but returned to the University of Copenhagen, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at the University of Copenhagen he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted the thesis \"Nogle Unders\u00f8gelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning\" (Some Investigations on the Biological Significance of the Sterines) to the University of Copenhagen, and received the degree of PhD in biochemistry.\nBetween 1942 and 1945 Dam was a senior research associate at the University of Rochester; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the first Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like the majority of Royal Navy nuclear submarines, all seven boats were constructed at Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, Cumbria. The class made up part of the Royal Navy's nuclear-powered 'hunter-killer' submarine force. The \"Trafalgar\" class was replaced by the larger and more capable , of which five are in service. The name \"Trafalgar\" refers to the Battle of Trafalgar fought between the Royal Navy and the combined fleets of France and Spain in 1805.\nDevelopment.\nThe \"Trafalgar\" class were designed in the early 1970s during the Cold War as a refinement of the preceding \"Swiftsure\" class. Including , the \"Trafalgar\" class are the fifth class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines to enter service with the Royal Navy. The lead boat of the class, HMS \"Trafalgar\", was ordered on 7 April 1977 and completed in 1983. The last, HMS \"Triumph\", was ordered on 3 January 1986 and completed in 1991. All seven boats of the class were built and completed by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard.\nIn 1982, \"Jane's Fighting Ships\" recorded: \"Estimated cost of fourth submarine \u00a3175 million including equipment and weapon system when fitted.\" In 1986, \"Jane's Fighting Ships\" recorded that the average cost for this class was \u00a3200 million at 1984\u201385 prices.\nCharacteristics.\nAs a refinement of the preceding \"Swiftsure\" class, the design of the \"Trafalgar\" class bore some similarity, including its internal layout and the Rolls-Royce PWR1 Core 3. However some improvements over the \"Swiftsure\" class included its reduced acoustic signature, which was due to the hull being covered in anechoic tiles which were designed to absorb sound rather than reflect it, making the boats quieter and more difficult to detect with active sonar. A pumpjet propulsion system was also used from the second vessel onward, rather than a conventional propeller. The \"Trafalgar\" class were long, have a beam of , a draught of and a dived displacement of . Each boat had a complement of 130. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the \"Trafalgar\" class had strengthened fins and retractable hydroplanes, allowing them to surface through thick ice.\nFour boats of the class \u2014 \"Torbay\", \"Trenchant\", \"Talent\" and \"Triumph\" \u2014 were fitted with the Sonar 2076 system. Beginning in 2014, the last four boats of the class underwent a communications package upgrade.\nThe \"Trafalgar\" class was equipped with five torpedo tubes with accommodation for a mixture of up to 30 weapons:\nThe Tomahawk missiles are capable of hitting a target to within a few metres, to a range of .\nOstensibly, the submarines used the same steering column as was used in the Wellington bombers of the Second World War.\nBoats of the class.\nInitially, the last five boats of the \"Trafalgar\" class were to be replaced by the 'Future Fleet Submarine' programme, however, this was effectively cancelled in 2001. The are replacing the \"Trafalgar\" class.\nOperational service.\nThe submarines of the class saw service in a wide range of locations, most notably firing Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles in anger at targets during conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Three of the \"Trafalgar\"-class boats were involved in such operations. In 2001 \"Trafalgar\" took part in Operation Veritas, the attack on al-Qaeda and Taliban forces following the 11 September attacks in the United States, becoming the first Royal Navy submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets in Afghanistan. During April 2003, \"Turbulent\" returned home flying the Jolly Roger after having launched thirty Tomahawk cruise missiles during the invasion of Iraq. As part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, \"Triumph\" fired her Tomahawk cruise missiles on three occasions; first on 19 March, then again on 20 March, and finally on 24 March. Her primary targets were Libyan air-defence installations around the city of Sabha. \"Triumph\" returned to Devonport on 3 April 2011 flying a Jolly Roger adorned with six small Tomahawk axes to indicate the missiles fired by the submarine in the operation.\nIn 1993 \"Triumph\" sailed to Australia, covering a distance of whilst submerged and without any forward support. As of 2011, this remained the longest solo deployment by any British nuclear submarine.\nService problems.\nIn 1998, \"Trenchant\" experienced a steam leak, forcing the crew to shut down the nuclear reactor. In 2000 a leak in the PWR1 reactor primary cooling circuit was discovered on \"Tireless\", forcing her to proceed to Gibraltar on diesel power. The fault was found to be due to thermal fatigue cracks, requiring the other \"Trafalgar\"-class boats, and some of the remaining \"Swiftsure\"-class boats, to be urgently inspected and if necessary modified.\nIn 2013 the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator reported that the reactor systems were suffering increasing technical problems due to ageing, requiring effective management. An example was that \"Tireless\" had had a small radioactive coolant leak for eight days in February 2013.\nPotential export.\nIn 1987, the Canadian White Paper on Defence recommended the purchase of 10 to 12 - or \"Trafalgar\"-class submarines under technology transfer, with the choice of the type of submarine due to be confirmed before summer 1988. The goal was to build up a three-ocean navy and to assert Canadian sovereignty over Arctic waters. The purchase was abandoned in April 1989 due to a growing budget deficit.\nIn fiction.\nIn June 2019, ITV commissioned a six-part thriller to be set aboard a fictional \"Trafalgar\"-class submarine, HMS \"Tenacity\". However, production on the series was paused in 2020, before being dropped all together by November 2021.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69918", "revid": "43998273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69918", "title": "Buffalo Sabres", "text": "National Hockey League franchise in Buffalo, New York\nThe Buffalo Sabres are a professional ice hockey team based in Buffalo, New York. The Sabres compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The team was established in 1970, along with the Vancouver Canucks, when the league expanded to 14 teams. The Sabres have played their home games at KeyBank Center since 1996, having previously played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium since their inception. The Sabres are owned by Terry Pegula, who purchased the club in 2011 from Tom Golisano.\nThe team has twice advanced to the Stanley Cup Final, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in 1975 and to the Dallas Stars in 1999. The Sabres, along with the Canucks, are the oldest active NHL franchises to have never won the Stanley Cup. The Sabres have the longest active playoff drought in the NHL at 14 seasons, which stands as an NHL record, and are tied with the New York Jets for the longest active playoff drought across the \"Big 4\" North American sports leagues.\nHistory.\nEarly years and the French Connection (1970\u20131981).\nThe Sabres, along with the Vancouver Canucks, joined the NHL in the 1970\u201371 season. Their first owners were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, scions of a family long prominent in Western New York and grandsons of the co-founders of the Woolworth's variety store chain; along with Robert O. Swados, a Buffalo attorney. On the team's inaugural board of directors were Robert E. Rich Jr., later the owner of the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team; and George W. Strawbridge Jr., an heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the Buffalo Bisons were a pillar of the American Hockey League (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another Bisons hockey team played from 1928 to 1936), winning the Calder Cup in their final season.\nWanting a name other than \"bison\" (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest. With names like \"Mugwumps\", \"Buzzing Bees\" and \"Flying Zeppelins\" being entered, the winning choice, \"Sabres\", was chosen because Seymour Knox felt a sabre was a weapon carried by a leader, and could be effective on both offense and defense. The Knoxes tried twice before to get an NHL team, first when the NHL expanded in 1967, and again when they attempted to purchase the Oakland Seals with the intent of moving them to Buffalo. Their first attempt was thwarted when Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney persuaded his horse racing friends James and Bruce Norris to select Pittsburgh over Buffalo. The second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon, nor isolate the Los Angeles Kings (the only NHL team other than the Seals west of St. Louis at the time) from the rest of the NHL entirely. At the time of their creation, the Sabres created their own AHL farm team, the Cincinnati Swords. Former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager and head coach Punch Imlach was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.\nThe Sabres' debut in 1970 also coincided with the AFL\u2013NFL merger in which the Buffalo Bills joined the National Football League, and the National Basketball Association's Buffalo Braves also began to play. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established major professional sports leagues to three in one off-season. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; Paul Snyder, the \"nouveau riche\" Braves owner, publicly feuded with the old money Knoxes and the local college basketball scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the ABA\u2013NBA merger, moved the team out of Buffalo.\nWhen the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they used Aram Khachaturian's Armenian war dance \"Sabre Dance\" as their entrance song. The music has been associated with the team ever since, typically at the beginning of each period.\nThe consensus was that the first pick in the 1970 NHL amateur draft would be junior phenomenon Gilbert Perreault. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a wheel of fortune. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Quebec-born junior players. The Canucks were allocated numbers 1\u201310 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11\u201320. When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres. Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of 1970\u201371, at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year.\nDuring the team's second season, rookie Rick Martin, drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in 1971, and recently acquired Rene Robert joined Perreault to become one of the league's top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin broke Perreault's goal-scoring record as a rookie with 44 goals. They were nicknamed \"The French Connection\" after the movie of the same name and in homage to their French-Canadian roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in 1972\u201373, just the team's third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens.\nAfter the 1973\u201374 season, which saw them miss the playoffs (as well as defenseman Tim Horton's death in a DUI-induced car accident), the Sabres did an odd moment at the 1974 NHL amateur draft. General manager Punch Imlach annoyed at the length of the draft decided to draft a fictitious Japanese player named Taro Tsujimoto. The pick was later invalidated. That season, they tied for the best record in the NHL in the regular season. Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in team history to play against the Philadelphia Flyers, a series which included the legendary Fog Game (game three of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center Jim Lorentz spotted a bat flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4\u20132.\nAlthough Danny Gare scored 50 goals in the 1975\u201376 season, the team lost in the quarterfinals to the New York Islanders. The team did not return to the Final with the French Connection despite a Wales Conference championship in 1979\u201380 and being the first team to beat a team from the Soviet Union during the Super Series '76. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the Colorado Rockies in 1979 and Martin's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1981. All three players have had their jersey numbers (11, 7 and 14, respectively) retired and a statue erected in their honor at KeyBank Center in 2012.\nAdams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981\u20131996).\nIn 1981\u201382, the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the Boston Bruins or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1983 and Boston in 1993, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the Quebec Nordiques and Montreal in the Adams Division semifinals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387\u2014only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985\u201386 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986\u201387, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.\nThe Sabres drafted Pierre Turgeon with the first pick in the 1987 NHL entry draft, and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987\u201388, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by Alexander Mogilny, who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL. In the 1989\u201390 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points\u2014third-best in the NHL, but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought Pat LaFontaine to Buffalo.\nIn 1992\u201393, goaltender Dominik Hasek joined the team in a trade from the Chicago Blackhawks. In the 1993 playoffs, the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semifinals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. Brad May's series-winning goal in overtime of game four in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's \"May Day!\" call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4\u20133 score.\nWith the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the 1993\u201394 season, the Sabres faced the New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1\u20130 quadruple overtime goaltending duel with the Devils' Martin Brodeur in game six, Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995\u201396, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach Ted Nolan and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the \"hardest-working team in hockey\". This season also featured the debut of veteran Randy Burridge, who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team most valuable player.\nThe final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4\u20131 victory over the Hartford Whalers. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.\nFinal trip and ownership turnover (1996\u20132005).\nTed Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in 1996\u201397, their first at Marine Midland Arena, by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the Hart and Vezina Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's Jacques Plante in 1962), Michael Peca taking home the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager John Muckler honored as Executive of the Year. The team also acquired Miroslav Satan in a trade with the Edmonton Oilers.\nHowever, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in game three of the first round against the Ottawa Senators, Hasek left the game, forcing backup Steve Shields to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. \"The Buffalo News\" columnist Jim Kelley wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper questioning the severity of the injury, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won game five, Hasek came out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields started as the Sabres goaltender for the remainder of the series as the team rallied to defeat Ottawa. However, before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy. Set to return in game four with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Although the Sabres staved off elimination in game four, they lost in game five.\nTeam president Larry Quinn fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan. The new general manager, Darcy Regier, offered Nolan just a one-year contract, but Nolan refused. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Former Sabres captain Lindy Ruff was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract.\nNew owners and return to the Final.\nDuring the 1997\u201398 season, the Sabres, which had lost $32\u00a0million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997, were sold by Northrop Knox to John Rigas, owner of Adelphia Communications. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John's son, Timothy Rigas. The Sabres reached the conference finals that season, but lost to the Washington Capitals in six games.\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, Satan scored 40 goals, doing so during the dead puck era where goal-scoring had dropped to 5.19 goals per game. The Sabres also added centers Stu Barnes from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Joe Juneau from the Capitals. The team returned to the Stanley Cup Final, this time against the Presidents' Trophy-winning Dallas Stars. In game six, Brett Hull's triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull's two shots in the crease constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.\nIn the 1999\u20132000, Doug Gilmour was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline. Hasek was also sidelined for three months due to a torn groin, but returned with two months left in the regular season. Gilmour on the other hand was stricken by stomach flu just before the postseason. The Sabres finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, clinching a playoff spot on the final day of the regular season with a 1\u20131 tie against the Capitals. Like the previous playoffs season, there would be an officiating controversy. In game two, Flyers left wing John LeClair put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the \"side\" of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2\u20131 and go on to win the series four games to one.\nCaptain Michael Peca sat out the 2000\u201301 season due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 for Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games during the first round of the playoffs, winning 8\u20130 in the final game. In the second round, they faced the Pittsburgh Penguins but lost via a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman Darius Kasparaitis. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 2001, closing out his career with Buffalo.\nOwnership turmoil and lockout.\nIn May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2\u00a0billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and served eight years of a 15-year sentence before his release in 2016. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even outright folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by Rochester billionaire, and former New York gubernatorial candidate, Tom Golisano and former Sabres president Larry Quinn. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.\nWith the 2002\u201303 season starting under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger Rob Ray, who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for winger Michael Ryan and a draft pick. A third deal sent center Chris Gratton to the Phoenix Coyotes with a draft pick for Daniel Briere and a draft pick. Over the summer, Regier also completed a three-team trade that landed them Chris Drury. Although the team improved during the 2003\u201304 season, they did not make the playoffs. The next season was then curbed by the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. Many of the players would play overseas or for the Rochester Americans during the lockout.\nPost-lockout success (2005\u20132010).\nIn 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the Empire Sports Network, which had been on the air since 1991, ceased operations during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's seizure of the franchise. Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005\u201306 campaign Madison Square Garden Network (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in western New York, with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Sabres finished with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000\u201301 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979\u201380 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and Carolina Hurricanes for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.\nBuffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 2006 playoffs in six games, then the top-seeded Ottawa in five games in the second round. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first conference finals since 1999. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen, Teppo Numminen, Dmitri Kalinin, Jay McKee, and Henrik Tallinder, and their top powerplay scorer, Tim Connolly, for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres' impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette to win the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.\nThe Sabres started the 2006\u201307 season 10\u20130, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history, after the 1993\u201394 Toronto Maple Leafs, to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) after a 7\u20134 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. This record would be beaten by the 2023\u201324 Los Angeles Kings. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the Presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home-ice advantage for their entire run in the 2007 playoffs. They also tied the 1974\u201375 team's franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive conference finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.\nIn the April 9, 2007, issue of \"ESPN the Magazine\", the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket prices and exciting brand of hockey.\nPost-Briere\u2013Drury era.\nOn July 1, 2007, the Sabres lost both co-captains, with Daniel Briere going to the Philadelphia Flyers and Chris Drury going to the New York Rangers as free agents. The team also nearly lost Thomas Vanek to the Edmonton Oilers, which offered him a seven-year, $50\u00a0million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator Jim Lorentz announced his retirement during the preseason. \"Hockey Night in Canada\"'s Harry Neale took over the position in October 2007.\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at Ralph Wilson Stadium, home of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). The 2008 Winter Classic, known colloquially as the \"Ice Bowl\" due to it taking place at the same time as college football's bowl games. The Sabres lost 2\u20131 in a shootout. The Sabres failed to qualify for the 2008 playoffs and became only the third team in NHL history to go from finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out of the playoffs the following year.\nOn June 10, the Sabres officially announced their new AHL affiliate, beginning in the 2008\u201309 season, would be the Portland Pirates from Portland, Maine. This ended their 29-year affiliation with the Rochester Americans. They signed with the Pirates for two seasons, with a parent club option for a third. In the offseason, the Sabres acquired Craig Rivet from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a second-round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also extended the contracts of some players including Ryan Miller (five years) and Jason Pominville (five years). Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent the upcoming season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent. On October 8, the Sabres named defenseman Craig Rivet team captain, the first single full-time captain since Stu Barnes' term from 2001 to 2003. The team was also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a two-year, $4.2\u00a0million extension, then acquired Mikael Tellqvist from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth-round pick in the 2010 draft. Dominic Moore came from the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 2009 draft. On April 9, the Buffalo Sabres were eliminated from the playoffs.\nGeneral manager Darcy Regier announced on the first day of free agency for the following season the Sabres had signed unrestricted free agent defenseman Steve Montador to a two-year contract. After only playing two games with Buffalo that season, Daniel Paille was traded to the Boston Bruins on October 20, 2009, in exchange for a third-round and a conditional fourth-round draft selection. Paille's move to Boston marked the first ever trade of a player under contract between the two division rivals in their common 39 years in the NHL. Tyler Ennis, who was selected 26th in the 2008 draft, made his NHL debut this season. On January 1, the Sabres became the first team to win consecutive games when trailing by three or more goals since the Dallas Stars did it in 2005\u201306; Buffalo defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4\u20133 in overtime. It was Buffalo's second straight win in a game it trailed 3\u20130, following a 4\u20133 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. On March 27, the Sabres clinched their first playoff berth since 2006\u201307 with a 7\u20131 rout of the Tampa Bay Lightning. On April 6, the Sabres clinched the Northeast Division title by defeating the New York Rangers by a score of 5\u20132. However, they were defeated in six games by the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs.\nThe 2010\u201311 roster did not have many significant changes in the offseason. One of the most notable was the team's decision to waive center Tim Kennedy, a Buffalo native, to avoid paying the award he won in arbitration. Defensemen Henrik Tallinder and Toni Lydman were allowed to leave as free agents, while the team signed veterans Jordan Leopold and Shaone Morrisonn to replace them. Additionally, center Rob Niedermayer was added.\nThe Pegula era (2010\u2013present).\nOn November 30, 2010, Ken Campbell of \"The Hockey News\" reported a story that billionaire Terry Pegula had signed a letter of intent to purchase the Sabres for US$150\u00a0million. Pegula was the founder, president and CEO of East Resources, one of the largest privately held companies in the United States before he sold the company. After the report was released, Sabres managing partner Larry Quinn claimed it was \"untrue\" but refused further comment. The $150\u00a0million was later determined to be an undervalued amount, as \"Forbes\" magazine had valued the team at just under $170\u00a0million in 2010. In December, Pegula officially expressed interest in buying the Sabres for $170\u00a0million and submitted a letter of intent to the NHL. In January, Golisano reportedly issued a counteroffer with an asking price of US$175\u00a0million. Pegula and Golisano reached an agreement to sell the team on January 29, 2011, with Pegula purchasing the team for $189\u00a0million ($175\u00a0million with $14\u00a0million in debt included) with the Sabres and Golisano officially making an announcement in a press conference on February 3, 2011. NHL owners approved the sale on February 18.\nIn the conference, it was stated that an unnamed bidder submitted a much higher bid than Pegula's, but made the bid contingent upon moving the team. The description is consistent with that of Jim Balsillie, who has made public his efforts to move a team to Hamilton, Ontario, a move the Sabres have actively opposed. Terry Pegula named former Pittsburgh Penguins executive Ted Black to be team president. Pegula was introduced as the Sabres' owner in a public ceremony at HSBC Arena on February 23, accompanied by what would be the final appearance of all three members of The French Connection before Rick Martin's death three weeks later. Around the 2010\u201311 trade deadline, the team attempted to trade Craig Rivet, but was unsuccessful. After initially clearing waivers, Rivet entered re-entry waivers and was claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Late on February 27, the team acquired Brad Boyes from the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a second-round draft pick. This was the Sabres' sole trade of the deadline. After Pegula's official takeover of the team, the Sabres finished the regular season 16\u20134\u20134, never losing two consecutive games in that span, and landed the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Pegula's approach was credited by players, fans and the public with bringing new energy to the team, sparking a run to the playoffs that seemed improbable only months earlier. On April 8, the Sabres clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season, defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20133 in overtime. The Sabres clinched the seventh seed and faced Philadelphia in the first round. The Sabres had a three games to two lead but lost the series in seven games.\nPlayoff drought.\nThe Sabres began the 2011\u201312 season as part of the 2011 NHL Premiere series for the first time, playing games in Finland and Germany. The team was particularly well-received during a game against Adler Mannheim in Mannheim, the hometown of Sabres forward Jochen Hecht. Prior to the first game, Lindy Ruff named Jason Pominville the Sabres' 13th full-time captain in team history. The Sabres began the season relatively strong but collapsed after a Boston Bruins game in which Bruins forward Milan Lucic hit and injured goaltender Ryan Miller; the subsequent months saw the Sabres collapse to last place in the Eastern Conference. Despite a two-month rally that began in February along with the emergence of rookie forward Marcus Foligno, the Sabres lost the last two games of the regular season and fell three points short of a playoff spot.\nThe 2012\u201313 NHL lockout eliminated the first part of the 2012\u201313 season, which ultimately began with a scheduled 48 games. After a 6\u201310\u20131 start to the season, Lindy Ruff's contract was terminated by general manager Darcy Regier on February 20, 2013, ending 16 seasons as head coach. Ruff was replaced by Ron Rolston first on an interim basis, then permanently after the season ended. In the days leading up to the trade deadline, the Sabres were active in trades. On March 15, the Sabres' first trade sent T. J. Brennan to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a fifth-round pick (originally owned by the Los Angeles Kings) in the 2013 draft. On March 30, the Sabres traded Jordan Leopold to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a second-round pick and a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2013 draft. On April 1, the Sabres traded Robyn Regehr to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for two-second round draft choices (one in 2014 and the other in 2015). The final trade came on the day of the trade deadline, April 3, where the Sabres sent Jason Pominville to the Minnesota Wild for Johan Larsson and Matt Hackett. At the time of the official announcement, it was not clear if there were other parts of the deal as the trade was still pending NHL approval. It was later revealed that draft picks were also involved in the deal: the Wild would receive a fourth-round pick in the 2014 draft, and the Sabres would receive a first-round pick in the 2013 draft and a second-round pick in the 2014 draft.\nThe following season, on November 13, 2013, the team dismissed general manager Darcy Regier and head coach Ron Rolston. Former Sabres head coach Ted Nolan was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season. He later signed a three-year contract extension. Pat LaFontaine was named president of hockey operations. On January 9, 2014, Tim Murray, the assistant general manager of the Ottawa Senators, was named general manager. On February 28, 2014, Murray made his first major trade, sending star goaltender Ryan Miller and captain Steve Ott to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for goaltender Jaroslav Halak, forwards Chris Stewart and William Carrier and two draft picks. After just over three months as president of hockey operations, Pat LaFontaine resigned from the Sabres to return to his previous position with the NHL on March 1, 2014. Among highlights in the otherwise bad 2013\u201314 season included the \"butt goal\" in which a severely short-staffed Sabres won their December 23 contest against the Phoenix Coyotes when Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith backed into his own goal with the puck lodged in his pants, and the lone NHL appearance of former Lancaster High School goaltender Ryan Vinz, who was working as a videographer in the Sabres organization, to suit up as a backup goaltender in the wake of the Ryan Miller trade. The Sabres finished the 2013\u201314 season last in the NHL and again missed the playoffs.\nDespite winning two more games than the previous season, the 2014\u201315 season was much like the previous one, with the team sitting near the bottom of the standings the entire season, and finishing last in the NHL. On March 26, 2015, during a 4\u20133 overtime loss to the Arizona Coyotes, spectators at the game, ostensibly fans of the Sabres, cheered after a game-winning goal by Coyotes center Sam Gagner. The Sabres clinched last place with a loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 10 and got the second pick in the draft which they used to select Jack Eichel. Murray fired Nolan at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry between them. On May 28, 2015, Dan Bylsma was hired as the 17th head coach in franchise history.\nThe hiring of Bylsma, the drafting of Eichel and 2014 second overall pick Sam Reinhart, the acquisition of star centerman Ryan O'Reilly in the off-season, and the rising performance of youngsters Zemgus Girgensons, Jake McCabe and Rasmus Ristolainen resulted in an improved season in 2015\u201316. Even though the Sabres again missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, the team managed to finish just under .500 in points percentage with a 27-point improvement over the previous season.\nIn mid-2016, the team announced that its television broadcasts would be spun off to their own regional sports network, MSG Western New York. The new network continues to operate under the MSG banner but under Pegula Sports and Entertainment control and features additional programs centered around the Sabres and the Buffalo Bills, which the Pegulas purchased separately in 2014. The team failed to make significant progress, and in fact slightly regressed, in 2016\u201317, missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season, leading to the firings of both head coach Dan Bylsma and general manager Tim Murray on April 20, 2017.\nDuring the 2017 off-season, the Sabres hired two of their former players as head coach and general manager: Jason Botterill as general manager and Phil Housley as head coach. Among the more notable roster changes for this season was the return of former scoring leader Jason Pominville to the team in a trade that brought him and defenseman Marco Scandella to Buffalo in exchange for sending forwards Tyler Ennis and Marcus Foligno to the Minnesota Wild.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Sabres participated in the 2018 Winter Classic, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the New York Rangers. Buffalo finished in last place in the NHL for the third time in five seasons and won the draft lottery for the 2018 NHL entry draft for the first time since 1987, using the pick to select Rasmus Dahlin from Frolunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League.\nOn November 27, 2018, the Sabres became the first team in NHL history to lead the league in points after the first 25 games of the season after finishing last in the league the previous season. The team won 10 games in a row for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season and tied the franchise record. Jeff Skinner became the seventh player in franchise history to score 20 or more goals in less than 27 games, and only the second player to score 20 goals before December. The team then collapsed and missed the playoffs, leading to Housley's firing at the end of the season.\nOn March 21, 2019, it was announced that the Sabres would play the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2019 NHL Global Series at Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden. Ralph Krueger was named the Sabres head coach in May 2019.\nIn the 2019\u201320 season, the Lightning defeated the Sabres 5\u20133 in the Global Series on November 9, 2019. The team traded a draft pick for Jimmy Vesey and during the season traded Scandella for a draft pick. Even with 24 teams making the expanded playoffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sabres finished with a 30\u201331\u20138 record and missed the postseason for the ninth consecutive season.\nOn June 16, 2020, despite Kim Pegula's vote of confidence three weeks prior, Botterill was fired and replaced by Kevyn Adams.\nOn March 17, 2021, in the midst on a twelve-game losing streak, head coach Ralph Krueger was fired. Don Granato was named interim head coach. After continuing to lose games, on March 29, 2021, the Sabres tied the Pittsburgh Penguins' all-time NHL losing streak of 18 games from the 2003\u201304 season after blowing a 3\u20130 lead in the third period against the Philadelphia Flyers and subsequently losing in overtime; it is the longest losing streak since the shootout was introduced. Granato was named the full-time head coach at the end of the season.\nWith their last-place finish in the 2020\u201321 season, they won the draft lottery and selected Owen Power with the first overall pick in the 2021 draft. Longtime play-by-play announcer Rick Jeanneret also announced the upcoming season would be his final one. Prior to the 2021\u201322 season, the Sabres traded away Sam Reinhart and Rasmus Ristolainen. During the season, the team traded away Jack Eichel for Peyton Krebs, Alex Tuch and two draft picks. Leading to the trade, Eichel had suffered a herniated disc and sought an independent specialist who recommended an artificial total disc. Eichel's lawyers also told the Sabres organization that the surgery would be required or he wouldn't be able to play the following season. However, the Sabres organization placed him on injured reserve and stripped him of the captaincy prior to the season. The Vegas Golden Knights funded his surgery following the trade, winning the Stanley Cup with Eichel in 2023. The team ended up missing for the 11th consecutive season, setting the record for consecutive missed playoff seasons.\nThe Sabres improved in the 2022\u201323 season, going 42\u201333\u20137 and finishing above .500 for the first time since 2011 and only finishing one point below the playoff line. With the Sacramento Kings clinching a spot in the 2023 NBA playoffs, it left both the New York Jets and Sabres as the teams among the major professional leagues with the longest active postseason drought with twelve seasons.\nOn August 17, 2023, Rick Jeanneret died. The Sabres honored his legacy by renaming Perry Street, the street adjacent to KeyBank Center, to \"RJ Way\" on October 13. The team regressed slightly in the 2023\u201324 season. They ended up trading captain Kyle Okposo to the Florida Panthers\u2014he would end up winning the Stanley Cup with Florida. On April 9, they were eliminated from postseason potential with a loss to the Dallas Stars. On April 16, 2024, one day after playing the final game of the season, head coach Granato was fired, marking his ousting as the seventh coach the Sabres have employed since the playoff drought began. One week later, on April 22, former coach Lindy Ruff was named as the new head coach, returning for a second tenure.\nIn the 2024\u201325 season, after beginning the season 11\u20139\u20131, the Sabres went on a 13-game losing streak. During the streak, owner Terry Pegula visited the team while they were in Montreal to express his support in the team and leadership. On April 8, 2025, the team was eliminated from postseason potential for the 14th time. Shortly after the end of that season, the government of Erie County announced plans to end its 30-year operational lease of KeyBank Center when it expires in September 2026, ostensibly placing the arena into the responsibility of the city of Buffalo, who indicated an inability to pay for the maintenance of said arena. In a statement to the press, Sabres chief operating officer Pete Guelli insisted that the team did not intend to relocate. On July 30, the Sabres and KeyBank announced a new arena naming rights contract that will keep the team in the arena through the 2035\u201336 season.\nTeam information.\nLogo and uniforms.\nThe Sabres have had, for the most part, used a primary logo featuring a bison atop two crossed sabres in a blue circle with gold trim. This logo was first used from 1970 to 1996 and was restored in 2020 after the Sabres 50th anniversary season was complete.\nThroughout their 26-year tenure at the Buffalo Auditorium, the Sabres have worn white uniforms with a blue and gold shoulder yoke and alternating gold, white and blue stripes. On the road they wore blue uniforms with gold stripes. In 1978 the primary logo was added on the shoulders.\nUpon moving to what is now KeyBank Center (formerly Marine Midland and HSBC Arena, later First Niagara Center) in 1996, the Sabres changed their logo and colors. Red, black and silver replaced blue and gold while the primary \"bison head\" logo was unveiled as the primary logo. Black road (later home) and white home (later road) uniforms were also released featuring a bull's head silhouette design in front and the \"Sabre B\" alternate logo on the shoulders.\nThe first third jersey of the Buffalo Sabres was created in 2000. The primary color was Sabre red, with black and silver stripes on the sleeves. It also featured the word \"Buffalo\" written on a black stripe outlined by silver near the waist. The logo was a black circle with two sabres crossing each other (a nod to the original logo).\nOn October 7, 2001, the Sabres wore a modified version of their white jerseys in a road game against the New York Rangers. The uniform replaced the \"bison head\" with the \"NEW YORK\" diagonal wordmark as a tribute to the state of New York in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\nOn September 16, 2006, the Sabres unveiled new home and away jerseys featuring midnight blue, maize (gold), silver and white colors. Front chest numbers were also added. The new logo, a stylized bison, was widely reviled, drawing unfavorable comparisons to a banana slug (hence the nickname \"Buffaslug\"). Despite the criticism, five of the top ten player jerseys sold in the first two months of the 2006\u201307 season were Sabres \"slug\" designs. Nevertheless, the Sabres brought back the classic blue jerseys as a third jersey, but continued to pair the look with the navy helmet and pants. When the Reebok Edge template was unveiled in 2007, the Sabres kept their \"Buffaslug\" uniforms, but the following season, they released a new third jersey featuring the classic look depicted in the navy, gold, silver and white colors. The Sabres also wore the original white uniforms during the 2008 Winter Classic.\nThe third jersey eventually became the primary home jersey on September 18, 2010, when the Sabres released a modern version of the classic 1970\u20131996 logo. A corresponding road white jersey was also released, along with a third jersey featuring an alternate throwback arrangement that pays homage to the AHL's Buffalo Bisons, complete with the team's 40th Anniversary insignia (essentially the original royal blue version of the current logo with the year \"1970\" inside).\nIn 2013, the Sabres released a new third jersey, featuring a gold front and navy back design. The uniform only lasted two seasons, after which it was retired.\nThe Sabres kept their uniforms largely intact when Adidas took over as its supplier, save for the removal of silver sections in the armpits. They were also the only remaining NHL team to sport uniform numbers in front; teams such as the Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks briefly added numbers in front of their uniforms before removing them altogether.\nDuring the 2018 Winter Classic, the Sabres broke out white uniforms with the classic blue and gold shade, albeit with a different striping scheme from the original uniforms.\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the final season of the navy and gold look, as the Sabres announced the return to royal blue uniforms for the following season. Also, a 50th-anniversary white third jersey was used, featuring metallic gold elements on the logo and stripes.\nOn August 11, 2020, the Sabres unveiled the uniforms for the upcoming season. The style is similar to the ones worn in the early days of the franchise. Jersey numbers are no longer displayed on the front. The Sabres also released a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform, bringing back the \"crossed swords\" alternate from 2000 to 2006 but recolored to the current royal, gold and white scheme.\nFor the 2022 Heritage Classic, the Sabres again wore a variation of their classic uniforms, but without the blue shoulder yoke and with a cream base.\nOn August 31, 2022, the Sabres announced that their black uniform used from 1995 to 2006 would become their new third jersey. This same uniform also became the basis of their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, but recolored to the white, blue and gold scheme and featured white pants.\nBroadcasters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNational anthems.\nThe Canadian and U.S. national anthems are sung before every Sabres home game, regardless if the visiting team is Canadian or American, because Buffalo is adjacent to the Canadian border and many spectators come from Canada. Doug Allen sang the Canadian and US national anthems at most home games (except in cases where there is a conflict with his charitable work for the Wesleyan Church) until resigning in 2021 because of his refusal to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Curtis Cook is the arena's in-game organist. During Tom Golisano's ownership, the team occasionally used the services of singer Ronan Tynan who sang \"God Bless America\" while Allen performed the Canadian anthem (in such cases, the U.S. anthem was not performed).\nIn-game hosting.\nRich Gaenzler, morning host at WGRF, took over as in-game host beginning in 2018 before he was fired in 2021 over an unrelated dispute pertaining to his WGRF show, which was canceled at the same time. WBFO personality Jay Moran is the current public address announcer; he succeeded Milt Ellis in the position.\nIn November 2021, the Sabres added an official team dog, named Rick, a Newfoundland puppy trained as a service animal. Rick was graduated to daily service and succeeded by Nikki, a golden retriever puppy.\nMinor league affiliates.\nThe Sabres are presently affiliated with two minor league teams, the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League, and the Jacksonville Icemen of the ECHL. The Americans play at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York. Founded in 1956, the Americans were previously the Sabres AHL affiliate from the 1979\u201380 season to the 2007\u201308 season. During the original Sabres affiliation, the Americans won three Calder Cup championships and finished as runners-up another six times. They finished out of the playoffs only five times in 28 years. The Sabres became re-affiliated with the Americans starting with the 2011\u201312 season when after buying the Sabres, Pegula purchased the Americans from former owner Curt Styres.\nThe Jacksonville Icemen are based in Jacksonville, Florida and have been the Sabres ECHL affiliate since the 2023\u201324 season. Unlike the Americans, the Icemen are not owned by Pegula but are instead owned by SZH Hockey LLC.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Sabres.

{"id": "69919", "revid": "8926256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69919", "title": "In Search of Lost Time", "text": "1913\u20131927 novel in seven volumes by Marcel Proust\nIn Search of Lost Time (), first translated into English as Remembrance of Things Past, and sometimes referred to in French as La Recherche (\"The Search\"), is a novel in seven volumes by French author Marcel Proust. This early twentieth-century work is his most prominent, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory.\nThe novel gained fame in English through translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin and was known in the Anglosphere as \"Remembrance of Things Past\". The title \"In Search of Lost Time\", a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.\n\"In Search of Lost Time\" follows the narrator's recollections of childhood and experiences into adulthood in late 19th-century and early 20th-century high-society France. Proust began to shape the novel in 1909; he continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished, he continued to add new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the time of Proust's death. His brother Robert oversaw editing and publication of these parts.\nThe work was published in France between 1913 and 1927. Proust paid to publish the first volume (with \u00c9ditions Grasset) after it had been turned down by leading editors who had been offered the manuscript in longhand. Many of its ideas, motifs and scenes were anticipated in Proust's unfinished novel, \"Jean Santeuil\" (1896\u20131899), though the perspective and treatment there are different, and in his unfinished hybrid of philosophical essay and story, \"Contre Sainte-Beuve\" (1908\u201309).\nThe novel had great influence on twentieth-century literature; some writers have sought to emulate it, others to parody it. For the centenary of the French publication of the novel's first volume, American author Edmund White pronounced \"In Search of Lost Time\" \"the most respected novel of the twentieth century\".\nIt holds the Guinness World Record for longest novel.\nInitial publication.\nThe novel was initially published in seven volumes:\nSynopsis.\nThe novel recounts the experiences of the Narrator (who is never definitively named) while he is growing up, learning about art, participating in society, and falling in love.\nAn approximate timeline of the novel was deduced by literary theorist G\u00e9rard Genette in his 1980 book, \"Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method.\"\nVolume One: \"Swann's Way\".\nThe Narrator begins by noting, \"For a long time, I went to bed early.\" He comments on the way in which sleep seems to alter one's surroundings, and the way habit makes one indifferent to them. He remembers being in his room in the family's country home in Combray, while downstairs his parents entertain their friend Charles Swann, an elegant man of Jewish origin with strong ties to society. Due to Swann's visit, the Narrator is deprived of his mother's goodnight kiss, but he gets her to spend the night reading to him. This memory is the only one he has of Combray until years later the taste of a madeleine cake dipped in tea inspires a nostalgic incident of involuntary memory. He remembers having a similar snack as a child with his invalid aunt L\u00e9onie, and it leads to more memories of Combray. He describes their servant Fran\u00e7oise, who is uneducated but possesses an earthy wisdom and a strong sense of both duty and tradition. He meets an elegant \"lady in pink\" while visiting his uncle Adolphe. He develops a love of the theater, especially the actress la Berma, and his awkward Jewish friend Bloch introduces him to the works of the writer Bergotte. He learns Swann made an unsuitable marriage but has social ambitions for his beautiful daughter Gilberte. Legrandin, a snobbish friend of the family, tries to avoid introducing the boy to his well-to-do sister. The Narrator describes two routes for country walks the child and his parents often enjoyed: the way past Swann's home (the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way), and the Guermantes way, both containing scenes of natural beauty. Taking the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, he sees Gilberte Swann standing in her yard with a lady in white, Mme. Swann, and her supposed lover: Baron de Charlus, a friend of Swann's. Gilberte makes a gesture that the Narrator interprets as a rude dismissal. During another walk, he spies a lesbian scene involving Mlle. Vinteuil, daughter of a composer, and her friend. The Guermantes way is symbolic of the Guermantes family, the nobility of the area. The Narrator is awed by the magic of their name and is captivated when he first sees Mme. de Guermantes. He discovers how appearances conceal the true nature of things and tries writing a description of some nearby steeples. Lying in bed, he seems transported back to these places until he awakens.\nMme. Verdurin is a very rich and autocratic hostess who, aided by her husband, demands total obedience from the guests in her \"little clan\". One guest is Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, a former courtesan, who has met Swann and invites him to the group. Swann is too refined for such company, but Odette gradually intrigues him with her unusual style. A sonata by Vinteuil, which features a \"little phrase\", becomes the motif for their deepening relationship. The Verdurins host M. de Forcheville; their guests include Cottard, a doctor; Brichot, an academic; Saniette, the object of scorn; and a painter, M. Biche. Swann grows jealous of Odette, who now keeps him at arm's length, and suspects an affair between her and Forcheville, aided by the Verdurins. Swann seeks respite by attending a society concert that includes Legrandin's sister and a young Mme. de Guermantes; the \"little phrase\" is played and Swann realizes Odette's love for him is gone. He tortures himself wondering about her true relationships with others, but his love for her, despite renewals, gradually diminishes. He moves on and marvels that he ever loved a woman who was not his type.\nAt home in Paris, the Narrator dreams of visiting Venice or the church in Balbec, a resort, but he is too unwell and instead takes walks in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. There he meets and befriends Gilberte. He holds her father, now married to Odette, in the highest esteem, and is awed by the beautiful sight of Mme. Swann strolling in public. Years later, the old sights of the area are long gone, and he laments the fleeting nature of places.\nVolume Two: \"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\".\nThe Narrator's parents invite M. de Norpois, a diplomat colleague of the Narrator's father, to dinner. With Norpois's intervention, the Narrator is finally allowed to go and see the Berma perform in a play, but is disappointed by her acting. Afterwards, at dinner, he watches Norpois, who is extremely diplomatic and correct at all times, expound on society and art. The Narrator gives him a draft of his writing, but Norpois gently indicates it is not good. The Narrator continues to go to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and play with Gilberte. Her parents distrust him, so he writes to them in protest. He and Gilberte wrestle and he has an orgasm. Gilberte invites him to tea, and he becomes a regular at her house. He observes Mme. Swann's inferior social status, Swann's lowered standards and indifference towards his wife, and Gilberte's affection for her father. The Narrator contemplates how he has attained his wish to know the Swanns, and savors their unique style. At one of their parties he meets and befriends Bergotte, who gives his impressions of society figures and artists. But the Narrator is still unable to start writing seriously. His friend Bloch takes him to a brothel, where there is a Jewish prostitute named Rachel. He showers Mme. Swann with flowers, being almost on better terms with her than with Gilberte. One day, he and Gilberte quarrel and he decides never to see her again. However, he continues to visit Mme. Swann, who has become a popular hostess, with her guests including Mme. Bontemps, who has a niece named Albertine. The Narrator hopes for a letter from Gilberte repairing their friendship, but gradually feels himself losing interest. He breaks down and plans to reconcile with her, but spies from afar someone resembling her walking with a boy and gives her up for good. He stops visiting her mother also, who is now a celebrated beauty admired by passersby, and years later he can recall the glamour she displayed then.\nTwo years later, the Narrator, his grandmother, and Fran\u00e7oise set out for the seaside town of Balbec. The Narrator is almost totally indifferent to Gilberte now. During the train ride, his grandmother, who only believes in proper books, lends him her favorite: the \"Letters\" of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. At Balbec, the Narrator is disappointed with the church and uncomfortable in his unfamiliar hotel room, but his grandmother comforts him. He admires the seascape, and learns about the colorful staff and customers around the hotel: Aim\u00e9, the discreet headwaiter; the lift operator; M. de Stermaria and his beautiful young daughter; and M. de Cambremer and his wife, Legrandin's sister. His grandmother encounters an old friend, the blue-blooded Mme. de Villeparisis, and they renew their friendship. The three of them go for rides in the country, openly discussing art and politics. The Narrator longs for the country girls he sees alongside the roads, and has a strange feeling\u2014possibly memory, possibly something else\u2014while admiring a row of three trees. Mme. de Villeparisis is joined by her glamorous great-nephew Robert de Saint-Loup, who is involved with an unsuitable woman. Despite initial awkwardness, the Narrator and his grandmother become good friends with him. Bloch, the childhood friend from Combray, turns up with his family, and acts in typically inappropriate fashion. Saint-Loup's ultra-aristocratic and extremely rude uncle the Baron de Charlus arrives. The Narrator discovers Mme. de Villeparisis, her nephew M. de Charlus, and his nephew Saint-Loup are all of the Guermantes family. Charlus ignores the Narrator, but later visits him in his room and lends him a book. The next day, the Baron speaks shockingly informally to him, then demands the book back. The Narrator ponders Saint-Loup's attitude towards his aristocratic roots, and his relationship with his mistress, a mere actress whose recital bombed horribly with his family. One day, the Narrator sees a \"little band\" of teenage girls strolling beside the sea, and becomes infatuated with them, along with an unseen hotel guest named Mlle. Simonet. He joins Saint-Loup for dinner and reflects on how drunkenness affects his perceptions. Later they meet the painter Elstir, and the Narrator visits his studio. The Narrator marvels at Elstir's method of renewing impressions of ordinary things, as well as his connections with the Verdurins (he is \"M. Biche\") and Mme. Swann. He discovers the painter knows the teenage girls, particularly one dark-haired beauty who is Albertine Simonet. Elstir arranges an introduction, and the Narrator becomes friends with her, as well as her friends Andr\u00e9e, Rosemonde, and Gis\u00e8le. The group goes for picnics and tours the countryside, as well as playing games, while the Narrator reflects on the nature of love as he becomes attracted to Albertine. Despite her rejection, they become close, although he still feels attracted to the whole group. At summer's end, the town closes up, and the Narrator is left with his image of first seeing the girls walking beside the sea.\nVolume Three: \"The Guermantes Way\".\nThe Narrator's family has moved to an apartment connected with the Guermantes residence. Fran\u00e7oise befriends a fellow tenant, the tailor Jupien and his niece. The Narrator is fascinated by the Guermantes and their life, and is awed by their social circle while attending another Berma performance. He begins staking out the street where Mme. de Guermantes walks every day, to her evident annoyance. He decides to visit her nephew Saint-Loup at his military base, to ask to be introduced to her. After noting the landscape and his state of mind while sleeping, the Narrator meets and attends dinners with Saint-Loup's fellow officers, where they discuss the Dreyfus Affair and the art of military strategy. But the Narrator returns home after receiving a call from his aging grandmother. Mme. de Guermantes declines to see him, and he also finds he is still unable to begin writing. Saint-Loup visits on leave, and they have lunch and attend a recital with his actress mistress: Rachel, the Jewish prostitute, toward whom the unsuspecting Saint-Loup is crazed with jealousy. The Narrator then goes to Mme. de Villeparisis's salon, which is considered second-rate despite its public reputation. Legrandin attends and displays his social climbing. Bloch stridently interrogates M. de Norpois about the Dreyfus Affair, which has ripped all of society asunder, but Norpois diplomatically avoids answering. The Narrator observes Mme. de Guermantes and her aristocratic bearing, as she makes caustic remarks about friends and family, including the mistresses of her husband, who is M. de Charlus's brother. Mme. Swann arrives, and the Narrator remembers a visit from Morel, the son of his uncle Adolphe's valet, who revealed that the \"lady in pink\" was Mme. Swann. Charlus asks the Narrator to leave with him, and offers to make him his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. At home, the Narrator's grandmother has worsened, and while walking with him she suffers a stroke.\nThe family seeks out the best medical help, and she is often visited by Bergotte, himself unwell, but she dies, her face reverting to its youthful appearance. Several months later, Saint-Loup, now single, convinces the Narrator to ask out the Stermaria daughter, newly divorced. Albertine visits; she has matured and they share a kiss. The Narrator then goes to see Mme. de Villeparisis, where Mme. de Guermantes, whom he has stopped following, invites him to dinner. The Narrator daydreams of Mme. de Stermaria, but she abruptly cancels, although Saint-Loup rescues him from despair by taking him to dine with his aristocratic friends, who engage in petty gossip. Saint-Loup passes on an invitation from Charlus to come visit him. The next day, at the Guermantes's dinner party, the Narrator admires their Elstir paintings, then meets the cream of society, including the Princess of Parma, who is an amiable simpleton. He learns more about the Guermantes: their hereditary features; their less-refined cousins the Courvoisiers; and Mme. de Guermantes's celebrated humor, artistic tastes, and exalted diction (although she does not live up to the enchantment of her name). The discussion turns to gossip about society, including Charlus and his late wife; the affair between Norpois and Mme. de Villeparisis; and aristocratic lineages. Leaving, the Narrator visits Charlus, who falsely accuses him of slandering him. The Narrator stomps on Charlus's hat and storms out, but Charlus is strangely unperturbed and gives him a ride home. Months later, the Narrator is invited to the Princesse de Guermantes's party. He tries to verify the invitation with M. and Mme. de Guermantes, but first sees something he will describe later. They will be attending the party but do not help him, and while they are chatting, Swann arrives. Now a committed Dreyfusard, he is very sick and nearing death, but the Guermantes assure him he will outlive them.\nVolume Four: \"Sodom and Gomorrah\".\nThe Narrator describes what he had seen earlier: while waiting for the Guermantes to return so he could ask about his invitation, he saw Charlus encounter Jupien in their courtyard. The two then went into Jupien's shop and had intercourse. The Narrator reflects on the nature of \"inverts\", and how they are like a secret society, never able to live in the open. He compares them to flowers, whose reproduction through the aid of insects depends solely on happenstance. Arriving at the Princesse's party, his invitation seems valid as he is greeted warmly by her. He sees Charlus exchanging knowing looks with the diplomat Vaugoubert, a fellow invert. After several tries, the Narrator manages to be introduced to the Prince de Guermantes, who then walks off with Swann, causing speculation on the topic of their conversation. Mme. de Saint-Euverte tries to recruit guests for her party the next day, but is subjected to scorn from some of the Guermantes. Charlus is captivated by the two young sons of M. de Guermantes's newest mistress. Saint-Loup arrives and mentions the names of several promiscuous women to the Narrator. Swann takes the Narrator aside and reveals the Prince wanted to admit his and his wife's pro-Dreyfus leanings. Swann is aware of his old friend Charlus's behavior, then urges the Narrator to visit Gilberte, and departs. The Narrator leaves with M. and Mme. de Guermantes, and heads home for a late-night meeting with Albertine. He grows frantic when first she is late and then calls to cancel, but he convinces her to come. He writes an indifferent letter to Gilberte, and reviews the changing social scene, which now includes Mme. Swann's salon centered on Bergotte.\nHe decides to return to Balbec, after learning the women mentioned by Saint-Loup will be there. At Balbec, grief at his grandmother's suffering, which was worse than he knew, overwhelms him. He ponders the intermittencies of the heart and the ways of dealing with sad memories. His mother, even sadder, has become more like his grandmother in homage. Albertine is nearby and they begin spending time together, but he starts to suspect her of lesbianism and of lying to him about her activities. He fakes a preference for her friend Andr\u00e9e to make her become more trustworthy, and it works, but he soon suspects her of knowing several scandalous women at the hotel, including L\u00e9a, an actress. On the way to visit Saint-Loup, they meet Morel, the valet's son who is now an excellent violinist, and then the aging Charlus, who falsely claims to know Morel and goes to speak to him. The Narrator visits the Verdurins, who are renting a house from the Cambremers. On the train with him is the little clan: Brichot, who explains at length the derivation of the local place-names; Cottard, now a celebrated doctor; Saniette, still the butt of everyone's ridicule; and a new member, Ski. The Verdurins are still haughty and dictatorial toward their guests, who are as pedantic as ever. Charlus and Morel arrive together, and Charlus's true nature is barely concealed. The Cambremers arrive, and the Verdurins barely tolerate them.\nBack at the hotel, the Narrator ruminates on sleep and time, and observes the amusing mannerisms of the staff, who are mostly aware of Charlus's proclivities. The Narrator and Albertine hire a chauffeur and take rides in the country, leading to observations about new forms of travel as well as country life. The Narrator is unaware that the chauffeur and Morel are acquainted, and he reviews Morel's amoral character and plans towards Jupien's niece. The Narrator is jealously suspicious of Albertine but grows tired of her. She and the Narrator attend evening dinners at the Verdurins, taking the train with the other guests; Charlus is now a regular, despite his obliviousness to the clan's mockery. He and Morel try to maintain the secret of their relationship, and the Narrator recounts a ploy involving a fake duel that Charlus used to control Morel. The passing station stops remind the Narrator of various people and incidents, including two failed attempts by the Prince de Guermantes to arrange liaisons with Morel; a final break between the Verdurins and Cambremers; and a misunderstanding between the Narrator, Charlus, and Bloch. The Narrator has grown weary of the area and prefers others over Albertine, but she reveals to him as they leave the train that she has plans with Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend (the lesbians from Combray), which plunges him into despair. He invents a story about a broken engagement of his, to convince her to go to Paris with him, and after hesitating she suddenly agrees to go immediately. The Narrator tells his mother: he must marry Albertine.\nVolume Five: \"The Prisoner\".\nThe Narrator is living with Albertine in his family's apartment, to Fran\u00e7oise's distrust and his absent mother's chagrin. He marvels that he has come to possess her, but has grown bored with her. He mostly stays home, but has enlisted Andr\u00e9e to report on Albertine's whereabouts, as his jealousy remains. The Narrator gets advice on fashion from Mme. de Guermantes, and encounters Charlus and Morel visiting Jupien and his niece, who is being married off to Morel despite his cruelty towards her. One day, the Narrator returns from the Guermantes and finds Andr\u00e9e just leaving, claiming to dislike the smell of their flowers. Albertine, who is more guarded to avoid provoking his jealousy, is maturing into an intelligent and elegant young lady. The Narrator is entranced by her beauty as she sleeps, and is only content when she is not out with others. She mentions wanting to go to the Verdurins, but the Narrator suspects an ulterior motive and analyzes her conversation for hints. He suggests she go instead to the Trocad\u00e9ro with Andr\u00e9e, and she reluctantly agrees. The Narrator compares dreams to wakefulness, and listens to the street vendors with Albertine, then she departs. He remembers trips she took with the chauffeur, then learns L\u00e9a the notorious actress will be at the Trocadero too. He sends Fran\u00e7oise to retrieve Albertine, and while waiting, he muses on music and Morel. When she returns, they go for a drive, while he pines for Venice and realizes she feels captive. He learns of Bergotte's final illness. That evening, he sneaks off to the Verdurins to try to discover the reason for Albertine's interest in them. He encounters Brichot on the way, and they discuss Swann, who has died. Charlus arrives and the Narrator reviews the Baron's struggles with Morel, then learns Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend are expected (although they do not come). Morel joins in performing a septet by Vinteuil, which evokes commonalities with his sonata that only the composer could create. Mme. Verdurin is furious that Charlus has taken control of her party; in revenge the Verdurins persuade Morel to repudiate him, and Charlus falls temporarily ill from the shock. Returning home, the Narrator and Albertine fight about his solo visit to the Verdurins, and she denies having affairs with L\u00e9a or Mlle. Vinteuil, but admits she lied on occasion to avoid arguments. He threatens to break it off, but they reconcile. He appreciates art and fashion with her, and ponders her mysteriousness. But his suspicion of her and Andr\u00e9e is renewed, and they quarrel. After two awkward days and a restless night, he resolves to end the affair, but in the morning Fran\u00e7oise informs him: Albertine has asked for her boxes and left.\nVolume Six: \"The Fugitive\".\nThe Narrator is anguished at Albertine's departure and absence. He dispatches Saint-Loup to convince her aunt Mme. Bontemps to send her back, but Albertine insists the Narrator should ask, and she will gladly return. The Narrator lies and replies he is done with her, but she just agrees with him. He writes to her that he will marry Andr\u00e9e, then hears from Saint-Loup of the failure of his mission to the aunt. Desperate, he begs Albertine to return, but receives word: she has died in a riding accident. He receives two last letters from her: one wishing him and Andr\u00e9e well, and one asking if she can return. The Narrator plunges into suffering amid the many different memories of Albertine, intimately linked to all of his everyday sensations. He recalls a suspicious incident she told him of at Balbec, and asks Aim\u00e9, the headwaiter, to investigate. He recalls their history together and his regrets, as well as love's randomness. Aim\u00e9 reports back: Albertine often engaged in affairs with girls at Balbec. The Narrator sends him to learn more, and he reports other liaisons with girls. The Narrator wishes he could have known the true Albertine, whom he would have accepted. He begins to grow accustomed to the idea of her death, despite constant reminders that renew his grief. Andr\u00e9e admits her own lesbianism but denies being with Albertine. The Narrator knows he will forget Albertine, just as he has forgotten Gilberte.\nHe happens to meet Gilberte again; her mother Mme. Swann became Mme. de Forcheville and Gilberte is now part of high society, received by the Guermantes. The Narrator publishes an article in \"Le Figaro\". Andr\u00e9e visits him and confesses her relations with Albertine. She also explains the truth behind Albertine's departure: her aunt wanted her to marry another man. The Narrator and his mother visit Venice, which enthralls him. They happen to see Norpois and Mme. de Villeparisis there. A telegram signed from Albertine arrives, but the Narrator is indifferent. Returning home, the Narrator and his mother receive surprising news: Gilberte will marry Saint-Loup, and Jupien's niece will be adopted by Charlus and then married to Legrandin's nephew, an invert. There is much discussion of these marriages among society. The Narrator visits Gilberte in her new home where he also realizes that the telegram was from her, not Albertine, who is not alive, and is shocked to learn of Saint-Loup's affair with Morel, among others. He despairs for their friendship.\nVolume Seven: \"Time Regained\".\nThe Narrator is staying with Gilberte at her home near Combray. They go for walks, on one of which he is stunned to learn the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way and the Guermantes way are actually linked. Gilberte also tells him she was attracted to him when young, and had made a suggestive gesture to him as he watched her. Also, it was L\u00e9a she was walking with the evening he had planned to reconcile with her. He considers Saint-Loup's nature and reads an account of the Verdurins' salon, deciding he has no talent for writing.\nThe scene shifts to a night in 1916, during World War I, when the Narrator has returned to Paris from a stay in a sanatorium and is walking the streets during a blackout. He reflects on the changed norms of art and society, with the Verdurins now highly esteemed. He recounts a 1914 visit from Saint-Loup, who was trying to enlist secretly. He recalls descriptions of the fighting he subsequently received from Saint-Loup and Gilberte, whose home was threatened. He describes a call paid on him a few days previously by Saint-Loup; they discussed military strategy. Now on the dark street, the Narrator encounters Charlus, who has completely surrendered to his impulses. Charlus reviews Morel's betrayals and his own temptation to seek vengeance; critiques Brichot's new fame as a writer, which has ostracized him from the Verdurins; and admits his general sympathy with Germany. The last part of the conversation draws a crowd of suspicious onlookers. After parting the Narrator seeks refuge in what appears to be a hotel, where he sees someone who looks familiar leaving. Inside, he discovers it to be a male brothel, and spies Charlus using the services. The proprietor turns out to be Jupien, who expresses a perverse pride in his business. A few days later, news comes that Saint-Loup has been killed in combat. The Narrator pieces together that Saint-Loup had visited Jupien's brothel, and ponders what might have been had he lived.\nYears later, again in Paris, the Narrator goes to a party at the house of the Prince de Guermantes. On the way he sees Charlus, now a mere shell of his former self, being helped by Jupien. The paving stones at the Guermantes house inspire another incident of involuntary memory for the Narrator, quickly followed by two more. Inside, while waiting in the library, he discerns their meaning: by putting him in contact with both the past and present, the impressions allow him to gain a vantage point outside time, affording a glimpse of the true nature of things. He realizes his whole life has prepared him for the mission of describing events as fully revealed, and (finally) resolves to begin writing. Entering the party, he is shocked at the disguises old age has given to the people he knew, and at the changes in society. Legrandin is now an invert, but is no longer a snob. Bloch is a respected writer and vital figure in society. Morel has reformed and become a respected citizen. Mme. de Forcheville is the mistress of M. de Guermantes. Mme. Verdurin has married the Prince de Guermantes after both their spouses died. Rachel is the star of the party, abetted by Mme. de Guermantes, whose social position has been eroded by her affinity for theater. Gilberte introduces her daughter to the Narrator; he is struck by the way the daughter encapsulates both the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes ways within herself. He is spurred to writing, with help from Fran\u00e7oise and despite signs of approaching death. He realizes that every person carries within them the accumulated baggage of their past, and concludes that to be accurate he must describe how everyone occupies an immense range \"in Time\".\nThemes.\n\"\u00c0 la recherche\" made a decisive break with the 19th-century realist and plot-driven novel, populated by people of action and people representing social and cultural groups or morals. Although parts of the novel could be read as an exploration of snobbery, deceit, jealousy and suffering, and although it contains a multitude of realistic details, the focus is not on the development of a tight plot or of a coherent evolution but on a multiplicity of perspectives and on the formation of experience. The protagonists of the first volume (the narrator as a boy and Swann) are, by the standards of 19th-century novels, remarkably introspective and passive, nor do they trigger action from other leading characters; to contemporary readers, reared on Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Victor Hugo and Leo Tolstoy, they would not function as centers of a plot. While there is an array of symbolism in the work, it is rarely defined through explicit \"keys\" leading to moral, romantic or philosophical ideas. The significance of what is happening is often placed within the memory or into the inner contemplation of what is described. This focus on the relationship between experience, memory and writing, and the radical de-emphasizing of the outward plot have become staples of the modern novel but were almost unheard of in 1913.\nRoger Shattuck elucidates an underlying principle in understanding Proust and the various themes present in his novel:\nThus the novel embodies and manifests the principle of intermittence: to live means to perceive different and often conflicting aspects of reality. This iridescence never resolves itself completely into a unitive point of view. Accordingly, it is possible to project out of the \"Search\" itself a series of putative and intermittent authors\u00a0... The portraitist of an expiring society, the artist of romantic reminiscence, the narrator of the laminated \"I,\" the classicist of formal structure\u2014all these figures are to be found in Proust\u00a0...\nMemory.\nThe role of memory is central to the novel, introduced with the famous madeleine episode in the first section of the novel and in the last volume, \"Time Regained\", a flashback similar to that caused by the madeleine is the beginning of the resolution of the story. Throughout the work many similar instances of involuntary memory, triggered by sensory experiences such as sights, sounds and smells conjure important memories for the narrator and sometimes return attention to an earlier episode of the novel. Although Proust wrote contemporaneously with Sigmund Freud, with there being many points of similarity between their thought on the structures and mechanisms of the human mind, neither author read the other.\nThe madeleine episode reads:\nNo sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory\u2014this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me it was me. ... Whence did it come? What did it mean? How could I seize and apprehend it? ... And suddenly the memory revealed itself. The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt L\u00e9onie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it. And all from my cup of tea.\nGilles Deleuze believed that the focus of Proust was not memory and the past but the narrator's learning the use of \"signs\" to understand and communicate ultimate reality, thereby becoming an artist. While Proust was bitterly aware of the experience of loss and exclusion\u2014loss of loved ones, loss of affection, friendship and innocent joy, which are dramatized in the novel through recurrent jealousy, betrayal and the death of loved ones\u2014his response to this, formulated after he had discovered Ruskin, was that the work of art can recapture the lost and thus save it from destruction, at least in our minds. Art triumphs over the destructive power of time. This element of his artistic thought is clearly inherited from romantic platonism, but Proust combines it with a new intensity in describing jealousy, desire and self-doubt.\nSeparation anxiety.\nProust begins his novel with the statement, \"For a long time I used to go to bed early.\" This leads to lengthy discussion of his anxiety at leaving his mother at night and his attempts to force her to come and kiss him goodnight, even on nights when the family has company, culminating in a spectacular success, when his father suggests that his mother stay the night with him after he has waylaid her in the hall when she is going to bed.\nHis anxiety leads to manipulation, much like the manipulation employed by his invalid aunt L\u00e9onie and all the lovers in the entire book, who use the same methods of petty tyranny to manipulate and possess their loved ones.\nNature of art.\nThe nature of art is a motif in the novel and is often explored at great length. Proust sets forth a theory of art in which we are all capable of producing art, if by this we mean taking the experiences of life and transforming them in a way that shows understanding and maturity. Writing, painting, and music are also discussed at great length. Morel the violinist is examined to give an example of a certain type of \"artistic\" character, along with other fictional artists like the novelist Bergotte, the composer Vinteuil, and the painter Elstir.\nAs early as the \"Combray\" section of \"Swann's Way\", the narrator is concerned with his ability to write, since he desires to pursue a writing career. The transmutation of the experience of a scene in one of the family's usual walks into a short descriptive passage is described and the sample passage given. The narrator presents this passage as an early sample of his own writing, in which he has only had to alter a few words. The question of his own genius relates to all the passages in which genius is recognized or misunderstood because it presents itself in the guise of a humble friend, rather than a passionate \"artiste\".\nThe question of taste or judgement in art is also an important theme, as exemplified by Swann's exquisite taste in art, which is often hidden from his friends who do not share it or subordinated to his love interests.\nHomosexuality.\nQuestions pertaining to homosexuality appear throughout the novel, particularly in the later volumes. The first arrival of this theme comes in the \"Combray\" section of \"Swann's Way\", where the daughter of the piano teacher and composer Vinteuil is seduced, and the narrator observes her having lesbian relations in front of the portrait of her recently deceased father.\nThe narrator invariably suspects his lovers of liaisons with other women, a repetition of the suspicions held by Charles Swann about his mistress and eventual wife, Odette, in \"Swann's Way\". The first chapter of \"Cities of the Plain\" (\"Sodom and Gomorrah\") includes a detailed account of a sexual encounter between M. de Charlus, the novel's most prominent male homosexual, and his tailor. Critics have often observed that while the character of the narrator is ostensibly heterosexual, Proust intimates that the narrator is a closeted homosexual. The narrator's manner towards male homosexuality is consistently aloof, yet the narrator is unaccountably knowledgeable. This strategy enables Proust to pursue themes related to male homosexuality\u2014in particular the nature of closetedness\u2014from both within and without a homosexual perspective. Proust does not designate Charlus's homosexuality until the middle of the novel, in \"Cities\"; afterwards the Baron's ostentatiousness and flamboyance, of which he is blithely unaware, completely absorb the narrator's perception. Lesbianism, on the other hand, tortures Swann and the narrator because it presents an inaccessible world. Whereas male homosexual desire is recognizable, insofar as it encompasses male sexuality, Odette's and Albertine's lesbian trysts represent Swann and the narrator's painful exclusion from characters they desire.\nThere is much debate as to how great a bearing Proust's sexuality has on understanding these aspects of the novel. Although many of Proust's close family and friends suspected that he was homosexual, Proust never admitted this. It was only after his death that Andr\u00e9 Gide, in his publication of correspondence with Proust, made public Proust's homosexuality. In response to Gide's criticism that he hid his actual sexuality within his novel, Proust told Gide that \"one can say anything so long as one does not say 'I'.\" Proust's intimate relations with such individuals as Alfred Agostinelli and Reynaldo Hahn are well-documented, though Proust was not \"out\", except perhaps in close-knit social circles.\nIn 1913, Proust's former regular taxi driver during his summer holidays in Cabourg, Alfred Agostinelli, suddenly reappeared at Proust's house in Paris, looking for work, and was hired as a secretary, as Proust already had a housekeeper-driver but needed support with his work. Agostinelli moved in with his fianc\u00e9e that May and typed the first volume of \"Lost Time\". Despite, or perhaps because of, the hopelessness, Proust fell in love with Agostinelli, with whom he had previously only had a brief, temporary affair. This is evident from the letters Proust wrote after Agostinelli \"fled\" to Nice to be with his family in the spring of 1914 (sometimes using the pseudonym \"Marcel Swann\" after his escape) and died shortly thereafter in a plane crash as a pioneer pilot. Proust's relationship with Agostinelli largely shaped the volumes \"The Prisoner\" and \"The Fugitive\", in which the novel's heroine, \"Albertine\", and her relationship with the first-person narrator \"Marcel\" are modeled after the author's relationship with his secretary.\nIn 1949, the critic Justin O'Brien published an article in the \"Publications of the Modern Language Association\" called \"Albertine the Ambiguous: Notes on Proust's Transposition of Sexes\", in which he proposed that some female characters are best understood as actually referring to young men. Strip off the feminine ending of the names of the Narrator's lovers, Albertine, Gilberte, and Andr\u00e9e, and one has their masculine counterparts. This theory has become known as the \"transposition of sexes theory\" in Proust criticism. The models for the novel's figures were later examined in more detail and it was found that they are not always transpositioned men, for example, Gilberte was modeled on three young women. Edmund White wrote: \"In the past gay writers adopted \"Proust's Albertine strategy\", pretending Albert was Albertine, which sometimes made them great observers of women to render the substitution credible. At the very least it made them good liars with good memories. Isn't fiction called \"lies like truth?\" It was a common strategy in the \"closet era\", however Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Elisabeth Ladenson point out that feminized forms of masculine names were and are commonplace in French.\nCritical reception.\n\"In Search of Lost Time\" is considered, by many scholars and critics, to be the definitive modern novel. It has had a profound effect on subsequent writers, such as the British authors who were members of the Bloomsbury Group. Virginia Woolf wrote in 1922: \"Oh if I could write like that!\" Edith Wharton wrote that \"Every reader enamoured of the art must brood in amazement over the way in which Proust maintains the balance between these two manners\u2014the broad and the minute. His endowment as a novelist\u2014his range of presentation combined with mastery of his instruments\u2014has probably never been surpassed.\" During Proust's lifetime, on the other hand, while he would achieve success, he would also face criticism from critics of his work. According to \"Cambridge University Press\", \"Proust's reception during his lifetime is always set against the backdrop of often-hostile criticism, frequently based on the myth of the sickly, reclusive snob writing from the safety of his cork-lined room.\"\nHarold Bloom wrote that \"In Search of Lost Time\" is now \"widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century\". Vladimir Nabokov, in a 1965 interview, named the greatest prose works of the 20th century as, in order, \"Joyce's \"Ulysses\", Kafka's \"Transformation\" [usually called \"The Metamorphosis\"], Bely's \"Petersburg\", and the first half of Proust's fairy tale \"In Search of Lost Time\"\". J. Peder Zane's book \"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books\", collates 125 \"top 10 greatest books of all time\" lists by prominent living writers; \"In Search of Lost Time\" is placed eighth. In the 1960s, Swedish literary critic Bengt Holmqvist described the novel as \"at once the last great classic of French epic prose tradition and the towering precursor of the 'nouveau roman'\", indicating the vogue of new, experimental French prose but also, by extension, other post-war attempts to fuse different planes of location, temporality and fragmented consciousness within the same novel. Michael Dirda wrote that \"To its admirers, it remains one of those rare encyclopedic summas, like Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", the essays of Montaigne or Dante's \"Commedia\", that offer insight into our unruly passions and solace for life's miseries.\" Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon has called it his favorite book.\nProust's influence (in parody) is seen in Evelyn Waugh's \"A Handful of Dust\" (1934), in which Chapter 1 is entitled \"Du C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Chez Beaver\" and Chapter 6 \"Du C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Chez Tod\". Waugh did not like Proust: in letters to Nancy Mitford in 1948, he wrote, \"I am reading Proust for the first time ... and am surprised to find him a mental defective\" and later, \"I still think [Proust] insane ... the structure must be sane &amp; that is raving.\" Another hostile critic is Kazuo Ishiguro, who said in an interview: \"To be absolutely honest, apart from the opening volume of Proust, I find him crushingly dull.\"\nSince the publication in 1992 of a revised English translation by The Modern Library, based on a new definitive French edition (1987\u201389), interest in Proust's novel in the English-speaking world has increased. Two substantial new biographies have appeared in English, by Edmund White and William C. Carter, and at least two books about the experience of reading Proust have appeared, Alain de Botton's \"How Proust Can Change Your Life\" and Phyllis Rose's \"The Year of Reading Proust\". The Proust Society of America, founded in 1997, has three chapters: at The New York Mercantile Library, the Mechanic's Institute Library in San Francisco, and the Boston Athen\u00e6um Library. Furthermore, in 2016, https://, a non-profit organization, was created to accommodate reading and discussing Proust to readers all over the world through monthly online sessions.\nEnglish-language translations.\nThe first six volumes were first translated into English by the Scotsman C. K. Scott Moncrieff under the title \"Remembrance of Things Past\", a phrase taken from Shakespeare's Sonnet 30; this was the first translation of the \"Recherche\" into another language. The individual volumes were \"Swann's Way\", in two books (1922), \"Within a Budding Grove\", in two books (1924), \"The Guermantes Way\", in two books (1925), \"Cities of the Plain\", in two books (1927), \"The Captive\" (1929), and \"The Sweet Cheat Gone\" (1930). The final volume, \"Le Temps retrouv\u00e9\", was initially published in English in the UK as \"Time Regained\" (1931), translated by Stephen Hudson (a pseudonym of Sydney Schiff), and in the US as \"The Past Recaptured\" (1932) in a translation by Frederick Blossom. There were thus eleven books in the original English translation. Although cordial with Scott Moncrieff, Proust grudgingly remarked in a letter that \"Remembrance\" eliminated the correspondence between \"Temps perdu\" and \"Temps retrouv\u00e9\" (Painter, 352). Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff translation in 1981, using the new French edition of 1954. An additional revision by D. J. Enright\u2014that is, a revision of a revision\u2014was published by the Modern Library in 1992. It is based on the \"La Pl\u00e9iade\" edition of the French text (1987\u201389), and rendered the title of the novel more literally as \"In Search of Lost Time\". It also includes an index/concordance to the novel compiled by Terence Kilmartin that was published in 1983 as the \"Reader's Guide to the Remembrance of Things Past\". The guide contains four indices: fictional characters from the novels; actual persons; places; and themes.\nIn 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation based on the \"La Pl\u00e9iade\" French text (published in 1987\u201389) of \"In Search of Lost Time\" by a team of seven different translators overseen by editor Christopher Prendergast. The six volumes were published in Britain under the Allen Lane imprint in 2002, each volume under the name of a separate translator, the first volume being American writer Lydia Davis, and the others under English translators and one Australian, James Grieve. The first four volumes were published in the US under the Viking imprint as hardcover editions in 2003\u20132004, while the entire set is available in paperback under the Penguin Classics imprint.\nBoth the Modern Library and Penguin translations provide a detailed plot synopsis at the end of each volume. The last volume of the Modern Library edition, \"Time Regained\", also includes Kilmartin's \"A Guide to Proust\", a set of four indexes covering the (fictional) characters, (real) persons, places (both real and fictional), and themes in the novel. The Modern Library volumes include a handful of endnotes, and alternative versions of some of the novel's famous episodes. The Penguin volumes each provide an extensive set of brief, non-scholarly endnotes that help identify cultural references perhaps unfamiliar to contemporary English readers. Reviews that discuss the merits of both translations can be found online at the \"Observer\", the \"Telegraph\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"The New York Times\", \"TempsPerdu.com\", and Reading Proust.\nFrom 2013 to 2025, Yale University Press published a new revision of Scott Moncrieff's translation, edited and annotated by William C. Carter, at the rate of one volume every two or three years, using Andreas Mayor's translation for the final volume.\nAfter a partial translation of the first volume in 2018, since 2023 Oxford University Press is publishing a new, complete translation, edited by Adam Watt.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, the term is ambiguous, with several other common meanings: an OEM can be the maker of a system that includes other companies' subsystems, an end-product producer, an automotive part that is manufactured by the same company that produced the original part used in the automobile's assembly, or a value-added reseller.\nOEM manufacturing is also widely used in the packaging industry, particularly in the production of customized gift boxes for wine and spirits. These OEM producers allow brands to create unique holiday packaging without maintaining their own manufacturing facilities.\nAutomotive parts.\nWhen referring to auto parts, OEM typically refers to the manufacturer of the original equipment, that is, the parts which are then subsequently assembled and installed during the construction of a new vehicle. In contrast, aftermarket parts are those made by companies other than the OEM, which might be installed as replacements or enhancements after the car comes out of the factory. For example, if Ford used Autolite spark plugs, Exide batteries, Bosch fuel injectors, and Ford's own engine blocks and heads when building a car, then car restorers and collectors consider those to be the OEM parts. Other-brand parts would be considered aftermarket, such as Champion spark plugs, DieHard batteries, Kinsler fuel injectors, and BMP engine blocks and heads.\nMany auto parts manufacturers sell parts through multiple channels, for example to car makers for installation during new vehicle construction, to car makers for resale as automaker\u2011branded replacement parts, and through general merchandising supply chains. Any given brand of part can be OEM on some vehicle models and aftermarket on others.\nNot all auto parts are available in OEM versions. In some cases, vehicle manufacturers secure exclusive sales rights for specific components. These parts are produced by contracted suppliers and carry the automaker's branding, but the suppliers are not permitted to sell them independently under their own name.\nComputer software.\nWindows.\nMicrosoft is a popular example of a company that issues its Windows operating systems for use by OEM computer manufacturers via the bundling of Microsoft Windows. OEM product keys are priced lower than their retail counterparts, especially as they are purchased in bulk quantities, although they use the same software as retail versions of Windows. They are primarily for PC manufacturer OEMs and system builders, and as such are typically sold in volume licensing deals to a variety of manufacturers (Dell, HP, ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Wistron, Inventec, Supermicro, Compal Electronics, Quanta Computer, Foxconn, Pegatron, Jabil, Flex, etc.). \nThese OEMs commonly use a procedure known as System Locked Pre-installation, which pre-activates Windows on PCs that are to be sold via mass distribution. These OEMs also commonly bundle software that is not installed on stock Windows on the images of Windows that will be deployed with their PCs (appropriate hardware drivers, anti-malware and maintenance software, various apps, etc.).\nIndividuals may also purchase OEM \"system-builder\" licenses for personal use (to include virtual hardware), or for sale/resale on PCs which they build. Per Microsoft's EULA regarding PC manufacturers and system-builder OEM licenses, the product key is tied to the PC motherboard which it is initially installed on, and there is \"typically\" no transferring the key between PCs afterward. This is in contrast to retail keys, which may be transferred, provided they are only activated on one PC at a time. A significant hardware change will trigger a reactivation notice, just as with retail.\nDirect OEMs are officially held liable for things such as installation/recovery media, and as such were commonly provided until the late-2000s. These were phased out in favor of recovery partitions located on the primary storage drive of the PC (and available for order from the manufacturer upon request) for the user to repair or restore their systems to the factory state. This not only cut down on costs, but was also a consequence of the gradual obsolescence and phasing out of optical media from 2010 onward. System builders also have a different requirement regarding installation media from Direct OEMs. \nWhile a clean retail media of Windows can be installed and activated on these devices with OEM keys (most commonly using the SLP key that's embedded in to the system firmware already), actual OEM recovery media that was created by the PC manufacturer (not system-builder, nor retail Windows versions) typically only works on the PC model line that was designed for it. For example, a recovery disc/USB for a Toshiba Satellite P50-B will only work on that model, and not a Satellite S55T.\nAndroid.\nThe OEM smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung, Sony and Xiaomi, are manufacturers of hardware and software of smartphones. Such manufacturers usually customize and adapt suitable Android operating system, with manufacturer components such as One UI and MIUI.\nSkateboards.\nSkateboard decks are primarily produced by a small number of specialized OEMs, such as PS Stix, BBS, and Dwindle. These manufacturers handle the entire production process, including sourcing high-quality wood, crafting molds, gluing and pressing multiple layers of veneer, and applying graphics designed by the brands to the decks. Once completed, the finished products are distributed to skateboarding brands, which sell them under their respective labels.\nOther examples.\nFoxconn is one example of an OEM, which helps upstream companies such as Nokia and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to manufacture servers. The designed intellectual property are usually owned by upstream companies.\nEconomies of scale.\nOEMs rely on their ability to drive down the cost of production through economies of scale. Using an OEM also allows the purchasing company to obtain needed components or products without owning and operating a factory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69923", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69923", "title": "Whodunit", "text": "Type of detective story\nA whodunit (less commonly spelled as whodunnit; a colloquial elision of \"Who [has] done it?\") is a complex plot-driven variety of detective fiction in which the puzzle regarding who committed the crime is the main focus. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues to the case, from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric, amateur, or semi-professional detective.\nConcept.\nA whodunit follows the paradigm of the traditional detective story in the sense that it presents crime as a puzzle to be solved through a chain of inquiries questions that the detective poses. In a whodunit, however, the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. This engages the readers so that they strive to compete with or outguess the expert investigator.\nA defining feature of the whodunit narrative is the so-called double narrative. Here, one narrative is hidden and gradually revealed while the other is the open narrative, which often transpires in the present time of the story. This feature has been associated with the Russian literary terms \"syuzhet\" and fabula. The former involves the narrative presented to the reader by the author or the actual story as it happened in chronological order while the latter focuses on the underlying substance or material of the narrative.\nThe double narrative has a deep structure but is specific, particularly when it comes to time and a split gaze on the narrative itself. The two tales coexist and interweave with the first tale focusing on the crime itself, what led to it, and the investigation to solve it while the second story is all about the reconstruction of the crime. Here, the \"diegesis\", or the way the characters live on the inquiry level creates the phantom narration where the objects, bodies, and words become signs for both the detective and the reader to interpret and draw their conclusions from. For instance, in a detective novel, solving a mystery entails the reconstruction of the criminal events. This process, however, also involves on the part of the detective the production of a hypothesis that could withstand scrutiny, including the crafting of findings about cause and motive as well as crime and its intended consequences. This discourse of explanation constitutes the second narrative besides the primary story relating to the crime.\nThe double narrative is cited as a main distinguishing element between the whodunit and the thriller. The whodunit goes backward as it goes forward, reconstructing the timeline of both crime and investigation, while the thriller coincides with the action in a single story. According to Tzvetan Todorov, in terms of temporal logic, the whodunit narrative is considered a paradigm for fiction in general because the story unfolds in relation not to a future event but one that is already known and merely lying in wait. Such certainty pertains to the crime and not to the identity of the culprit, who the reader must anticipate as part of the unknown future.\nThis narrative development has been seen as a form of comedy, in which order is restored to a threatened social calm.\nHistory.\nAccording to , the term \"WhoDunIt\" was coined by https:// reviewer Donald Gordon in 1930, in his review of the detective novel \"Half-Mast Murder\" written by Milward Kennedy. Journalist Wolfe Kaufman claimed that he coined the word \"whodunit\" around 1935 while working for \"Variety\" magazine. However, an editor of the magazine, Abel Green, attributed it to his predecessor, Sime Silverman. The earliest appearance of the word \"whodunit\" in \"Variety\" occurs in the edition of August 28, 1934, in reference to a film adaptation of the play \"Recipe for Murder,\" as featured in the headline, \"U's Whodunit: Universal is shooting 'Recipe for Murder,' Arnold Ridley's play\". The film was eventually titled \"Blind Justice\".\nThe \"whodunit\" flourished during the so-called \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", between the First and Second World Wars, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing. Many of the best-known writers of whodunits in this period were British \u2013 notably Agatha Christie, Nicholas Blake, G. K. Chesterton, Christianna Brand, Edmund Crispin, Michael Innes, Dorothy L. Sayers, Gladys Mitchell and Josephine Tey. Others \u2013 S. S. Van Dine, John Dickson Carr and Ellery Queen \u2013 were American, but imitated the \"British\" style. Still others, such as Rex Stout, Clayton Rawson and Earl Derr Biggers, attempted a more \"American\" style. During the Golden Age, the genre was dominated by female authors. In addition to Christie, Brand, Sayers, Mitchell, and Tey, major writers also included Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh. \nOver time, certain conventions and clich\u00e9s developed which limited surprise on the part of the reader \u2013 vis-\u00e0-vis details of the plot \u2013 the identity of the murderer. Several authors excelled, after successfully misleading their readers, in revealing an unlikely suspect as the real villain of the story. They often had a predilection for certain casts of characters and settings, with the secluded English country house at the top of the list.\nOne reaction to the conventionality of British murder mysteries was American \"hard-boiled\" crime fiction, epitomized by the writings of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Mickey Spillane, among others. Though the settings were grittier, the violence more abundant and the style more colloquial, plots were, as often as not, whodunits constructed in much the same way as the \"cozier\" British mysteries.\nGames.\nThe 1935 commercial parlour game \"Jury Box\" sees the players cast as jurors who are given the scenario of the murder, the evidence presented by the prosecutor and defendant, two photographs of the crime scene and ballot papers. Players are challenged to make the decision as to who is guilty, before a real solution is read out.\nThe 1948 board game \"Cluedo\", released as \"Clue\" in North America, was the first murder mystery board game, and sees players as visitors in a mansion, attempting to identify a killer whose identity is recorded on a hidden card.\nA murder mystery game is a form of live-action \"whodunit\" experience, where guests at a private party are given notes to perform the roles of the suspects, detective and murderer over the course of an evening. There are a number of murder mystery dinner theaters, where either professional or community theatre performers take on those roles, and present the murder mystery to an audience, usually in conjunction with a meal. Typically before or immediately following the final course, the audience is given a chance to offer their help in solving the mystery.\nUse and variations.\nHowdunnit.\nAn important variation on the whodunit is the inverted detective story (also referred to as a \"howcatchem\" or \"howdunnit\") in which the guilty party and the crime are openly revealed to the reader/audience and the story follows the investigator's efforts to find out the truth while the criminal attempts to prevent it. The \"Columbo\" TV series is the classic example of this kind of detective story (\"\" and \"The Streets of San Francisco\" also fit into this genre). This tradition dates back to the inverted detective stories of R Austin Freeman, and reached an apotheosis of sorts in \"Malice Aforethought\" written by Francis Iles (a pseudonym of Anthony Berkeley). In the same vein is Iles's \"Before the Fact\" (1932), which became the Hitchcock movie \"Suspicion\". Successors of the psychological suspense novel include Patricia Highsmith's \"This Sweet Sickness\" (1960), Simon Brett's \"A Shock to the System\" (1984), and Stephen Dobyns's \"The Church of Dead Girls\" (1997).\nWhydunit.\nA whydunit is a story in which the central mystery is the motive, rather than the perpetrator. A notable example is \"The Secret History\" by Donna Tartt, in which the killers and the circumstances of the murder are revealed on the first page.\nParody and spoof.\nIn addition to standard humor, parody, spoof, and pastiche have had a long tradition within the field of crime fiction. Examples of pastiche are the Sherlock Holmes stories written by John Dickson Carr, and hundreds of similar works by such authors as E. B. Greenwood. As for parody, the first Sherlock Holmes spoofs appeared shortly after Conan Doyle published his first stories. Similarly, there have been innumerable Agatha Christie send-ups. The idea is to exaggerate and mock the most noticeable features of the original and, by doing so, amuse especially those readers who are also familiar with that original.\nThere are also \"reversal\" mysteries, in which the conventional structure is deliberately inverted. One of the earliest examples of this is \"Trent's Last Case\" (1914) by E. C. Bentley (1875\u20131956). Trent, a very able amateur detective, investigates the murder of Sigsbee Manderson. He finds many important clues, exposes several false clues, and compiles a seemingly unassailable case against a suspect. He then learns that that suspect cannot be a murderer, and that while he found nearly all of the truth, his conclusion is wrong. Then, at the end of the novel, another character tells Trent that he always knew the other suspect was innocent, because \"I shot Manderson myself.\" These are Trent's final words to the killer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I'm cured. I will never touch a crime-mystery again. The Manderson affair shall be Philip Trent's last case. His high-blown pride at length breaks under him.\" Trent's smile suddenly returned. \"I could have borne everything but that last revelation of the impotence of human reason. [...] I have absolutely nothing left to say, except this: you have beaten me. I drink your health in a spirit of self-abasement. And \"you\" shall pay for the dinner.\"\nAnother example of a spoof, which at the same time shows that the borderline between serious mystery and its parody is necessarily blurred, is U.S. mystery writer Lawrence Block's novel \"The Burglar in the Library\" (1997). The burglar of the title is Bernie Rhodenbarr, who has booked a weekend at an English-style country house just to steal a signed, and therefore very valuable, first edition of Chandler's \"The Big Sleep\", which he knows has been sitting there on one of the shelves for more than half a century. Alas, immediately after his arrival a dead body turns up in the library, the room is sealed off, and Rhodenbarr has to track down the murderer before he can enter the library again and start hunting for the precious book.\n\"Murder by Death\" is Neil Simon's spoof of many of the best-known whodunit sleuths and their sidekicks. In the 1976 film, Sam Spade (from \"The Maltese Falcon\") becomes Sam Diamond, Hercule Poirot becomes Milo Perrier, and so on. The characters are all gathered in a large country house and given clues to solve the mystery.\nTom Stoppard's \"The Real Inspector Hound\" is a send-up of crime fiction novels and features a bumbling detective.\nThe 2019 film \"Knives Out\" is a modern take on the classic \"whodunit\" by deconstructing the narrative form and adds a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.\nHomicide investigation.\nThe term \"whodunit\" is also used among homicide investigators to describe a case in which the identity of the killer is not quickly apparent. Since most homicides are committed by people with whom the victim is acquainted or related, a whodunit case is usually more difficult to solve.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He became Bishop of Utrecht in 995. He appears to have been the son or grandson of Lambert, a nobleman of the Maasgau, the area where he later founded the Abbey of Thorn. He also appears to have been related to various important contemporaries including the royal family.\nLife.\nThe principal source of information regarding Ansfried is the \"De diversitatem temporum\" by the Benedictine Albert of Metz, written around 1022.\nAnsfried had the same name as a paternal uncle (\"patruus\"), Ansfried the elder, a count who supposedly held 15 counties. The young Ansfried studied secular and clerical subjects under another paternal uncle, Robert, Archbishop of Trier, before attending the cathedral school at Cologne. \nIn 961, Otto I took Ansfried into his personal service and made him his swordbearer. When Otto was in Rome the following year to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor, he directed Ansfried to keep close at hand with the sword as a precaution against any unforeseen eventualities. Karl Leyser describes this as a valuable lesson in practicality.\nBecause of his Christian commitment, he was highly respected and an important knight of the emperor's circle, holding rich possessions along the Meuse, in Brabant and Gelderland. Possibly all or some of his counties were inherited from his paternal uncle of the same name. As count he had considerable success in suppressing piracy and armed robbery. In 985, Otto III granted Ansfried the right to mint coins at Medemblik, on the north-south shipping route through the Vlie, as well as the income from tolls and tax collecting.\nHe was married to Heresuint or Hilsondis. They had one child, Benedicta. He founded a Romanesque abbey church on his wife's estate at Thorn under the patronage of St. Michael. The abbey itself had a double cloister that housed both men and women. Ansfried planned it as a place of retirement for himself and his family after he left public service. Under his control, the abbey and lands, of about 1.5 square kilometers, was reichsunmittel, making it subject only to the Emperor. Hereswitha was to be the first abbess but died on her way there; and Benedicta took her place.\nAfter his wife's death, Ansfried wanted to become a monk. However, in 995, Emperor Otto III and Bishop Notker of Li\u00e8ge persuaded the reluctant Ansfried to assume the then vacant see of Utrecht. Ansfried objected that as he had borne weapons as a knight, he was unworthy of the office, but the emperor prevailed. The elderly count laid down his sword on the altar of Saint Mary in Aachen and was ordained priest and consecrated eighteenth Bishop of Utrecht in the same ceremony. Bishop Ansfried never took a commission in the royal army, in contrast to Notger and the Bishop of Cologne.\nIn 1006 Bishop Ansfried founded the abbey of Heiligenberg, also under the patronage of Saint Michael. Toward the end of his life he became increasingly weakened through fasting, and retired there as a monk, caring for the sick, although almost blind himself.\nUpon his death, townsfolk from Heiligenberg took possession of his body, while the people of Utrecht were extinguishing a not coincidental fire. The abbess of Thorn mediated and Ansfried was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Martin in Utrecht.\nVeneration.\nHis feast day was 3 May but was later moved to 11 May.\nPatronage.\nSt. Ansfried is the patron saint of Amersfoort.\nIconography.\nAnsfried is portrayed holding a small church building (as a founder); as a knight with weapons at his feet, because he renounced the knighthood; with a bishop's miter and staff; or as a Benedictine monk.\nThe stained glass windows in St. John's Cathedral in Den Bosch depicting the seven sacraments.

{"id": "69926", "revid": "43843819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69926", "title": "Pauline Hanson", "text": "Australian politician (born 1954)\nPauline Lee Hanson (n\u00e9e Seccombe, formerly Zagorski; born 27 May 1954) is an Australian politician who is the founder and leader of One Nation, a right-wing populist political party. Hanson has represented Queensland in the Australian Senate since the 2016 federal election.\nHanson ran a fish and chip shop before entering politics in 1994 as a member of Ipswich City Council. She joined the Liberal Party of Australia in 1995 and was preselected for the Division of Oxley in Brisbane at the 1996 federal election. She was disendorsed shortly before the election after making contentious comments about Aboriginal Australians, but remained listed as a Liberal on the ballot paper. Hanson won the election and took her seat as an independent, before co-founding One Nation in 1997 and becoming its only MP. She attempted to switch to the Division of Blair at the 1998 federal election but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, her newly formed party experienced a surge in popularity at the 1998 Queensland state election, garnering the second-highest number of votes of any party in the state.\nAfter her defeat in 1998, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the 2001 election as the leader of One Nation but was expelled from the party in 2002. A District Court jury found Hanson guilty of electoral fraud in 2003, but her convictions were later overturned by three judges on the Queensland Court of Appeal. She spent 11 weeks in jail prior to the appeal being heard.\nFollowing her release, Hanson ran in several state and federal elections, as the leader of Pauline Hanson's United Australia Party and as an independent before rejoining One Nation in 2013 and becoming leader again the following year. She was narrowly defeated at the 2015 Queensland state election, but was elected to the Senate at the 2016 federal election, along with three other members of the party. She was re-elected at the 2022 federal election.\nIn 2017 and 2025, she gained media attention for wearing a burqa into the Australian Senate. She is currently suspended from the Senate for this act.\nEarly life and career.\nHanson was born Pauline Lee Seccombe on 27 May 1954 in the Brisbane suburb of Woolloongabba. She was the fifth of seven children (and the youngest daughter) to John Alfred \"Jack\" Seccombe and Hannorah Alousius Mary \"Norah\" Seccombe (n\u00e9e Webster). She first received schooling at Buranda Girls' School, later attending Coorparoo State School in Coorparoo until she ended her education at age 15, shortly before her first marriage and pregnancy.\nJack and Norah Seccombe owned a fish and chip shop in Ipswich, Queensland, in which Hanson and her siblings worked from a young age, preparing meals and taking orders. At an older age, she assisted her parents with more administrative work in bookkeeping and sales ledgering.\nHanson worked at Woolworths before working in the office administration of Taylors Elliotts Ltd, a subsidiary of Drug Houses of Australia (now Bickford's Australia), where she handled clerical bookkeeping and secretarial work. She left Taylors Elliotts during her first pregnancy.\nIn 1978, Hanson (then Pauline Zagorski) met Mark Hanson, a tradesman on Queensland's Gold Coast. They married in 1980 and established a construction business specialising in roof plumbing. Hanson handled the administrative components of the company, similar to her work with Taylors Elliotts, while her husband dealt with practical labour. In 1987, the couple divorced and the company was liquidated. She moved back to Ipswich and worked as a barmaid at what was then Booval Bowls Club. Hanson then bought a fish and chip shop with a new business partner Morrie Marsden. They established Marsden Hanson Pty Ltd and began operations from their recently opened fish and chip shop in Silkstone, a suburb of Ipswich. Hanson and Marsden both shared the administrative responsibilities of the company, but Hanson took on additional practical responsibilities, including buying supplies and produce for the shop and preparing the food, which was among many things that contributed to her notoriety during her first political campaign. Over time, Hanson acquired full control of the company, which was sold upon her election to Parliament in 1996.\nPolitical career.\nEntry into politics.\nHanson's first election to office was in 1994, earning a seat on the Ipswich City Council, on the premise of an opposition to extra funding. She held the seat for 11 months, before being removed in 1995 due to administrative changes.\nIn August 1995, she joined the Liberal Party of Australia and in 1996 was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Oxley, based on Ipswich, for the March 1996 Federal election. At the time, the seat was thought of as a Labor stronghold. The Labor incumbent, Les Scott, held it with an almost 15% two-party majority, making it the safest Labor seat in Queensland. Because of this, Hanson was initially dismissed and ignored by the media believing that she had no chance of winning the seat. However, Hanson received widespread media attention when, leading up to the election, she advocated the abolition of special government assistance for Aboriginal Australians, and she was disendorsed by the Liberal Party. Ballot papers had already been printed listing Hanson as the Liberal candidate, and the Australian Electoral Commission had closed nominations for the seat. As a result, Hanson was still listed as the Liberal candidate when votes were cast, even though Liberal leader John Howard had declared she would not be allowed to sit with the Liberals if elected. On election night, Hanson took a large lead on the first count and picked up enough Democrat preferences to defeat Scott on the sixth count. Her victory came amid Labor's near-meltdown in Queensland which saw it cut down to only two seats in the state. Hanson won 54 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. Had she still been running as a Liberal, the 19.3-point swing would have been the largest two-party swing of the election. Since Hanson had been disendorsed, she entered parliament as an independent.\n1996 \u2014 maiden speech.\nOn 10 September 1996, Hanson gave her maiden speech to the House of Representatives, which was widely reported in the media. In her opening lines, Hanson said: \"I won the seat of Oxley largely on an issue that has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals\". Hanson then asserted that Australia was in danger of being \"swamped by Asians\", and that these immigrants \"have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate\". Hanson argued that \"mainstream Australians\" were instead subject to \"a type of reverse racism ... by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists and a host of other minority groups\". This theme continued with the assertion that \"present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals\".\nAmong a series of criticisms of Aboriginal land rights, access to welfare and reconciliation, Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), saying: \"Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC\". There then followed a short series of statements on family breakdown, youth unemployment, international debt, the Family Law Act, child support, and the privatisation of Qantas and other national enterprises. The speech also included an attack on immigration and multiculturalism, a call for the return of high-tariff protectionism, and criticism of economic rationalism. Her speech was delivered uninterrupted by her fellow parliamentarians as it was the courtesy given to MPs delivering their maiden speeches.\n1997 \u2014 establishment of One Nation.\nIn February 1997, Hanson, David Oldfield and David Ettridge founded the Pauline Hanson's One Nation political party. Disenchanted rural voters attended her meetings in regional centres across Australia as she consolidated a support base for the new party. An opinion poll in May of that year indicated that the party was attracting the support of 9 per cent of Australian voters and that its popularity was primarily at the expense of the Liberal Party-National Party Coalition's base.\nHanson's presence in the suburb of Dandenong, Victoria, to launch her party was met with demonstrations on 7 July 1997, with 3,000\u20135,000 people rallying outside. A silent vigil and multicultural concert was organised by the Greater Dandenong City Council in response to Hanson's presence, while a demonstration was organised by an anti-racism body. The majority of attendees were of Asian origin, where an open platform attracted leaders of the Vietnamese, Chinese, East Timorese and Sri Lankan communities. Representatives from churches, local community groups, lesbian and gay and socialist organisations also attended and addressed the crowd.\nIn its late 1990s incarnation, One Nation called for zero net immigration, an end to multiculturalism and a revival of Australia's Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition which it says has been diminished, the abolition of native title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an end to special Aboriginal funding programs, opposition to Aboriginal reconciliation which the party says will create two nations, and a review of the 1967 constitutional referendum which gave the Commonwealth power to legislate for Aborigines. The party's economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation's influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, competition policy, and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people's bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia's United Nations membership, a repudiation of Australia's UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.\n1998 re-election campaign.\nIn 1999, \"The Australian\" reported that support for One Nation had fallen from 22% to 5%. One Nation Senate candidate Lenny Spencer blamed the press together with party director David Oldfield for the October 1998 election defeat, while the media reported the redirecting of preferences away from One Nation as the primary reason, with a lack of party unity, poor policy choices and an \"inability to work with the media\" also responsible.\nAhead of the 1998 federal election, an electoral redistribution essentially split Oxley in half. Oxley was reconfigured as a marginal Labor seat, losing most of its more rural and exurban area while picking up the heavily pro-Labor suburb of Inala. A new seat of Blair was created in the rural area surrounding Ipswich. Hanson knew her chances of holding the reconfigured Oxley were slim, especially after former Labor state premier Wayne Goss won preselection for the seat. After considering whether to contest a Senate seat\u2014which, by most accounts, she would have been heavily tipped to win\u2014she opted to contest Blair. Despite its very large notional Liberal majority (18.7 percent), most of her base was now located there.\nHanson launched her 1998 election campaign with a focus on jobs, rather than a focus on race/ethnicity or on \"the people\" against \"the elites\". Instead Hanson focused on unemployment and the need to create more jobs not through government schemes but by \"cheap loans to business, by more apprenticeships, and by doing something about tariffs\".\nHanson won 36 percent of the primary vote, slightly over 10% more than the second-place Labor candidate, Virginia Clarke. However, with all three major parties preferencing each other ahead of Hanson, Liberal candidate Cameron Thompson was able to win the seat despite finishing in third place on the first count. Thompson overtook Clarke on National preferences and defeated Hanson on Labor preferences. It has been suggested by Thompson that Hanson's litigation against parodist Pauline Pantsdown was a distraction from the election which contributed to her loss.\nNationally, One Nation gained 8.99 percent of the Senate vote and 8.4% of the Representatives vote, but only one MP was elected \u2013 Len Harris as a Senator for Queensland. Heather Hill had been elected to this position, but the High Court of Australia ruled that, although she was an Australian citizen, she was ineligible for election to sit as a Senator because she had not renounced her British citizenship. The High Court found that, at least since 1986, Britain had counted as a 'foreign power' within the meaning of section 44(i) of the Constitution. Hanson alleged in her 2007 autobiography \"Pauline Hanson: Untamed &amp; Unashamed\" that a number of other politicians had dual citizenship yet this did not prevent them from holding positions in Parliament.\nIn 1998, Tony Abbott had established a trust fund called \"Australians for Honest Politics Trust\" to help bankroll civil court cases against the One Nation Party and Hanson herself. John Howard denied any knowledge of the existence of such a fund. Abbott was also accused of offering funds to One Nation dissident Terry Sharples to support his court battle against the party. However, Howard defended the honesty of Abbott in this matter. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard Government was \"a very big factor\" in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also said he was acting \"in Australia's national interest\". Howard also defended Abbott's actions saying \"It's the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties \u2013 there's nothing wrong with that.\"\nTime in office.\nHanson gained extensive media coverage during her campaign and once she took her seat in the House. Her first speech attracted considerable attention for the views it expressed on Aboriginal benefits, welfare, immigration and multiculturalism. During her term in Parliament, Hanson spoke on social and economic issues such as the need for a fairer child support scheme and concern for the emergence of the working class poor. She also called for more accountable and effective administration of Indigenous affairs. Hanson's supporters viewed her as an ordinary person who challenged 'political correctness' as a threat to Australia's identity.\nThe reaction of the mainstream political parties was negative, with parliament passing a resolution (supported by all members except Graeme Campbell) condemning her views on immigration and multiculturalism. However, the Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, refused to censure Hanson or speak critically about her, acknowledging that her views were shared by many Australians, commenting that he saw the expression of such views as evidence that the \"pall of political correctness\" had been lifted in Australia, and that Australians could now \"speak a little more freely and a little more openly about what they feel\".\nHanson immediately labelled Howard a \"strong leader\" and said Australians were now free to discuss issues without \"fear of being branded as a bigot or racist\". Over the next few months, Hanson attracted populist anti-immigration sentiment and the attention of the Citizens' Electoral Council, the Australian League of Rights and other right-wing groups. Then-Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock announced a tougher government line on refugee applications, and cut the family reunion intake by 10,000, despite an election promise to maintain immigration levels. Various academic experts, business leaders and several state premiers attacked the justification offered by Ruddock, who had claimed that the reduction had been forced by continuing high unemployment. Various ethnic communities complained that this attack on multiculturalism was a cynical response to polls showing Hanson's rising popularity. Hanson herself claimed credit for forcing the government's hand.\n2001 election campaign.\nAt the next federal election on 10 November 2001, Hanson ran for a Queensland senate seat but narrowly failed. She accounted for her declining popularity by claiming that the Liberals under John Howard had stolen her policies.\n\"It has been widely recognised by all, including the media, that John Howard sailed home on One Nation policies. In short, if we were not around, John Howard would not have made the decisions he did.\"\nOther interrelated factors that contributed to her political decline from 1998 to 2002 include her connection with a series of advisors with whom she ultimately fell out (John Pasquarelli, David Ettridge and David Oldfield); disputes amongst her supporters; and a lawsuit over the organisational structure of One Nation.\nIn 2003, following her release from prison, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the New South Wales state election, running for a seat in the upper house. In January 2004, Hanson announced that she did not intend to return to politics. but then stood as an independent candidate for one of Queensland's seats in the Senate in the 2004 federal election. At the time, Hanson declared, \"I don't want all the hangers on. I don't want the advisers and everyone else. I want it to be this time Pauline Hanson.\" She was unsuccessful, receiving only 31.77% of the required quota of primary votes, and did not pick up enough additional support through preferences. However, she attracted more votes than the One Nation party (4.54% compared to 3.14%) and, unlike her former party, recovered her deposit from the Australian Electoral Commission and secured $150,000 of public electoral funding. Hanson claimed to have been vilified over campaign funding.\nHanson contested the electoral district of Beaudesert as an independent at the 2009 Queensland state election. After an election campaign dominated by discussion over hoax photographs, she was placed third behind the Liberal National Party's Aidan McLindon and Labor's Brett McCreadie. There were conflicting media reports as to whether she had said she would not consider running again.\nOn 23 July 2010, while at an event promoting her new career as a motivational speaker, Hanson expressed interest in returning to the political stage as a Liberal candidate if an invitation were to be offered by the leader Tony Abbott in the 2010 federal election. No such offer was made.\nRattnergate scandal.\nIn March 2011, Hanson ran as an independent candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Council in the 2011 state election, but was not elected, receiving 2.41 percent of the primary statewide vote but losing on preferences. Following the election, Hanson alleged that \"dodgy staff\" employed by the NSW Electoral Commission put 1,200 votes for her in a pile of blank ballots, and she claimed that she had a forwarded NSW Electoral Commission internal email as evidence of this. Hanson then commenced legal proceedings to challenge the outcome of the election in the NSW Supreme Court, which sat as the Court of Disputed Returns.\nFrom the start of proceedings, the NSW Electoral Commissioner maintained the view that Hanson's claims lacked substance. The man who alerted Hanson to the alleged emails, who identified himself as \"Michael Rattner\", failed to appear in court on 8 June 2011 \"Rattner\" was revealed to be Shaun Castle, a history teacher who posed as a journalist to obtain embargoed progressive poll results.\n\"Michael Rattner\" was a pun on Mickey Mouse and reports linked the pseudonym to an \"anti-voter-fraud\" organisation led by Amy McGrath and Alasdair Webster.\nAfter having refused to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination, Castle apologised to the court and was granted protection from prosecution by Justice McClellan, before being compelled to answer questions relating to the fraudulent email. The judge ordered that Hanson's legal costs of more than $150,000 be paid by the State of New South Wales \u2013 a move which outraged Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, who would have been replaced by Hanson had her challenge been successful. Questioning whether Hanson's legal action should have gone ahead at all given the nature of the evidence, Buckingham said that \"This lack of judgement shows that she's unfit for public office.\" Earlier, the judge, Justice McClellan, said Hanson had no other remedy but to take legal action after receiving the fraudulent email.\nOusted from One Nation, forming a new party.\nAt the 1999 election, One Nation politician David Oldfield was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council, the state parliament's upper house. However, in 2000, Oldfield was expelled from One Nation for an alleged verbal dispute with Hanson. Within weeks, Oldfield had established the splinter group, One Nation NSW.\nOne Nation won three seats in the Western Australian Legislative Council at the 2001 state election, but the electoral success of One Nation began to deteriorate after this point because the split-away of One Nation NSW began to spark further lack of party unity, and a series of gaffes by One Nation members and candidates, particularly in Queensland.\nHanson resigned from One Nation in January 2002 and John Fischer, the State Leader from Western Australia, was elected the Federal President of One Nation.\nOn 24 May 2007, Hanson launched Pauline's United Australia Party. Under that banner, Hanson again contested one of Queensland's seats in the Senate in the 2007 federal election, when she received over 4 percent of total votes. The party name invokes that of the historic United Australia Party. Speaking on her return to politics, she stated: \"I have had all the major political parties attack me, been kicked out of my own party and ended up in prison, but I don't give up.\" In October 2007, Hanson launched her campaign song, entitled \"Australian Way of Life\", which included the line: \"Welcome everyone, no matter where you come from.\"\nAfter an unsuccessful campaign in the 2009 Queensland state election, Hanson announced in 2010 that she planned to deregister Pauline's United Australia Party, sell her Queensland house and move to the United Kingdom. The announcement was warmly welcomed by Nick Griffin, leader of the far-right British National Party (BNP). When considering moving, Hanson said that she would not sell her house to Muslims. However, following an extended holiday in Europe, Hanson said in November 2010 that she had decided not to move to Britain because it was \"overrun with immigrants and refugees.\" Hanson lives in Beaudesert, Queensland.\nReturn as One Nation leader (2013\u2013present).\nIn 2013, Hanson announced that she would stand in the 2013 federal election. She rejoined the One Nation party and was a Senate candidate in New South Wales. She did not win a seat, attracting 1.22% of the first preference vote.\nIn November 2014, Hanson announced that she had returned as One Nation leader, prior to the party's announcement, following support from One Nation party members. She announced that she would contest the seat of Lockyer in the 2015 Queensland state election. One Nation held the Queensland seat of Lockyer from 1998 to 2004. In February 2015, Hanson lost the seat by a narrow margin.\nFirst Senate term (2016\u20132022).\nIn mid-2015, Hanson announced that she would contest the Senate for Queensland at the 2016 federal election, and also announced the endorsement of several other candidates throughout Australia. She campaigned on a tour she called \"Fed Up\" in 2015, and spoke at a Reclaim Australia rally. Hanson won a seat in the Senate at the election, and One Nation won 9% of the vote in Queensland. According to the rules governing the allocation of Senate seats following a double dissolution, Hanson served a full six-year term. Hanson secured a spot on the National Broadband Network parliamentary committee.\nAfter being elected to the parliament, she and other One Nation senators voted with the governing Coalition on a number of welfare cuts, and usually supports the government.\nOn 17 August 2017, Hanson received criticism after wearing a burqa, which she claims \"oppresses women\", into the Senate. Attorney-General George Brandis got a standing ovation from Labor and Greens senators after he gave an \"emotional\" speech saying to Hanson: \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do.\" Following the incident, polling found that 57% of Australians supported Hanson's call to ban the burka in public places, with 44% \"strongly\" supporting a ban. In August 2017, the party's constitution was changed, for Hanson to become party President for as long as she may wish and to choose her successor, who may also continue until resignation.\nOn 22 March 2018, Hanson announced that One Nation would back the Turnbull government's corporate tax cuts. She subsequently reversed her position, citing the failure of the government to cut immigration levels and support coal-fired power.\nOn 15 October 2018, Hanson proposed an \"It's OK to be white\" motion in the Australian Senate intended to acknowledge the \"deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilization\". It was supported by most senators from the governing Liberal-National Coalition, but was defeated 31\u201328 by opponents who called it a racist slogan from the white supremacist movement. The following day, the motion was \"recommitted\", and this time rejected unanimously by senators in attendance, with its initial supporters in the Liberal-National Coalition saying they had voted for it due to an administrative error (One Nation did not attend the recommital vote).\nOn 18 September 2019, the Liberal government announced that Hanson would co-chair the newly announced parliamentary inquiry into family law along with Kevin Andrews. She proposed a parliament motion advocating opposition to the proposed Great Reset of the World Economic Forum, on the belief that it is cover for creating a New World Order. Her proposal was defeated by 37 votes to 2.\nIn 2019, Hanson campaigned against a ban on climbing Uluru, a sacred site for local Aboriginal people. Shortly before the ban came into effect, in August Channel Nine paid for Hanson's trip to Uluru and on their \"A Current Affair\" program she was shown in a controversial episode climbing the rock.\nBeginning in May 2019, Hanson was a regular contributor on Channel Nine's \"Today\" show. She was removed from the role in July 2020 after describing people who lived in Melbourne public housing as drug addicts who couldn't speak English.\nFollowing the 2019 federal election, One Nation obtained $2.8 million in electoral expenses from the Australian Electoral Commission. Later, the Commission required One Nation to repay $165,442 as money that had not been spent or not spent for electoral purposes. In addition, it is reported: \"Hanson has personally agreed to an enforceable undertaking. And the party must in future make sure all invoices are in Hanson\u2019s name, the party\u2019s name or the name of a party officer. And make sure that all invoices match payment receipts, credit card or bank statements.\"\nIn June 2021, following media reports that the proposed national curriculum was \"preoccupied with the oppression, discrimination and struggles of Indigenous Australians\", the Australian Senate approved a motion tabled by Hanson calling on the federal government to reject Critical race theory CRT, despite it not being included in the curriculum.\nSecond Senate term (2022\u2013present).\nIn July 2022, the Senate opened with the Lord's Prayer and an Acknowledgement of Country, as normal. The ceremony includes the words: \"[the Parliament] recognises the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples as the traditional custodians of the Canberra meetings, and pays respects to elders past, present and emerging.\" Despite having sat through the ceremony many times before, this time Hanson stormed out of the chamber, yelling \"No I don't, and I never will!\"\nHanson later stated that her opposition was to a motion that the Aboriginal flag and Torres Strait Islander flag, which are both official flags of Australia, should be raised inside the Senate chamber alongside the Australian flag.\nIn 2023, Hanson criticised New South Wales One Nation leader Mark Latham's homophobic tweet in response to openly gay fellow politician Alex Greenwich, and called for him to apologise.\nOn 24 November 2025, Hanson wore a burqa on the Senate floor in a scene similar to a stunt performed in 2017. This was after a bill to ban the burqa failed. The entire Senate chamber was suspended for 90 minutes as a result of Hanson's action. She was formally censured by the Senate the next day and was suspended for seven sitting days.\nViews.\nDespite Hanson's repeated denials of charges of racism, her views on race, immigration, and Islam have been discussed widely in Australia. In her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996, Hanson appealed to economically disadvantaged white Australians by expressing dissatisfaction with government policy on indigenous affairs. Following Hanson's maiden speech her views received negative coverage across Asian news media in 1996, and Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer criticised the race \"debate\" initiated by Hanson, saying it was putting Australian exports and jobs at risk. Other ministers and state and territory leaders followed Fischer's lead in criticising Hanson.\nIn 1998, the resurgence of popularity of Hanson was met with disappointment in Asian media. Her resignation from politics in 2002 was met with support from academics, politicians and the press across Asia. In 2004, Hanson appeared on the nationally televised ABC TV interview show \"Enough Rope\", where her views were challenged.\nHanson is opposed to same-sex marriage and voted against it in the Senate.\nPolicies.\nImmigration and multiculturalism.\nIn her maiden speech, Hanson proposed a drastic reduction in immigration with particular reference to immigrants from Asia. Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Condemning multiculturalism, One Nation has railed against government immigration and multicultural policies.\nAfter Hanson was elected to Parliament in 1996, journalist Tracey Curro asked her on \"60 Minutes\" whether she was xenophobic. Hanson replied, \"Please explain?\" This response became a much-parodied catchphrase within Australian culture and was included in the title of the 2016 SBS documentary film \"\".\nIn 2006, Hanson stated that African immigrants were bringing diseases into Australia and were of \"no benefit to this country whatsoever\". She also stated her opposition to Muslim immigration. Ten years after her maiden speech, its effects were still being discussed within a racism framework, and were included in resources funded by the Queensland Government on \"Combating racism in Queensland\". In 2007, Hanson publicly backed Kevin Andrews, then Minister for Immigration under John Howard, in his views about African migrants and crime.\nHanson opposes the White Australia policy.\nIn 2018 Hanson called for immigration numbers to be capped at 75,000 a year. In 2025, Hanson called for immigration to be cut to 130,000 a year.\nIslam.\nIn 2015, Hanson claimed that Halal certification in Australia was funding terrorism. After the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Hanson called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia. The same year, Hanson announced several policies, including a ban on building new mosques until a royal commission into whether Islam is a religion or a political ideology has been held, and installing CCTV cameras in all existing mosques. She has called for a moratorium on accepting Muslim immigrants into Australia. In her 2016 maiden speech in the Senate, she said that \"We are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own\" and that they should \"go back to where [they] came from\", and called for banning Muslim migration. The speech prompted a walkout by Senate members of the Australian Greens.\nAfter the January 2017 Melbourne car attack, Hanson repeated her stance on banning Muslims from entering Australia. In a live interview after the attack, she stated: \"all terrorist attacks in this country have been by Muslims\", on which she was corrected by a journalist. In response, the Islamic Council of Victoria asked for a public apology for Hanson's statement.\nOn 24 March 2017, after the 2017 Westminster attack, Hanson made an announcement in a video posted to social media, holding up a piece of paper with her own proposed hash tag \u201c#Pray4MuslimBan\u201d. \u201cThat is how you solve the problem, put a ban on it and then let\u2019s deal with the issues here\u201d, she said.\nOn 22 June 2017, Hanson moved a motion in the Senate calling on the government to respond to the Halal inquiry. The motion was passed.\nOn 17 August 2017, Hanson wore a burqa onto the floor of the Australian Senate in a move to rally support for a national ban of the religious attire, citing \"national security\" concerns. The move quickly became widely condemned by Labor, the Greens and the Liberal Party. In response, the Attorney-General George Brandis, who is tasked with giving advice on national security legislation, gave an \"emotional\" speech calling Hanson's stunt \"an appalling thing to do\" and advised Hanson \"to be very very careful of the offense you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians\", to which both Labor and Greens' Senators gave a standing ovation.\nIn September 2022, Hanson tweeted that Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi should \"piss off back to Pakistan\". This came after Faruqi was slammed over an allegedly \"appalling\" tweet about Queen Elizabeth II after her death. Subsequently, Faruqi decided to launch court proceedings against Hanson for \"breaching section 18C of the \"Racial Discrimination Act 1975\"\". On 1 November 2024, it was reported that Federal Court of Australia judge Angus Stewart had ruled that Hanson's tweet was an \"angry personal attack\", unconnected with the issues Faruqi raised, and was therefore \"anti-Muslim or Islamophobic\". Hanson was ordered to delete the tweet and Faruqi was awarded costs for the entire proceedings. Hanson said that she would appeal the decision. As of \u00a02025,[ [update]] along with Sue Chrysanthou, Hanson is appealing the judgement.\nIn November 2025, Hanson wore a burqa on the Senate floor in a scene similar to a stunt performed in 2017. This was after a bill to ban the burqa failed. The entire Senate chamber was suspended for 90 minutes as a result of Hanson's action.\nPublic opinion.\nAfter her election in 1996, an estimated 10,000 people marched in protest against racism in Melbourne, and other protests followed, while Anglican and Catholic church leaders warned that the controversy threatened the stability of Australia's multicultural society. Also repudiating Hanson's views on immigration and multiculturalism were Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, the Queensland National senator Ron Boswell, Ronald Wilson and former Prime Minister Paul Keating. At the 1997 annual conference of the Australian and New Zealand Communications Association (ANZCA) at La Trobe University, a paper was presented with the title \"Phenomena and Epiphenomena: is Pauline Hanson racist?\". In 1998, social commentator Keith Suter argued that Hanson's views were better understood as an angry response to globalisation. A poll in \"The Bulletin\" magazine at this time suggested that if Hanson formed a political party, it would win 18 percent of the vote. After months of silence, then-Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley proposed a bipartisan motion against racial discrimination and reaffirming support for a nondiscriminatory immigration policy. The motion was carried on the voices.\nHanson did not relent in articulating her views and continued to address public meetings around Australia. The League of Rights offered financial and organisational support for her campaign against Asian immigration, and in December she announced she was considering forming a political party to contest the next election. Alexander Downer, minister for foreign affairs under John Howard, issued a media release calling on Hanson, David Oldfield and David Ettridge to distance themselves from racist slurs. In 2000, the University of NSW Press published the book \"Race, Colour and Identity in Australia and New Zealand\", which identified Hanson as a central figure in the \"racism debate\" in Australia of the 1990s, noting that senior Australian academics such as Jon Stratton, Ghassan Hage and Andrew Jakubowicz had explored Hanson's significance in an international as well as national context.\nAcademics, commentators and political analysts have continued to discuss Hanson's legacy and impact upon Australian politics since her rise to prominence in the 1990s and her political comeback in 2016. Milton Osborne noted that public opinion research indicated Hanson's initial support in the 1990s was not necessarily motivated by racist or anti-immigration sentiments, but instead from voters concerned about globalisation and unemployment. In 2019, Hans-Georg Betz identified Hanson as among the first populist politicians to mobilize a public following by targeting \"the intellectual elite\" in their messages, and that in the twentyfirst century, with \"today\u2019s army of self-styled commentators and pundits summarily dismissing radical right-wing populist voters as uncouth, uneducated plebeians intellectually incapable of understanding the blessings of progressive identity politics, Hanson\u2019s anti-elite rhetoric anno 1996 proved remarkably prescient, if rather tame\".\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and children.\nHanson was first married to Walter Zagorski.\nIn 1980, Hanson (then Pauline Zagorski) married Mark Hanson, a divorced tradesman working on the Gold Coast in Queensland. They honeymooned in South-East Asia. Mark Hanson had a daughter from his previous marriage, and he later had two children with Hanson: Adam and Lee. Together they established a trades and construction business, in which Hanson was in charge of the administrative and bookkeeping work, and would on occasion assist her husband on more practical work. Hanson has written about her difficult marriage, where alcohol and domestic violence impacted her family. They divorced in 1987. Lee was a candidate for One Nation in the 2025 Australian federal election.\nIn 1988, Hanson began a relationship with Morrie Marsden, a businessman in Queensland. Together, they established a catering service under the holding company Marsden Hanson Pty Ltd, and operated from their fish and chips store, Marsden's Seafood, in Silkstone, Queensland. Marsden worked on Hanson's campaign for political office in the seat of Oxley in 1996, and was a member of her staff after her election. When Hanson began to receive national and international media attention for her views, Marsden left the relationship. Hanson had begun a relationship with Ipswich man Rick Gluyas in 1994. Gluyas encouraged her to run as a candidate in the 1994 Ipswich City Council election, in which he also ran. Both were elected. Hanson and Gluyas ended their relationship some time after this, with Hanson retaining the home and property they had owned jointly at Coleyville, near Ipswich.\nIn 1996, Hanson began a relationship with David Oldfield. In 2000, all of Hanson's relations with Oldfield ended when he was dismissed from Pauline Hanson's One Nation.\nIn 2005, Hanson began a relationship with Chris Callaghan, a country music singer and political activist. He wrote and composed the song \"The Australian Way of Life\", which was used in Hanson's 2007 campaign for the Australian Senate, under her new United Australia Party. In 2007, Hanson revealed that she and Callaghan were engaged. However, in 2008, Hanson broke off the relationship.\nIn 2011, while campaigning for the New South Wales Legislative Council, Hanson began a relationship with property developer and real estate agent Tony Nyquist.\nFraud conviction and reversal.\nA 1999 civil suit reached the Queensland Court of Appeal in 2000 involving disgruntled former One Nation member Terry Sharples and led to a finding of fraud when registering One Nation as a political party, \nOn 20 August 2003, a jury in the District Court of Queensland convicted Hanson and David Ettridge of electoral fraud. Both Hanson and Ettridge were sentenced to three years imprisonment for falsely claiming that 500 members of the Pauline Hanson Support Movement were members of the political organisation Pauline Hanson's One Nation to register that organisation in Queensland as a political party and apply for electoral funding. Because the registration was found to be unlawful, Hanson's receipt of electoral funding worth $498,637 resulted in two further convictions for dishonestly obtaining property, each with three-year sentences, to run concurrently with the first. The sentence was widely criticised in the media, and by some politicians, including the prime minister, John Howard, and Liberal politician Bronwyn Bishop, as being too harsh. \nOn 6 November 2003, delivering judgment the day after hearing the appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed all of Hanson and Ettridge's convictions. Hanson, having spent 11 weeks in jail, was immediately released along with Ettridge. The court's unanimous decision was that the evidence did not support a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the people on the list were not members of the Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and that Hanson and Ettridge knew this when the application to register the party was submitted. Accordingly, the convictions regarding registration were quashed. The convictions regarding funding, which depended on the same facts, were also quashed.\nTelevision appearances.\nIn 2004, Hanson appeared in multiple television programs such as \"Dancing with the Stars\", \"Enough Rope\", \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", and \"This is Your Life\".\nIn 2011, Hanson was a contestant on \"The Celebrity Apprentice\".\nFollowing her successful relaunch of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party at the 2016 federal Senate election, with four senators elected, including herself, a documentary was made by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) entitled \"\".\nSexual harassment allegations.\nOn 14 February 2019, Hanson was accused of sexually harassing fellow senator Brian Burston. Burston claimed that Hanson \"rubbed her fingers up my spine\" in an incident that occurred in 1998, and propositioned him after he was elected in 2016. In court it was revealed that Hanson also sent a \"malicious\" text message to Burston's wife claiming he was infatuated with another staff member. Hanson denied the claims of sexual harassment.\nProperties and residence.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], Hanson was living on a large property in Beaudesert, Queensland. \nShe purchased an investment property in Maitland, New South Wales, in 2012, selling it in 2023.\nPublished books.\nSoon after her election to Parliament, Hanson's book \"Pauline Hanson\u2014the Truth: on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate and the future of Australia\" was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to \"demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society\".\nDavid Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct \"misconceptions\" about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that \"the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies\". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was \"written by some other people who actually put my name to it\" and that, while she held the copyright in the book, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.\nIn March 2007, Hanson published her autobiography, \"Untamed and Unashamed\".\nIn 2018, Hanson and Tony Abbott launched a collection of Hanson's speeches, \"Pauline: In Her Own Words\", compiled by journalist Tom Ravlic.\nIn art.\nAboriginal artist Karla Dickens represented Hanson in a collage entitled \"Clown Nation\" which included Hanson's photograph, in a series called \"A Dickensian Country Show\". It was shown in the 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia, an exhibition titled \"Monster Theatres\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located just west of Tucson, Arizona, it features two miles (3.2\u00a0km) of walking paths traversing 21 acres (8.5 ha) of desert landscape. It is one of the most visited attractions in Southern Arizona.\nThe nonprofit organization focuses on the interpretation of the natural history, plants and animals of the Sonoran Desert. The museum is home to more than 230 animal species and 1,200 varieties of plants. It is open every day through the year, and hosts nearly 400,000 visitors annually, including visitors from abroad.\nThe museum is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a member of the American Alliance of Museums and the American Public Gardens Association.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1952, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum interprets the complete natural history of a single region\u2014the Sonoran Desert and adjacent ecosystems\u2014with plants and animals from the region featured together in its exhibits.\nWilliam H. Carr inspired and founded the Desert Museum with the support of his friend, Arthur Newton Pack, a conservationist, son of Charles Lathrop Pack, and editor of \"Nature Magazine\". Carr had earlier founded the Bear Mountain Trailside Museum in New York, which was affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History. There he had developed a similar approach to displays, working with native plants and animals to create a regionally focused collection.\nPack, through his foundation, had provided $200,000 to open the museum and pay its operating cost, so the museum initially charged no admission. Although an admission charge was instituted in 1953, the museum is still supported only by admission fees, memberships, and donations, and receives no direct support from public taxes.\nFrom 1953 to 1985, a local television series, \"Desert Trails\", featured the museum. \"It was an informal show, almost always having live animals and human guests, and focusing on the natural history of the desert as well as happenings at the museum.\" In 1991 the museum partnered to develop a national television series known as \"Desert Speaks\". It was produced in cooperation with the local PBS affiliate (KUAT), and with The Nature Conservancy of Arizona. This television series was broadcast in 200 markets and ran for 19 seasons.\"\nTripAdvisor rated the Museum as Tucson's #2 attraction for 2018. It was ranked number 18 on their \"Top 25 Museums \u2013 United States\" and a top five public gardens to visit in the United States for 2018, and ranked number nine in the world on their \"Traveler\u2019s Choice\" of top museums for 2013 and 2014. \"Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\"'s \"The Daily Traveler\" included in their list of five museums in the United States for children interested in dinosaurs.\nExhibits and interpretation.\nThe Warden Aquarium opened in January 2013. The aquarium highlights the roles of the Colorado and other rivers in the region, as well as the Gulf of California, from which the water brought by the monsoon is essential to life in the Sonoran Desert.\nThe Desert Museum has exhibited lower vertebrates and invertebrates since its early days. Though this hall has been modified over the years, the building dates back to 1937 and many of the painted dioramas were created in the early to mid-1950s. On exhibit is a wide variety of native reptiles, including many species of rattlesnakes. Many amphibians and other invertebrates, ranging from spiders and scorpions to beetles, walking sticks, and grasshoppers, are also showcased.\nAt Cat Canyon visitors can view small cats, like bobcats and an ocelot, in naturalistic grotto settings. This exhibit area also includes a gray fox and porcupine.\nThe Desert Grassland exhibit area recreates a desert grassland habitat featuring soap tree yuccas, desert scrub, grasses and succulents. Visitors can observe prairie dogs and learn the region's history through a replica of a mammoth kill site.\nLife on the Rocks is a multi-species exhibit focusing on the habitat and species most often encountered amid the region's rocky slopes. Some enclosures are mesh-topped with natural soils and vegetation; others are glass-fronted crevices or cutaway burrows in simulated soil banks. The \"homes\" of individual species are embedded in the rocks\u2014many with burrows that can be exposed by visitors.\nThe Life Underground exhibit highlights creatures that make their homes underground. Visitors enter a tunnel and walk below ground into a dimly lit corridor where various creatures, such as kit fox, kangaroo rat, and ringtail, are featured. Here visitors learn where animals go when the desert heats up.\nCurrently on exhibit in the Riparian Corridor area are a river otter, bighorn sheep, coatis (also known as coatimundis), beavers, native fish and aquatic invertebrates (i.e., dragonflies and snails). There is also a desert toad life-cycle installation.\nThe Desert Loop Trail is an unpaved desert trail one-half mile long, passing through areas where javelinas, coyotes and lizards are on display. The fiber fencing there are designed to be almost invisible to the eye, aiming to make the enclosure feel like naturally open space. Agaves and various legume trees, native to the region, are identified on this trail.\nThe \"Mountain Woodland\" exhibit is a Mexican pine\u2013oak woodland habitat recreating similar habitats in nearby mountain ranges. Native species include a cougar, white-tailed deer, Merriam's turkeys and a brown bear. Mexican wolves and thick-billed parrots also showcased in this area are no longer present in the Sonoran Desert.\nThere is a walk-in aviary with northern cardinals, Gambel's quail, ducks, doves, and many other species of native birds. Several benches are located throughout the aviary for observation. A small stream runs through the middle of the enclosure.\nThe Earth Sciences Center-Cave is an artificial cave constructed with arches, side chambers and a tunnel for visitors to explore its 75-foot length. Along the entry passage, organisms and residents are displayed. Further in, a glistening mass of cave formations are lit from beneath the surface of a pool. In the grand rooms, fossils, geologic gems and minerals, and the history of the earth is interpreted.\nDesert Garden was built as a partnership between \"Sunset\" magazine and the Desert Museum. Three different levels of demonstration gardens display various species of plants that can be used in landscaping for homes in the Sonoran Desert region. There are two water features and seating. Attracted by water and flowers, wild native birds and butterflies frequently visit.\nThe Hummingbird Aviary allows observation of hummingbirds hovering so closely that visitors can feel the air disturbed by their wings. In breeding season, nests are near enough to allow viewing of the babies. The aviary houses four species that nest annually. The museum's Hummingbird Propagation Program is the only one of its kind in the world for North American hummingbirds.\nDue to its bi-seasonal rainfall, the Sonoran Desert region is known as the \"lushest desert on earth\" and is home to over 2,000 species of plants. The museum's gardens display this ecosystem and represent a variety of biotic communities found within the Sonoran Desert region. There are 1,200 different species of plants with 56,000 individual specimens planted on the grounds. The following gardens are available for viewing throughout the year:\nLive presentations.\nLive &amp; (sort of) on the Loose.\nThis presentation features often misunderstood venomous reptiles. Each program presents two species, which could be any combination of the following:\nRaptor free-flight.\nThis birds-of-prey demonstration is held in the open desert and spectators watch from the flight path. The birds fly so close visitors often feel the brush of feathers. Weather permitting, the museum hosts two demonstrations daily from mid-October through mid-April. The birds fly completely untethered, without any jesses (leg straps) and most often without leg rings. Only birds native to the Sonoran Desert Region are flown. A featured species is Harris's hawks, the only raptor species in the world to hunt as a family using strategy, like wolves. The morning and afternoon demonstrations showcase different species, so each is unique. Species include: Harris's hawk, peregrine falcons, barn owls, red-tailed hawks, ferruginous hawk, great horned owl, gray hawk, prairie falcon, and chihuahuan raven.\nDocent stations.\nDocent Stations, with trained volunteer naturalists, are located throughout the museum grounds. At these stations, docents offer presentations with live reptiles, birds, or mammals, or with animal skulls, skeletons, or fossil remains. Some stations interpret the geology of the Sonoran Desert region including rock formations and semi-precious stones.\nTours are available through advanced reservations via the museum's website. Topics include: Zookeeper for a Day, Winged Wonders (Hummingbird Tour), Warden Aquarium Private Tour, Walk on the Wild Side, and the Reptiles, Amphibians, and Invertebrates Tour.\nConservation education and science.\nFor many years, the Museum has been involved in scientific investigations, including botanical field investigations, especially in Mexico, with population studies of Ironwood, and a major bi-national research program on migratory pollinators. Current work includes studies of pollination and seed dispersal (how plants survive and get around), and the effects of climate change on regional ecological communities. The Living Collections staff of the museum, are involved in collaborative species survival projects, working with outside agencies and scientists. These include salvage and recovery efforts on a variety of lower vertebrates, including the Tarahumara frog, Chiricahua leopard frog, Mexican garter snake, Sonoyta mud turtle, and a wide range of desert fishes.\nCommunity outreach \u2013 the Desert Ark van and live animals.\nDesert Ark Community Programs feature live Sonoran Desert animals and may include interactive lectures, slide shows or activities. Museum staff members travel throughout Southern Arizona as well as areas within an 8-hour round-trip drive from the museum, although live animals are unable to travel outside the state of Arizona. For in-state programs, live animals may be used, and may include reptiles, birds, mammals and insects, although the particular animals vary by program.\nDigital library.\nThe Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum has a digital library containing thousands of photographs of plants and animals. The digital library is an interactive site that has a kid's page with videos, animal sounds, and games. Another interactive feature is the plant phenology section. Visitors can look at a specific species of plant or compare two plant species. In addition, the \"Time of Year\" feature allows users to select a date on the calendar to view what species are in flower or are expected to be in flower. Past dates will also provide temperature and precipitation data, whereas future dates will give average temperatures and chance of precipitation.\nArt Institute.\nThe Art Institute opened in 2001 to promote conservation of the Sonoran Desert through art education including classes, art exhibits, and stewardship of the Museum art.

It also hosts nationally recognized artists, both individually and through traveling exhibits, by the Society of Conservation Artists and (others).\nDesert Museum Press.\nSince 1995, the ASDM Press (Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum Press) has published more than 40 books or guides, including 22 popular books on the natural history of the Sonoran Desert Region. It has published six picture books for children in both English and Spanish and several pocket guides to hummingbirds and other birds, plants, lizards, snakes, beetles, etc. In 2000, ASDM Press co-published the 628-page \"bible\" of the Sonoran Desert, \"A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert\", with the University of California Press. In collaboration with the University of Arizona Press, the division has co-published several technical books in the Studies in Natural History Series, featuring research on topics from pollinators, to water in the desert, to the Sea of Cortez. In the first few years publications were mainly small paperback books. But since 2000, more substantial volumes are common, including the recent field guides to mountain wildflowers and mountain trees, as well as the full-color, 232-page \"Natural History of the Santa Catalina Mountains\", with an Introduction to the Madrean Sky Islands (2013).\nOperations and support.\nThe museum is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) institution. Its primary source of revenue is from the sale of admission tickets and memberships. Revenue from grants, major donors, bequests and planned gifts, special events, sponsorships, and an annual fund also contribute to the museum's funding.\nDocents and volunteers.\nThe Desert Museum benefits from the service of approximately 500 volunteers, who assist the approximately 120 paid staff. Collectively, Desert Museum volunteers contribute about 130,000 hours per year.\nSince its inception in 1972, the Docent Program has become a hallmark of the museum and is recognized by the industry as one of the finest docent corps in existence today.

The ASDM Internship Program offers a few unpaid, educational appointments for college students.\nHal Gras and the Desert Ark program.\nOne of the most influential staff members in the history of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum was Harold W. \"Hal\" Gras Jr., more commonly known as Hal Gras. According to David Leighton, historian for the \"Arizona Daily Star\" newspaper, Gras was born in New Jersey, in 1919. After serving in World War II and getting married, he relocated to El Paso, Texas where he received his college degree in broadcasting. In 1950, he moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he worked in radio and then television.\nIn 1952, when the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum opened its doors, Hal Gras and his wife Natie attended its opening and, as a result Gras began hosting the museum's TV show, \"Desert Trails\" (renamed \"The Desert Speaks\" when it moved to KUAT around 1990). The show first aired in 1953, and would run for 32 years, with Gras hosting 1,551 shows. From 1955 to 1972, Gras was the public relations director for the museum. He visited local clubs and talked about the museum. Though he had little or no experience with animals, he started bringing some along with him for his appearances. Soon the popularity of his talks increased and he started bringing creatures from the museum to schools, hospitals, county fairs, etc. The program and the car that Gras brought the animals in both came to be called \"The Desert Ark\".\nWhen Gras retired in 1985, he had presented a total of 5,382 Desert Ark programs. A few years after his retirement, a small street south of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, along Kinney Road, was named Hal Gras Road in his honor. He would die in 1999.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She grew up in Hillsborough, California. Her father was born to a Jewish family and her mother converted to Conservative Judaism before marriage. Silverstone had a bat mitzvah ceremony. She began modeling when she was six, and was subsequently cast in television commercials, the first being for Domino's Pizza. She attended Crocker Middle School, then San Mateo High School.\nCareer.\n1990s.\nHer first credited acting role was on \"The Wonder Years\" in 1992, in the episode \"Road Test\", as Kevin's high school \"dream girl\". Silverstone made her film debut when she obtained the leading role in the erotic thriller \"The Crush\", playing a teenage girl who sets out to ruin an older man after he spurns her affections; she became legally emancipated at the age of 15 to work the hours required for the shooting schedule of the film. She won two awards at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards for the role\u2014Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Villain. Silverstone made some television films in her early career, including \"Torch Song\", \"Cool and the Crazy\", and \"Scattered Dreams\".\nAfter seeing her in \"The Crush\", Marty Callner decided Silverstone would be perfect for a role in a music video he was directing for Aerosmith, called \"Cryin'.\" Silverstone is shown getting a navel piercing in the music video, which has largely been credited as introducing the navel piercing to mainstream culture. She was subsequently cast in two more Aerosmith videos, \"Amazing\" and \"Crazy\". These were hugely successful for both the band and Silverstone, making her a household name. After seeing Silverstone in the three videos, filmmaker Amy Heckerling decided to cast her in the coming-of-age comedy \"Clueless\", in the role of Cher Horowitz, a sweet but spoiled girl living in Beverly Hills. \"Clueless\" became a hit and critical darling during the summer of 1995, and as a result, Silverstone signed a deal with Columbia-TriStar valued between $8 and $10 million. As part of the package, she got a three-year first-look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions. Silverstone also won Best Female Performance and Most Desirable Female at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards, plus awards from Blockbuster Entertainment Award, Kids' Choice Awards, National Board of Review and an American Comedy Award for her performance in the film.\nSilverstone had three other film releases in 1995\u2014\"Le Nouveau monde\", \"Hideaway\" and \"The Babysitter\". \"Le Nouveau monde,\" which is a French drama about Americans, saw her play the love interest of a French boy.

Her next role was Barbara Wilson/Batgirl in \"Batman &amp; Robin\" (1997). Budgeted at $160 million, the film grossed a modest $238 million worldwide, and her turn as Batgirl received polarized reviews from critics, who also considered the film to be one of the worst films of all time. Silverstone won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress, but received a Blimp Award at the Kids' Choice Awards for the role.\nAlso in 1997, the first film by Silverstone's production company, \"Excess Baggage\", was released. In the film, she plays a neglected young woman who stages her own kidnapping to get her wealthy father's attention, only to actually be kidnapped by a car thief. The film only grossed $14.5 million in North America, and received mediocre reviews from critics; Roger Ebert mentioned that she was \"no better than OK\" as he felt that she was miscast. Silverstone starred as the female lead in the romantic comedy \"Blast from the Past\" (1999), directed by Hugh Wilson and co-starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. Critical response towards the film was mixed, while it made a modest $40 million globally.\n2000s.\nFor the next decade, Silverstone stepped aside from the spotlight and opted to focus on smaller-scale films and theater. In \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (2000), a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, directed by Kenneth Branagh, Silverstone played the Princess of France, a role which required her to sing and dance. While critical response was mixed, the film received a limited theatrical release. Film critic James Berardinelli felt that Silverstone, \"while not completely at ease with all of her dialogue, is surprisingly credible\" in her portrayal.\nSilverstone executive produced and provided the voice of Sharon Spitz, the lead part, in the Canadian animated television series \"Braceface\", from 2001 to 2003. During this period, she played the bassist of a rock band in the independent comedy \"Global Heresy\" (2002), opposite Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright, and made her Broadway debut alongside Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in a stage version of \"The Graduate\", which ran between 2002 and 2003 at the Plymouth Theatre.

The show was canceled after only 11 episodes had aired, and \"Variety\" in its review for the show, wrote: \"It's a shame that she's stuck with such wafer-thin material here, because Silverstone is undoubtedly a fun, perky presence on the small screen.\" Nevertheless, she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy.\nIn 2004, Silverstone played a news reporter turned villainess in \"\", opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Despite a negative critical response, the film grossed $181 million at the international box office.\nIn the comedy \"Beauty Shop\" (2005), a spinoff of the Barbershop film franchise, Silverstone appeared with Queen Latifah, playing a naive and bubbly stylist of an Atlanta-area salon.

Silverstone did a pilot episode in 2005 with Fox called \"Queen B\", where she played a delusional former high school prom queen, but it was not picked up for production. In 2006, she starred in an ABC pilot called \"Pink Collar\" as a woman working in a law firm, but like \"Queen B\", this pilot was not picked up to series.\nSilverstone portrayed the close friend of a teenager turned secret agent in the action-spy film \"Stormbreaker\" (2006), directed by Geoffrey Sax and co-starring Alex Pettyfer, Ewan McGregor and Mickey Rourke. Despite a $40 million budget, the film made $23 million worldwide and was largely dismissed by critics. \"USA Today\" described Silverstone as \"simply ghastly\" in her role, while \"View London\" remarked that there was \"strong support\" from the actress. She obtained the role of a single mother returning to her hometown after a lengthy absence in the made-for-Hallmark Hall of Fame television film \"Candles on Bay Street\", based on the book by Cathie Pelletier.\nSilverstone continued her theater work, next appearing in David Mamet's \"Boston Marriage\" (2007), a play exploring the relationship between two upper-class women, where the actress played what was described by \"Los Angeles Times\" as the \"clueless and hyper-emotional Scottish maid\" of one of them. The production was presented at the Geffen Playhouse theater in Los Angeles, with \"Variety\" writing that Silverstone \"steals the show [in her role]. Her Scottish accent is good, her comic delivery is fresh, and she gets the maximum laugh value from each wobbly curtsey. Her character is the one thing in the show that Mamet gets absolutely right, although she is used a bit repetitively.\" In the same year, she starred as a secretary in the theater production \"Speed-the-Plow\", a satire of Hollywood executives. The production, presented at Geffen Playhouse, was directed by Randall Arney and penned by David Mamet. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" concluded the play was \"fueled\" by \"a spectacular tour de force\" from Silverstone.\nIn 2008, Silverstone filmed another unaired ABC pilot alongside Megan Mullally called \"Bad Mother's Handbook\" and made a cameo appearance in the action-comedy \"Tropic Thunder\". In 2009, she starred in the music video for Rob Thomas's single \"Her Diamonds\", and acted in Donald Margulies' production of \"Time Stands Still\", set in Brooklyn and revolving around the relationships of two couples.

In 2010, she reprised her role in the Broadway production of \"Time Stands Still\", alongside Laura Linney. Daniel Sullivan directed the play, and described Silverstone as \"a breath of fresh air\" which had a general positive reception among critics. \"The New York Times\" felt that Silverstone \"brings warmth, actorly intelligence, and delicate humor.\" She filmed a small segment in the independent comedy sequel \"Elektra Luxx\" (2010), but her part was not included in the final cut of the film.\nSilverstone obtained the role of the teacher of a Manhattan private-school senior in the teen romance drama \"The Art of Getting By\" (2011), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The ensemble comedy \"Butter\" (2011) saw her play the adoptive mother of a 12-year-old African-American girl who enters a local butter sculpturing competition in a small Iowa town. The film screened on the film festival circuit and was distributed in a limited release. She reunited with \"Clueless\" director Amy Heckerling in the independent film \"Vamps\" (2012), playing one of two vampires who fall in love and face a choice that could jeopardize their immortality. She was offered the role after Heckerling came to see her in \"Time Stands Still\". Despite a very limited release, \"Variety\" found the film to be \"a refreshing change of pace [...] with an irresistible cast\".\nSilverstone guest-starred in \"Childrens Hospital\" (2011) and obtained a four-episode role in the first season of \"Suburgatory\" (2012), reuniting with her \"Clueless\" castmate Jeremy Sisto. In 2012, Silverstone returned to Broadway in the production of \"The Performers\", a comedic performance set at the Adult Film Award in Las Vegas.

In 2014, Silverstone took on the role of a self-absorbed mother in the rural environment in the coming-of-age drama \"Angels in Stardust\", and her \"Kind Life\" follow-up book, \"The Kind Mama\", was published.\nIn 2015, Silverstone starred in the New York production of \"Of Good Stock\", a play revolving around a group of siblings who gather at their family home for a summer weekend. \"Entertainment Weekly\" remarked that she was \"magnetic even as an engaged narcissist, ditzy\" sister; however, \"The New York Times\" felt that her role was \"the most cartoonish of the characters and a thankless part for [Silverstone], who tips into comic shrillness here\". She appeared in the romantic comedy \"Who Gets the Dog?\" (2016), opposite Ryan Kwanten portraying a divorcing couple fighting over custody of their beloved dog. The production went straight to DVD. Her next film appearance was in the independent biographical drama \"King Cobra\" (2016), as the mother of gay film actor Brent Corrigan.\nIn 2016's \"Catfight\", Silverstone played the love interest of an outsider artist having a bitter lifetime rivalry with a wealthy housewife.

Silverstone starred in three 2017 films\u2014\"\", \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\", and \"The Tribes of Palos Verdes\"\u2014and filmed the television series \"American Woman\" in July of that year. On her busy workload, she remarked: \"[T]hey were all happening at the same time. Everybody worked together. Yorgos [the \"Sacred Dee\" director] helped us to push my date and \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" held the movie for a week or two for me\". The comedy \"The Long Haul\", the fourth film in the \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" film series, saw her portray the clueless and loving mother of the titular character, replacing Rachael Harris. The film was widely disliked and criticized by critics for the recasting of the main characters and its story development, and while \"The Long Haul\" made a modest $40.1 million worldwide, it emerged as Silverstone's most widely seen film since \"Beauty Shop\" (2005).\nIn the psychological thriller \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\", directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and co-starring Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman, Silverstone took on the role of a widow and the mother of a mysterious boy who befriends his late father's cardiac surgeon. The film competed for the at the 70th Cannes Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Casting director Francine Maisler chose Silverstone after seeing her star in a previous play; her two-scene appearance was filmed in one day, and she remarked of the filming: \"[I]t was just so wonderful. When you admire something so much, it's a little bit hard to imagine how you fit into it\". In the independent coming-of-age drama \"The Tribes of Palos Verdes\", she reunited with her \"Butter\" co-star Jennifer Garner, playing a real-estate agent living in Palos Verdes, an affluent, coastal suburb of Los Angeles.

{"id": "69931", "revid": "1291458195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69931", "title": "Liza of Lambeth", "text": "1897 novel by William Somerset Maugham\nLiza of Lambeth (1897) was W. Somerset Maugham's first novel, which he wrote while he was a medical student and obstetric clerk at St Thomas's Hospital in Lambeth, then a working-class district of London. It depicts the short life and death of Liza Kemp, an 18-year-old factory worker who lives with her aging mother in the fictional Vere Street off Westminster Bridge Road (real) in Lambeth.\nPlot summary.\nThe action covers a period of roughly four months\u2014from August to November\u2014in a year in the 1890s. Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of a large family, now living alone with her aging mother. Very popular with all the residents of Vere Street, Lambeth, she likes Tom, a boy her age, but not as much as he likes her, so she rejects him when he proposes. Nevertheless, she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip (in a horse-drawn coach, of course) to Chingford, then on the northern outskirts of London, on the August Bank Holiday Monday. Some of the other members of the party are Tom; Liza's friend Sally and her boyfriend Harry; and Jim Blakeston, a 40-year-old father of 5 who has recently moved to Vere Street with his large family, and his wife (while their eldest daughter, Polly, is taking care of her siblings). The outing is fun, and they all get drunk on beer. On their way back in the dark, Liza realises that Jim is making a pass at her by holding her hand. Back home, Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her.\nLiza feels attracted to Jim. They never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of Vere Street or their workmates to start talking about them. One of Jim's first steps to win Liza's heart is to go to a melodramatic play with her on Saturday night. Afterwards, they have sex. When autumn arrives and the nights get chillier, Liza's secret meetings with Jim become less comfortable and more trying; they must meet in the third-class waiting-room of Waterloo station. To Liza's dismay, people do start talking about them despite their precautions. Only Liza's mother, a drunkard and a simple person, doesn't know about their affair. After Sally gets married, she soon becomes pregnant. With Sally married and stuck at home, and even Tom seemingly shunning her, Liza feels increasingly isolated, but her love for Jim keeps her going. They do talk about their love affair: about the possibility of Jim leaving his wife and children (\"I dunno if I could get on without the kids\"); about Liza not being able to leave her mother, who needs her help; about living somewhere else \"as if we was married\". Soon the situation deteriorates completely; Mrs Blakeston, who is pregnant again, opposes Jim's affair with Liza by refusing to talk to him, then goes around telling other people what she would do with Liza if she caught her, and those people inform Liza, who is frightened. One Saturday afternoon in November, Liza is on her way home from work when the angry Mrs. Blakeston confronts her, spits in her face, and physically attacks her. Quickly a crowd gathers, not to abate the fight, but to abet it. (\"The audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands.\")\nEventually, both Tom and Jim stop the fight, and Tom walks Liza home. Liza is now publicly stigmatised as a \"wrong one\", a fact she herself admits to Tom (\"Oh, but I 'ave treated yer bad. I'm a regular wrong 'un, I am\"). Tom wants to marry Liza, but she tells him that \"it's too lite now\" because she thinks she is pregnant. Tom says he wouldn't mind that, but she insists on refusing. Meanwhile, at the Blakestons' house, Jim beats his wife. Other residents hear them and young Polly appeals to some for help, but they choose not to interfere in other people's domestic problems (\"She'll git over it; an' p'raps she deserves it, for all you know\"). When Mrs Kemp comes home and sees her daughter's injuries, all she does is offer her some alcohol (whiskey or gin). That evening they both get drunk. During the next night Liza has a miscarriage. Mr Hodges, who lives upstairs, fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital, who soon says he can do nothing for her. While her daughter is dying, Mrs Kemp has a long talk with Mrs Hodges, a midwife and sick-nurse. Liza's last visitor is Jim, but Liza is already in a coma. Mrs Kemp and Mrs Hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear Liza's death rattle and the doctor declares her dead.\nTheatrical adaptations.\nA musical based \u2013 albeit loosely \u2013 on the novel was written by Willie Rushton and Berny Stringle, with music by Cliff Adams. It opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in June 1976, and ran for 110 performances. It was produced by Ben Arbeid, directed by Berny Stringle, musically directed by John Burrows, and starred Angela Richards (best known as a regular in the BBC's \"Secret Army\") in the title role, Patricia Hayes, Ron Pember, Bryan Marshall, Christopher Neil, Tina Martin, Michael Robbins and Eric Shilling.\nThe musical style is predominantly music hall, but the show includes a parody of Gilbert and Sullivan, a church choir arrangement with some completely incongruous lyrics (\"A Little Bit on the Side\"), and some touching ballads.\n\"The Tart with a Heart of Gold\" was cut from the West End production, and is also missing from the original London cast recording (Thames THA 100), despite it describing the entire \"raison d'\u00eatre\" of one of the main female characters.\nThe musical has not been officially published for amateur performance, but it is occasionally licensed for amateurs. The world amateur premiere was performed at the Erith Playhouse in Erith, Kent, in June 1977, and was attended by members of the London production team. The rights to this musical are currently held by Thames Music in London.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All four boats are based at HM Naval Base Clyde (HMS \"Neptune\"), west of Glasgow, Scotland.\nSince the decommissioning of the Royal Air Force WE.177 free-fall thermonuclear weapons during March 1998, the four \"Vanguard\" submarines are the sole platforms for the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons.

The Polaris missile was supplied to Britain following the terms of the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement. This nuclear deterrent system was known as the UK Polaris programme. In the early 1980s the British government began studies examining options for replacing the \"Resolution\"-class submarines and their Polaris missiles, both of which would be approaching the end of their service lives within little over a decade. On 24 January 1980, the House of Commons backed government policy, by 308 votes to 52, to retain an independent nuclear deterrent. Options that were examined included:\nA European solution and the US UGM-73 Poseidon were also briefly considered, but ultimately rejected, primarily on capability, cost and uncertainty grounds. The clear favourite was the UGM-96 Trident I, which as well as being a cost-effective solution \u2013 given the US would also operate the missile in vast numbers \u2013 also delivered the overall best long-term capability insurances against Soviet advancements in ballistic missile defence. Subsequently, on 10 July 1980, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to US President Jimmy Carter requesting the purchase of Trident I missiles on a similar basis as the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement. However, following the acceleration of the US UGM-133 Trident II missiles, Thatcher wrote to US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 requesting the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the improved system instead. An agreement was made in March 1982 between the two countries, and under the agreement, Britain made a 5% research and development contribution.\nDesign and construction.\nThe \"Vanguard\" class were designed in the early 1980s by the Ministry of Defence, acting in one of its last Royal Navy warship design authority roles. The guidance drawings were then supplied for detailed design development by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL) based at Barrow-in-Furness, now BAE Systems Maritime \u2013 Submarines. They were designed from the outset as nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, able to accommodate the UGM-133 Trident II missiles. As such, the missile compartment is based on the same system used on the American , which is also equipped with the UGM-133 Trident II. This requirement led to the \"Vanguard\"-class design being significantly larger than the previous Polaris-equipped \"Resolution\" class, and at nearly 16,000 tonnes they are the largest submarines ever built for the Royal Navy.\nDue to the large size of the \"Vanguard\"-class, the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness was built between 1982 and 1986 specifically for the construction of the boats.\nBeginning in 1985, both HMNB Clyde and the Royal Naval Armaments Depot Coulport at Faslane underwent extensive redevelopment in preparation for the \"Vanguard\" class submarines and Trident II missiles. Rosyth dockyard also underwent significant redevelopment. The work included enhanced \"handling, storage, armament processing, berthing, docking, engineering, training and refitting facilities\" at an estimates cost of \u00a3550 million.\nMargaret Thatcher laid the keel of the first boat, HMS \"Vanguard\", on 3 September 1986 at the Devonshire Dock Hall. \"Vanguard\" was launched in 1992 and commissioned in 1993. The year 1992 saw a debate over whether the fourth vessel, \"Vengeance\", should be cancelled; however, the government ultimately ordered it in July 1992 and she was commissioned in 1999.\nReplacement.\nThe Vanguard class had an originally intended service life of 25 years. This would put the retirement dates for the class at 2018, 2020, 2021, 2024.\nOn 4 December 2006, then Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed plans to spend up to \u00a320\u00a0billion on a new generation of ballistic missile submarines to replace the \"Vanguard\" class. In order to reduce costs and show Britain's commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Blair suggested that submarine numbers could be cut from four to three, while the number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20% to 160. On 23 September 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed that this reduction to three submarines was still under consideration. In February 2011, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox stated that four submarines would be needed if the UK was to retain a credible nuclear deterrent. On 18 May 2011 the British government approved the initial assessment phase for the construction of a new class of four submarines, paving the way for the ordering of the first long-lead items and preparations for the main build to begin in the future. This new class of submarine, now known as the \"Dreadnought\" class, will retain the current Trident II missiles, and will incorporate a new 'PWR3' nuclear reactor as well as technology developed for the nuclear-powered fleet submarines of the Royal Navy.\nA vote on the Trident renewal programme was held in the House of Commons on 18 July 2016, and determined that the UK should proceed with construction of the next generation of submarines. The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels at \u00a331\u00a0billion (plus a contingency fund of \u00a310\u00a0billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2\u00a0per\u00a0cent of government spending, or 6\u00a0per\u00a0cent of defence spending, every year. It is expected the new fleet of submarines will come into operation starting 2028 at the earliest and certainly by the 2030s. The \"Dreadnought\" class will extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.\nCharacteristics.\nWeapons and systems.\nThe \"Vanguard\"-class submarines are equipped with 16 ballistic missile tubes. However, as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Royal Navy loads only eight of the missile tubes with the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles, each armed with up to eight nuclear warheads. In addition to the missile tubes, the submarines are fitted with four 21\u00a0inch (533\u00a0mm) torpedo tubes and carry the Spearfish heavyweight torpedo, allowing them to engage submerged or surface targets at ranges up to . Two SSE Mark 10 launchers are also fitted, allowing the boats to deploy Type 2066 and Type 2071 decoys, and a UAP Mark 3 electronic support measures (ESM) intercept system is carried.\nThe submarines carry the Thales Underwater Systems Type 2054 composite sonar. The Type 2054 is a multi-mode, multi-frequency system, which incorporates the 2046, 2043 and 2082 sonars. The Type 2043 is a hull-mounted active/passive search sonar, the Type 2082 a passive intercept and ranging sonar, and the Type 2046 a towed array sonar operating at very low frequency providing a passive search capability. The fleet is in the process of having the sonars refitted to include open-architecture processing using commercial off-the-shelf technology. Navigational search capability is provided by a Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. They will also be fitted with the new Common Combat System. Two periscopes are carried, a CK51 search model and a CH91 attack model. Both have TV and thermal imaging cameras in addition to conventional optics.\nA specialised Submarine Command System (SMCS) was originally developed for the \"Vanguard\" boats and was later used on the .\nPropulsion.\nA new pressurised water reactor, the Rolls-Royce PWR 2, was designed for the \"Vanguard\" class. The PWR 2 has double the service life of previous models, and it is estimated that a \"Vanguard\"-class submarine could circumnavigate the world 40 times without refuelling. Furthermore, during their long-overhaul refit periods, a 'Core H' reactor is fitted to each of the boats, ensuring that none of the submarines will require further re-fuelling for the rest of their service lives. The reactor drives two GEC steam turbines linked to a single shaft pump jet propulsor, giving the submarines a maximum submerged speed of over . Auxiliary power is provided by a pair of 6\u00a0MW steam-turbine generators supplied by WH Allen, (later known as NEI Allen, Allen Power &amp; Rolls-Royce), and two 905 kWb Paxman diesel generators for provision of backup power supply.\nNuclear warheads.\nBritish nuclear weapons are designed and developed by the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment. The boats are capable of deploying with a maximum of 192 independently targetable warheads, or MIRVs, with immediate readiness to fire. However, as a result of a decision taken by the 1998 Strategic Defence Review this was reduced to 48 warheads with a readiness to fire reduced 'to days rather than minutes'. Furthermore, the total number of warheads maintained by the United Kingdom was reduced to approximately 200, with a total of 58 Trident missiles. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced this number further and the submarines will put to sea in future with a reduced total of 40 warheads and a reduced missile load of 8 (from a maximum possible 16). The number of operationally available nuclear warheads is to be reduced 'from fewer than 160 to no more than 120 and the total UK nuclear weapon stockpile will number no more than 180. The warheads, named Holbrook, use the Mark 4A aeroshell, and have a yield of 100kt. It is thought to be technically similar to the American W76 warhead, with which it shares its aeroshell and some non-nuclear components.\nOn 16 March 2021 Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his government's 10-year plan to boost international trade and deploy soft power around the world with an aspiration of creating a \"Global Britain\". In a document called \"Global Britain in a competitive age\", this plan raised the cap on the number of nuclear warheads aboard the Royal Navy's Trident submarines from 180 to 260. The document also vowed to maintain a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines so Britain would always have one at sea. Information of number of deployed warheads and missiles would also no longer be provided following the 2021 Integrated Review, under a policy of \"deliberate ambiguity\".\nIn fiction.\nThe 2021 BBC TV series \"Vigil\" is set on board a fictional \"Vanguard\"-class submarine named HMS \"Vigil\". Further boats of the class named HMS \"Virtue\", HMS \"Vanquish\" along with the real HMS \"Vanguard\" are mentioned.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his essays and his associations with other men of letters.\nLife and career.\nIsaac was born in Enfield, Middlesex, England, the only child of Benjamin D'Israeli, a Sephardic Jewish merchant who had immigrated from Cento, Italy, in 1748, and his second wife, Sarah Syprut de Gabay Villa Real. Isaac received much of his education in Leiden. At the age of 16, he began his literary career with some verses addressed to Samuel Johnson. He became a frequent guest at the table of the publisher John Murray and became one of the noted bibliophiles of the time.\nIn 1797 D'Israeli published \"Vaurien\", a romantic novel set in radical circles following the French Revolution. Conservative commentators praised the book for its mockery of radicals in England and depiction of Vaurien, who has come from France to foment revolution. Yet they were perturbed by his depiction of a prostitute, who is kindly and was forced into prostitution to feed her family after her husband was ruined by a litigious neighbour for stealing an apple. Moreover, they were shocked by a chapter in which Disraeli launched a staunch defence of the Jewish community condemning the way Jews were treated in England.\nOn 10 February 1802, D'Israeli married Maria Basevi, who came from another London merchant family of Italian-Jewish descent. The marriage was a happy one, producing five children: Sarah (\"Sa\"; 1802\u20131859); Benjamin (\"Ben\" or \"Dizzy\"; 1804\u20131881); Naphtali (b. 1807, died in infancy); Raphael (\"Ralph\"; 1809\u20131898); and Jacobus (\"James\" or \"Jem\"; 1813\u20131868). The children were named according to Jewish customs and the boys were all circumcised. Religiously, however, Isaac D'Israeli appears to have set aside his Jewish beliefs. In the midst of an eight-year dispute with the Bevis Marks Synagogue and on the advice of his friend, historian Sharon Turner, all his children were baptised into the Church of England in 1817. In 1833 he published a severely critical analysis of contemporary Judaism, \"The Genius of Judaism\". He himself did not receive baptism, however, and never indicated any desire to exchange Judaism for Christianity. He did attend the inauguration ceremonies of the Reform Synagogue at Burton Street, London.\nHe penned a handful of English adaptations of traditional tales from the Middle East, wrote a few historical biographies, and published a number of poems. His most popular work was a collection of essays entitled \"Curiosities of Literature\". The work contained myriad anecdotes about historical persons and events, unusual books, and the habits of book-collectors. The work was very popular and sold widely in the 19th century, reaching its eleventh edition (the last to be revised by the author) in 1839. It was still in print when the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" entry was written in 1911. His book \"The Life and Reign of Charles I\" (1828) resulted in his being awarded the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford.\nD\u2019Israeli also published \"Calamities of Authors\" (1812) within his Miscellanies. \nIn 1841, he became blind and, though he underwent an operation, his sight was not restored. He continued writing with his daughter as his amanuensis. In this way he produced \"Amenities of Literature\" (1841) and completed the revision of his work on Charles I. He died of influenza at age 81, at his home, Bradenham House, in Buckinghamshire, less than a year after the death of his wife in the spring of 1847.\nD'Israeli's daughter-in-law, the wife of his eldest son, Benjamin, erected a monument to him in June 1862 following his death. It stands on a hill near Hughenden Manor, the Disraelis' country house in Buckinghamshire.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69937", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69937", "title": "Nuclear pulse propulsion", "text": "Hypothetical spacecraft propulsion through continuous nuclear explosions for thrust\nNuclear pulse propulsion or external pulsed plasma propulsion is a hypothetical method of spacecraft propulsion that uses nuclear explosions for thrust. It originated as Project \"Orion\" with support from DARPA, after a suggestion by Stanislaw Ulam in 1947. Newer designs using inertial confinement fusion have been the baseline for most later designs, including Project \"Daedalus\" and Project \"Longshot\".\nHistory.\nLos Alamos.\nCalculations for a potential use of this technology were made at the laboratory from and toward the close of the 1940s to the mid-1950s.\nProject Orion.\nProject Orion was the first serious attempt to design a nuclear pulse rocket. A design was formed at General Atomics during the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the idea of reacting small directional nuclear explosives utilizing a variant of the Teller\u2013Ulam two-stage bomb design against a large steel pusher plate attached to the spacecraft with shock absorbers. Efficient directional explosives maximized the momentum transfer, leading to specific impulses in the range of seconds, or about thirteen times that of the Space Shuttle main engine. With refinements a theoretical maximum specific impulse of (1 MN\u00b7s/kg) might be possible. Thrusts were in the millions of tons, allowing spacecraft larger than 8\u00d7106 tons to be built with 1958 materials.\nThe reference design was to be constructed of steel using submarine-style construction with a crew of more than 200 and a vehicle takeoff weight of several thousand tons. This single-stage reference design would reach Mars and return in four weeks from the Earth's surface (compared to 12 months for NASA's current chemically powered reference mission). The same craft could visit Saturn's moons in a seven-month mission (compared to chemically powered missions of about nine years). Notable engineering problems that occurred were related to crew shielding and pusher-plate lifetime.\nAlthough the system appeared to be workable, the project was shut down in 1965, primarily because the Partial Test Ban Treaty made it illegal; in fact, before the treaty, the US and Soviet Union had already separately detonated a combined number of at least nine nuclear bombs, including thermonuclear, in space, i.e., at altitudes of over 100\u00a0km (see high-altitude nuclear explosions). Ethical issues complicated the launch of such a vehicle within the Earth's magnetosphere: calculations using the (disputed) linear no-threshold model of radiation damage showed that the fallout from each takeoff would cause the death of approximately 1 to 10 individuals. In a threshold model, such extremely low levels of thinly distributed radiation would have no associated ill-effects, while under hormesis models, such tiny doses would be negligibly beneficial. The use of less efficient clean nuclear bombs for achieving orbit and then more efficient, higher yield dirtier bombs for travel would significantly reduce the amount of fallout caused from an Earth-based launch.\nOne useful mission would be to deflect an asteroid or comet on collision course with the Earth, depicted dramatically in the 1998 film \"Deep Impact\". The high performance would permit even a late launch to succeed, and the vehicle could effectively transfer a large amount of kinetic energy to the asteroid by simple impact. The prospect of an imminent asteroid impact would obviate concerns over the few predicted deaths from fallout. An automated mission would remove the challenge of designing a shock absorber that would protect the crew.\nOrion is one of very few interstellar space drives that could theoretically be constructed with available technology, as discussed in a 1968 paper, \"Interstellar Transport\" by Freeman Dyson.\nProject Daedalus.\nProject Daedalus was a study conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the British Interplanetary Society (BIS) to design an interstellar uncrewed spacecraft that could reach a nearby star within about 50 years. A dozen scientists and engineers led by Alan Bond worked on the project. At the time fusion research appeared to be making great strides, and in particular, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) appeared to be adaptable as a rocket engine.\nICF uses small pellets of fusion fuel, typically lithium deuteride (6Li2H) with a small deuterium/tritium trigger at the center. The pellets are thrown into a reaction chamber where they are hit on all sides by lasers or another form of beamed energy. The heat generated by the beams explosively compresses the pellet to the point where fusion takes place. The result is a hot plasma, and a very small \"explosion\" compared to the minimum size bomb that would be required to instead create the necessary amount of fission.\nFor Daedalus, this process was to be run within a large electromagnet that formed the rocket engine. After the reaction, ignited by electron beams, the magnet funnelled the hot gas to the rear for thrust. Some of the energy was diverted to run the ship's systems and engine. In order to make the system safe and energy efficient, Daedalus was to be powered by a helium-3 fuel collected from Jupiter.\n\"Medusa\".\nThe \"Medusa\" design has more in common with solar sails than with conventional rockets. It was envisioned by Johndale Solem in the 1990s and published in the \"Journal of the British Interplanetary Society\" (JBIS).\nA \"Medusa\" spacecraft would deploy a large sail ahead of it, attached by independent cables, and then launch nuclear explosives forward to detonate between itself and its sail. The sail would be accelerated by the plasma and photonic impulse, running out the tethers as when a fish flees a fisher, generating electricity at the \"reel\". The spacecraft would use some of the generated electricity to reel itself up toward the sail, constantly smoothly accelerating as it goes.\nIn the original design, multiple tethers connected to multiple motor generators. The advantage over the single tether is to increase the distance between the explosion and the tethers, thus reducing damage to the tethers.\nFor heavy payloads, performance could be improved by taking advantage of lunar materials, for example, wrapping the explosive with lunar rock or water, stored previously at a stable Lagrange point.\n\"Medusa\" performs better than the classical Orion design because its sail intercepts more of the explosive impulse, its shock-absorber stroke is much longer, and its major structures are in tension and hence can be quite lightweight. \"Medusa\"-type ships would be capable of a specific impulse of (500 to 1000\u00a0kN\u00b7s/kg).\n\"Medusa\" became widely known to the public in the BBC documentary film \"To Mars By A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion\". A short film shows an artist's conception of how the \"Medusa\" spacecraft works \"by throwing bombs into a sail that's ahead of it\".\nProject Longshot.\nProject Longshot was a NASA-sponsored research project carried out in conjunction with the US Naval Academy in the late 1980s. \"Longshot\" was in some ways a development of the basic Daedalus concept, in that it used magnetically funneled ICF. The key difference was that they felt that the reaction could not power both the rocket and the other systems, and instead included a 300\u00a0kW conventional nuclear reactor for running the ship. The added weight of the reactor reduced performance somewhat, but even using LiD fuel it would be able to reach neighboring star Alpha Centauri in 100 years (approx. velocity of 13,411\u00a0km/s, at a distance of 4.5 light years, equivalent to 4.5% of light speed).\nAntimatter-catalyzed nuclear reaction.\nIn the mid-1990s, research at Pennsylvania State University led to the concept of using antimatter to catalyze nuclear reactions. Antiprotons would react inside the nucleus of uranium, releasing energy that breaks the nucleus apart as in conventional nuclear reactions. Even a small number of such reactions can start the chain reaction that would otherwise require a much larger volume of fuel to sustain. Whereas the \"normal\" critical mass for plutonium is about 11.8 kilograms (for a sphere at standard density), with antimatter catalyzed reactions this could be well under one gram.\nSeveral rocket designs using this reaction were proposed, some which would use all-fission reactions for interplanetary missions, and others using fission-fusion (effectively a very small version of Orion's bombs) for interstellar missions.\nMagneto-inertial fusion.\nNASA funded MSNW LLC and the University of Washington in 2011 to study and develop a fusion rocket through the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts NIAC Program.\nThe rocket uses a form of magneto-inertial fusion to produce a direct thrust fusion rocket. Magnetic fields cause large metal rings to collapse around the deuterium-tritium plasma, triggering fusion. The energy heats and ionizes the shell of metal formed by the crushed rings. The hot ionized metal is shot out of a magnetic rocket nozzle at a high speed (up to 30\u00a0km/s). Repeating this process roughly every minute would accelerate or decelerate the spacecraft. The fusion reaction is not self-sustaining and requires electrical energy to explode each pulse. With electrical requirements estimated to be between 100\u00a0kW to 1,000\u00a0kW (300\u00a0kW average), designs incorporate solar panels to produce the required energy.\nFoil Liner Compression creates fusion at the proper energy scale. The proof of concept experiment in Redmond, Washington, was to use aluminum liners for compression. However, the ultimate design was to use lithium liners.\nPerformance characteristics are dependent on the fusion energy gain factor achieved by the reactor. Gains were expected to be between 20 and 200, with an estimated average of 40. Higher gains produce higher exhaust velocity, higher specific impulse and lower electrical power requirements. The table below summarizes different performance characteristics for a theoretical 90-day Mars transfer at gains of 20, 40, and 200.\nBy April 2013, MSNW had demonstrated subcomponents of the systems: heating deuterium plasma up to fusion temperatures and concentrating the magnetic fields needed to create fusion. They planned to put the two technologies together for a test before the end of 2013.\nPulsed fission-fusion propulsion.\nPulsed fission-fusion (PuFF) propulsion is reliant on principles similar to magneto-inertial fusion. It aims to solve the problem of the extreme stress induced on containment by an Orion-like motor by ejecting the plasma obtained from small fuel pellets that undergo autocatalytic fission and fusion reactions initiated by a Z-pinch. It is a theoretical propulsion system researched through the NIAC Program by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It is in essence a fusion rocket that uses a Z-pinch configuration, but coupled with a fission reaction to boost the fusion process.\nA PuFF fuel pellet, around 1\u00a0cm in diameter, consists of two components: A deuterium-tritium (D-T) cylinder of plasma, called the \"target\", which undergoes fusion, and a surrounding U-235 sheath that undergoes fission enveloped by a lithium liner. Liquid lithium, serving as a moderator, fills the space between the D-T cylinder and the uranium sheath. Current is run through the liquid lithium, a Lorentz force is generated which then compresses the D-T plasma by a factor of 10 in what is known as a Z-pinch. The compressed plasma reaches criticality and undergoes fusion reactions. However, the fusion energy gain (\"Q\") of these reactions is far below breakeven (\"Q\" &lt; 1), meaning that the reaction consumes more energy than it produces.\nIn a PuFF design, the fast neutrons released by the initial fusion reaction induce fission in the U-235 sheath. The resultant heat causes the sheath to expand, increasing its implosion velocity onto the D-T core and compressing it further, releasing more fast neutrons. Those again amplify the fission rate in the sheath, rendering the process autocatalytic. It is hoped that this results in a complete burn up of both the fission and fusion fuels, making PuFF more efficient than other nuclear pulse concepts. Much like in a magneto-inertial fusion rocket, the performance of the engine is dependent on the degree to which the fusion gain of the D-T target is increased.\nOne \"pulse\" consist of the injection of a fuel pellet into the combustion chamber, its consumption through a series of fission-fusion reactions, and finally the ejection of the released plasma through a magnetic nozzle, thus generating thrust. A single pulse is expected to take only a fraction of a second to complete.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are named elliptic functions because they come from elliptic integrals. Those integrals are in turn named elliptic because they first were encountered for the calculation of the arc length of an ellipse.\nImportant elliptic functions are Jacobi elliptic functions and the Weierstrass formula_1-function.\nFurther development of this theory led to hyperelliptic functions and modular forms.\nDefinition.\nA meromorphic function is called an elliptic function, if there are two formula_2-linear independent complex numbers formula_3 such that\n formula_4 and formula_5.\nSo elliptic functions have two periods and are therefore doubly periodic functions.\nPeriod lattice and fundamental domain.\nIf formula_6 is an elliptic function with periods formula_7 it also holds that\n formula_8\nfor every linear combination formula_9 with formula_10.\nThe abelian group\n formula_11\nis called the \"period lattice\".\nThe parallelogram generated by formula_12and formula_13\n formula_14\nis a \"fundamental domain\" of formula_15 acting on formula_16.\nGeometrically the complex plane is tiled with parallelograms. Everything that happens in one fundamental domain repeats in all the others. For that reason we can view elliptic function as functions with the quotient group formula_17 as their domain. This quotient group, called an elliptic curve, can be visualised as a parallelogram where opposite sides are identified, which topologically is a torus.\nLiouville's theorems.\nThe following three theorems are known as \"Liouville's theorems (1847).\"\n1st theorem.\nA holomorphic elliptic function is constant.\nThis is the original form of Liouville's theorem and can be derived from it. A holomorphic elliptic function is bounded since it takes on all of its values on the fundamental domain which is compact. So it is constant by Liouville's theorem.\n2nd theorem.\nEvery elliptic function has finitely many poles in formula_17 and the sum of its residues is zero.\nThis theorem implies that there is no elliptic function not equal to zero with exactly one pole of order one or exactly one zero of order one in the fundamental domain.\n3rd theorem.\nA non-constant elliptic function takes on every value the same number of times in formula_17 counted with multiplicity.\nWeierstrass \u2118-function.\nOne of the most important elliptic functions is the Weierstrass formula_1-function. For a given period lattice formula_15 it is defined by\n formula_22\nIt is constructed in such a way that it has a pole of order two at every lattice point. The term formula_23 is there to make the series convergent.\nformula_1 is an even elliptic function; that is, formula_25.\nIts derivative\n formula_26\nis an odd function, i.e. formula_27\nOne of the main results of the theory of elliptic functions is the following: Every elliptic function with respect to a given period lattice formula_15 can be expressed as a rational function in terms of formula_1 and formula_30.\nThe formula_1-function satisfies the differential equation\n formula_32\nwhere formula_33 and formula_34 are constants that depend on formula_15. More precisely, formula_36 and formula_37, where formula_38 and formula_39 are so called Eisenstein series.\nIn algebraic language, the field of elliptic functions is isomorphic to the field\n formula_40,\nwhere the isomorphism maps formula_1 to formula_42 and formula_30 to formula_44.\nRelation to elliptic integrals.\nThe relation to elliptic integrals has mainly a historical background. Elliptic integrals had been studied by Legendre, whose work was taken on by Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi.\nAbel discovered elliptic functions by taking the inverse function formula_45 of the elliptic integral function\n formula_46\nwith formula_47.\nAdditionally he defined the functions\n formula_48\nand\n formula_49.\nAfter continuation to the complex plane they turned out to be doubly periodic and are known as Abel elliptic functions.\nJacobi elliptic functions are similarly obtained as inverse functions of elliptic integrals.\nJacobi considered the integral function\n formula_50\nand inverted it: formula_51. formula_52 stands for \"sinus amplitudinis\" and is the name of the new function. He then introduced the functions \"cosinus amplitudinis\" and \"delta amplitudinis\", which are defined as follows:\n formula_53\n formula_54.\nOnly by taking this step, Jacobi could prove his general transformation formula of elliptic integrals in 1827.\nHistory.\nShortly after the development of infinitesimal calculus the theory of elliptic functions was started by the Italian mathematician Giulio di Fagnano and the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. When they tried to calculate the arc length of a lemniscate they encountered problems involving integrals that contained the square root of polynomials of degree 3 and 4. It was clear that those so called elliptic integrals could not be solved using elementary functions. Fagnano observed an algebraic relation between elliptic integrals, what he published in 1750. Euler immediately generalized Fagnano's results and posed his algebraic addition theorem for elliptic integrals.\nExcept for a comment by Landen his ideas were not pursued until 1786, when Legendre published his paper \"M\u00e9moires sur les int\u00e9grations par arcs d\u2019ellipse\". Legendre subsequently studied elliptic integrals and called them \"elliptic functions\". Legendre introduced a three-fold classification \u2013 three kinds \u2013 which was a crucial simplification of the rather complicated theory at that time. Other important works of Legendre are: \"M\u00e9moire sur les transcendantes elliptiques\" (1792), \"Exercices de calcul int\u00e9gral\" (1811\u20131817), \"Trait\u00e9 des fonctions elliptiques\" (1825\u20131832). Legendre's work was mostly left untouched by mathematicians until 1826.\nSubsequently, Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi resumed the investigations and quickly discovered new results. At first they inverted the elliptic integral function. Following a suggestion of Jacobi in 1829 these inverse functions are now called \"elliptic functions\". One of Jacobi's most important works is \"Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum\" which was published 1829. The addition theorem Euler found was posed and proved in its general form by Abel in 1829. In those days the theory of elliptic functions and the theory of doubly periodic functions were considered to be different theories. They were brought together by Briot and Bouquet in 1856. Gauss discovered many of the properties of elliptic functions 30 years earlier but never published anything on the subject.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prize carries a symbolic reward of only 10 euros, but results in considerable recognition and book sales for the winning author. Four other prizes are also awarded: prix Goncourt du Premier Roman (first novel), prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle (short story), prix Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie (poetry) and prix Goncourt de la Biographie (biography). Of the \"big six\" French literary awards, the Prix Goncourt is the best known and most prestigious. The other major literary prizes include the , the Prix Femina, the , the Prix Interalli\u00e9 and the Prix M\u00e9dicis.\nHistory.\nEdmond de Goncourt, a successful author, critic, and publisher, bequeathed his estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt. In honour of his brother and collaborator, Jules Alfred Huot de Goncourt (1830\u20131870), the acad\u00e9mie has awarded the Prix Goncourt every December since 1903. The jury that determines the winner meets at the \"Drouant\" restaurant in November to make its decision. Notable winners of the prize include Marcel Proust (\"In Search of Lost Time\"), Simone de Beauvoir (\"The Mandarins\"), Andr\u00e9 Malraux (\"Man's Fate\") and Marguerite Duras (\"The Lover\").\nThe award was initially established to provide talented new authors with a monetary award that would allow them to write a second book. Today, the Goncourt has a token prize amount (around 10 euros), about the same amount given in 1903, and so the prestige of the prize has been explained not because of the cash-value of the prize, but \"in terms of the tremendous book sales it effects: the Goncourt winner becomes an instant millionaire.\" Herv\u00e9 Le Tellier's \"The Anomaly\", which won the Goncourt in 2020, exceeded a million copies in less than a year after its publication.\nIn 1987, the Prix Goncourt des Lyc\u00e9ens was established, as a collaboration between the acad\u00e9mie Goncourt, the French Ministry of Education, and Fnac, a book, music, and movie retailer.\nThe is announced at the same ceremony as the Prix Goncourt. It has become known as something of a second-place prize.\nControversies.\nWithin months of the first prize in 1903, it spawned a \"hostile counter-prize\" in the form of the Prix Femina to counter the all-male Jury of the Goncourt with an all-female jury on the Femina.\nSome choices have been controversial. One famous example was the awarding of the prize to Marcel Proust in 1919, which sparked public indignation since many believed that it should have gone to Roland Dorgel\u00e8s for \"Les Croix de bois\", a novel about the First World War. The prize was supposed to be awarded to promising young authors, whereas Proust was not considered \"young\" at 48 \u2013 however Proust was a beginning author which is the only eligibility requirement, age being unimportant.\nIn 1921, Rene Maran won the Goncourt with \"Batouala, veritable roman negre\", the first French novel to openly criticize European colonialism in Africa. The novel caused \"violent reactions\" and was banned in all the French colonies.\nIn 1932, the prize was controversial for passing up Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line's \"Voyage au bout de la nuit\" for Guy Mazeline's \"Les Loups\". The voting process became the basis of the 1992 book \"Goncourt 32\" by Eug\u00e8ne Saccomano.\nAlthough the award may only be given to an author once, Romain Gary won it twice, in 1956 for \"Les racines du ciel\" and again under the pseudonym \u00c9mile Ajar in 1975 for \"La vie devant soi\". The Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt awarded the prize to Ajar without knowing his real identity. A period of literary intrigue followed. Gary's cousin's son Paul Pavlowitch posed as the author for a time. Gary later revealed the truth in his posthumous book \"Vie et mort d'\u00c9mile Ajar\".\nIn September 2021, the Goncourt attracted controversy after the jury decided, by a vote of 7 to 3, to include \"Les enfants de Cadillac\" by Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on its 2021 list of finalists. Noudelmann is the partner of Camille Laurens, who is a member of the prize's jury. Laurens voted in favor of her partner's book. In October 2021, the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt ultimately decided that it will no longer allow lovers and family members of the jury to be entered for consideration.\nSelection and voting process.\nThe Prix Goncourt is divided into three selection stages. The first selection is typically composed of fifteen finalists. The second selection is typically composed of eight finalists, narrowed down from the previous fifteen. A third and final selection leaves four finalists.\nIn the voting rounds, a maximum of fourteen rounds can be carried out. To begin the deliberation process, the names of the four finalists are placed in a champagne bucket. In turn, the names are taken out and each member of the jury votes aloud in favour of, or in opposition to, the writer. An absolute majority\u2014more than half the votes cast\u2014is required until the tenth round, then a simple majority is sufficient to designate a winner. If, after fourteen rounds, there is no winner, the president's vote counts as double to determine a majority vote. At 12:45p.m., the Secretary General, currently Philippe Claudel, appears in front of the crowd of journalists and announces the winner. The winner typically waits in a cafe near the \"Drouant\" so that they can arrive in time. The winner is interviewed by the media and is offered a symbolic check for ten euros.\nOther awards.\nIn addition to the Prix Goncourt for a novel, the Academy awards four other awards, for first novel, short story, biography and poetry.\nAs of March 2009, the acad\u00e9mie changed the award name by dropping \"bourses\" (\"scholarship\") from the title. The prefix \"prix\" can be included or not, such as \"Prix Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie\" (Goncourt prize for Poetry) or \"Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie\" (Goncourt of Poetry). For example: \"Claude Vig\u00e9e was awarded a Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie in 2008\". Or, \"Claude Vig\u00e9e won the 2008 prix Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie\".\nThe award titles are:\nThe winners are listed below.\nPrix Goncourt de la Biographie.\nGoncourt Prize for biography.

It was promulgated on 2 February 506, the 22nd year of his reign. It applied, not to the Visigothic nobles who lived under their own law, which had been formulated by Euric, but to the Hispano-Roman and Gallo-Roman population, living under Visigoth rule south of the Loire and, in Book 16, to the members of the trinitarian Catholic Church; the Visigoths were Arian and maintained their own clergy.\nSignificance.\nIt is termed a code (\"codex\"), in the certificate of Anianus, the king's referendary, but unlike the code of Justinian, from which the writings of jurists were excluded, it comprises both imperial constitutions (\"leges\") and juridical treatises (\"jura\"). From the circumstance that the \"Breviarium\" \nhas prefixed to it a royal rescript (\"commonitorium\") directing that copies of it, certified under the hand of Anianus, should be received exclusively as law throughout the kingdom of the Visigoths, the compilation of the code has been attributed to Anianus by many writers, and it is frequently designated the \"Breviary of Anianus\" (\"Breviarium Aniani\").\nThe code, however, appears to have been known amongst the Visigoths by the title of \"Lex Romana\" or \"Lex Theodosii\", and it was not until the 16th century that the title of \"Breviarium\" was introduced to distinguish it from a recast of the code, the \"Lex Romana Curiensis\" which was introduced into northern Italy in the 9th century for the use of the Romans in Lombardy. This recast of the Visigothic code was published in the 18th century for the first time by Paolo Canciani in his collection of ancient laws entitled \"Barbarorum Leges Antiquae\". Another manuscript of this Lombard recast of the Visigothic code was discovered by Gustav Friedrich H\u00e4nel in the library of St Gall.\nThe chief value of the Visigothic code is as a source for Roman Law, including the first five books of the \"Theodosian Code\" (\"Codex Theodosianus\"), five books of the \"Sententiae Receptae\" of Julius Paulus. Until the discovery of a manuscript in the chapter library in Verona, which contained the greater part of the \"Institutes\" of Gaius, it was the only known work containing the institutional writings of Gaius, an important ancient Roman jurist.\nThe \"Breviary\" had the effect of preserving the traditions of Roman law in Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis, which became both Provence and Septimania, thus reinforcing their sense of enduring continuity, broken in the Frankish north.\nContents.\nThe \"Breviary of Alaric\" comprises:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a simple pnictogen hydride, and is a colourless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odour. Hydrazine is highly hazardous unless handled in solution as, for example, hydrazine hydrate ().\nHydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but applications also include its uses as a precursor to pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as a long-term storable propellant for in-space spacecraft propulsion. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in airbags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion.\n, approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year.\nHydrazines are a class of organic substances derived by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in hydrazine by an organic group.\nEtymology and history.\nThe name \"hydrazine\" was coined by Emil Fischer in 1875; he was trying to produce organic compounds that consisted of mono-substituted hydrazine. By 1887, Theodor Curtius had produced hydrazine sulfate by treating organic diazides with dilute sulfuric acid; however, he was unable to obtain pure hydrazine, despite repeated efforts. Pure anhydrous hydrazine was first prepared by the Dutch chemist Lobry de Bruyn in 1895.\nThe nomenclature is a bi-valent form, with prefix \"hydr-\" used to indicate the presence of hydrogen atoms and suffix beginning with \"-az-\", from \"azote\", the French word for nitrogen.\nApplications.\nGas producers and propellants.\nThe largest use of hydrazine is as a precursor to blowing agents. Specific compounds include azodicarbonamide and azobisisobutyronitrile, which produce 100\u2013200 mL of gas per gram of precursor. In a related application, sodium azide, the gas-forming agent in airbags, is produced from hydrazine by reaction with sodium nitrite.\nHydrazine is also used as a long-term storable propellant on board space vehicles, such as the \"Dawn\" mission to Ceres and Vesta, and to both reduce the concentration of dissolved oxygen in and control pH of water used in large industrial boilers. The F-16 fighter jet, Space Shuttle, and U-2 spy plane use hydrazine to fuel their Emergency Start System in the event of an engine stall. The Space Shuttle's solid boosters decomposed hydrazine to provide power for onboard systems.\nPrecursor to pesticides and pharmaceuticals.\nHydrazine is a precursor to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, anastrozole, fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, propiconazole, hydrazine sulfate, diimide, triadimefon, and the diacylhydrazine insecticides.\nHydrazine compounds can be effective as active ingredients in insecticides, miticides, nematicides, fungicides, antiviral agents, attractants, herbicides, or plant growth regulators.\nSmall-scale, niche, and research.\nThe Italian catalyst manufacturer Acta (chemical company) has proposed using hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen in fuel cells. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 mW/cm2 more than a similar hydrogen cell without requiring (expensive) platinum catalysts. Because the fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing the hydrazine in a tank full of a double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine has a higher electromotive force of 1.56 V compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water. Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Corp., including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.\nA mixture of 63% hydrazine, 32% hydrazine nitrate and 5% water is a standard propellant for experimental bulk-loaded liquid propellant artillery. The propellant mixture above is one of the most predictable and stable, with a flat pressure profile during firing. Misfires are usually caused by inadequate ignition. The movement of the shell after a mis-ignition causes a large bubble with a larger ignition surface area, and the greater rate of gas production causes very high pressure, sometimes including catastrophic tube failures (i.e. explosions). From January\u2013June 1991, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory conducted a review of early bulk-loaded liquid propellant gun programs for possible relevance to the electrothermal chemical propulsion program.\nThe United States Air Force (USAF) regularly uses H-70, a 70% hydrazine 30% water mixture, in operations employing the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft and the Lockheed U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" reconnaissance aircraft. The single jet engine F-16 utilizes hydrazine to power its Emergency Power Unit (EPU), which provides emergency electrical and hydraulic power in the event of an engine flame out. The EPU activates automatically, or manually by pilot control, in the event of loss of hydraulic pressure or electrical power in order to provide emergency flight controls. The single jet engine U-2 utilizes hydrazine to power its Emergency Starting System (ESS), which provides a highly reliable method to restart the engine in flight in the event of a stall.\nRocket fuel.\nHydrazine was first used as a component in rocket fuels during World War II. A 30% mix by weight with 57% methanol (named M-Stoff in the German Luftwaffe) and 13% water was called C-Stoff by the Germans. The mixture was used to power the Messerschmitt Me 163B rocket-powered fighter plane, in which the German high test peroxide \"T-Stoff\" was used as an oxidizer. Unmixed hydrazine was referred to as B-Stoff by the Germans, a designation also used later for the ethanol/water fuel for the V-2 missile.\nHydrazine is used as a low-power monopropellant for the maneuvering (RCS/Reaction control system) thrusters of spacecraft, and was used to power the Space Shuttle's auxiliary power units (APUs). In addition, mono-propellant hydrazine-fueled rocket engines are often used in terminal descent of spacecraft. Such engines were used on the Viking program landers in the 1970s as well as the Mars landers \"Phoenix\" (May 2008), \"Curiosity\" (August 2012), and \"Perseverance\" (February 2021).\nDuring the Soviet space program, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (also discovered by Fischer in 1875) was used instead of hydrazine. Together with nitric oxidizers it became known as \"devil's venom\" due to its highly dangerous nature.\nIn all hydrazine mono-propellant engines, the hydrazine is passed over a catalyst such as iridium metal supported by high-surface-area alumina (aluminium oxide), which causes it to decompose into ammonia (), nitrogen gas (), and hydrogen () gas according to the three following reactions:\n Reaction 1: \n Reaction 2: \n Reaction 3: \nThe first two reactions are extremely exothermic (the catalyst chamber can reach 800\u00a0\u00b0C in a matter of milliseconds,) and they produce large volumes of hot gas from a small volume of liquid, making hydrazine a fairly efficient thruster propellant with a vacuum specific impulse of about 220 seconds. Reaction 2 is the most exothermic, but produces a smaller number of molecules than that of reaction 1. Reaction 3 is endothermic and reverts the effect of reaction 2 back to the same effect as reaction 1 alone (lower temperature, greater number of molecules). The catalyst structure affects the proportion of the that is dissociated in reaction 3; a higher temperature is desirable for rocket thrusters, while more molecules are desirable when the reactions are intended to produce greater quantities of gas.\nSince hydrazine is a solid below 2\u00a0\u00b0C, it is not suitable as a general purpose rocket propellant for military applications. Other variants of hydrazine that are used as rocket fuel are monomethylhydrazine, , also known as MMH (melting point \u221252\u00a0\u00b0C), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, , also known as UDMH (melting point \u221257\u00a0\u00b0C). These derivatives are used in two-component rocket fuels, often together with dinitrogen tetroxide, . A 50:50 mixture by weight of hydrazine and UDMH was used in the engine of the service propulsion system of the Apollo command and service module, both the ascent and descent engines of the Apollo Lunar Module and Titan II ICBMs and is known as Aerozine 50. These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also hypergolic (it starts burning without any external ignition).\nThere are ongoing efforts in the aerospace industry to find a replacement for hydrazine, given its potential ban across the European Union. Promising alternatives include nitrous oxide-based propellant combinations, with development being led by commercial companies Dawn Aerospace, Impulse Space, and Launcher. The first nitrous oxide-based system ever flown in space was by D-Orbit onboard their ION Satellite Carrier in 2021, using six Dawn Aerospace B20 thrusters. Another alternative is more safe blends of hydrazine with much lower vapor pressure, hence reduced inhalation hazard. Aerojet Rocketdyne has developed HPB-G28 blend that have 150 times lower vapor pressure, same specific impulse, and 35% higher density specific impulse than neat hydrazine. HPB-G28 can be used with same thrusters and catalysts as hydrazine, but has freezing point of -55\u00b0C, making propellant line heating unnecessary. It contains 65% (by mol) hydrazine, 27% hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) and 8% hydrazinium nitrate.\nOccupational hazards.\nHealth effects.\nPotential routes of hydrazine exposure include dermal, ocular, inhalation and ingestion.\nHydrazine exposure can cause skin irritation/contact dermatitis and burning, irritation to the eyes/nose/throat, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, headache, dizziness, central nervous system depression, lethargy, temporary blindness, seizures and coma. Exposure can also cause organ damage to the liver, kidneys and central nervous system. Hydrazine is documented as a strong skin sensitizer with potential for cross-sensitization to hydrazine derivatives following initial exposure. In addition to occupational uses reviewed above, exposure to hydrazine is also possible in small amounts from tobacco smoke.\nThe official U.S. guidance on hydrazine as a carcinogen is mixed but generally there is recognition of potential cancer-causing effects. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists it as a \"potential occupational carcinogen\". The National Toxicology Program (NTP) finds it is \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\". The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) grades hydrazine as \"A3\u2014confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans\". The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grades it as \"B2\u2014a probable human carcinogen based on animal study evidence\".\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rates hydrazine as \"2A\u2014probably carcinogenic to humans\" with a positive association observed between hydrazine exposure and lung cancer. Based on cohort and cross-sectional studies of occupational hydrazine exposure, a committee from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that there is suggestive evidence of an association between hydrazine exposure and lung cancer, with insufficient evidence of association with cancer at other sites. The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) places hydrazine in carcinogen \"group B\u2014a genotoxic carcinogen\". The genotoxic mechanism the committee cited references hydrazine's reaction with endogenous formaldehyde and formation of a DNA-methylating agent.\nIn the event of a hydrazine exposure-related emergency, NIOSH recommends removing contaminated clothing immediately, washing skin with soap and water, and for eye exposure removing contact lenses and flushing eyes with water for at least 15 minutes. NIOSH also recommends anyone with potential hydrazine exposure to seek medical attention as soon as possible. There are no specific post-exposure laboratory or medical imaging recommendations, and the medical work-up may depend on the type and severity of symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends potential exposures be treated symptomatically with special attention given to potential lung and liver damage. Past cases of hydrazine exposure have documented success with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) treatment.\nOccupational exposure limits.\nThe odor threshold for hydrazine is 3.7 ppm, thus if a worker is able to smell an ammonia-like odor then they are likely over the exposure limit. However, this odor threshold varies greatly and should not be used to determine potentially hazardous exposures.\nFor aerospace personnel, the United States Air Force uses an emergency exposure guideline, developed by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Toxicology, which is utilized for non-routine exposures of the general public and is called the Short-Term Public Emergency Exposure Guideline (SPEGL). The SPEGL, which does not apply to occupational exposures, is defined as the acceptable peak concentration for unpredicted, single, short-term emergency exposures of the general public and represents rare exposures in a worker's lifetime. For hydrazine the 1-hour SPEGL is 2 ppm, with a 24-hour SPEGL of 0.08 ppm.\nHandling and medical surveillance.\nA complete surveillance programme for hydrazine should include systematic analysis of biologic monitoring, medical screening and morbidity/mortality information. The CDC recommends surveillance summaries and education be provided for supervisors and workers. Pre-placement and periodic medical screening should be conducted with specific focus on potential effects of hydrazine upon functioning of the eyes, skin, liver, kidneys, hematopoietic, nervous and respiratory systems.\nCommon controls used for hydrazine include process enclosure, local exhaust ventilation and personal protective equipment (PPE). Guidelines for hydrazine PPE include non-permeable gloves and clothing, indirect-vent splash resistant goggles, face shield and in some cases a respirator. The use of respirators for the handling of hydrazine should be the last resort as a method of controlling worker exposure. In cases where respirators are needed, proper respirator selection and a complete respiratory protection program consistent with OSHA guidelines should be implemented.\nFor USAF personnel, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 48-8, Attachment 8 reviews the considerations for occupational exposure to hydrazine in missile, aircraft and spacecraft systems. Specific guidance for exposure response includes mandatory emergency shower and eyewash stations and a process for decontaminating protective clothing. The guidance also assigns responsibilities and requirements for proper PPE, employee training, medical surveillance and emergency response. USAF bases requiring the use of hydrazine generally have specific base regulations governing local requirements for safe hydrazine use and emergency response.\nMolecular structure.\nHydrazine, , contains two amine groups connected by a single bond between the two nitrogen atoms. Each subunit is pyramidal. The structure of the free molecules was determined by gas electron diffraction and microwave spectroscopy. The N\u2013N single bond length is 1.447(2) \u00c5 (144.7(2) pm), the N-H distance is 1.015(2) \u00c5, the N-N-H angles are 106(2)\u00b0 and 112(2)\u00b0, the H-N-H angle is 107\u00b0. The molecule adopts a gauche conformation with a torsion angle of 91(2)\u00b0 (dihedral angle between the planes containing the N-N bond and the bisectors of the H-N-H angles). The rotational barrier is twice that of ethane. These structural properties resemble those of gaseous hydrogen peroxide, which adopts a \"skewed\" anticlinal conformation, and also experiences a strong rotational barrier.\nThe structure of solid hydrazine was determined by X-ray diffraction. In this phase the N-N bond has a length of 1.46 \u00c5 and the nearest non-bonded distances are 3.19, 3.25 and 3.30 \u00c5.\nSynthesis and production.\nDiverse synthetic pathways for hydrazine production have been developed. The key step is the creation of the N\u2013N single bond. The many routes can be divided into those that use chlorine oxidants (and generate salt) and those that do not.\nOxidation of ammonia via oxaziridines from peroxide.\nHydrazine can be synthesized from ammonia and hydrogen peroxide with a ketone catalyst, in a procedure called the Peroxide process (sometimes called Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann process, the Atofina\u2013PCUK cycle, or ketazine process). The net reaction is:\nIn this route, the ketone and ammonia first condense to give the imine, which is oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to the oxaziridine, a three-membered ring containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Next, the oxaziridine gives the hydrazone by treatment with ammonia, which process creates the nitrogen-nitrogen single bond. This hydrazone condenses with one more equivalent of ketone. \nThe resulting azine is hydrolyzed to give hydrazine and regenerate the ketone, methyl ethyl ketone:\nUnlike most other processes, this approach does not produce a salt as a by-product.\nChlorine-based oxidations.\nThe Olin Raschig process, first announced in 1907, produces hydrazine from sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in many bleaches) and ammonia without the use of a ketone catalyst. This method relies on the reaction of monochloramine with ammonia to create the N\u2013N single bond as well as a hydrogen chloride byproduct:\n \nRelated to the Raschig process, urea can be oxidized instead of ammonia. Again sodium hypochlorite serves as the oxidant. The net reaction is shown:\nThe process generates significant by-products and is mainly practised in Asia.\nThe Bayer Ketazine Process is the predecessor to the peroxide process. It employs sodium hypochlorite as oxidant instead of hydrogen peroxide. Like all hypochlorite-based routes, this method produces an equivalent of salt for each equivalent of hydrazine.\nReactions.\nAcid-base behavior.\nHydrazine forms a monohydrate that is denser (1.032 g/cm3) than the anhydrous form (1.021 g/cm3). Hydrazine has basic (alkali) chemical properties comparable to those of ammonia:\n, \"K\"b = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126, p\"K\"b = 5.9\nIt is difficult to diprotonate:\n, \"K\"b = 8.4 \u00d7 10\u221216, p\"K\"b = 15\nExposure to extremely strong bases or alkali metals generates deprotonated hydrazide salts, such as sodium hydrazide. Most explode on exposure to air or moisture.\nRedox reactions.\nIdeally, the combustion of hydrazine in oxygen produces nitrogen and water:\nAn excess of oxygen gives oxides of nitrogen, including nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide:\n\nThe heat of combustion of hydrazine in oxygen (air) is 19.41 MJ/kg (8345 BTU/lb).\nHydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. This property makes it useful as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. It also directly reduces salts of less active metals (e.g., bismuth, arsenic, copper, mercury, silver, lead, platinum, and palladium) to the element. That property has commercial application in electroless nickel plating and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. Some colour photographic processes also use a weak solution of hydrazine as a stabilising wash, as it scavenges dye coupler and unreacted silver halides. Hydrazine is the most common and effective reducing agent used to convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via hydrothermal treatment.\nHydrazinium salts.\nHydrazine can be protonated to form various solid salts of the hydrazinium cation , by treatment with mineral acids. A common salt is hydrazinium hydrogensulfate, . Hydrazinium hydrogensulfate was investigated as a treatment of cancer-induced cachexia, but proved ineffective.\nDouble protonation gives the hydrazinium dication or hydrazinediium, , of which various salts are known.\nOrganic chemistry.\nHydrazines are part of many organic syntheses, often those of practical significance in pharmaceuticals (see applications section), as well as in textile dyes and in photography.\nHydrazine is used in the Wolff\u2013Kishner reduction, a reaction that transforms the carbonyl group of a ketone into a methylene bridge (or an aldehyde into a methyl group) via a hydrazone intermediate. Upon the catalysis with transition-metals, the hydrazones are used as organometallic reagent equivalents (HOME chemistry) for C-C bond formations. The production of the highly stable dinitrogen from the hydrazine derivative helps to drive the reaction.\nBeing bifunctional, with two amines, hydrazine is a key building block for the preparation of many heterocyclic compounds via condensation with a range of difunctional electrophiles. With 2,4-pentanedione, it condenses to give the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In the Einhorn-Brunner reaction hydrazines react with imides to give triazoles.\nBeing a good nucleophile, can attack sulfonyl halides and acyl halides. The tosylhydrazine also forms hydrazones upon treatment with carbonyls.\nHydrazine is used to cleave \"N\"-alkylated phthalimide derivatives. This scission reaction allows phthalimide anion to be used as amine precursor in the Gabriel synthesis.\nHydrazone formation.\nIllustrative of the condensation of hydrazine with a simple carbonyl is its reaction with acetone to give the acetone azine. The latter reacts further with hydrazine to yield acetone hydrazone:\n\nThe propanone azine is an intermediate in the Atofina-PCUK process. Direct alkylation of hydrazines with alkyl halides in the presence of base yields alkyl-substituted hydrazines, but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary amines). The reduction of hydrazones to hydrazines present a clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated hydrazines.\nIn a related reaction, 2-cyanopyridines react with hydrazine to form amide hydrazides, which can be converted using 1,2-diketones into triazines.\nBiochemistry.\nHydrazine is the intermediate in the anaerobic oxidation of ammonia (anammox) process. It is produced by some yeasts and the open ocean bacterium anammox (\"Brocadia anammoxidans\").\nThe false morel produces the poison gyromitrin which is an organic derivative of hydrazine that is converted to monomethylhydrazine by metabolic processes. Even the most popular edible \"button\" mushroom \"Agaricus bisporus\" produces organic hydrazine derivatives, including agaritine, a hydrazine derivative of an amino acid, and gyromitrin.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the novel \"The Martian\" (which was adapted into a feature film) the main character uses an iridium catalyst to separate hydrogen gas from surplus hydrazine fuel, which he then burns to generate water for survival.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The main advantages of hypergolic propellants are that they can be stored as liquids at room temperature and that engines which are powered by them are easy to ignite reliably and repeatedly. Common hypergolic propellants are extremely toxic or corrosive, making them difficult to handle.\nIn contemporary usage, the terms \"hypergol\" and \"hypergolic propellant\" usually mean the most common such propellant combination: dinitrogen tetroxide plus hydrazine.\nHistory.\nThe fact that turpentine may spontaneously combust when mixed with nitric acid was discovered as early as the late 17th century by Frederick Slare, but it remained a scientific curiosity for centuries until it was proposed to use it for rocket-assisted take off during WWII.\nIn 1935, Hellmuth Walter discovered that hydrazine hydrate was hypergolic with high-test peroxide of 80\u201383%. He was probably the first to discover this phenomenon, and set to work developing a fuel. Prof. Otto Lutz assisted the Walter Company with the development of \"C-Stoff\", which contained 30% hydrazine hydrate, 57% methanol, and 13% water, and spontaneously ignited with high-strength hydrogen peroxide. BMW developed engines burning a hypergolic mix of nitric acid with various combinations of amines, xylidines, and anilines.\nHypergolic propellants were discovered independently, for the second time, in the U.S. by GALCIT and Navy Annapolis researchers in 1940. They developed engines powered by aniline and red fuming nitric acid. Robert Goddard, Reaction Motors, and Curtiss-Wright worked on aniline/nitric acid engines in the early 1940s, for small missiles and jet assisted take-off (JATO). The project resulted in the successful JATO of several Martin PBM and PBY bombers, but the project was disliked because of the toxic properties of both fuel and oxidizer, as well as the high freezing point of aniline. The second problem was eventually solved by the addition of small quantities of furfuryl alcohol to the aniline.\nIn Germany from the mid-1930s through World War II, rocket propellants were broadly classed as monergols, hypergols, nonhypergols and lithergols. The ending \"ergol\" is a combination of Greek \"ergon\" or work, and Latin \"oleum\" or oil, later influenced by the chemical suffix \"-ol\" from alcohol. Monergols were monopropellants, while nonhypergols were bipropellants that required external ignition, and lithergols were solid/liquid hybrids. Hypergolic propellants (or at least hypergolic ignition) were far less prone to hard starts than electric or pyrotechnic ignition. The \"hypergole\" terminology was coined by Dr. Wolfgang N\u00f6ggerath, at the Technical University of Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.\nThe only rocket-powered fighter ever deployed was the Messerschmitt Me 163B \"Komet\", which had an HWK 109-509, a rocket motor which consumed methanol/hydrazine as fuel and high-test peroxide \"T-Stoff\" as oxidizer. The hypergolic rocket motor had the advantage of fast climb and quick-hitting tactics at the cost of being very volatile and capable of exploding with any degree of inattention. Other proposed combat rocket fighters such as the Heinkel \"Julia\" and reconnaissance aircraft like the DFS 228 were meant to use the Walter 509 series of rocket motors, but besides the Me 163, only the Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\" vertical launch expendable fighter was ever flight-tested with the Walter rocket propulsion system as its primary sustaining thrust system for military-purpose aircraft.\nThe earliest ballistic missiles, such as the Soviet R-7 that launched Sputnik 1 and the U.S. Atlas and Titan-1, used kerosene and liquid oxygen. Although they are preferred in space launchers, the difficulties of storing a cryogen such as liquid oxygen in a missile that had to be kept launch ready for months or years at a time led to a switch to hypergolic propellants in the U.S. Titan II and in most Soviet ICBMs such as the R-36, but the difficulties of such corrosive and toxic materials, including injury-causing leaks and the explosion of a Titan-II in its silo, led to their near universal replacement with solid-fuel boosters, first in Western submarine-launched ballistic missiles and then in land-based U.S. and Soviet ICBMs.\nIn the 1960s, late variants of French V\u00e9ronique sounding rocket and the Vesta rocket, as well as the first stage of the first orbital SLV Diamant used the combination of nitric acid and turpentine discovered by Slare. It may also be used in amateur rocketry.\nThe Apollo Lunar Module, used in the Moon landings, employed hypergolic fuels in both the descent and ascent rocket engines. The Apollo spacecraft used the same combination for the Service Propulsion System. Those spacecraft and the Space Shuttle (among others) used hypergolic propellants for their reaction control systems.\nThe trend among Western space-launch agencies is away from large hypergolic rocket engines and toward hydrogen/oxygen engines or methane/oxygen and RP-1/oxygen engines for various advantages and disadvantages. Arianes 1 through 4, with their hypergolic first and second stages (and optional hypergolic boosters on the Ariane 3 and 4) have been retired and replaced with the Ariane 5, which uses a first stage fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Titan II, III, and IV, with their hypergolic first and second stages, have also been retired for the Atlas V (RP-1/oxygen) and Delta IV (hydrogen/oxygen). Hypergolic propellants are still used in upper stages, when multiple burn-coast periods are required, and in launch escape systems.\nCharacteristics.\nAdvantages.\nHypergolically fueled rocket engines are usually simple and reliable because they need no ignition system. Although larger hypergolic engines in some launch vehicles use turbopumps, most hypergolic engines are pressure fed. A gas, usually helium, is fed to the propellant tanks under pressure through a series of check and safety valves. The propellants, in turn, flow through control valves into the combustion chamber; there, their instant contact ignition prevents a mixture of unreacted propellants from accumulating and then igniting in a potentially catastrophic hard start.\nAs hypergolic rockets do not need an ignition system, they can fire any number of times by simply opening and closing the propellant valves until the propellants are exhausted, so are uniquely suited for spacecraft maneuvering and well-suited, though not uniquely so, as upper stages of such space launchers as the Delta II and Ariane 5, which must perform more than one burn. Restartable nonhypergolic rocket engines nevertheless exist, notably the cryogenic (oxygen/hydrogen) RL-10 on the Centaur and the J-2 on the Saturn V. The RP-1/LOX Merlin on the Falcon 9 can also be restarted.\nThe most common hypergolic fuels, hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), and oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide, are all liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures. They are therefore sometimes called \"storable liquid propellants\". They are suitable for use in spacecraft missions lasting many years. The cryogenity of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen has so far limited their practical use to space launch vehicles where they need to be stored only briefly. The largest issue with the usage of cryogenic propellants in interplanetary space is boil-off, which is largely dependent on the scale of spacecraft.\nAnother advantage of hypergolic propellants is their high density compared to cryogenic propellants. LO2 has a density of 1.14 g/ml, while hypergolic oxidizers such as nitric acid or nitrogen tetroxide have a density of 1.55 g/ml and 1.45 g/ml, respectively. LH2 fuel offers extremely high performance, yet its density only warrants its use in the largest of rocket stages, while mixtures of hydrazine and UDMH have a density at least 10 times greater. This is of great importance in space probes, as the higher propellant density allows the size of their propellant tanks to be reduced significantly, which in turn allows the probes to fit within a smaller payload fairing.\nDisadvantages.\nRelative to their mass, traditional hypergolic propellants possess a lower calorific value than cryogenic propellant combinations like LH2/LO2 or LCH4/LO2. A launch vehicle that uses hypergolic propellant must therefore carry a greater mass of fuel than one that uses these cryogenic fuels.\nThe corrosivity, toxicity, and carcinogenicity of traditional hypergolics necessitate expensive safety precautions. Failure to follow adequate safety procedures with an exceptionally dangerous UDMH-nitric acid propellant mixture nicknamed \"devil's venom\", for example, resulted in the deadliest rocketry accident in history, the Nedelin catastrophe.\nHypergolic combinations.\nCommon.\nCommon hypergolic propellant combinations include:\nLess common or obsolete.\nLess-common or obsolete hypergolic propellants include:\nRelated technology.\nPyrophoric substances, which ignite spontaneously in the presence of air, are also sometimes used as rocket fuels themselves or to ignite other fuels. For example, a mixture of triethylborane and triethylaluminium (which are both separately and even more so together pyrophoric), was used for engine starts in the SR-71 Blackbird and in the F-1 engines on the NASA Saturn V rocket, and is used in the Merlin engines on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69971", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69971", "title": "Hornbill", "text": "Family of birds\nHornbills are birds found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Melanesia of the family Bucerotidae. They are characterized by a long, down-curved bill which is frequently brightly coloured and sometimes has a horny casque on the upper mandible. Hornbills have a two-lobed kidney. They are the only birds in which the first and second neck vertebrae (the atlas and axis respectively) are fused together; this probably provides a more stable platform for carrying the bill. The family is omnivorous, feeding on fruit and small animals. They are monogamous breeders nesting in natural cavities in trees and sometimes cliffs. A number of mainly insular species of hornbill with small ranges are threatened with extinction, mainly in Southeast Asia.\nIn the Neotropical realm, toucans occupy the hornbills' ecological niche, an example of convergent evolution. Despite their close appearances, the two groups are not very closely related, with toucans being allied with the woodpeckers, honeyguides and several families of barbet, while hornbills (and their close relatives the ground hornbills) are allied with the hoopoes and wood-hoopoes.\nDescription.\nHornbills show considerable variation in size and colors. The smallest species is the black dwarf hornbill (\"Tockus hartlaubi\"), at and in length. The largest and most massive species appears to be the southern ground hornbill which has an average weight of , and can weigh up to and span about across the wings. Other species rival the southern ground species in length, at up to about , including the Abyssinian ground hornbill (\"Bucorvus abyssinicus\"), the great hornbill (\"Buceros bicornis\") and, probably the longest of all (perhaps exceeding ) thanks in part to its extended tail feathers, the helmeted hornbill (\"Rhinoplax vigil\"). Males are always bigger than the females, though the extent to which this is true varies according to species. The extent of sexual dimorphism also varies with body parts. For example, the difference in body mass between males and females is 1\u201317%, but the variation is 8\u201330% for bill length and 1\u201321% in wing length.\nThe most distinctive feature of the hornbills is the heavy bill, supported by powerful neck muscles as well as by the fused vertebrae. The large bill assists in fighting, preening, constructing the nest, and catching prey. A feature unique to the hornbills is the casque, a hollow structure that runs along the upper mandible. In some species it is barely perceptible and appears to serve no function beyond reinforcing the bill. In other species it is quite large, is reinforced with bone, and has openings between the hollow centre, allowing it to serve as a resonator for calls. In the helmeted hornbill the casque is not hollow but is filled with hornbill ivory and is used as a battering ram in dramatic aerial jousts. Aerial casque-butting has also been reported in the great hornbill.\nThe plumage of hornbills is typically black, grey, white, or brown, and is frequently offset by bright colours on the bill, or by patches of bare coloured skin on the face or wattles. Some species exhibit sexual dichromatism, where the colouration of soft parts varies by sex.\nHornbills possess binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of vision, the bill intrudes on their visual field. This allows them to see their own bill tip and aids in precision handling of food objects with their bill. The eyes are also protected by large eyelashes which act as a sunshade.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe Bucerotidae include about 64 living species, though a number of cryptic species may yet be split, as has been suggested for the red-billed hornbill. Their distribution includes Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, but no genus is found in \"both\" Africa and Asia. Most are arboreal birds, but the large ground hornbills (\"Bucorvus\"), as their name implies, are terrestrial birds of open savanna. Of the 24 species found in Africa, 13 are birds of the more open woodlands and savanna, and some occur even in highly arid environments; the remaining species are found in dense forests. This contrasts with Asia, where a single species occurs in open savanna and the remainder are forest species. The Indian subcontinent has 10 species of hornbills, of which 9 are found in India and adjoining countries, while the Sri Lanka grey hornbill is restricted to the island. The most common widespread species in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian grey hornbill.\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Indonesia has 13 hornbill species: 9 of them exist in Sumatra, and the rest exist in Sumba, Sulawesi, Papua and Kalimantan. Kalimantan has the same hornbill species as Sumatra, except that the great hornbill is not found there. Meanwhile, the neighboring archipelago of the Philippines has 11 hornbill species, all of which are endemic to certain small islands of the country, making them one of the most endangered hornbills in the world. In the Neogene (at least in the late Miocene), hornbills inhabited North Africa and South Europe. Their remains have been found in Morocco and Bulgaria. The oldest known hornbill is from the Early Miocene of Uganda, around 19 million years ago, which is similar to modern \"Tockus.\"\nBehaviour and ecology.\nHornbills are diurnal, generally travelling in pairs or small family groups. Larger flocks sometimes form outside the breeding season. The largest assemblies of hornbills form at some roosting sites, where as many as 2400 individual birds may be found.\nDiet.\nHornbills are omnivorous birds, eating fruit, insects and small animals. They cannot swallow food caught at the tip of the beak as their tongues are too short to manipulate it, so they toss it back to the throat with a jerk of the head. While both open country and forest species are omnivorous, species that specialise in feeding on fruit are generally found in forests, while the more carnivorous species are found in open country. Forest-dwelling species of hornbills are considered to be important seed dispersers. Some hornbill species (e.g., Malabar pied-hornbill) even have a great preference for the fruits of the strychnine tree (\"Strychnos nux-vomica\"), which contain the potent poison strychnine.\nSome hornbills defend a fixed territory. Territoriality is related to diet; fruit sources are often patchily distributed and require long-distance travel to find. Thus, species that specialise in fruit are less territorial.\nBreeding.\nHornbills generally form monogamous pairs, although some species engage in cooperative breeding. The female lays up to six white eggs in existing holes or crevices, either in trees or rocks. The cavities are usually natural, but some species may nest in the abandoned nests of woodpeckers and barbets. Nesting sites may be used in consecutive breeding seasons by the same pair. Before incubation, the females of all Bucerotinae\u2014sometimes assisted by the male\u2014begin to close the entrance to the nest cavity with a wall made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. When the female is ready to lay her eggs, the entrance is just large enough for her to enter the nest, and after she has done so, the remaining opening is also all but sealed shut. There is only one narrow aperture, big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and eventually the chicks. The function of this behaviour is apparently related to protecting the nesting site from rival hornbills. The sealing can be done in just a few hours; at most it takes a few days. After the nest is sealed, the hornbill takes another five days to lay the first egg. Clutch size varies from one or two eggs in the larger species to up to eight eggs for the smaller species. During the incubation period the female undergoes a complete and simultaneous moult. It has been suggested that the darkness of the cavity triggers a hormone involved in moulting. Non-breeding females and males go through a sequential moult. When the chicks and the female are too big to fit in the nest, the mother breaks out the nest and both parents feed the chicks. In some species the mother rebuilds the wall, whereas in others the chicks rebuild the wall unaided. The ground hornbills do not adopt this behaviour, but are conventional cavity-nesters.\nAssociations with other species.\nA number of hornbills have associations with other animal species. For example, some species of hornbills in Africa have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, foraging together and warning each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators. Other relationships are commensal, for example following monkeys or other animals and eating the insects flushed up by them.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family Bucerotidae was introduced (as Buceronia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815; it comes from the genus name Buceros given by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 from Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (\"bo\u00fbs\"), meaning \"ox\", and \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (\"k\u00e9ras\"), meaning \"horn\", and thus, \"ox horn\".\nThere are two subfamilies: the Bucorvinae contain the two ground hornbills in a single genus, and the Bucerotinae contain all other taxa. Traditionally they are included in the order Coraciiformes (which includes also kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes and bee-eaters). In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, however, hornbills are separated from the Coraciiformes into an order of their own, Bucerotiformes, with the subfamilies elevated to family level. Given that they are almost as distant from the rollers, kingfishers and allies as are the trogons, the arrangement chosen is more a matter of personal taste than any well-established taxonomic practice. All that can be said with reasonable certainty is that placing the hornbills outside the Coraciiformes and the trogons inside would be incorrect.\nGenetic data suggests that ground hornbills and \"Bycanistes\" form a clade outside the rest of the hornbill lineage. They are thought to represent an early African lineage, while the rest of Bucerotiformes evolved in Asia. However, another study claims that the ground hornbills diverged first, followed by \"Tockus\". Within \"Tockus\", two clades have been identified based on genetics and vocal types\u2014'whistlers' and 'cluckers'. The 'cluckers' have been placed in a separate genus, \"Lophoceros\".\n\"Bycanistes\" belongs to a clade of mostly African species that also includes \"Ceratogymna\" and \"Tropicranus\". Another member of this clade is the Black dwarf hornbill. The Black dwarf hornbill is typically classified in the genus \"Tockus\" but in this study, is a sister species to the White-crested hornbill. If these two species are classified in congeneric, \"Tropicranus\" becomes a junior synonym of \"Horizocerus\", as that was one of the old names used for the Black dwarf hornbill. This clade also includes one Southeast Asian species, the white-crowned hornbill.\nAs for the other Asian hornbill species, \"Buceros\" and \"Rhinoplax\" are each other's closest relatives, \"Anorrhinus\" is part of a clade that has \"Ocyceros\" and \"Anthracoceros\" as sister taxa, and \"Aceros\", \"Rhyticeros\", and \"Penelopides\" form another clade. However, according to this study, \"Aceros\" is polyphyletic; the rufous-headed hornbill, writhed hornbill, and wrinkled hornbill form a clade with the Sulawesi hornbill, and are in turn more closely related to \"Penelopides\". These four species have been classified in a separate genus, \"Rhabdotorrhinus\". Similarly, the knobbed hornbill is more closely related to \"Rhyticeros\", leaving the rufous-necked hornbill the only member of the genus \"Aceros\".\nThe following cladogram showing the relationships between the genera is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Juan-Carlos Gonzalez and collaborators that was published in 2013. The number of species in each genus is taken from the taxonomy published by the AviList team.\nFossil record.\nSome scientist believe the hornbill evolutionary tree spread from the Indian microcontinent after Gondwana, before India merged with Asia.\nCultural significance.\nMost species' casques are very light, containing much airspace. However, the helmeted hornbill has a solid casque made of a material called hornbill ivory, which is greatly valued as a carving material in China and Japan. It was used as a medium for the art of netsuke, and also used for hunting purposes in places like India. The Iban people of Borneo regards the Rhinoceros hornbill (known as Kenyalang) as the king of the worldly birds, who acts as the intermediary between the man and the God. \nThe Wreathed hornbill (Undan) is believed by the Iban people to be the guide of dead souls to the lower world.\nStatus and conservation.\nNone of the African species of hornbills are seriously threatened, but many Asian hornbills are threatened by hunting and habitat loss, as they tend to require primary forest. Among these threatened species, only the plain-pouched hornbill and rufous-necked hornbill are found on the Asian mainland; all others are insular in their distribution. In the Philippines alone, the Palawan hornbill is vulnerable, and the Mindoro is endangered. The Visayan hornbill is classified as endangered by the IUCN, but considered critically endangered by the National List of Threatened Terrestrial Fauna of the Philippines. A subspecies of the Visayan hornbill, the Ticao hornbill, was declared extinct in 2013. Two of the three critically endangered hornbills, the rufous-headed hornbill and the Sulu hornbill, are also restricted to the Philippines. The latter species is one of the world's rarest birds, with only 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals, and faces imminent extinction. The other critically endangered species, the helmeted hornbill, is threatened by uncontrolled hunting and the trade in hornbill ivory.\nIn popular culture.\nA hornbill named Zazu is the king's adviser and one of the characters in \"The Lion King\" franchise, voiced by Rowan Atkinson in the original 1994 version and John Oliver in the remade 2019 version.\nHornbill was used as the official mascot of one of Malaysia's political parties, the Democratic Action Party.\nThe Rhinoceros hornbill is the official state animal of Sarawak, a Malaysian state located in Borneo.\nThe great hornbill, a member of the hornbill family, is the official state bird of Kerala, an Indian state.

In Chinese it is commonly known as the Jiawu War. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the ports of L\u00fcshunkou (Port Arthur) and Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895 and signed the unequal Treaty of Shimonoseki two months later, ending the war. \nIn the late 19th century, Korea remained one of the Qing tributary states, while Japan viewed it as a target of imperial expansion. In June 1894, the Qing government, at the request of the Korean emperor Gojong, sent 2,800 troops to aid in suppressing the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The Japanese considered this a violation of the 1885 Convention of Tientsin, and sent an expeditionary force of 8,000 troops, which landed at Incheon. This army moved to Seoul, seized the Korean emperor, and set up a pro-Japanese government on 23 July 1894 in the occupation of Gyeongbokgung. The Qing government decided to withdraw its troops, but rejected recognition of the pro-Japanese government, which had granted the Imperial Japanese Army the right to expel the Qing's Huai Army from Korea. About 3,000 Qing troops still remained in Korea, and could be supplied only by sea; on 25 July, the Japanese Navy won the Battle of Pungdo and sank the steamer \"Kowshing\", which was carrying 1,200 Qing reinforcements. A declaration of war followed on 1 August.\nFollowing the Battle of Pyongyang on 15 September, Qing troops retreated to Manchuria, allowing the Japanese to take over Korea. Two days later, the Beiyang Fleet suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Yalu River, with its surviving ships retreating to Port Arthur. In October 1894, the Japanese Army invaded Manchuria, and captured Port Arthur on 21 November. Japan next captured Weihaiwei on the Shandong Peninsula on 12 February 1895. This gave them control over the approaches to Beijing, and the Qing court began negotiations with Japan in early March. The war concluded with the Treaty of Shimonoseki on 17 April, which required the Qing to pay a massive indemnity and to cede the island of Taiwan to Japan. Japan also gained a predominant position in Korea.\nThe war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernise its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Revolution and ultimate end of dynastic rule in China.\nNames.\nThe war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu (), referring to the year (1894) as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years. In Japan, it is called the . In Korea, where much of the war took place, it is called the Qing\u2013Japan War (; Hanja: ).\nBackground.\nAfter two centuries, the Japanese policy of seclusion under the \"sh\u014dguns\" of the Edo period came to an end when the country was opened to trade by the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. In the years following the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the fall of the shogunate, the newly formed Meiji government embarked on reforms to centralise and modernise Japan. The Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world to learn and assimilate Western arts and sciences, with the intention of making Japan an equal to the Western powers. These reforms transformed Japan from a feudal society into a modern industrial state. The Meiji government focused on strengthening the military, adopting Western-style training and technology, which led to the establishing of a powerful navy and a well-equipped army. Furthermore, Japan's economic infrastructure saw significant improvements, including the development of railways, telegraph lines, and modern factories, which led to rapid industrial growth and enhanced the country's military capabilities.\nDuring the same period, the Qing dynasty also attempted to implement reforms in response to internal rebellions and external threats. The Self-Strengthening Movement (1861\u20131895) aimed to modernise the Qing's military and industry by adopting Western technology and military techniques. However, the movement faced significant challenges, including bureaucratic resistance, corruption, and a lack of central coordination. These difficulties affected the effectiveness of the reforms and prevented China from achieving the same level of modernisation and industrialisation as Japan. As a result, by the time of the First Sino-Japanese War, China remained a largely agrarian society with a relatively weak military, unable to match the rapidly modernising Japanese forces.\nKorean politics.\nIn January 1864, King Cheoljong died without a male heir, and through Korean succession protocols King Gojong ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, as King Gojong was too young to rule, the new king's father, Yi Ha-\u016dng, became the , or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son's name as regent. Originally the term referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. With his ascendancy to power the initiated a set of reforms designed to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the class. He also pursued an isolationist policy and was determined to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. In Korean history, the king's in-laws enjoyed great power, consequently the acknowledged that any future daughters-in-law might threaten his authority. Therefore, he attempted to prevent any possible threat to his rule by selecting as a new queen for his son an orphaned girl from among the Y\u014fh\u016dng Min clan, which lacked powerful political connections. With Queen Min as his daughter-in-law and the royal consort, the felt secure in his power. However, after she had become queen, Min recruited all her relatives and had them appointed to influential positions in the name of the king. The Queen also allied herself with political enemies of the , so that by late 1873 she had mobilised enough influence to oust him from power. In October 1873, when the Confucian scholar Choe Ik-hyeon submitted a memorial to King Gojong urging him to rule in his own right, Queen Min seized the opportunity to force her father-in-law's retirement as regent. The departure of the led to Korea's abandonment of its isolationist policy.\nOpening of Korea.\nOn 26 February 1876, after Japanese troops attacked Korean forces in the Ganghwa Island incident, the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876 was signed, opening Korea to Japanese trade. In 1880, the King sent a mission to Japan that was headed by Kim Hong-jip, an enthusiastic observer of the reforms taking place there. While in Japan, the Chinese diplomat Huang Zunxian presented him with a study called \"A Strategy for Korea\" (). It warned of the threat to Korea posed by the Russians and recommended that Korea maintain friendly relations with Japan, which was at the time too economically weak to be an immediate threat, to work closely with the Qing government, and seek an alliance with the United States as a counterweight to Russia. After returning to Korea, Kim presented the document to King Gojong, who was so impressed with the document that he had copies made and distributed to his officials.\nIn 1880, following Chinese advice and breaking with tradition, King Gojong decided to establish diplomatic ties with the United States. After negotiations through Chinese mediation in Tianjin, the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation was formally signed between the United States and Korea in Incheon on 22 May 1882. However, there were two significant issues raised by the treaty. The first concerned Korea's status as an independent nation. During the talks with the Americans, the Chinese insisted that the treaty contain an article declaring that Korea was a dependency of China and argued that the country had long been a tributary state of China. But the Americans firmly opposed such an article, arguing that a treaty with Korea should be based on the Treaty of Ganghwa, which stipulated that Korea was an independent state. A compromise was finally reached, with Shufeldt and Li agreeing that the King of Korea would notify the U.S. president in a letter that Korea had special status as a tributary state of China. The treaty between the Korean government and the United States became the model for all treaties between it and other Western countries. Korea later signed similar trade and commerce treaties with Britain and Germany in 1883, with Italy and Russia in 1884, and with France in 1886. Subsequently, commercial treaties were concluded with other European countries.\nKorean reforms.\nAfter 1879, China's relations with Korea came under the authority of Li Hongzhang, who had emerged as one of the most influential figures in China after playing an important role during the Taiping Rebellion, and was also an advocate of the Self-Strengthening Movement. In 1879, Li was appointed as governor-general of Zhili and the imperial commissioner for the northern ports. He was in charge of China's Korea policy and urged Korean officials to adopt China's own self-strengthening program to strengthen their country in response to foreign threats, to which King Gojong was receptive. The Korean government, immediately after opening the country to the outside world, pursued a policy of enlightenment aimed at achieving national prosperity and military strength through the doctrine of (\"Eastern ways and Western machines\"). To modernise their country, the Koreans tried selectively to accept and master Western technology while preserving their country's cultural values and heritage.\nIn January 1881, the government launched administrative reforms and established the (Office for Extraordinary State Affairs) which was modelled on Chinese administrative structures. Under this overarching organisation, twelve or agencies were created. In 1881, a technical mission was sent to Japan to survey its modernised facilities. Officials travelled all over Japan inspecting administrative, military, educational, and industrial facilities. In October, another small group went to Tianjin to study modern weapons manufacturing, and Chinese technicians were invited to manufacture weapons in Seoul. Additionally, as part of their plan to modernise the country, the Koreans had invited the Japanese military attach\u00e9 Lieutenant Horimoto Reiz\u014d to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army. A new military formation called the (Special Skills Force) was established, in which eighty to one hundred young men of the aristocracy were to be given Japanese military training. The following year, in January 1882, the government also reorganised the existing five-army garrison structure into the (Palace Guards Garrison) and the (Capital Guards Garrison).\nJapanese insecurities over Korea.\nDuring the 1880s, discussions in Japan about national security focused on the issue of Korean reform. The political discourse over the two were interlinked; as the German military adviser Major Jakob Meckel stated, Korea was \"a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan\". What made Korea of strategic concern was not merely its proximity to Japan but its inability to defend itself against outsiders. If Korea were truly independent, it posed no strategic problem to Japan's national security, but if the country remained undeveloped it would remain weak and consequently would be inviting prey for foreign domination. The political consensus in Japan was that Korean independence lay, as it had been for Meiji Japan, through the importation of \"civilization\" from the West. Korea required a program of self-strengthening like the post-Restoration reforms that were enacted in Japan. The Japanese interest in the reform of Korea was not purely altruistic. Not only would these reforms enable Korea to resist foreign intrusion, which was in Japan's direct interest, but through being a conduit of change they would also have opportunity to play a larger role on the peninsula. To Meiji leaders, the issue was not whether Korea should be reformed but how these reforms might be implemented. There was a choice of adopting a passive role which required the cultivation of reformist elements within Korean society and rendering them assistance whenever possible, or adopting a more aggressive policy, actively interfering in Korean politics to assure that reform took place. Many Japanese advocates of Korean reform swung between these two positions.\nJapan in the early 1880s was weak, as a result of internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions during the previous decade. The country was also struggling financially, with inflation as a result of these internal factors. Subsequently, the Meiji government adopted a passive policy, encouraging the Korean court to follow the Japanese model but offering little concrete assistance except for the dispatch of the small military mission headed by Lieutenant Horimoto Reizo to train the . What worried the Japanese was the Chinese, who had loosened their hold over Korea in 1876 when the Japanese succeeded in establishing a legal basis for Korean independence by ending its tributary status. Chinese actions appeared to be thwarting the forces of reform in Korea and re-asserting their influence over the country.\n1882 crisis.\nIn 1882, the Korean Peninsula experienced a severe drought which led to food shortages, causing much hardship and discord among the population. Korea was on the verge of bankruptcy, even falling months behind on military pay, causing deep resentment among the soldiers. There was also resentment towards the on the part of the soldiers of the regular Korean army, as the formation was better equipped and treated. Additionally, more than 1000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army; most of them were either old or disabled, and the rest had not been given their pay in rice for thirteen months.\nIn June of that year, King Gojong, being informed of the situation, ordered that a month's allowance of rice be given to the soldiers. He directed Min Gyeom-ho, the overseer of government finances and Queen Min's nephew, to handle the matter. Min in turn handed the matter over to his steward who sold the good rice he had been given and used the money to buy millet which he mixed with sand and bran. As a result, the rice became rotten and inedible. The distribution of the alleged rice infuriated the soldiers. On 23 July, a military mutiny and riot broke out in Seoul. Enraged soldiers headed for the residence of Min Gyeom-ho, who they had suspected of having swindled them out of their rice. Min, on hearing word of the revolt, ordered the police to arrest some of the ringleaders and announced that they would be executed the next morning. He had assumed that this would serve as a warning to the other agitators. However, after learning what had transpired, the rioters broke into Min's house to take vengeance; as he was not at his residence the rioters vented their frustrations by destroying his furniture and other possessions.\nThe rioters then moved on to an armoury from which they stole weapons and ammunition, and then headed for the prison. After overpowering the guards, they released not only the men who had been arrested that day by Min Gyeom-ho but also many political prisoners as well. Min then summoned the army to quell the rebellion but it had become too late to suppress the mutiny. The original body of mutineers had been swelled by the poor and disaffected citizenry of the city; as a result the revolt had assumed major proportions. The rioters now turned their attention to the Japanese. One group headed to Lieutenant Horimoto's quarters and killed him. Another group, some 3,000 strong, headed for the Japanese legation, where Hanabusa Yoshitada the minister to Korea and twenty seven members of the legation resided. The mob surrounded the legation shouting its intention of killing all the Japanese inside. Hanabusa gave orders to burn the legation and important documents were set on fire. As the flames quickly spread, the members of the legation escaped through a rear gate, where they fled to the harbour and boarded a boat which took them down the Han River to Chemulpo. Taking refuge with the Incheon commandant, they were again forced to flee after word arrived of the events in Seoul and the attitude of their hosts changed. They escaped to the harbour during heavy rain and were pursued by Korean soldiers. Six Japanese were killed, while another five were seriously wounded. The survivors carrying the wounded then boarded a small boat and headed for the open sea where three days later they were rescued by a British survey ship, , which took them to Nagasaki. The following day, after the attack on the Japanese legation, the rioters forced their way into the royal palace where they found and killed Min Gyeom-ho, as well as a dozen other high-ranking officers. They also searched for Queen Min. The queen narrowly escaped, however, dressed as an ordinary lady of the court and was carried on the back of a faithful guard who claimed she was his sister. The used the incident to reassert his power.\nThe Chinese then deployed about 4,500 troops to Korea, under General Wu Changqing, which effectively regained control and quelled the rebellion. In response, the Japanese also sent four warships and a battalion of troops to Seoul to safeguard Japanese interests and demand reparations. However, tensions subsided with the Treaty of Chemulpo, signed on the evening of 30 August 1882. The agreement specified that the Korean conspirators would be punished and \u00a550,000 would be paid to the families of slain Japanese. The Japanese government would also receive \u00a5500,000, a formal apology, and permission to station troops at their diplomatic legation in Seoul. In the aftermath of rebellion, the was accused of fomenting the rebellion and its violence, and was arrested by the Chinese and taken to Tianjin. He was later carried off to a town about sixty miles southwest of Beijing, where for three years he was confined to one room and kept under strict surveillance.\nRe-assertion of Chinese influence.\nAfter the Imo Incident, early reform efforts in Korea suffered a major setback. In the aftermath of the incident, the Chinese reasserted their influence over the peninsula, where they began to interfere in Korean internal affairs directly. After stationing troops at strategic points in the capital Seoul, the Chinese undertook several initiatives to gain significant influence over the Korean government. The Qing dispatched two special advisers on foreign affairs representing Chinese interests to Korea: the German Paul Georg von M\u00f6llendorff, a close confidant of Li Hongzhang, and the Chinese diplomat Ma Jianzhong. A staff of Chinese officers also took over the training of the army, providing the Koreans with 1,000 rifles, two cannons, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the (Capital Guards Command), a new Korean military formation, was created and trained along Chinese lines by Yuan Shikai.\nIn October, the two countries signed a treaty stipulating that Korea was dependent on China and granted Chinese merchants the right to conduct overland and maritime business freely within its borders. It also gave the Chinese advantages over the Japanese and Westerners and granted them unilateral extraterritoriality privileges in civil and criminal cases. Under the treaty, the number of Chinese merchants and traders significantly increased, a severe blow to Korean merchants. Although it allowed Koreans reciprocally to trade in Beijing, the agreement was not a treaty but was in effect issued as a regulation for a vassal. Additionally, during the following year, the Chinese supervised the creation of a Korean Maritime Customs Service, headed by von M\u00f6llendorff. Korea was reduced to a semi-colonial tributary state of China with King Gojong unable to appoint diplomats without Chinese approval, and with troops stationed in the country to protect Chinese interests. China also obtained concessions in Korea, notably the Chinese concession of Incheon.\nFactional rivalry and ascendancy of the Min clan.\nDuring the 1880s two rival factions emerged in Korea. One was a small group of reformers that had centered around the (Enlightenment Party), which had become frustrated at the limited scale and arbitrary pace of reforms. The members who constituted the Enlightenment Party were well-educated Koreans and most were from the yangban class. They were impressed by the developments in Meiji Japan and were eager to emulate them. Members included Kim Okkyun, Pak Y\u014fnghyo, Hong Yeong-sik, Seo Gwang-beom, and Philip Jaisohn. The group was also relatively young; Pak Yung-hio came from a prestigious lineage related to the royal family and was 23, Hong was 29, Seo Gwang-beom was 25, and Soh Jaipil was 20, with Kim Okkyun being the oldest at 33. All had spent some time in Japan; Pak Yung-hio had been part of a mission sent to Japan to apologise for the Imo incident in 1882. He had been accompanied by Seo Gwang-beom and by Kim Okkyun, who later came under the influence of Japanese modernizers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi. Kim Okkyun, while studying in Japan, had also cultivated friendships with influential Japanese figures and became the de facto leader of the group. They were also strongly nationalistic and desired to make their country truly independent by ending Chinese interference in Korea's internal affairs.\nThe was a group of conservatives, which included not only Min Yeong-ik from the Min family but also other prominent Korean political figures that wanted to maintain power with China's help. Although the members of the supported the enlightenment policy, they favoured gradual changes based on the Chinese model. After the Imo incident, the Min clan pursued a pro-Chinese policy. This was also partly a matter of opportunism as the intervention by Chinese troops led to subsequent exile of the rival in Tianjin and the expansion of Chinese influence in Korea, but it also reflected an ideological disposition shared by many Koreans toward the more comfortable and traditional relationship as a tributary of China. Consequently, the Min clan became advocates of the (\"adopting Western knowledge while keeping Eastern values\") philosophy, which had originated from the ideas of moderate Chinese reformers who had emphasised the need to maintain the perceived superior cultural values and heritage of the Sino-centric world while recognising the importance of acquiring and adopting Western technology, particularly military technology, to preserve autonomy. Hence, rather than major institutional reforms such as the adoption of new values such as legal equality or introducing modern education like in Meiji Japan, the advocates of this school of thought sought piecemeal adoptions of institutions that would strengthen the state while preserving the basic social, political, and cultural order. Through the ascendancy of Queen Min to the throne, the Min clan had also been able to use newly created government institutions as bases for political power; subsequently with their growing monopoly of key positions they frustrated the ambitions of the Enlightenment Party.\nKapsin Coup.\nIn the two years preceding the Imo incident, the members of the had failed to secure appointments to vital offices in the government and were unable to implement their reform plans. As a consequence they were prepared to seize power by any means necessary. In 1884, an opportunity to seize power by staging a coup d'\u00e9tat against the presented itself. In August, as hostilities between France and China erupted over Annam, half of the Chinese troops stationed in Korea were withdrawn. On 4 December 1884, with the help of Japanese minister Takezoe Shinichiro who promised to mobilise Japanese legation guards to provide assistance, the reformers staged their coup under the guise of a banquet hosted by Hong Yeong-sik, the director of the General Postal Administration. The banquet was to celebrate the opening of the new national post office. King Gojong was expected to attend together with several foreign diplomats and high-ranking officials, most of whom were members of the pro-Chinese faction. Kim Okkyun and his comrades approached King Gojong falsely stating that Chinese troops had created a disturbance and escorted him to the small Gyoengu Palace, where they placed him in the custody of Japanese legation guards. They then proceeded to kill and wound several senior officials of the faction.\nAfter the coup, the members formed a new government and devised a program of reform. The radical 14-point reform proposal stated that the following conditions be met: an end to Korea's tributary relationship with China; the abolition of ruling-class privilege and the establishment of equal rights for all; the reorganisation of the government as virtually a constitutional monarchy; the revision of land tax laws; cancellation of the grain loan system; the unification of all internal fiscal administrations under the jurisdiction of the Ho-jo; the suppression of privileged merchants and the development of free commerce and trade, the creation of a modern police system including police patrols and royal guards; and severe punishment of corrupt officials.\nHowever, the new government lasted no longer than a few days. This was possibly inevitable, as the reformers were supported by no more than 140 Japanese troops who faced at least 1,500 Chinese garrisoned in Seoul, under the command of General Yuan Shikai. With the reform measures being a threat to her clan's power, Queen Min secretly requested military intervention from the Chinese. Consequently, within three days, even before the reform measures were made public, the coup was suppressed by Chinese troops who attacked and defeated the Japanese forces and restored power to the pro-Chinese faction. During the ensuing melee Hong Yeong-sik was killed, the Japanese legation building was burned down and forty Japanese were killed. The surviving Korean coup leaders including Kim Okkyun escaped to the port of Chemulpo under escort of the Japanese minister Takezoe. From there they boarded a Japanese ship for exile in Japan.\nIn January 1885, with a show of force the Japanese dispatched two battalions and seven warships to Korea, which resulted in the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1885, signed on 9 January 1885. The treaty restored diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. The Koreans also agreed to pay the Japanese \u00a5100,000 for damages to their legation and to provide a site for the building of a new legation. Prime Minister It\u014d Hirobumi, to overcome Japan's disadvantageous position in Korea followed by the abortive coup, visited China to discuss the matter with his Chinese counterpart, Li Hongzhang. The two parties succeeded in concluding the Convention of Tianjin on 31 May 1885. They also pledged to withdraw their troops from Korea within four months, with prior notification to the other if troops were to be sent to Korea in the future. After both countries withdrew their forces they left behind a precarious balance of power on the Korean Peninsula between the two nations. Meanwhile, Yuan Shikai remained in Seoul, appointed as the Chinese Resident, and continued to interfere with Korean domestic politics. The failure of the coup also marked a dramatic decline in Japanese influence over Korea.\nNagasaki incident.\nThe Nagasaki incident was a riot that took place in the Japanese port city of Nagasaki in 1886. Four warships from the Qing Empire's navy, the Beiyang Fleet, stopped at Nagasaki, apparently to carry out repairs. Some Chinese sailors caused trouble in the city and started the riot. Several Japanese policemen confronting the rioters were killed. The Qing government did not apologise after the incident, which resulted in a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan.\nBean controversy.\nA poor harvest in 1889 led the governor of Korea's Hamgyong Province to prohibit soybean exports to Japan. Japan requested and received compensation in 1893 for their importers. The incident highlighted the growing dependence Japan felt on Korean food imports.\nPrelude to the war.\nKim Okkyun affair.\nOn 28 March 1894, a pro-Japanese Korean revolutionary, Kim Okkyun, was assassinated in Shanghai. Kim had fled to Japan after his involvement in the 1884 coup, and the Japanese had turned down Korean demands for him to be extradited. Many Japanese activists saw in him potential for a future role in Korean modernisation; however, Meiji government leaders were more cautious. After some reservations, they exiled him to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands. Ultimately, he was lured to Shanghai, where he was killed by a Korean, Hong Jong-u, in his room at a Japanese inn in the International Settlement. After some hesitation, the Shanghai Municipal Council concluded that rules against extradition did not apply to a corpse and turned his body over to Chinese authorities. His body was then taken aboard a Chinese warship and sent back to Korea, where it was cut up by the Korean authorities, quartered and displayed in all Korean provinces as a warning to other purported rebels and traitors.\nIn Tokyo, the Japanese government took that as an outrageous affront. Kim Okkyun's brutal murder was portrayed as a betrayal by Li Hongzhang and a setback for Japan's stature and dignity. The Chinese authorities refused to press charges against the assassin, and he was even allowed to accompany Kim's mutilated body back to Korea, where he was showered with rewards and honours. Kim's assassination had also called Japan's commitment to its Korean supporters into question. The police in Tokyo had foiled an earlier attempt during the same year to assassinate Pak Y\u014fnghyo, one of the other Korean leaders of the 1884 uprising. When two suspected Korean assassins received asylum at the Korean legation, that had instigated a diplomatic outrage as well. Although the Japanese government could have immediately used Kim's assassination to its advantage, it concluded that since Kim had died on Chinese territory, the treatment of the corpse was outside its authority. \nThe shocking murder of the Korean inflamed Japanese opinion since many Japanese considered the Chinese-supported actions to be directed against Japan as well. To the Japanese, the Chinese had also showed their contempt for international law when they set free the suspected assassin, who had been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police and then, in accordance with treaty obligations, turned over to the Chinese for trial. Nationalistic groups immediately began to call for war with China.\nDonghak Rebellion.\nTensions ran high between China and Japan, but war was not yet inevitable, and the fury in Japan over Kim's assassination began to dissipate. However, in late April, the Donghak Rebellion erupted in Korea. Korean peasants rose up in open rebellion against oppressive taxation and incompetent financial administration of the Joseon government. It was the largest peasant rebellion in Korean history. However, on 1 June, rumours reached the Donghaks that the Chinese and Japanese were on the verge of sending troops and so the rebels agreed to a ceasefire to remove any grounds for foreign intervention.\nOn 2 June, the Japanese cabinet decided to send troops to Korea if China did the same. In May, the Chinese had taken steps to prepare for the mobilisation of their forces in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong and in Manchuria as a result of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. However, those actions were planned more as an armed demonstration to strengthen the Chinese position in Korea than as preparation for war against Japan. On 3 June, King Gojong, on the recommendation of the Min clan and at the insistence of Yuan Shikai, requested aid from the Chinese government in suppressing the Donghak Rebellion. Although the rebellion was not as serious as it had initially seemed and so the Chinese forces were not necessary, the decision was made to send 2,500 men under the command of General Ye Zhichao to the harbour of Asan, about from Seoul. The troops destined for Korea sailed on board three British-owned steamers chartered by the Chinese government, arriving at Asan on 9 June. On 25 June, a further 400 troops had arrived. Consequently, by the end of June, Ye Zhichao had about 2,800\u20132,900 soldiers under his command at Asan.\nClosely watching the events on the peninsula, the Japanese government had quickly become convinced that the rebellion would lead to Chinese intervention in Korea. As a result, soon after learning of the Korean government's request for Chinese military help, all Japanese warships in the vicinity were immediately ordered to Pusan and Chemulpo. By 9 June, Japanese warships had consecutively called at Chemulpo and Pusan. A formation of 420 sailors, selected from the crews of warships anchored in Chemulpo, was immediately dispatched to Seoul, where they served as a temporary counterbalance to the Chinese troops camped at Asan. Simultaneously, a reinforced brigade of approximately 8,000 troops (the Oshima Composite Brigade), under the command of General \u014cshima Yoshimasa, was also dispatched to Chemulpo by 27 June.\nAccording to the Japanese, the Chinese government had violated the Convention of Tientsin by not informing the Japanese government of its decision to send troops, but the Chinese claimed that Japan had approved the decision. The Japanese countered by sending an expeditionary force to Korea. The first 400 troops arrived on 9 June en route to Seoul, and 3,000 landed at Incheon on 12 June.\nHowever, Japanese officials denied any intention to intervene. As a result, the Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang \"was lured into believing that Japan would not wage war, but the Japanese were fully prepared to act\". The Qing government turned down Japan's suggestion for Japan and China to co-operate to reform the Korean government. When Korea demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from Korea, the Japanese refused.\nIn July 1894, the 8,000 Japanese troops captured the Korean king Gojong and occupied the Gyeongbokgung in Seoul. By 25 July, they had replaced the existing Korean government with members of the pro-Japanese faction. Even though Qing forces were already leaving Korea after they found themselves unneeded there, the new pro-Japanese Korean government granted Japan the right to expel Qing forces, and Japan dispatched more troops to Korea. The Qing Empire rejected the new Korean government as illegitimate.\nStatus of the combatants.\nJapan.\nJapanese reforms under the Meiji government gave significant priority to the creation of an effective modern national army and navy, especially naval construction. Japan sent numerous military officials abroad for training and evaluation of the relative strengths and tactics of Western armies and navies.\nImperial Japanese Navy.\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy was modelled after the British Royal Navy, at the time the foremost naval power. British advisors were sent to Japan to train the naval establishment, while Japanese students were in turn sent to Britain to study and observe the Royal Navy. Through drilling and tuition by Royal Navy instructors, Japan developed naval officers expert in the arts of gunnery and seamanship. At the start of hostilities, the Imperial Japanese Navy was composed of a fleet of 12 modern warships, (the protected cruiser \"Izumi\" being added during the war), eight corvettes, one ironclad warship, 26 torpedo boats, and numerous auxiliary/armed merchant cruisers and converted liners. During peacetime, the warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were divided among three main naval bases at Yokosuka, Kure and Sasebo and following mobilisation, the navy was composed of five divisions of seagoing warships and three flotillas of torpedo boats with a fourth being formed at the beginning of hostilities. The Japanese also had a relatively large merchant navy, which at the beginning of 1894 consisted of 288 vessels. Of these, 66 belonged to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha shipping company, which received national subsidies from the Japanese government to maintain the vessels for use by the navy in time of war. As a consequence, the navy could call on a sufficient number of auxiliaries and transports.\nJapan did not yet have the resources to acquire battleships and so planned to employ the \"Jeune \u00c9cole\" doctrine, which favoured small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, with the offensive capability to destroy larger craft. The Japanese naval leadership, on the eve of hostilities, was generally cautious and even apprehensive, as the navy had not yet received the warships ordered in February 1893, particularly the battleships and and the protected cruiser . Hence, initiating hostilities at the time was not ideal, and the navy was far less confident than the army about the outcome of a war with China.\nMany of Japan's major warships were built in British and French shipyards (eight British, three French and two Japanese-built) and 16 of the torpedo boats were known to have been built in France and assembled in Japan.\nImperial Japanese Army.\nThe Meiji government at first modelled their army after the French Army. French advisers had been sent to Japan with two military missions (in 1872\u20131880 and 1884), in addition to one mission under the shogunate. Nationwide conscription was enforced in 1873 and a Western-style conscript army was established; military schools and arsenals were also built. In 1886, Japan turned toward the German-Prussian model as the basis for its army, adopting German doctrines and the German military system and organisation. In 1885 Jakob Meckel, a German adviser, implemented new measures, such as the reorganisation of the command structure into divisions and regiments; the strengthening of army logistics, transportation, and structures (thereby increasing mobility); and the establishment of artillery and engineering regiments as independent commands. It was also an army that was equal to European armed forces in every respect.\nOn the eve of the outbreak of the war with China all men between the ages of 17 and 40 years were eligible for conscription, but only those who turned 20 were to be drafted while those who had turned 17 could volunteer. All men between the ages of 17 and 40, even those who had not received military training or were physically unfit, were considered part of the territorial militia or national guard (\"kokumin\"). Following the period of active military service (\"gen-eki\"), which lasted for three years, the soldiers became part of the first Reserve (\"y\u014dbi numbering 92,000 in 1893\") and then the second Reserve (\"k\u014dbi numbering 106,000 in 1893\"). All young and able-bodied men who did not receive basic military training due to exceptions and those conscripts who had not fully met the physical requirements of military service, became third Reserve (\"hoj\u016b\"). In time of war, the first Reserve (\"y\u014dbi\") were to be called up first and they were intended to fill the ranks of the regular army units. Next to be called up were the \"k\u014dbi\" reserve who were to be either used to further fill in the ranks of line units or to be formed into new ones. The \"hoj\u016b\" reserve members were to be called up only in exceptional circumstances, and the territorial militia or national guard would only be called up in case of an immediate enemy attack on or invasion of Japan.\nThe country was divided into six military districts (headquarters Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, Hiroshima and Kumamoto), with each being a recruitment area for a square infantry division consisting of two brigades of two regiments. Each of these divisions contained approximately 18,600 troops and 36 artillery pieces when mobilised. There was also an Imperial Guard division which recruited nationally, from all around Japan. This division was also composed of two brigades but had instead two-battalion, not three-battalion, regiments; consequently its numerical strength after mobilisation was 12,500 troops and 24 artillery pieces. In addition, there were fortress troops consisting of approximately six battalions, the Colonial Corps of about 4,000 troops which was stationed on Hokkaido and the Ryukyu Islands, and a battalion of military police in each of the districts. In peacetime the regular army had a total of fewer than 70,000 men, while after mobilisation the numbers rose to over 220,000. Moreover, the army still had a trained reserve, which, following the mobilisation of the first-line divisions, could be formed into reserve brigades. These reserve brigades each consisted of four battalions, a cavalry unit, a company of engineers, an artillery battery and rear-echelon units. They were to serve as recruiting bases for their front-line divisions and could also perform secondary combat operations, and if necessary they could be expanded into full divisions with a total of 24 territorial force regiments. However, formation of these units was hindered by a lack of sufficient amounts of equipment, especially uniforms.\nJapanese troops were equipped with the 8-mm single-shot Murata Type 18 breech-loading rifle. The improved eight-round-magazine Type 22 was just being introduced and consequently in 1894, on the eve of the war, only the Imperial Guard and 4th Division were equipped with these rifles. The division artillery consisted of 75-mm field guns and mountain pieces manufactured in Osaka. The artillery was based on Krupp designs that were adapted by the Italians at the beginning of the 1880s; although it could hardly be described as modern in 1894, in general it still matched contemporary battlefield requirements.\nBy the 1890s, Japan had at its disposal a modern, professionally trained Western-style army which was relatively well equipped and supplied. Its officers had studied in Europe and were well educated in the latest strategy and tactics. By the start of the war, the Imperial Japanese Army could field a total force of 120,000 men in two armies and five divisions.\nThe Japanese army despite the integration of supply troops into its divisions was unable to rely on its pre-existing logistical system and personnel to sustain its armies in the field with 153,000 labourers, contractors, and drivers being contracted to sustain the armies in the field. Supply issues and a general lack of preparedness for a sustained war would routinely delay operations and slow down the Japanese field armies as seen in the Yingkou Campaign, troops often had to forage or steal from the local populace and medicine and winter clothing was often in short supply during the latter stages of the war.\nThe Japanese Army also possessed a large amount of coastal guns at key locations which could be used for siege operations, these weapons were as follows:\nChina.\nThe prevailing view in many Western circles was that the modernised Chinese military would crush the Japanese. Observers commended Chinese units such as the Huai Army and Beiyang Fleet. The German General Staff predicted a Japanese defeat and William Lang, who was a British advisor to the Chinese military, praised Chinese training, ships, guns, and fortifications, stating that \"in the end, there is no doubt that Japan must be utterly crushed\".\nImperial Chinese Army.\nThe Qing dynasty did not have a unified national army, but was made up of three main components, with the so-called Eight Banners forming the elite. The Eight Banners forces were segregated along ethnic lines into separate Manchu, Han Chinese, Mongol, Hui (Muslim) and other ethnic formations. Bannermen who made up the Eight Banners got higher pay than the rest of the army while the Manchu received further privileges. In total, there were 250,000 soldiers in the Eight Banners, with over 60 per cent kept in garrisons in Beijing, while the remaining 40 per cent served as garrison troops in other major Chinese cities. The Green Standard Army was a 600,000-strong gendarmerie-type force that was recruited from the majority Han Chinese population. Its soldiers were not given any peacetime basic military training, but were expected to fight in any conflict. The third component was an irregular force called the Braves, which were used as a kind of reserve force for the regular army, and which were usually recruited from the more distant or remote provinces of China. They were formed into very loosely organised units from the same province. The Braves were sometimes described as mercenaries, with their volunteers receiving as much military training as their commanders saw fit. With no fixed unit organisation, it is impossible to know how many battle-ready Braves there actually were in 1894. There were also a few other military formations, one of which was the Huai Army, which was under the personal authority of Li Hongzhang and was created originally to suppress the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864). The Huai Army had received limited training by Western military advisors; numbering nearly 45,000 troops, it was considered the best-armed military unit in China.\nHowever, there is no definitive estimate for the size of the Qing armies in this war and scholarly estimates vary widely.\nThe Japanese Imperial General Staff estimated that they would face no more than 350,000 effective Chinese soldiers. This corresponds well with the estimate of the Board of war from 1898 which states that the total of the provincial militia, Defense army (Yong ying), Disciplined army (modernised Green standard), and new-style forces (organised after the war) was approximately 360,000. Du Boulay confirms this with the total army strength of the army in Zhili, Shandong and Manchuria amounting to 357,100 (Zhili, Shandong, and Manchuria) and 1,000,000 total trained men in the empire.\nDue to various factors such as the limited transport capacity (the absence of any railway in the combat zone), provincial infighting and a general lack of capacity for accommodating soldiers, only a small portion of the army that could be fielded was actually deployed, even forces that were mobilised, including the strong Hunan forces of Liu Kunyi were not able to arrive in time to make a meaningful difference. This meant that the fighting primarily fell on the forces already in Zhili, Shandong and Manchuria. This was a similar situation as what occurred in the Opium Wars, as the much larger Chinese army found itself outnumbered in those conflicts as it did this one.\nChinese forces were also far behind the Japanese in terms of support services; there was a complete absence of engineers, quartermasters, transportation, signal and medical troops. Hired labour (coolies) often performed transportation duties and rudimentary engineering tasks, supply was organised by the province where the soldiers were fighting and left to civilian officials assigned as quartermasters and a few doctors were attached to the army at the rear. This lack of adequate supply organisation led to some units receiving the wrong ammunition for their rifles (on the presumption they possessed rifles).\nThe basic tactical unit of the Chinese army was the battalion (ying), composed on paper of 500 men, though in reality actual strength was 350 for the infantry and 250 for the cavalry. Up to a dozen of these Ying would form an independent corps, and only at a corps level did Chinese units receive artillery.\nAlthough the Chinese had established arsenals to produce firearms, and a large number of them had been imported from abroad, 40 per cent of Chinese troops at the outbreak of the war were not issued with rifles or even muskets. Instead they were armed with a variety of swords, spears, pikes, halberds, and bows and arrows. Against well-trained, well-armed, and disciplined Japanese troops, they would have little chance. Those units that did have firearms were equipped with a heterogeneity of weapons, from a variety of modern rifles to old-fashioned muskets; this lack of standardisation led to a major problem with the proper supply of ammunition.\nChinese troops were often not drilled in how to use their guns with training conducted with spears. Due to the officer corps' resistance to modern training practices, training with guns was performed only at a distance of 50\u00a0ft instead of the longer ranges which were more common in combat. There was also a lack of discipline within the army, as troops would routinely flee before, during, or after combat as occurred in the Battle of Pyongyang. Chinese artillerymen likewise did not receive adequate training in operating their artillery pieces.\nThe Imperial Chinese Army in 1894 was a heterogeneous mixture of modernised, partly modernised, and almost medieval units which no commander could have led successfully, resulting in poor leadership among Chinese officers. Chinese officers did not know how to handle their troops and the older, higher-ranking officers still believed that they could fight a war as they had during the Taiping Rebellion of 1850\u20131864. This was also the result of the Chinese military forces being divided into largely independent regional commands. The soldiers were drawn from diverse provinces that had no affinity with each other. Chinese troops also suffered from poor morale, largely because many of the troops had not been paid for a long time. The low prestige of soldiers in Chinese society also hindered morale, and the use of opium and other narcotics was rife throughout the army. Low morale and poor leadership seriously reduced the effectiveness of Chinese troops, and contributed to defeats such as the abandonment of the very well-fortified and defensible Weihaiwei. Additionally, military logistics were lacking, as the construction of railroads in Manchuria had been discouraged.\nThe Huai Army troops (also sometimes referred to as the Beiyang Army), although they were a small minority in the overall Imperial Chinese Army, were to take part in the majority of the fighting during the war. They were organised in 51 battalions and were estimated to number from 25,000 to 45,000. The Huai Army units that faced the Japanese in Korea did have a significant amount of modern weaponry, including Mauser breech-loading rifles that were comparable to the Murata rifles of the Japanese, and Krupp artillery pieces. After their defeat in Korea, the Qing deployed additional forces to defend northeast China, including partially-reformed Green Standard troops that were poorly equipped.\nBeiyang Fleet.\nThe Beiyang Fleet was one of the four modernised Chinese navies in the late Qing dynasty. The navies were heavily sponsored by Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili who had also created the Huai Army. The Beiyang Fleet was the dominant navy in East Asia before the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese themselves were apprehensive about facing the Chinese fleet, especially the two German-built battleships \u2013 and \u2013 to which the Japanese had no comparable counterparts. However, China's advantages were more apparent than real as most of the Chinese warships were over-age and obsolescent; the ships were also not maintained properly and indiscipline was common among their crews. The greater armour of major Chinese warships and the greater weight of broadside they could fire were more than offset by the number of quick-firing guns on most first-line Japanese warships, which gave the Japanese the edge in any sustained exchange of salvos. The worst feature of both Chinese battleships was actually their main armament; each was armed with short-barreled guns in twin barbettes mounted in echelon which could fire only in restricted arcs. The short barrels of the Chinese main armament meant that the shells had a low muzzle velocity and poor penetration, and their accuracy was also poor at long ranges.\nTactically, Chinese naval vessels entered the war with only the crudest set of instructions\u00a0\u2013 ships that were assigned to designated pairs were to keep together and all ships were to fight end-on, as far forward from the beam as possible, a tactic dictated by the obsolescent arrangement of guns aboard Chinese warships. The only vague resemblance of a fleet tactic was that all ships were to follow the visible movements of the flagship, an arrangement made necessary because the signal book used by the Chinese was written in English, a language with which few officers in the Beiyang Fleet had any familiarity.\nWhen it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1888, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her adopted son, the Guangxu Emperor, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan's victories over China has often been falsely rumoured to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy's defeat because Cixi embezzled funds from the navy to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, extensive research by Chinese historians revealed that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy's decline. In actuality, China's defeat was caused by the Guangxu Emperor's lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on.\nThe total strength of the entire Imperial Chinese navy was:\nContemporaneous wars waged by the Qing.\nWhile the Qing was fighting the First Sino-Japanese War, it was also simultaneously engaging rebels in the Dungan Revolt in northwestern China, where thousands lost their lives. The generals Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang and Ma Haiyan were initially summoned by the Qing government to bring the Hui troops under their command to participate in the First Sino-Japanese War, but they were eventually sent to suppress the Dungan Revolt instead.\nEarly stages.\n1 June 1894: The Donghak Rebel Army moves toward Seoul. The Korean government requests help from the Qing government to suppress the revolt.\n6 June 1894: About 2,465 Chinese soldiers are transported to Korea to suppress the Donghak Rebellion. Japan asserts that it was not notified and thus China has violated the Convention of Tientsin, which requires that China and Japan must notify each other before intervening in Korea. China asserts that Japan was notified and approved of Chinese intervention.\n8 June 1894: First of about 4,000 Japanese soldiers and 500 marines land at Chemulpo.\n11 June 1894: Ceasefire during the Donghak Rebellion.\n13 June 1894: The Japanese government telegraphs the commander of the Japanese forces in Korea, \u014ctori Keisuke, to remain in Korea for as long as possible despite the end of the rebellion.\n16 June 1894: Japanese foreign minister Mutsu Munemitsu meets with Wang Fengzao, the Qing ambassador to Japan, to discuss the future status of Korea. Wang states that the Qing government intends to pull out of Korea after the rebellion has been suppressed and expects Japan to do the same. However, China retains a resident to look after Chinese primacy in Korea.\n22 June 1894: Additional Japanese troops arrive in Korea. Japanese prime minister It\u014d Hirobumi tells Matsukata Masayoshi that since the Qing Empire appear to be making military preparations, there is probably \"no policy but to go to war\". Mutsu tells \u014ctori to press the Korean government on the Japanese demands.\n26 June 1894: \u014ctori presents a set of reform proposals to the Korean king Gojong. Gojong's government rejects the proposals and instead insists on troop withdrawals.\n7 July 1894: Failure of mediation between China and Japan arranged by the British ambassador to China.\n19 July 1894: Establishment of the Japanese Combined Fleet, consisting of almost all vessels in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Mutsu cables \u014ctori to take any necessary steps to compel the Korean government to carry out a reform program.\n23 July 1894: Japanese troops occupy Seoul, capture Gojong, and establish a new, pro-Japanese government, which terminates all Sino-Korean treaties and grants the Imperial Japanese Army the right to expel the Qing Empire's Beiyang Army from Korea.\n25 July 1894: First battle of the war: the Battle of Pungdo / Hoto-oki kaisen\nEvents during the war.\nOpening troop movements.\nBy July 1894, Chinese forces in Korea numbered 3,000\u20133,500 and they were outnumbered by Japanese troops. They could only be supplied by sea through Asan Bay. The Japanese objective was first to blockade the Chinese at Asan and then encircle them with their land forces. Japan's initial strategy was to gain command of the sea, which was critical to its operations in Korea. Command of the sea would allow Japan to transport troops to the mainland. The army's Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces north-west up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending on the outcome of this engagement, Japan would make one of three choices. If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively, the larger part of the Japanese army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between Shan-hai-kuan and Tientsin to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the engagement were to be a draw and neither side gained control of the sea, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action.\nSinking of the \"Kowshing\".\nOn 25 July 1894, the cruisers \"Yoshino\", \"Naniwa\" and \"Akitsushima\" of the Japanese flying squadron, which had been patrolling off Asan Bay, encountered the Chinese cruiser \"Jiyuan\" and gunboat \"Kwang-yi\". These vessels had steamed out of Asan to meet the transport \"Kowshing\", escorted by the Chinese gunboat \"Tsao-kiang\". After an hour-long engagement, the \"Jiyuan\" escaped while the \"Kwang-yi\" grounded on rocks, where its powder magazine exploded.\nThe \"Kowshing\" was a 2,134-ton British merchant vessel owned by the Indochina Steam Navigation Company of London, commanded by Captain T. R. Galsworthy and crewed by 64 men. The ship was chartered by the Qing government to ferry troops to Korea, and was on her way to reinforce Asan with 1,100 troops plus supplies and equipment. A German artillery officer, Major von Hanneken, advisor to the Chinese, was also aboard. The ship was due to arrive on 25 July.\nThe Japanese cruiser \"Naniwa\", under Captain T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, intercepted the \"Kowshing\" and captured its escort. The Japanese then ordered the \"Kowshing\" to follow \"Naniwa\" and directed that Europeans be transferred to \"Naniwa\". However, the 1,100 Chinese on board, desperate to return to Taku, threatened to kill the English captain, Galsworthy, and his crew. After four hours of negotiations, Captain Togo gave the order to fire upon the vessel. A torpedo missed, but a subsequent broadside hit the \"Kow Shing\", which started to sink.\nIn the confusion, some of the Europeans escaped overboard, only to be fired upon by the Chinese. The Japanese rescued three of the British crew (the captain, first officer and quartermaster) and 50 Chinese, and took them to Japan. The sinking of the \"Kowshing\" almost caused a diplomatic incident between Japan and Britain, but the action was ruled in conformity with international law regarding the treatment of mutineers (the Chinese troops). Many observers considered the troops lost on board the \"Kowshing\" to have been the best the Chinese had.\nThe German gunboat rescued 150 Chinese, the French gunboat \"Le Lion\" rescued 43, and the British cruiser HMS \"Porpoise\" rescued an unknown number.\nFighting in southern Korea.\nCommissioned by the new pro-Japanese Korean government to forcibly expel Chinese forces, on 25 July Major-General \u014cshima Yoshimasa led a mixed brigade numbering about 4,000 on a rapid forced march from Seoul south toward Asan Bay to face Chinese troops garrisoned at Seonghwan Station east of Asan and Kongju.\nThe Chinese forces stationed near Seonghwan under the command of General Ye Zhichao numbered about 3,880 men. They had anticipated the impending arrival of the Japanese by fortifying their position with trenches, earthworks including six redoubts protected by abatis and by the flooding of surrounding rice fields. But expected Chinese reinforcements had been lost on board the British-chartered transport \"Kowshing\". Units of the Chinese main force were deployed east and northeast of Asan, near the main road leading to Seoul; the key positions held by the Chinese were the towns of Seonghwan and Cheonan. Approximately 3,000 troops were stationed at Seonghwan, while 1,000 men along with General Ye Zhichao were at headquarters at Cheonan. The remaining Chinese troops were stationed in Asan itself. The Chinese had been preparing for a pincer movement against the Korean capital by massing troops at Pyongyang in the north and Asan in the south.\nOn the morning of 27\u201328 July 1894, the two forces met just outside Asan in an engagement that lasted till 07:30 the next morning. The battle began with a diversionary attack by Japanese troops, followed by the main attack which quickly outflanked the Chinese defences. The Chinese troops, witnessing that they were being outflanked, left their defensive positions and fled towards the direction of Asan. The Chinese gradually lost ground to the superior Japanese numbers, and finally broke and fled towards Pyongyang abandoning arms, ammunition and all their artillery. The Japanese took the city of Asan on 29 July, breaking the Chinese encirclement of Seoul. The Chinese suffered 500 killed and wounded while the Japanese suffered 88 casualties. General Ye Zhichao reported to the Emperor that he had in fact won the battle and caused over 2,000 casualties to the Japanese forces, for which his army was rewarded with 20,000 taels. He then reported later that 20,000 Japanese attacked him and he inflicted a further 1,500 casualties to his 300 losses and the strategic situation compelled him to withdraw to Pyongyang where en route he inflicted a further 1,500 casualties. Ye's reports of the battle of Seonghwan were received in Beijing in August over a month after the battle occurred, an indication of the lack of proper systems of communication within the Qing army.\nDeclaration of War.\nOn 1 August 1894, war was officially declared between China and Japan. The rationale, language and tone given by the rulers of both nations in their respective declarations of war were markedly different.\nThe tenor of the Japanese declaration of war, issued in the name of the Meiji Emperor, appears to have had at least one eye fixed on the wider international community using phrases such as 'Family of Nations', the 'Law of Nations' and making additional references to international treaties. This was in sharp contrast to the Chinese approach to foreign relations which historically was noted for refusing to treat with other nations on an equal diplomatic footing, and instead insistent on such foreign powers paying tribute to the Chinese Emperor as vassals. In keeping with the traditional Chinese approach to its neighbours, the Chinese declaration of war stated the palpable disdain for the Japanese can be surmised from the repeated use of the term \"Wojen\" which translates to 'dwarf', an ancient intentionally offensive and highly derogative term for the Japanese.\nThis use of the pejorative to describe a foreign nation was not unusual for Chinese official documents of the time\u00a0\u2013 so much so that a major bone of contention between Imperial China and the Treaty Powers of the day had previously been the habitual use of the Chinese character \u5937 ('Yi'...which literally meant 'barbarian'), to refer to those termed otherwise as 'foreign devils' typically describing those powers occupying the treaty ports. The use of the term 'Yi' (\u5937) by Chinese Imperial officials had in fact been considered so provocative by the Treaty Powers that the collective bundle of accords known as the Treaty of Tientsin negotiated in 1858 to end the Second Opium War explicitly proscribed the Chinese Imperial Court from using the term 'Yi' to refer to officials, subjects, or citizens of the belligerent powers, the signatories seemingly feeling it necessary to extract this specific demand from the Xianfeng Emperor's representatives. In the thirty-five years elapsing since the Treaty of Tientsin, however, the language of the Chinese Emperors would appear to change little with regards to its neighbour Japan.\nBattle of Pyongyang.\nAfter the initial fighting further to the south in July 1894, the Chinese ground forces focused on holding Pyongyang, beyond which there were no other defensible positions until the Yalu River, the border between Korea and China. The city was near a river to the south and east, mountains to the north, and was surrounded by walls. The Qing deployed 13,000 troops there from China, and the defenders spent almost two months preparing fortifications after they arrived in the city on 4 August, including 27 forts. The Chinese were planning to use Pyongyang as their headquarters from where they would retake the rest of the Korean peninsula. The Qing forces in the city had a large quantity of modern equipment, and some of their best troops.\nAt 04:30 on 15 September, the Imperial Japanese Army converged on the city of Pyongyang from four directions, with a total of 23,800 troops. They launched an artillery barrage from the east and a feint from the south as a diversion from the main attack, coming from the north, which was the easiest direction to approach from. The Chinese put up a strong resistance, and it was some of the fiercest fighting of the war, but they did not fire on Japanese troops crossing the river and were not expecting another attack from the north. Once the Japanese entered the city, the defenders were defeated and the survivors fled, being attacked by a separate Japanese force as they retreated. The Japanese captured 35 artillery pieces, hundreds of rifles, and ammunition. The troops led by the Chinese Hui Muslim general Zuo Baogui notably fought well, until he was killed in action by Japanese artillery.\nTaking advantage of heavy rainfall overnight, the remaining Chinese troops escaped Pyongyang and headed northeast toward the coastal city of Uiju. In the early morning of 16 September, the entire Japanese army entered Pyongyang.\nDefeat of the Beiyang fleet.\nIn early September, Li Hongzhang decided to reinforce the Chinese forces at Pyongyang by employing the Beiyang fleet to escort transports to the mouth of the Taedong River. About 4,500 additional troops stationed in the Zhili were to be redeployed. On 12 September, half of the troops embarked at Dagu on five specially chartered transports and headed to Dalian where two days later on 14 September, they were joined by another 2,000 soldiers. Initially, Admiral Ding wanted to send the transports under a light escort with only a few ships, while the main force of the Beiyang Fleet would locate and operate directly against the Combined Fleet to prevent the Japanese from intercepting the convoy. But the appearance of the Japanese cruisers \"Yoshino\" and \"Naniwa\" on a reconnaissance sortie near Weihaiwei thwarted these plans. The Chinese had mistaken them for the main Japanese fleet. Consequently, on 12 September, the entire Beiyang Fleet departed Dalian heading for Weihaiwei, arriving near the Shandong Peninsula the next day. The Chinese warships spent the entire day cruising the area, waiting for the Japanese. However, since there was no sighting of the Japanese fleet, Admiral Ding decided to return to Dalian, reaching the port in the morning of 15 September. As Japanese troops moved north to attack Pyongyang, Admiral It\u014d correctly guessed that the Chinese would attempt to reinforce their army in Korea by sea. On 14 September, the Combined Fleet steamed northwards to search the Korean and Chinese coasts to bring the Beiyang Fleet to battle.\nThe Japanese victory at Pyongyang had succeeded in pushing Chinese troops north to the Yalu River, in the process removing all effective Chinese military presence on the Korean Peninsula.\nShortly before the convoy's departure, Admiral Ding received a message concerning the battle at Pyongyang informing him about the defeat. Subsequently, it made the redeployment of the troops to the mouth of the Taedong river unnecessary. Admiral Ding then correctly assumed that the next Chinese line of defence would be established on the Yalu River, and decided to redeploy the embarked soldiers there. On 16 September, the convoy of five transport ships departed from Dalian Bay under escort from the vessels of the Beiyang Fleet which included the two ironclad battleships \"Dingyuan\" and \"Zhenyuan\". Reaching the mouth of the Yalu River, the transports disembarked the troops, and the landing operation lasted until the following morning.\nOn 17 September 1894, the Japanese Combined Fleet encountered the Chinese Beiyang Fleet off the mouth of the Yalu River. The naval battle, which lasted from late morning to dusk, resulted in a Japanese victory. Although the Chinese were able to land 4,500 troops near the Yalu River by sunset the Beiyang fleet was near the point of total collapse\u00a0\u2013 most of the fleet had fled or had been sunk and the two largest ships \"Dingyuan\" and \"Zhenyuan\" were nearly out of ammunition. The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed eight of the ten Chinese warships, assuring Japan's command of the Yellow Sea. The principal factor in the Japanese victory was its superiority in speed and firepower. The victory shattered the morale of the Chinese naval forces. The Battle of the Yalu River was the largest naval engagement of the war and was a major propaganda victory for Japan.\nInvasion of Manchuria.\nAfter taking Pyongyang and defeating the Chinese fleet near the Yalu River, the Japanese focused on capturing China's two naval bases guarding the approaches to the Qing capital: Port Arthur on the Liaodong Peninsula in northeast China (Manchuria), and Weihaiwei on the Shandong Peninsula, one on each side of the entrance to the Bohai Sea. Another force would capture Mukden, the main city in Manchuria. This plan included landing additional troops by ship near both naval bases, while the forces in Korea would march into Manchuria from the Korean border. After taking these objectives, the Imperial Japanese Army could make a pincer movement on Beijing.\nWith the defeat at Pyongyang, the Chinese abandoned northern Korea and took up defensive positions in fortifications along their side of the Yalu River at Jiuliancheng, with additional fortifications being built along the river bank to the north and to the south. The best equipped Chinese troops, the Huai Army, had been used for the defence of Korea, and after their defeat the Qing government had to deploy additional units to defend Manchuria, such as the partially-reformed Green Standard Army. The Chinese force at Jiuliancheng was commanded by General Song Qing.\nThe Japanese First Army under General Aritomo Yamagata marched from Pyongyang and arrived at the Yalu River on 23 October. On the 24th, the Japanese successfully crossed the Yalu River, undetected, by using a pontoon bridge. Yamagata planned to first attack the Chinese at Hushan, to the north of Jiuliancheng, to distract the defenders before then launching his main attack at their center in Jiuliancheng. The following afternoon of 25 October, they successfully captured Hushan, and intended to attack Jiuliancheng the next morning, but when they arrived there the Japanese found that the defenders had fled. The entire line of fortifications along the Yalu River, from Hushan to Andong in the south, had been abandoned by the Chinese by the 26th. They first withdrew to Fenghuangcheng, before abandoning that city on 30 October as the Japanese pursued them. The Japanese occupied it, and on 15 November they captured Xiuyan, a town west of Fenghuangcheng. After the Japanese established control over the border region, they planned on moving south along the coast to take Port Arthur and other towns in the area (including Jinzhou and Dalian), so they could land more troops. Song Qing's forces retreated in the opposite direction, toward Mukden, because it was the homeland of Manchus and had symbolic importance for the Qing dynasty. The Japanese Second Army under General \u014cyama Iwao arrived by ship near the peninsula on 24 October in preparation to advance on Port Arthur.\nFall of L\u00fcshunkou.\nBy 21 November 1894, the Japanese had taken the city of L\u00fcshunkou (Port Arthur) with minimal resistance and suffering minimal casualties. Describing their motives as having encountered a display of the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers as they invaded the town, Japanese forces proceeded with the unrestrained killing of civilians during the Port Arthur Massacre with unconfirmed estimates in the thousands. This event was at the time widely viewed with scepticism, as the world at large was still in disbelief that the Japanese were capable of such deeds\u00a0\u2013 it seemed more likely to have been exaggerated propagandist fabrications of a Chinese government to discredit Japanese hegemony. In reality, the Chinese government itself was unsure how to react and initially denied the occurrence of the loss of Port Arthur to the Japanese altogether.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; As we entered the town of Port Arthur, we saw the head of a Japanese soldier displayed on a wooden stake. This filled us with rage and a desire to crush any Chinese soldier. Anyone we saw in the town, we killed. The streets were filled with corpses, so many they blocked our way. We killed people in their homes; by and large, there wasn't a single house without from three to six dead. Blood was flowing and the smell was awful. We sent out search parties. We shot some, hacked at others. The Chinese troops just dropped their arms and fled. Firing and slashing, it was unbounded joy. At this time, our artillery troops were at the rear, giving three cheers [\"banzai\"] for the emperor.\nBy 10 December 1894, Kaipeng (present-day Gaizhou) fell to the Japanese First Army. That same month, Nozu Michitsura was given command of the First Army, replacing Yamagata who had fallen ill.\nFall of Weihaiwei.\nThe Chinese fleet subsequently retreated behind the Weihaiwei fortifications. However, it was then surprised by Japanese ground forces, who outflanked the harbour's defences in coordination with the navy. The Battle of Weihaiwei was a 23-day siege with the major land and naval engagements taking place between 20 January and 12 February 1895. Historian Jonathan Spence notes that \"the Chinese admiral retired his fleet behind a protective curtain of contact mines and took no further part in the fighting.\" The Japanese commander marched his forces over the Shandong peninsula and reached the landward side of Weihaiwei, where the siege was eventually successful for the Japanese.\nAdvance in Manchuria and peace talks.\nAfter Weihaiwei's fall on 12 February 1895, and an easing of harsh winter conditions, Japanese troops pressed further into southern Manchuria and northern China. Two Chinese officials had been appointed by the Qing imperial court two months earlier and were sent to meet with Japanese representatives to inquire about peace terms. After some delay they arrived in late January, but the Japanese did not consider them to have enough credentials and noted that they had not been empowered by their government to make decisions. On 2 February 1895, the envoys were told by the Japanese government that their peace mission was not considered to be serious. After the failed talks, Japanese troops of General Katsura Tar\u014d's 3rd Division fought off a Chinese attempt to liberate the city of Haicheng on 16 February, and then went on to capture Liaoyang on 4 March and Yingkou on 6 March. This left no more Chinese forces between the Japanese and the Shanhai Pass, which connected Manchuria to Zhili, giving them control over the approaches to Tianjin and Beijing.\nIn late February the Qing government appointed Li Hongzhang as ambassador extraordinary to open peace talks with Japan, and the Japanese accepted this on 4 March, because he was seen as the leading Chinese statesman. Li and his delegation arrived in Shimonoseki, Japan, on the 19th and were met by the Japanese prime minister and foreign minister, It\u014d Hirobumi and Mutsu Munemitsu. The Chinese request for an armistice was rejected because the conditions that the Japanese insisted for it were unacceptable, and Li was informed that a Japanese invasion force was on its way to Taiwan. On 24 March, after leaving a meeting, Li was shot and injured by a Japanese nationalist. The incident caused international outrage from the Western press and led to the Meiji Emperor issuing a statement to show his grief and regret. An armistice in Manchuria and north China was agreed to on 30 March 1895, and negotiations for the final treaty continued for another three weeks.\nOccupation of the Pescadores Islands.\nEven before the peace negotiations were set to begin at Shimonoseki, the Japanese had begun preparations for the capture of Taiwan. However, the first operation would be directed not against the island itself, but against the Pescadores Islands, which due to their strategic position off the west coast would become a stepping stone for further operations against the island. On 6 March, a Japanese expeditionary force consisting of a reinforced infantry regiment with 2,800 troops and an artillery battery were embarked on five transports, and sailed from Ujina to Sasebo, arriving there three days later. On 15 March, the five transports, escorted by seven cruisers and five torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla, left Sasebo heading south. The Japanese fleet arrived at the Pescadores during the night of 20 March, but encountered stormy weather. Due to the poor weather, the landings were postponed until 23 March, when the weather cleared.\nOn the morning 23 March, the Japanese warships began the bombardment of the Chinese positions around the port of Lizhangjiao. A fort guarding the harbour was quickly silenced. At about midday, the Japanese troops began their landing. Unexpectedly, when the landing operation was underway, the guns of the fort once again opened fire, which caused some confusion among the Japanese troops. But they were soon silenced again after being shelled by the Japanese cruisers. By 14:00, Lizhangjiao was under Japanese control. After reinforcing the captured positions, the following morning, Japanese troops marched on the main town of Magong. The Chinese offered token resistance and after a short skirmish they abandoned their positions, retreating to nearby Xiyu Island. At 11:30, the Japanese entered Magong, but as soon as they had taken the coastal forts in the town, they were fired upon by the Chinese coastal battery on Xiyu Island. The barrage went unanswered until nightfall, as the Chinese had destroyed all the guns at Magong before they retreated, and Japanese warships feared entering the strait between the Penghu and Xiyu Islands due to the potential threat posed by mines. However, it caused no serious casualties among the Japanese forces. During the night, a small naval gunnery crew of 30 managed to make one of the guns of the Magong coastal battery operational. At dawn, the gun began shelling the Chinese positions on Xiyu, but the Chinese guns did not respond. Subsequently, the Japanese crossed the narrow strait, reaching Xiyu, discovering that the Chinese troops had abandoned their positions during the night and escaped on board local vessels.\nThe Japanese warships entered the strait the next day and, upon discovering that there were no mine fields, they entered Magong harbour. By 26 March, all the islands of the archipelago were under Japanese control, and Rear Admiral Tanaka Tsunatsune was appointed governor. During the campaign the Japanese lost 28 killed and wounded, while the Chinese losses were almost 350 killed or wounded and nearly 1,000 taken prisoner. This operation effectively prevented Chinese forces in Taiwan from being reinforced, and allowed the Japanese to press their demand for the cession of Taiwan in the peace negotiations.\nEnd of the war.\nTreaty of Shimonoseki.\nThe Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on 17 April 1895. China recognised the total independence of Korea and ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands to Japan \"in perpetuity\". The disputed islands known as \"Senkaku/Diaoyu\" islands were not named by this treaty, but Japan annexed these uninhabited islands to Okinawa Prefecture in 1895. Japan asserts this move was taken independently of the treaty ending the war, and China asserts that they were implied as part of the cession of Taiwan.\nAdditionally, China was to pay Japan 200\u00a0million taels (8,000,000\u00a0kg/17,600,000\u00a0lb) of silver as war reparations. The Qing government also signed a commercial treaty permitting Japanese ships to operate on the Yangtze River, to operate manufacturing factories in treaty ports and to open four more ports to foreign trade. Russia, Germany and France in a few days made the Triple Intervention, however, and forced Japan to give up the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for another 30\u00a0million taels of silver (equivalent to about 450\u00a0million yen).\nAfter the war, the Qing government paid 200\u00a0million Kuping taels, or 311,072,865 yen, making the war a net profit for Japan, as their war fund was only 250,000,000 yen.\nJapanese invasion of Taiwan.\n\"The cession of the island to Japan was received with such disfavour by the Chinese inhabitants that a large military force was required to effect its occupation. For nearly two years afterwards, a bitter guerrilla resistance was offered to the Japanese troops, and large forces \u2013 over 100,000 men, it was stated at the time \u2013 were required for its suppression. This was not accomplished without much cruelty on the part of the conquerors, who, in their march through the island, perpetrated all the worst excesses of war. They had, undoubtedly, considerable provocation. They were constantly ambushed by enemies, and their losses from battle and disease far exceeded the entire loss of the whole Japanese army throughout the Manchurian campaign. But their revenge was often taken on innocent villagers. Men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered or became the victims of unrestrained lust and rapine. The result was to drive from their homes thousands of industrious and peaceful peasants, who, long after the main resistance had been completely crushed, continued to wage a vendetta war, and to generate feelings of hatred which the succeeding years of conciliation and good government have not wholly eradicated.\" \u2013 The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 12\nSeveral Qing officials in Taiwan resolved to resist the cession of Taiwan to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and on 23 May declared the island to be an independent Republic of Formosa. On 29 May, Japanese forces under Admiral Kabayama Sukenori landed in northern Taiwan, and in a five-month campaign defeated the Republican forces and occupied the island's main towns. The campaign effectively ended on 21 October 1895, with the flight of Liu Yongfu, the second Republican president, and the surrender of the Republican capital Tainan.\nAftermath.\nIn Japan.\nThe Japanese success during the war was the result of the modernisation and industrialisation embarked upon two decades earlier. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training from the adoption of a Western-style military. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy inflicted a string of defeats on the Chinese through foresight, endurance, strategy and power of organisation. Japan's prestige rose in the eyes of the world, and the victory reflected the success of the Meiji Restoration. Japan suffered only a small loss of lives and treasure in return for the dominance of Taiwan, the Pescadores, and the Liaotung Peninsula in China. Its decisions of abandoning the policy of isolation and learning advanced policy from Western countries also became a good example for other Asian countries to follow. As a result of the war, Japan started to have equal status with the Western powers, and its victory established Japan as the dominant power in Asia, with them gaining several much needed resources such as iron for their continued modernisation and expansion. It also heightened Japanese ambitions of aggression and military expansion in Asia. Because Japan had benefited a lot from the treaty, it stimulated Japanese ambition to continue to involve herself in affairs in China and made the late-Imperial Chinese national crisis unprecedentedly serious. The degree of semi-colonisation was greatly deepened. After Japan's victory, the Western powers agreed tacitly that they should delimit their benefits from China promptly. They then started to partition China over the next few years, arranging a score of treaty ports and concessions in 1897-98 like Guangzhouwan and Port Arthur.\nIn China.\nFor China, the war revealed the high level of corruption present in the government and policies of the Qing administration. Although the Qing court had invested heavily in modern ships for the Beiyang Fleet, the institutional weakness of the Qing did not allow the development of effective naval power. Traditionally, China viewed Japan as a subordinate part of the Chinese cultural sphere. China had been defeated by European powers in the 19th century, but defeat at the hands of an Asian power, one that she had traditionally considered as her either de facto or de jure tributary or at least an inferior, was a bitter psychological blow. \nChina's defeat precipitated an increase in railway construction in the country, as foreign powers demanded China make railway concessions.\nIn 1898, Russia signed a 25-year lease on the Liaodong Peninsula and proceeded to set up a naval station at Port Arthur. Although that infuriated the Japanese, they were more concerned with the Russian encroachment in Korea than in Manchuria. Other powers, such as France, Germany, and Britain, took advantage of the situation in China and gained land, port, and trade concessions at the expense of the decaying Qing dynasty. Qingdao was acquired by Germany, Guangzhouwan by France, and Weihaiwei and the New Territories by Britain.\nXenophobic sentiment and agitation grew, which would culminate in the Boxer Rebellion five years later. The Manchu people were devastated by the fighting during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, with massive casualties sustained during the wars. It was then driven into extreme suffering and hardship in Beijing and northeastern China.\nIn Europe.\nJapan had achieved what it had set out to accomplish and ended Chinese influence over Korea, but it had been forced to relinquish the Liaodong Peninsula (Port Arthur) in exchange for an increased financial indemnity. The European powers, especially Russia, had no objection to the other clauses of the treaty but felt that Japan should not gain Port Arthur since they had their own ambitions in that part of the world. Russia persuaded Germany and France to join in applying diplomatic pressure on Japan, which resulted in the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895. Japan was handed a diplomatic note that strongly advised against the terms regarding the Liaodong peninsula.\nFaced with overwhelming military might, and lack of American or British intervention or support, Japan conceded the Liaodong Peninsula and revised the Treaty of Shimonoseki to demand an increased indemnity instead of the previous concessions in the region. The subsequent Western \"scramble\" for Chinese concessions was viewed with distaste in Japan, who then sought to break out of her diplomatic loneliness and cultivate closer, equal alliances with powers in the West to counter such a coalition in the future.\nIn Korea.\nKorea had proclaimed itself the Korean Empire in 1892 and announced its independence from the Qing Empire. The Japanese-sponsored Kabo Reforms of 1894\u20131896 transformed Korea. Legal slavery was abolished in all forms, the yangban class lost all special privileges, outcastes were abolished; equality of law was declared; equality of opportunity in the face of social background was established, child marriage was abolished; Hangul was to be used in government documents, Korean history was introduced in schools, the Chinese calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar, education was expanded, and new textbooks were written.\nAlthough Japan had succeeded in eliminating Chinese influence over Korea, Russia seemed to reap the initial benefits. In 1895, a pro-Russian official attempted to remove the King of Korea to the Russian legation, and a second attempt later succeeded. Thus, for a year, the King reigned from the Russian legation in Seoul. The concession to build a Seoul-Inchon railway that had been granted to Japan in 1894 was revoked and granted to Russia. Russian guards guarded the king in his palace even after he had left the Russian legation.\nRusso-Japanese War.\nTensions between Russia and Japan would increase in the years after the First Sino-Japanese War. During the Boxer Rebellion, an eight-member international force was sent to suppress and quell the uprising; Russia sent troops into Manchuria as part of that force. After the suppression of the Boxers, the Russian government agreed to vacate the area. However, by 1903, it had actually increased the size of its forces in Manchuria.\nNegotiations between the two nations (1901\u20131904) to establish mutual recognition of respective spheres of influence (Russia over Manchuria and Japan over Korea) were repeatedly and intentionally stalled by the Russians. They felt that they were strong and confident enough not to accept any compromise and believed that Japan would not go to war against a European power. Russia also had intentions to use Manchuria as a springboard for further expansion of its interests in the Far East. In 1903, Russian soldiers began construction of a fort at Yongnampo but stopped after Japanese protests.\nIn 1902, Japan formed an alliance with Britain, the terms of which stated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and a third power entered the fight against Japan, Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese. That was a check to prevent Germany or France from intervening militarily in any future war against Russia. Japan sought to prevent a repetition of the Triple Intervention, which deprived it of Port Arthur. The British reasons for joining the alliance were to check the spread of Russian expansion into the Pacific area, to strengthen Britain's focus on other areas, and to gain a powerful naval ally in the Pacific.\nIncreasing tensions between Japan and Russia were results of Russia's unwillingness to compromise and the prospect of Korea falling under Russia's domination and thus coming into conflict with and undermining Japan's interests. Eventually, Japan was forced to take action. That would be the deciding factor and catalyst leading to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305.\nSee also.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located northwest of Coimbatore, and is the headquarters of Nilgiris district. Situated in the Nilgiri hills, it is known by the epithet \"King of all the Hill Stations\", and is a popular tourist destination.\nOriginally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company in the 18th century. It later served as the summer capital of Madras Presidency. The economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism and agriculture. The town is connected to the plains by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.\nEtymology.\nThe region was earlier known as \"Ottakal Mandu\", with \"Otta-kal\" meaning 'single stone' in Tamil, a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people and \" Mandu\", a Toda word for 'village'. This later became Udagamandalam which was anglicised to Ootacamund by the British, with the first part of the name (\"Ootaca\"), a corruption of the local name for the region and the second part (\"Mand\"), a shortening of the local Toda word \"Mandu\". The first known written mention of the place is given as \"Wotokymund\" in a letter dated March 1821, written to the \"Madras Gazette\" by an unknown correspondent. \"Ootacamund\" was later shortened to \"Ooty\". Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the \"blue mountains\", so named due to the Kurunji flower, which used to give the slopes a bluish tinge.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reference to Nilgiri hills is found in the Tamil Sangam epic Silappathikaram from the 5th or 6th century CE. The region was a land occupied by various tribes such as Badagas, Todas, Kotas, Irulas and Kurumbas. The region was ruled by the three Tamil kingdoms of Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas during various times. The Todas are referenced in a record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE. It was also ruled by various dynasties like Pallavas, Satavahanas, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara empire. Tipu Sultan captured Nilgiris in the eighteenth century and the region came into possession of British in 1799. It became part of Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency.\nIn 1818, J. C. Whish and N. W. Kindersley, assistants to John Sullivan, then collector of Coimbatore district, visited Kotagiri nearby and reported on the region's potential to serve as a summer retreat. Sullivan established his residence there and reported to the Board of Revenue on 31 July 1819. He also started work on a road from Sirumugai which was completed in May 1823 and extended up to Coonoor between 1830 and 1832. By 1827, it was established as a sanatorium of the Madras Presidency and developed further at the behest of then Governor of Madras Stephen Lushington. The Government Botanical Garden, covering , was established in 1842 and a library was established in 1959.\nOoty was made a municipality in 1866, and civic improvements including roads, drainage, and water supply from the Marlimund and Tiger Hill reservoirs were added through Government loans. In August 1868, the Nilgiris was separated from the Coimbatore district, and James Wilkinson Breeks was appointed its first commissioner. On 1 February 1882, Nilgiris was made a district, and Richard Wellesley Barlow, the then commissioner, became its first collector. By the early 20th century, Ooty was a well-developed hill station, with an artificial lake, various parks, religious structures, and sporting facilities for polo, golf, and cricket. It served as the summer capital of the Madras Presidency and as a retreat for the British officials.\nPost-independence, the town developed into a popular recreational resort and the nearby Wellington became the home of the Defence Services Staff College of the Indian Army.\nGeography.\nOoty is located in the Nilgiri hills, which are part of the Western Ghats in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. It is separated from the neighboring state of Karnataka by the Moyar river in the north and from the Anaimalai and Palani hills in the south by the Palghat Gap. It is situated at an altitude of above sea level. The total area of the town is . Doddabetta is the highest peak () in the Nilgiris, about from Ooty.\nOoty Lake is an artificial lake covering created in 1824. The Pykara, a river located from Ooty, rises at Mukurthi peak and flows through a series of cascades with the last two falls of and known as Pykara falls. Kamaraj Sagar Dam is located from the Ooty. Emerald Lake, Avalanche Lake and Porthimund Lake are other lakes in the region.\nClimate.\nOoty features a subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\") under K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Because of its high altitude, the temperatures are generally lower than the surrounding plains with the average between during summer and during winter. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 30 April 2024, and the lowest temperature recorded was . The town gets heavy rainfall during both south-west and north-east monsoons and the average rainfall is about of precipitation annually.\nBiodiversity and wildlife.\nOoty forms part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the largest protected forest area in India. It was declared as a protected reserve in 1986 and is part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme. Mudumalai National Park and tiger reserve lies on the north-western side, about from Ooty and was established in 1940 as the first wildlife sanctuary in India.\nThe region is part of the South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion. Nilgiris harbours thousands of plant species including medicinal plants and endemic flowering plants. Stunted evergreen trees grow in shola forest patches above and are festooned with epiphytes. The native vegetation consisted of Meadows and grasslands on the hillsides with shola forests in the valleys. When the British populated the town, invasive species of pine, wattle and eucalyptus were planted along with tea plantations and they became the dominant species replacing the native vegetation.\nThe region has one of the largest bengal tiger populations. The Indian elephant is the largest mammal in the region. The gaur is the largest ungulate in the region that frequent grasslands in the vicinity of water sources. Other mega-fauna include Indian leopard and sloth bear. Smaller fauna include Jungle cat, rusty-spotted cat, leopard cat, dhole, Golden jackal, Nilgiri marten, Small Indian civet, Asian palm civet, brown palm civet, ruddy mongoose, wild boar, Indian pangolin, Indian crested porcupine and Indian giant squirrel. Indian giant flying squirrel, Smooth-coated otter groups are observed along the Moyar River. Deer include sambar deer, chital, Indian spotted chevrotain, Indian muntjac, four-horned antelope and blackbuck. Monkeys, including the endangered Nilgiri langur, bonnet macaque and gray langur are also found in the region. Nilgiri tahr is an endangered ungulate that is endemic to the Nilgiris and is the state animal of Tamil Nadu. Bats are found in darker caves in the hills. More than 200 species of birds are found in the region.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2011 census, Udagamandalam had a population of 88,430 with a sex-ratio of 1,053 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 7,781 were under the age of six, constituting 3,915 males and 3,866 females.Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 28.98% and 0.30% of the population respectively.

Languages native to the Nilgiris including Badaga, Paniya, Irula and Kurumba. Due to its proximity to the neighboring states of Kerala and Karnataka and being a tourist destination, Malayalam, Kannada and English are also spoken and understood to an extent. According to the 2011 census, the most widely spoken languages in Udagamandalam taluk were Tamil, spoken by 88,896, followed by Badaga with 41,213 and Kannada with 27,070 speakers.\nAdministration and politics.\nOoty is the headquarters of the Nilgiris district. The town is part of the Udagamandalam Assembly constituency which forms part of the Nilgiris Lok Sabha constituency. The town is administered by Udagamanadalam municipality which was established in 1866 and the town is divided into 36 wards. The municipality is responsible for water services, sewage disposal and maintenance of public infrastructure.\nEconomy.\nOoty is a market town for the surrounding area, which is still largely dependent on agriculture. Vegetables cultivated include potato, carrot, cabbage and cauliflower and fruits include peach, plum, pear and strawberry. There is a daily wholesale auction of these products at the Ooty Municipal Market. Dairy farming has long been present in the area, and there is a cooperative dairy manufacturing cheese and skimmed milk powder. Floriculture and sericulture are also practised, as is the cultivation of mushrooms. The local area is known for tea cultivation. Nilgiri tea is a black tea variety unique to the region.\nThe Human Biologicals Institute, established in 1999, is involved in vaccine manufacturing. Other manufacturing industries located on the outskirts include Ketti (manufacture of needles) and Aruvankadu (manufacture of cordite).\nTransport.\nRoad.\nOoty is connected by roads known as the Nilgiri Ghat Roads. It is situated on NH 181. The municipality maintains roads in the town. Public bus services are operated by the Coimbatore division of TNSTC. SETC, KSRTC (Karnataka) and KSRTC (Kerala) connect to distant towns in Tamil Nadu and neighboring states.\nRail.\nNilgiri Mountain Railway is a railway in Nilgiris district, connecting Udagamandalam and Mettupalayam. The Nilgiri Railway Company was formed in 1885, and the Mettupalayam-Coonoor section of the track was opened for traffic on 15 June 1899. The railway was operated by the Madras Railway until 31 December 1907, when it was handed over to the South Indian Railway. The line from Coonoor to Ooty was completed in 1908. Operated currently by the Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways, it is the only rack railway in India and operates on its own fleet of steam locomotives between Coonoor and Udagamandalam. In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Mountain Railways of India.\nAir.\nThe nearest airport is Coimbatore International Airport, located from the town. The airport has regular flights from and to major domestic destinations and international destinations like Sharjah, Colombo and Singapore. Ooty has three helipads, one at Theettukal and two at Kodanad with the Theettukal helipad, approved by the Airports Authority of India for defence and VIP services. Pawan Hans planned to start commercial services with Bell 407, but the plan has been shelved.\nEducation.\nGovernment Arts College, established in 1955, is one of the oldest institutions in Ooty and is affiliated with Bharathiar University. There are a few other colleges in the town.

It is considered part of World War\u00a0II, and often regarded as the beginning of World WarII in Asia. It was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It is known in China as the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.\nOn 18 September 1931, the Japanese staged the Mukden incident, a false flag event fabricated to justify their invasion of Manchuria and establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo. This is sometimes marked as the beginning of the war. From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan engaged in skirmishes, including in Shanghai and in Northern China. Nationalist and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) forces, respectively led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, had fought each other in the Chinese Civil War since 1927. In late 1933, Chiang Kai-shek encircled the Chinese Communists in an attempt to finally destroy them, forcing the Communists into the Long March, resulting in the Communists losing around 90% of their men. As a Japanese invasion became imminent, Chiang still refused to form a united front before he was placed under house arrest by his subordinates who forced him to form the Second United Front in late 1936 in order to resist the Japanese invasion together.\nThe full-scale war began on 7 July 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge incident near Beijing, which prompted a full-scale Japanese invasion of the rest of China. The Japanese captured the capital of Nanjing in 1937 and perpetrated the Nanjing Massacre. After failing to stop the Japanese capture of Wuhan in 1938, then China's de facto capital at the time, the Nationalist government relocated to Chongqing in the Chinese interior. After the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Soviet aid bolstered the National Revolutionary Army and Air Force. By 1939, after Chinese victories at Changsha and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were unable to defeat CCP forces in Shaanxi, who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare. In November 1939, Nationalist forces launched a large scale winter offensive, and in August 1940, CCP forces launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive in central China. In April 1941, Soviet aid was halted with the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact.\nIn December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and declared war on the United States. The US increased its aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, becoming its main financial and military supporter. With Burma cut off, the United States Army Air Forces airlifted material over the Himalayas. In 1944, Japan launched Operation Ichi-Go, the invasion of Henan and Changsha. In 1945, the Chinese Expeditionary Force resumed its advance in Burma and completed the Ledo Road linking India to China. China launched large counteroffensives in South China, repulsed a failed Japanese invasion of West Hunan, and recaptured Japanese occupied regions of Guangxi.\nJapan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soviet declaration of war and subsequent invasions of Manchukuo and Korea. The war resulted in the deaths of around 20 million people, mostly Chinese civilians. China was recognized as one of the Big Four Allied powers in World War II and one of the \"Four Policemen\", which formed the foundation of the United Nations. It regained all lost territories and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Chinese Civil War resumed in 1946, ending with a communist victory and the Proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, while the government of the Republic of China relocated on Taiwan.\nNames.\nThe term \"Japanese invasion of China\", a term used mainly in non-Japanese narratives.\nChinese.\nIn China, the war is most commonly known as the \"War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" (), and shortened to \"Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" () or the \"War of Resistance\" (). It is also referred to by PRC as part of the \"Global Anti-Fascist War\" as Imperial Japan was then allied with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\nThe war has often been termed the Eight Years' War of Resistance\" (), a traditional view which dates the war's beginning to the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937.90 In an alternative view of Chinese historiography, the 18 September 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria marks the start of the\" Fourteen Years' War of Resistance\" (\u5341\u56db\u5e74\u6297\u6218; \u5341\u56db\u5e74\u6297\u6230). In 2017, the Chinese government officially announced that it would adopt this view.90 Under this interpretation, the 1931\u20131937 period is viewed as the \"partial\" war, while 1937\u20131945 is a period of \"total\" war.93 This view of a fourteen-year war has political significance because it provides more recognition for the role of northeast China in the War of Resistance.\nJapanese.\nIn contemporary Japan, the name \"Japan\u2013China War\" () is most commonly used because of its perceived objectivity. Dating the beginning of the war may also vary in Japanese context, with one Japanese historiographical view regarding the war as a \"Fifteen-Year War\" (\"Jyugonen Sens\u00f4\"), covering the period beginning with the invasion of Manchuria through the atomic bombings, and including both the war in China and the Pacific war.91\nWhen the invasion of China proper began in earnest in July 1937 near Beijing, the Empire of Japan used \"The North China Incident\" (), and with the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai the following month, it was changed to \"The China Incident\" ().\nThe word \"incident\" () was used by Japan, as neither country had made a formal declaration of war at the outbreak of hostility. From the Japanese perspective, localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other countries, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to an American embargo in accordance with the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s. In addition, due to China's fractured political status, Japan often claimed that China was no longer a recognizable political entity on which war could be declared.\nIn Japanese propaganda, the invasion of China became a holy war (), the first step of the \"eight corners of the world under one roof\" slogan (). In 1940, Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoe launched the Taisei Yokusankai. When both sides formally declared war in December 1941, the name was replaced by \"Greater East Asia War\" ().\nAlthough the Japanese government still uses the term \"China Incident\" in formal documents, the word \"Shina\" is considered derogatory by China and therefore the media in Japan often paraphrase with other expressions like \"The Japan\u2013China Incident\" (), which were used by media as early as the 1930s.\nThe name \"Second Sino-Japanese War\" is not commonly used in Japan as the China it fought a war against in 1894 to 1895 was led by the Qing dynasty, and thus is called the Qing-Japanese War (), rather than the First Sino-Japanese War.\nBackground.\nThe origins of the Second Sino-Japanese War can be traced to the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), in which China, then under the rule of the Qing dynasty, was defeated by Japan and forced to cede Taiwan and recognize the full and complete independence of Korea in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Japan also annexed the Senkaku Islands, which Japan claims were uninhabited, in early 1895 as a result of its victory at the end of the war. Japan had also attempted to annex the Liaodong Peninsula following the war, though was forced to return it to China following the Triple Intervention by France, Germany, and Russia. The Qing dynasty was on the brink of collapse due to internal revolts and the imposition of the unequal treaties, while Japan had emerged as a great power through its efforts to modernize. In 1905, Japan defeated the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War, gaining Dalian and southern Sakhalin and establishing a protectorate over Korea.\nWarlords in the Republic of China.\nIn 1911, factions of the Qing Army uprose against the government, staging a revolution that swept across China's southern provinces. The Qing responded by appointing Yuan Shikai, commander of the loyalist Beiyang Army, as temporary prime minister in order to subdue the revolution. Yuan, wanting to remain in power, compromised with the revolutionaries, and agreed to abolish the monarchy and establish a new republican government, under the condition he be appointed president of China. The new Beiyang government of China was proclaimed in March 1912, after which Yuan Shikai began to amass power for himself. In 1913, the parliamentary political leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated; it is generally believed Yuan Shikai ordered the assassination. Yuan Shikai then forced the parliament to pass a bill to strengthen the power of the president and sought to restore the imperial system, becoming the new emperor of China.\nHowever, there was little support for an imperial restoration among the general population, and protests and demonstrations soon broke out across the country. Yuan's attempts at restoring the monarchy triggered the National Protection War, and Yuan Shikai was overthrown after only a few months. In the aftermath of Shikai's death in June 1916, control of China fell into the hands of the Beiyang Army leadership. The Beiyang government was a civilian government in name, but in practice it was a military dictatorship with a different warlord controlling each province of the country. China was reduced to a fractured state. As a result, China's prosperity began to wither and its economy declined. This instability presented an opportunity for nationalistic politicians in Japan to press for territorial expansion.\nTwenty-One Demands.\nIn 1915, Japan issued the Twenty-One Demands to extort further political and commercial privilege from China, which was accepted by the regime of Yuan Shikai. Following World War I, Japan acquired the German Empire's sphere of influence in Shandong province, leading to nationwide anti-Japanese protests and mass demonstrations in China. The country remained fragmented under the Beiyang Government and was unable to resist foreign incursions. For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the Kuomintang (KMT) in Guangzhou launched the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the Soviet Union.\nJinan incident.\nThe National Revolutionary Army (NRA) formed by the Kuomintang swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the Jinan incident of 1928, during which time the Japanese military killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. According to the investigation results of the Association of the Families of the Victims of the Jinan massacre, it showed that 6,123 Chinese civilians were killed and 1,701 injured. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.\nReunification of China (1928).\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was assassinated by the Kwantung Army in 1928. His son, Zhang Xueliang, took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria. Later in the same year, Zhang declared his allegiance to the Nationalist government in Nanjing under Chiang Kai-shek, and consequently, China was nominally reunified under one government.\n1929 Sino-Soviet war.\nThe July\u2013November 1929 conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railroad (CER) further increased the tensions in the Northeast that led to the Mukden Incident and eventually the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet Red Army victory over Xueliang's forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.\nThe Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.\nChinese Communist Party conflict with the Kuomintang.\nIn 1930, the Central Plains War broke out across China, involving regional commanders who had fought in alliance with the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition, and the Nanjing government under Chiang. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the Shanghai massacre of 1927, and they continued to expand during this protracted civil war. The Kuomintang government focused its efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists instead of opposing the Japanese, following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ()8 through its encirclement campaigns against the Communists.\nAfter the defeat of the Chinese Soviet Republic by the Nationalists, the Communists retreated on the Long March to Yan'an.34 The Nationalist government ordered local warlords to continue the campaign against the Communists rather than focus on the Japanese threat.34\nOn 1 August 1935, the Communist Party issued the August First Declaration.10 It called for the creation of a United Front of all Chinese parties, organizations, and people of all circles, including overseas Chinese and ethnic minorities, to oppose the Japanese.10\nA December 1936 coup by two Nationalist Generals, the Xi'an Incident, forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept a United Front with the Communists to oppose Japan.34\nInvasion of Manchuria and Northern China.\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of Depression-era tariffs), and a protective buffer state against the Soviet Union in Siberia. As a result, the Japanese Army was widely prevalent in Manchuria immediately following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, where Japan gained significant territory in Manchuria. As a result of their strengthened position, by 1915 Japan had negotiated a significant amount of economic privilege in the region by pressuring Yuan Shikai, the president of the Republic of China at the time. With a widened range of economic privileges in Manchuria, Japan began focusing on developing and protecting matters of economic interests. This included railroads, businesses, natural resources, and a general control of the territory.\nWith its influence growing, the Japanese Army began to justify its presence by stating that it was simply protecting its own economic interests. However militarists in the Japanese Army began pushing for an expansion of influence, leading to the Japanese Army assassinating the warlord of Manchuria, Zhang Zuolin. This was done with hopes that it would start a crisis that would allow Japan to expand their power and influence in the region. When this was not as successful as they desired, Japan then decided to invade Manchuria outright after the Mukden incident in September 1931. Japanese soldiers set off a bomb on the Southern Manchurian Railroad in order to provoke an opportunity to act in \"self defense\" and invade outright. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory in 1905 at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, and installed the last Emperor of China, Puyi, as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the League of Nations for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the Lytton Report, condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure. From 1931 until summer 1937, the Nationalist Army under Chiang Kai-shek did little to oppose Japanese encroachment into China.\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the 28 January battle. This resulted in the demilitarization of Shanghai, which forbade the Chinese to deploy troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an ongoing campaign to pacify the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan. On 15 April 1932, the Chinese Soviet Republic led by the Communists declared war on Japan.\nUnder Chi Shi-ying and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Lo Ta-yu's leadership, the Kuomintang also established the Northeast Anti-Manchukuo and Anti-Japanese Association as well as the September 18th Alliance. These organizations developed an extensive underground intelligence network and coordinated anti-Japanese activities in Manchuria.\nIn 1933, the Japanese attacked the Great Wall region. The Tanggu Truce established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of Rehe Province, as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beijing-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in Nanjing.\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the Northern Expedition, the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the Yangtze River Delta. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various Chinese collaborators and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the \"Specialization\" of North China (), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong.\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now Inner Mongolia and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the He\u2013Umezu Agreement, which forbade the KMT to conduct party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed East Hebei Autonomous Council and the Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the Mongol military government was formed on 12 May 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.\n1937: Full-scale invasion of China.\nOn the night of 7 July 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge about 16\u00a0km from Beijing.29 The initial confused and sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle.\nUnlike Japan, China was unprepared for total war and had little military-industrial strength, no mechanized divisions, and few armoured forces.\nWithin the first year of full-scale war, Japanese forces obtained victories in most major Chinese cities.29\nBattle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin.\nOn 11 July, in accordance with the Goso conference, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff authorized the deployment of an infantry division from the Ch\u014dsen Army, two combined brigades from the Kwantung Army and an air regiment composed of 18 squadrons as reinforcements to Northern China. By 20 July, total Japanese military strength in the Beijing-Tianjin area exceeded 180,000 personnel.\nThe Japanese gave Sung and his troops \"free passage\" before moving in to pacify resistance in areas surrounding Beijing (then Beiping) and Tianjin. After 24 days of combat, the Chinese 29th Army was forced to withdraw. The Japanese captured Beijing and the Taku Forts at Tianjin on 29 and 30 July respectively, thus concluding the Beijing-Tianjin campaign. By August 1937, Japan had occupied Beijing and Tianjin.29\nHowever, the Japanese Army had been given orders not to advance further than the Yongding River. In a sudden volte-face, the Konoe government's foreign minister opened negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek's government in Nanjing and stated: \"Japan wants Chinese cooperation, not Chinese land.\" Nevertheless, negotiations failed to move further. The \u014cyama Incident on 9 August escalated the skirmishes and battles into full scale warfare.\nThe 29th Army's resistance (and poor equipment) inspired the 1937 \"Sword March\", which\u2014with slightly reworked lyrics\u2014became the National Revolutionary Army's standard marching cadence and popularized the racial epithet \"guizi\" to describe the Japanese invaders.\nBattle of Shanghai.\nThe Imperial General Headquarters (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into a full-scale war. Following the shooting of two Japanese officers who were attempting to enter the Hongqiao military airport on 9 August 1937, the Japanese demanded that all Chinese forces withdraw from Shanghai; the Chinese outright refused to meet this demand. In response, both the Chinese and the Japanese marched reinforcements into the Shanghai area. Chiang concentrated his best troops north of Shanghai in an effort to impress the city's large foreign community and increase China's foreign support.\nOn 13 August 1937, Kuomintang soldiers attacked Japanese Marine positions in Shanghai, with Japanese army troops and marines in turn crossing into the city with naval gunfire support at Zhabei, leading to the Battle of Shanghai. On 14 August, Chinese forces under the command of Zhang Zhizhong were ordered to capture or destroy the Japanese strongholds in Shanghai, leading to bitter street fighting. In an attack on the Japanese cruiser \"Izumo\", Kuomintang planes accidentally bombed the Shanghai International Settlement, which led to more than 3,000 civilian deaths.\nIn the three days from 14 to 16 August 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) sent many sorties of the then-advanced long-ranged G3M medium-heavy land-based bombers and assorted carrier-based aircraft with the expectation of destroying the Chinese Air Force. However, the Imperial Japanese Navy encountered unexpected resistance from the defending Chinese Curtiss Hawk II/Hawk III and P-26/281 Peashooter fighter squadrons; suffering heavy (50%) losses from the defending Chinese pilots (14 August was subsequently commemorated by the KMT as China's \"Air Force Day\").\nThe skies of China had become a testing zone for advanced biplane and new-generation monoplane combat-aircraft designs. The introduction of the advanced A5M \"Claude\" fighters into the Shanghai-Nanjing theater of operations, beginning on 18 September 1937, helped the Japanese achieve a certain level of air superiority. However the few experienced Chinese veteran pilots, as well as several Chinese-American volunteer fighter pilots, including Maj. Art Chin, Maj. John Wong Pan-yang, and Capt. Chan Kee-Wong, even in their older and slower biplanes, proved more than able to hold their own against the sleek A5Ms in dogfights, and it also proved to be a battle of attrition against the Chinese Air Force.\nAt the start of the battle, the local strength of the NRA was around five divisions, or about 70,000 troops, while local Japanese forces comprised about 6,300 marines. On 23 August, the Chinese Air Force attacked Japanese troop landings at Wusongkou in northern Shanghai with Hawk III fighter-attack planes and P-26/281 fighter escorts, and the Japanese intercepted most of the attack with A2N and A4N fighters from the aircraft carriers \"Hosho\" and \"Ryujo\", shooting down several of the Chinese planes while losing a single A4N in the dogfight with Lt. Huang Xinrui in his P-26/281; the Japanese Army reinforcements succeeded in landing in northern Shanghai. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) ultimately committed over 300,000 troops, along with numerous naval vessels and aircraft, to capture the city. After more than three months of intense fighting, their casualties far exceeded initial expectations. On 26 October, the IJA captured Dachang, a key strong-point within Shanghai, and on 5 November, additional reinforcements from Japan landed in Hangzhou Bay. Finally, on 9 November, the NRA began a general retreat.\nJapan did not immediately occupy the Shanghai International Settlement or the Shanghai French Concession, areas which were outside of China's control due to the treaty port system. Japan moved into these areas after its 1941 declaration of war against the United States and the United Kingdom.\nBattle of Nanjing and massacre.\nIn November 1937, the Japanese concentrated 220,000 soldiers and began a campaign against Nanjing.29 Building on the hard-won victory in Shanghai, the IJA advanced on and captured the KMT capital city of Nanjing (December 1937) and Northern Shanxi (September\u00a0\u2013 November 1937).\nJapanese forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese soldiers defending the city, killing approximately 50,000 of them including 17 Chinese generals.29 Upon the capture of Nanjing, Japanese committed massive war atrocities including mass murder and rape of Chinese civilians after 13 December 1937, which has been referred to as the Nanjing Massacre. Over the next several weeks, Japanese troops perpetrated numerous mass executions and tens of thousands of rapes. The army looted and burned the surrounding towns and the city, destroying more than a third of the buildings.\nThe number of Chinese killed in the massacre has been subject to much debate, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to more than 300,000. The numbers agreed upon by most scholars are provided by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which estimate at least 200,000 murders and 20,000 rapes.\nThe Japanese atrocities in Nanjing, especially following the Chinese defense of Shanghai, increased international goodwill for the Chinese people and the Chinese government.\nThe Nationalist government re-established itself in Chongqing, which became the wartime seat of government until 1945.32\n1938.\nBy January 1938, most conventional Kuomintang forces had either been defeated or no longer offered major resistance to Japanese advances. KMT forces won a few victories in 1938 (the Battle of Taierzhuang and the Battle of Wanjialing) but were generally ineffective that year.29 By March 1938, the Japanese controlled almost all of North China. Communist-led rural resistance to the Japanese remained active, however.\nBattles of Xuzhou and Taierzhuang.\nWith many victories achieved, Japanese field generals escalated the war in Jiangsu in an attempt to wipe out the Chinese forces in the area. The Japanese managed to overcome Chinese resistance around Bengbu and the Teng xian, but were fought to a halt at Linyi.\nThe Japanese were then decisively defeated at the Battle of Taierzhuang (March\u2013April 1938), where the Chinese used night attacks and close-quarters combat to overcome Japanese advantages in firepower. The Chinese also severed Japanese supply lines from the rear, forcing the Japanese to retreat in the first Chinese victory of the war.\nThe Japanese then attempted to surround and destroy the Chinese armies in the Xuzhou region with an enormous pincer movement. However the majority of the Chinese forces, some 200,000\u2013300,000 troops in 40 divisions, managed to break out of the encirclement and retreat to defend Wuhan, the Japanese's next target.\nBattle of Wuhan.\nFollowing Xuzhou, the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of Wuhan, which had become the political, economic and military center of China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the NRA and forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace. On 6 June, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways.\nThe Japanese forces, numbering some 400,000 men, were faced by over 1 million NRA troops in the Central Yangtze region. Having learned from their defeats at Shanghai and Nanjing, the Chinese had adapted themselves to fight the Japanese and managed to check their forces on many fronts, slowing and sometimes reversing the Japanese advances, as in the case of Wanjialing.\nTo overcome Chinese resistance, Japanese forces frequently deployed poison gas and committed atrocities against civilians, such as a \"mini-Nanjing Massacre\" in the city of Jiujiang upon its capture. After four months of intense combat, the Nationalists were forced to abandon Wuhan by October, and its government and armies retreated to Chongqing. Both sides had suffered tremendous casualties in the battle, with the Chinese losing up to 500,000 soldiers killed or wounded, and the Japanese up to 200,000.\nCommunist resistance.\nAfter their victory at Wuhan, Japan advanced deep into Communist territory and redeployed 50,000 troops to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Elements of the Eighth Route Army soon attacked the advancing Japanese, inflicting between 3,000 and 5,000 casualties and resulting in a Japanese retreat. The Eighth Route Army carried out guerilla operations and established military and political bases. As the Japanese military came to understand that the Communists avoided conventional attacks and defense, it altered its tactics. The Japanese military built more roads to quicken movement between strongpoints and cities, blockaded rivers and roads in an effort to disrupt Communists supply, sought to expand militia from its puppet regime to conserve manpower, and use systematic violence on civilians in the Border Region in an effort to destroy its economy. The Japanese military mandated confiscation of the Eighth Route Army's goods and used this directive as a pretext to confiscate goods, including engaging in grave robbery in the Border Region.\nAir raid at Chongqing.\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to launch the war's first massive air raids on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established provisional capital of Chongqing and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving many people either dead, injured, or homeless.\n1939\u20131943.\nBy 1939, the Nationalist army had withdrawn to the southwest and northwest of China and the Japanese controlled the coastal cities that had been centres of Nationalist power.30 From 1939 to 1945, China was divided into three regions: Japanese-occupied territories (\"Lunxianqu\"), the Nationalist-controlled region (\"Guotongqu\"), and the Communist-controlled regions (\"Jiefangqu,\" or liberated areas).35\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang and First Battle of Changsha. General Ma Biao also led Hui, Salar and Dongxiang cavalry to defeat the Japanese at the Battle of Huaiyang in the summer of 1939. Ma Biao had fought against the Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.\nIn 1939, Mao Zedong wrote \"The Greatest Crisis under Current Conditions\", calling for more active resistance against Japan and for the strengthening of the Second United Front.76\nThe Chinese launched their first large-scale counter-offensive against the IJA in December 1939; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in modern warfare, this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the Battle of Shanghai and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.\nDuring the offensive, Hui forces in Suiyuan under generals Ma Hongbin and Ma Buqing routed the Imperial Japanese Army and their puppet Inner Mongol forces and prevented the planned Japanese advance into northwest China. Ma Hongbin's father Ma Fulu had fought against Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.\nAfter 1940, the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve their occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly puppet governments favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered. This included prominently the regime headed by Wang Jingwei, one of Chiang's rivals in the KMT.35 However, atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large Collaborationist Chinese Army to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\nJapanese expansion.\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but guerrilla fighting continued in these occupied areas. Japan had suffered high casualties which resulted from unexpectedly stubborn Chinese resistance, and neither side could make any swift progress in the manner of Nazi Germany in Western Europe.\nBy 1943, Guangdong had experienced famine. As the situation worsened, New York Chinese compatriots received a letter stating that 600,000 people were killed in Siyi by starvation.\nSecond phase: October 1938 \u2013 December 1941.\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a war of attrition, thereby exhausting Japanese resources while it was building up China's military capacity. American general Joseph Stilwell called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, flanking attacks, and encirclements in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of Changsha in 1939, and again in the 1941 battle, in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\nLocal Chinese resistance forces, organized separately by both the CCP and the KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to make Japanese administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the Chinese Red Army launched a major offensive in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant guerilla and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and they led them to employ the Three Alls policy\u2014kill all, loot all, burn all. It was during this period that the bulk of Japanese war crimes were committed. In April 1941, Soviet aid to China halted with the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact. The CCP formally stated that the pact was \"a great victory for Soviet diplomacy\" and \"was beneficial to liberation throughout China.\"\nJapan had occupied much of north and coastal China by the end of 1941, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. From 1941 to 1942, Japan concentrated most of its forces in China in an effort to defeat the CCP bases behind Japan's lines.35 To decrease guerilla's human and material resources, the Japanese military implemented its Three Alls policy (\"Kill all, loot all, burn all\").35 In response, the CCP forces increased their role in production activities, including farming, raising hogs, and cloth-making.35\nRelationship between the Nationalists and the Communists.\nAfter the Mukden Incident in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" Zhang Xueliang, for his non-resistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to improvise while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his Northeast Army were given the duty of suppressing the Red Army in Shaanxi after their Long March. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\nIn the Xi'an Incident that took place on 12 December 1936, Zhang Xueliang kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an, hoping to force an end to KMT\u2013CCP conflict. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary ceasefire with the Communists. On 24 December, the two parties agreed to a United Front against Japan; this had salutary effects for the beleaguered Communists, who agreed to form the New Fourth Army and the 8th Route Army under the nominal control of the NRA. In addition, Shaan-Gan-Ning and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border regions were created, under the control of the CCP. In Shaan-Gan-Ning, Communists in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Base Area fostered opium production, taxed it, and engaged in its trade\u2014including selling to Japanese-occupied and KMT-controlled provinces. The Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the Battle of Taiyuan, and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the Battle of Wuhan.\nThe formation of a united front added to the legality of the CCP, but what kind of support the central government would provide to the communists were not settled. When compromise with the CCP failed to incentivize the Soviet Union to engage in an open conflict against Japan, the KMT withheld further support for the Communists. To strengthen their legitimacy, Communist forces actively engaged the Japanese early on. These operations weakened Japanese forces in Shanxi and other areas in the North. Mao Zedong was distrustful of Chiang Kai-shek, however, and shifted strategy to guerrilla warfare in order to preserve the CCP's military strength.\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich Yangtze River Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CCP forces. For example, the Red Army led by He Long attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in Hebei in June 1939. Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the New Fourth Army Incident in January 1941.\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader Mao Zedong outlined the preliminary plan for the CCP's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao himself is quoted outlining the \"721\" policy, saying \"We are fighting 70 percent for self development, 20 percent for compromise, and 10 percent against Japan\". Mao began his final push for consolidation of CCP power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CCP doctrine that came to be formalized as Mao Zedong Thought. The Communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, land and tax reform measures favouring poor peasants; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CCP and fighting the Japanese at the same time.\nEntrance of the Western Allies.\nJapan had expected to extract economic benefits of its invasions of China and elsewhere, including in the form of fuel and raw material resources.30 As Japanese aggression continued, however, the United States responded with trade embargoes on various goods, including oil and petroleum (beginning December 1939) and scrap iron and munitions (beginning July 1940).30 The United States demanded that Japan withdraw from China and also refused to recognize Japan's occupations of the Indochinese countries.30 In spring 1941, trade negotiations between the United States and Japan failed.30 In July 1941, the United States froze Japanese financial assets and obtained Dutch and British agreements to also cut those countries' oil exports to Japan.30 This in turn prompted the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor.30\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy. As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the Pacific theatre of World War II. Japan's military action against the United States also restrained its capacity to conduct further offensive operations in China.30\nAfter the Lend-Lease Act was passed in 1941, American financial and military aid began to trickle in. Claire Lee Chennault commanded the 1st American Volunteer Group (nicknamed the Flying Tigers), with American pilots flying American warplanes which were painted with the Chinese flag to attack the Japanese. He headed both the volunteer group and the uniformed U.S. Army Air Forces units that replaced it in 1942. However, it was the Soviets that provided the greatest material help for China from 1937 into 1941, with fighter aircraft for the Nationalist Chinese Air Force and artillery and armour for the Chinese Army through the Sino-Soviet Treaty; Operation Zet also provided for a group of Soviet volunteer combat aviators to join the Chinese Air Force in the fight against the Japanese occupation from late 1937 through 1939.\nThe United States embargoed Japan in 1941 depriving it of shipments of oil and various other resources necessary to continue the war in China. This pressure, which was intended to disparage a continuation of the war and bring Japan into negotiation, resulted in the Attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan's drive south to procure from the resource-rich European colonies in Southeast Asia by force the resources which the United States had denied to them.\nAlmost immediately, Chinese troops achieved another decisive victory in the Battle of Changsha, which earned the Chinese government much prestige from the Western Allies. China was one of the \"Big Four\" Allied Powers during the war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China as the world's \"Four Policemen\"; his primary reason for elevating China to such a status was the belief that after the war it would serve as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\nKnowledge of Japanese naval movements in the Pacific was provided to the American Navy by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO) which was run by the Chinese intelligence head Dai Li. Philippine and Japanese ocean weather was affected by weather originating near northern China. The base of SACO was located in Yangjiashan.\nChiang Kai-shek continued to receive supplies from the United States. However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the closing of the Burma Road in 1942 and its re-opening as the Ledo Road in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over \"The Hump\". In Burma, on 16 April 1942, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. After the Doolittle Raid, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of finding the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases. The operation started 15 May 1942, with 40 infantry battalions and 15\u201316 artillery battalions but was repelled by Chinese forces in September. During this campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army left behind a trail of devastation and also spread cholera, typhoid, plague and dysentery pathogens. Chinese estimates allege that as many as 250,000 civilians, the vast majority of whom were destitute Tanka boat people and other pariah ethnicities unable to flee, may have died of disease. It caused more than 16\u00a0million civilians to evacuate far away deep inward China. 90% of Ningbo's population had already fled before battle started.\nMost of China's industry had already been captured or destroyed by Japan, and the Soviet Union refused to allow the United States to supply China through the Kazakhstan into Xinjiang as the Xinjiang warlord Sheng Shicai had turned anti-Soviet in 1942 with Chiang's approval. For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives in Hubei and Changde.\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general Joseph Stilwell served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the China-Burma-India Theater. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as Barbara W. Tuchman) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the Kuomintang government, while others (such as Ray Huang and Hans van de Ven) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of out-waiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the Pacific Ocean Areas and South West Pacific Area, employing an island hopping strategy.\nLong-standing differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the Burma Road; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"Europe first\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the Burma Campaign was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial possessions. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general Claire Lee Chennault supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of the Indian independence movement in a 1942 meeting with Mohandas Gandhi, which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.\nAmerican and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China. Employing their racial background as a disguise, their mandate was to blend in with local citizens and wage a campaign of sabotage. Activities focused on destruction of Japanese transportation of supplies (signaling bomber destruction of railroads, bridges). Chinese forces advanced to northern Burma in late 1943, besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina, and captured Mount Song. The British and Commonwealth forces had their operation in Mission 204 which attempted to provide assistance to the Chinese Nationalist Army. The first phase in 1942 under command of SOE achieved very little, but lessons were learned and a second more successful phase, commenced in February 1943 under British Military command, was conducted before the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go offensive in 1944 compelled evacuation.\n1944-1945 and Operation Ichi-Go.\nIn 1944, the Communists launched counteroffensives from the liberated areas against Japanese forces.53\nJapan's 1944 Operation Ichi-Go was the largest military campaign of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The campaign mobilized 500,000 Japanese troops, 100,000 horses, 1,500 artillery pieces, and 800 tanks. The 750,000 casualty figure for Nationalist Chinese forces are not all dead and captured, Cox included in the 750,000 casualties that China incurred in Ichigo soldiers who simply \"melted away\" and others who were rendered combat ineffective besides killed and captured soldiers.\nIn late November 1944, the Japanese advance slowed approximately 300 miles from Chongqing as it experienced shortages of trained soldiers and materiel. Although Operation Ichi-Go achieved its goals of seizing United States air bases and establishing a potential railway corridor from Manchukuo to Hanoi, it did so too late to impact the result of the broader war. American bombers in Chengdu were moved to the Mariana Islands where, along with bombers from bases in Saipan and Tinian, they could still bomb the Japanese home islands.\nAfter Operation Ichigo, Chiang Kai-shek started a plan to withdraw Chinese troops from the Burma theatre against Japan in Southeast Asia for a counter offensive called \"White Tower\" and \"Iceman\" against Japanese soldiers in China in 1945.\nThe poor performance of Chiang Kai-shek's forces in opposing the Japanese advance during Operation Ichigo became widely viewed as demonstrating Chiang's incompetence. It irreparably damaged the Roosevelt administration's view of Chiang and the KMT. The campaign further weakened the Nationalist economy and government revenues. Because of the Nationalists' increasing inability to fund the military, Nationalist authorities overlooked military corruption and smuggling. The Nationalist army increasingly turned to raiding villages to press-gang peasants into service and force marching them to assigned units. Approximately 10% of these peasants died before reaching their units.\nBy the end of 1944, Chinese troops under the command of Sun Li-jen attacking from India, and those under Wei Lihuang attacking from Yunnan, joined forces in Mong-Yu, successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the Ledo Road, China's vital supply artery. In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook Hunan and Guangxi. With the Chinese army progressing well in training and equipment, Wedemeyer planned to launch Operation Carbonado in summer 1945 to retake Guangdong, thus obtaining a coastal port, and from there drive northwards toward Shanghai. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Soviet invasion of Manchuria hastened Japanese surrender and these plans were not put into action.\nChinese industrial base and the CIC.\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War had quickly harmed China's economy, with one of the earliest attacks being the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. With Shanghai, being a major industrial and foreign relations port for the Chinese and now under Japanese control, the Chinese economy industry took a big hit. In an effort to rectify this, Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (CIC) were created in 1937, under the \"Gung Ho\" Movement, before becoming formalized in 1938. The creation of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives allowed the Chinese people to establish smaller industry centers in small towns across China, allowing for economic and industrial production away from battle or possible Japanese invasion. In addition to supporting the economy, more immediate efforts were placed on supporting the Chinese military in producing whatever materials were needed for the war. Chinese refugees and those displaced by the war were hired by CICs to help production. The CICs relied on foreign aid and contributions, which drew mixed reactions. Overall, the CIC program failed as they had a goal of creating 30,000 cooperatives, but only succeeded in making approximately 2,000 cooperatives instead. The name \"Gung Ho\" comes from the Americanization of the Chinese name for Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. The full name, \"\u5de5\u696d\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\" (\"g\u014dng y\u00e8\" \"h\u00e9 zu\u00f2 sh\u00e8)\" was often shortened to the term \"\u5de5\u5408\" (\"g\u014dng\" \"h\u00e9\"), which was mistaken by U.S. Marine Evans Fordyce Carlson to mean \"work together\". Carlson then went on to use this believed motto as his slogan throughout the war, generating that phrase \"Gung Ho\" that has come to be in the English language.\nForeign aid.\nBefore the start of full-scale warfare of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Germany had since the time of the Weimar Republic, provided much equipment and training to crack units of the National Revolutionary Army of China, including some aerial-combat training with the \"Luftwaffe\" to some pilots of the pre-Nationalist Air Force of China. A number of foreign powers, including the Americans, Italians and Japanese, provided training and equipment to different air force units of pre-war China. With the outbreak of full-scale war between China and the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union became the primary supporter for China's \"war of resistance\" through the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact from 1937 to 1941. When the Imperial Japanese invaded French Indochina, the United States enacted the oil and steel embargo against Japan and froze all Japanese assets in 1941, and with it came the Lend-Lease Act of which China became a beneficiary on 6 May 1941; from there, China's main diplomatic, financial and military support came from the U.S., particularly following the attack on Pearl Harbor\".\"\nOverseas Chinese.\nOver 3,200 overseas Chinese drivers and motor vehicle mechanics embarked to wartime China to support military and logistics supply lines, especially through Indo-China, which became of absolute tantamount importance when the Japanese cut-off all ocean-access to China's interior with the capture of Nanning after the Battle of South Guangxi. Overseas Chinese communities in the U.S. raised money and nurtured talent in response to Imperial Japan's aggressions in China, which helped to fund an entire squadron of Boeing P-26 fighter planes purchased for the looming war situation between China and the Empire of Japan; over a dozen Chinese-American aviators, including John \"Buffalo\" Huang, Arthur Chin, Hazel Ying Lee, Chan Kee-Wong et al., formed the original contingent of foreign volunteer aviators to join the Chinese air forces (some provincial or warlord air forces, but ultimately all integrating into the centralized Chinese Air Force; often called the \"Nationalist Air Force of China\") in the \"patriotic call to duty for the motherland\" to fight against the Imperial Japanese invasion. Several of the original Chinese-American volunteer pilots were sent to Lagerlechfeld Air Base in Germany for aerial-gunnery training by the Chinese Air Force in 1936. Throughout the course of the war hundreds of overseas Chinese pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians from the United States, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Canada, and other countries fought in China and made up a significant portion of the Chinese Air Force. At least 13 were confirmed to have died in the line of duty or from illnesses.\nKorea.\nThe exiled Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (KPG) based in Chongqing allied with Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Army against the Japanese. The KPG established the Korean Liberation Army (KLA) to fight against the Japanese in China.\nGermany.\nPrior to the war, Germany and China were in close economic and military cooperation, with Germany helping China modernize its industry and military in exchange for raw materials. Germany sent military advisers such as Alexander von Falkenhausen to China to help the KMT government reform its armed forces. Some divisions began training to German standards and were to form a relatively small but well trained Chinese Central Army. By the mid-1930s about 80,000 soldiers had received German-style training. After the KMT lost Nanjing and retreated to Wuhan, Hitler's government decided to withdraw its support of China in 1938 in favour of an alliance with Japan as its main anti-Communist partner in East Asia.\nSoviet Union.\nAfter Germany and Japan signed the anti-communist Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet Union hoped to keep China fighting, in order to deter a Japanese invasion of Siberia and save itself from a two-front war. In September 1937, they signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and approved Operation Zet, the formation of a secret Soviet volunteer air force, in which Soviet technicians upgraded and ran some of China's transportation systems. Bombers, fighters, supplies and advisors arrived, headed by Aleksandr Cherepanov. Prior to the Western Allies, the Soviets provided the most foreign aid to China: some $250\u00a0million in credits for munitions and other supplies. The Soviet Union defeated Japan in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in May\u00a0\u2013 September 1939, leaving the Japanese reluctant to fight the Soviets again. In April 1941, Soviet aid to China ended with the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact and the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. This pact enabled the Soviet Union to avoid fighting against Germany and Japan at the same time. In August 1945, the Soviet Union annulled the neutrality pact with Japan and invaded Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, the Kuril Islands, and northern Korea. The Soviets also continued to support the Chinese Communist Party. In total, 3,665 Soviet advisors and pilots served in China, and 227 of them died fighting there.\nThe Soviet Union provided financial aid to both the Communists and the Nationalists.34\nUnited States.\nThe United States generally avoided taking sides between Japan and China until 1940, providing virtually no aid to China in this period. For instance, the 1934 Silver Purchase Act signed by President Roosevelt caused chaos in China's economy which helped the Japanese war effort. The 1933 Wheat and Cotton Loan mainly benefited American producers, while aiding to a smaller extent both Chinese and Japanese alike. This policy was due to US fear of breaking off profitable trade ties with Japan, in addition to US officials and businesses perception of China as a potential source of massive profit for the US by absorbing surplus American products, as William Appleman Williams states.\nFrom December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS \"Panay\" and the Nanjing Massacre swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to China. Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned iron ore exports in 1938. However, in July 1939, negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Khatira and the British Ambassador in Tokyo, Robert Craigie, led to an agreement by which the United Kingdom recognized Japanese conquests in China. At the same time, the US government extended a trade agreement with Japan for six months, then fully restored it. Under the agreement, Japan purchased trucks for the Kwantung Army, machine tools for aircraft factories, strategic materials (steel and scrap iron up to 16 October 1940, petrol and petroleum products up to 26 June 1941), and various other much-needed supplies.\nIn a hearing before the United States Congress House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, 19 April 1939, the acting chairman Sol Bloom and other Congressmen interviewed Maxwell S. Stewart, a former Foreign Policy Association research staff and economist who charged that America's Neutrality Act and its \"neutrality policy\" was a massive farce which only benefited Japan and that Japan did not have the capability nor could ever have invaded China without the massive amount of raw material America exported to Japan. America exported far more raw material to Japan than to China in the years 1937\u20131940. According to the United States Congress, the U.S.'s third largest export destination was Japan until 1940 when France overtook it due to France being at war too. Japan's military machine acquired war materials, automotive equipment, steel, scrap iron, copper, oil, that it wanted from the United States in 1937\u20131940 and was allowed to purchase aerial bombs, aircraft equipment, and aircraft from America up to the summer of 1938. A 1934 U.S. State Department memo even noted how Japan's business dealings with Standard Oil of New Jersey company, under the leadership of Walter Teagle, made United States oil the \"major portion of the petroleum and petroleum products now imported into Japan.\" War essentials exports from the United States to Japan increased by 124% along with a general increase of 41% of all American exports from 1936 to 1937 when Japan invaded China. Japan's war economy was fueled by exports to the United States at over twice the rate immediately preceding the war. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Japan corresponded to the following share of American exports.\nJapan invaded and occupied the northern part of French Indochina in September 1940 to prevent China from receiving the 10,000 tons of materials delivered monthly by the Allies via the Haiphong\u2013Yunnan Fou Railway line.\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. In spite of non-aggression pacts or trade connections, Hitler's assault threw the world into a frenzy of re-aligning political outlooks and strategic prospects.\nOn 21 July, Japan occupied the southern part of French Indochina (southern Vietnam and Cambodia), contravening a 1940 gentlemen's agreement not to move into southern French Indochina. From bases in Cambodia and southern Vietnam, Japanese planes could attack Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. As the Japanese occupation of northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.\nOn 24 July 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the US and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. This was a decisive moment in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long-term basis. It set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies, including the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.\nIn mid-1941, the United States government financed the creation of the American Volunteer Groups (AVG), of which one the \"Flying Tigers\" reached China, to replace the withdrawn Soviet volunteers and aircraft. The Flying Tigers did not enter actual combat until after the United States had declared war on Japan. Led by Chennault, their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their newly introduced Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters heavily armed with six 0.50-inch caliber machine guns and very fast diving speeds earned them wide recognition at a time when the Chinese Air Force and Allies in the Pacific and SE Asia were suffering heavy losses, and soon afterwards their \"boom and zoom\" high-speed hit-and-run air combat tactics would be adopted by the United States Army Air Forces.\nDisagreements existed both between the United States and the Nationalists, and within the United States military, about the form of aid.35 Chennault contended that aid should be in the form of building on the success of the Flying Tigers and go to the US Fourteenth Air Force in China.35 Lieutenant General Joseph Stilwell, who was in charge of training Nationalist divisions equipped by the United States, became increasingly frustrated by the Nationalists' refusal to use them to fight the Japanese in Burma or in southeastern China.35\nThe Sino-American Cooperative Organization was an organization created by the SACO Treaty signed by the Republic of China and the United States of America in 1942 that established a mutual intelligence gathering entity in China between the respective nations against Japan. It operated in China jointly along with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America's first intelligence agency and forerunner of the CIA while also serving as joint training program between the two nations. Among all the wartime missions that Americans set up in China, SACO was the only one that adopted a policy of \"total immersion\" with the Chinese. The \"Rice Paddy Navy\" or \"What-the-Hell Gang\" operated in the China-Burma-India theater, advising and training, forecasting weather and scouting landing areas for USN fleet and Gen Claire Chennault's 14th AF, rescuing downed American flyers, and intercepting Japanese radio traffic. An underlying mission objective during the last year of war was the development and preparation of the China coast for Allied penetration and occupation. Fujian was scouted as a potential staging area and springboard for the future military landing of the Allies of World War\u00a0II in Japan.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAfter the Tanggu Truce of 1933, Chiang Kai-Shek and the British government would have more friendly relations but were uneasy due to British foreign concessions there. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the British government would initially have an impartial viewpoint toward the conflict urging both to reach an agreement and prevent war. British public opinion would swing in favor of the Chinese after Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's car which had Union Jacks on it was attacked by Japanese aircraft with Hugessen being temporarily paralyzed with outrage against the attack from the public and government. The British public were largely supportive of the Chinese and many relief efforts were untaken to help China. Britain at this time was beginning the process of rearmament and the sale of military surplus was banned but there was never an embargo on private companies shipping arms. A number of unassembled Gloster Gladiator fighters were imported to China via Hong Kong for the Chinese Air Force. Between July 1937 and November 1938 on average 60,000 tons of munitions were shipped from Britain to China via Hong Kong. Attempts by the United Kingdom and the United States to do a joint intervention were unsuccessful as both countries had rocky relations in the interwar era.\nIn February 1941 a Sino-British agreement was forged whereby British troops would assist the Chinese \"Surprise Troops\" units of guerrillas already operating in China, and China would assist Britain in Burma.\nWhen Hong Kong was overrun in December 1941, the British Army Aid Group (B.A.A.G.) was set up and headquartered in Guilin, Guangxi. Its aim was to assist prisoners of war and internees to escape from Japanese camps. This led to the formation of the Hong Kong Volunteer Company which later fought in Burma. B.A.A.G. also sent agents to gather intelligence \u2013 military, political and economic in Southern China, as well as giving medical and humanitarian assistance to Chinese civilians and military personnel.\nA British-Australian commando operation, Mission 204 (\"Tulip Force\"), was initialized to provide training to Chinese guerrilla troops. The mission conducted two operations, mostly in the provinces of Yunnan and Jiangxi.\nThe first operation commenced in February 1942 from Burma on a long journey to the Chinese front. Due to issues with supporting the Chinese and gradual disease and supply issues, the first phase achieved very little and the unit was withdrawn in September.\nAnother phase was set up with lessons learned from the first. Commencing in February 1943 this time valid assistance was given to the Chinese 'Surprise Troops' in various actions against the Japanese. These involved ambushes, attacks on airfields, blockhouses, and supply depots. The unit operated successfully before withdrawal in November 1944.\nCommandos and members of SOE who had formed Force 136, worked with the Free Thai Movement who also operated in China, mostly while on their way into Thailand.\nAfter the Japanese blocked the Burma Road in April 1942, and before the Ledo Road was finished in early 1945, the majority of US and British supplies to the Chinese had to be delivered via airlift over the eastern end of the Himalayas known as \"The Hump\". Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous, but the airlift continued daily to August 1945, at great cost in men and aircraft.\nFrench Indochina.\nThe Chinese Kuomintang also supported the Vietnamese Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng (VNQDD) in its battle against French and Japanese imperialism. In Guangxi, Chinese military leaders were organizing Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army. Under the umbrella of KMT activities, a broad alliance of nationalists emerged. With Ho at the forefront, the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Independence League, usually known as the Viet Minh) was formed and based in the town of Jingxi. The pro-VNQDD nationalist Ho Ngoc Lam, a KMT army officer and former disciple of Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, was named as the deputy of Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, later to be Ho's Prime Minister. The front was later broadened and renamed the Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh (Vietnam Liberation League).\nThe Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General Zhang Fakui created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyen Hai Than, who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese. General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as Zhang's main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World WarII against Japanese forces. Franklin D. Roosevelt, through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire French Indochina (modern day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang Kai-shek control of all of Indochina. It was said that Chiang Kai-shek replied: \"Under no circumstances!\"\nAfter the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in French Indochina and to put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to maneuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh's forces against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement. In February 1946, he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the Chinese withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region. Following France's agreement to these demands, the withdrawal of Chinese troops began in March 1946.\nCentral Asian rebellions.\nIn 1937, then pro-Soviet General Sheng Shicai invaded Dunganistan accompanied by Soviet troops to defeat General Ma Hushan of the KMT 36th Division. General Ma expected help from Nanjing, but did not receive it. The Nationalist government was forced to deny these maneuvers as \"Japanese propaganda\", as it needed continued military supplies from the Soviets.\nAs the war went on, Nationalist General Ma Buqing was in virtual control of the Gansu corridor. Ma had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because the Soviet threat was great, Chiang in July 1942 directed him to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. Chiang further named Ma as Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten Sheng's southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam.\nThe Ili Rebellion broke out in Xinjiang when the Kuomintang Hui Officer Liu Bin-Di was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur rebels in November 1944. The Soviet Union supported the Turkic rebels against the Kuomintang, and Kuomintang forces fought back.\nEthnic minorities.\nJapan attempted to reach out to Chinese ethnic minorities in order to rally them to their side against the Han Chinese, but only succeeded with certain Manchu, Mongol, Uyghur, and Tibetan elements.\nThe Japanese attempt to get the Muslim Hui people on their side failed, as many Chinese generals such as Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang were Hui. The Japanese attempted to approach Ma Bufang but were unsuccessful in making any agreement with him. Ma Bufang ended up supporting the anti-Japanese Imam Hu Songshan, who prayed for the destruction of the Japanese. Ma became chairman (governor) of Qinghai in 1938 and commanded a group army. He was appointed because of his anti-Japanese inclinations, and was such an obstruction to Japanese agents trying to contact the Tibetans that he was called an \"adversary\" by a Japanese agent.\nHui Muslims.\nHui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons. Many Hui fought in the war against the Japanese such as Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Ma Zhanshan, Ma Biao, Ma Zhongying, Ma Buqing and Ma Hushan. Qinghai Tibetans served in the Qinghai army against the Japanese. The Qinghai Tibetans view the Tibetans of Central Tibet (Tibet proper, ruled by the Dalai Lamas from Lhasa) as distinct and different from themselves, and even take pride in the fact that they were not ruled by Lhasa ever since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire.\nXining was subjected to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941, causing all ethnicities in Qinghai to unite against the Japanese. General Han Youwen directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone by Ma Bufang, who hid in an air-raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in Han being buried in rubble, though he was later rescued.\nJohn Scott reported in 1934 that there was both strong anti-Japanese feeling and anti-Bolshevik among the Muslims of Gansu and he mentioned the Muslim generals Ma Fuxiang, Ma Qi, Ma Anliang and Ma Bufang who was chairman of Qinghai province when he stayed in Xining.\nConclusion in 1945 and aftermath.\nEnd of the Pacific War and the surrender of Japanese troops in China.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese had consistent tactical successes but failed to achieve strategic results. Although it seized the majority of China's industrial capacity, occupied most major cities, and rarely lost a battle, Japan's occupation of China was costly.70 Japan had approximately 50,000 military fatalities each year and 200,000 wounded per year.70\nIn less than two weeks the Kwantung Army, which was the primary Japanese fighting force, consisting of over a million men but lacking in adequate armour, artillery, or air support, had been destroyed by the Soviets. Japanese Emperor Hirohito officially capitulated to the Allies on 15 August 1945. The official surrender was signed aboard the battleship on 2 September 1945, in a ceremony where several Allied commanders including Chinese general Hsu Yung-chang were present.\nAfter the Allied victory in the Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding Manchuria), Taiwan and French Indochina north of 16\u00b0 north latitude to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on 9 September 1945, at 9:00. The ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month was chosen in echo of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) and because \"nine\" (\u4e5d \"ji\u01d4\") is a homophone of the word for \"long lasting\" (\u4e45) in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever).\nChiang relied on American help in transporting Nationalist troops to regain control of formerly Japanese-occupied areas.3 Non-Chinese generally viewed the behavior of these troops as undercutting Nationalist legitimacy, and these troops engaged in corruption and looting, leading to widespread views of a \"botched liberation\".3\nThe Nationalist government seized Japanese-held businesses at the time of the Japanese surrender.92 The Nationalist government made little effort to return these businesses to their original Chinese owners. A mechanism existed through which Chinese and foreign owners could petition for the return of their former property.92 In practice, the Nationalist government and its officials retained a great deal of the seized property and embezzling property, particularly from warehouses, was common.93 Nationalist officials sometimes extorted money from individuals in liberated territories under threat of labeling them as Japanese collaborators.93\nChiang's focus on his communist opponents prompted him to leave Japanese troops or troops of the Japanese puppet regimes to remain on duty in occupied areas so as to avoid their surrender to Communist forces.3\nPost-war struggle and resumption of the civil war.\nIn 1945, China emerged from the war a victor, but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\nThe poor performance of Nationalist forces opposing the Ichi-go campaign was largely viewed as reflecting poorly on Chiang's competence.3 Chiang blamed the failure on the United States, particularly Stilwell, who had used Chinese forces in the Burma Campaign and in Chiang's view, left China insufficiently defended.3\nAs part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation and famine in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\nIn Japanese-occupied areas, the Communists had established military and political bases from which it carried out guerilla warfare.35 The Communists built popular support in these areas, returning land to poor peasants, reducing peasant's rent, and arming the people.35 By Spring 1945, there were 19 Communist-governed areas in China in which 95 million people lived.36 In Fall 1945, the Communist armies had 1.27 million men and were supported by 2.68 million militia members.36\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in mainland China and the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949.\nAftermath.\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese, in which their guerrilla tactics were less effective, and generally limited their combat to guerrilla actions (the Hundred Regiments Offensive and the Battle of Pingxingguan are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to defend Shanghai and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CCP should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favourable timing\" by the end of 1941.\nLegacy.\nChina-Japan relations.\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan. The war remains a major roadblock for Sino-Japanese relations. Issues regarding the current historical outlook on the war exist. For example, the Japanese government has been accused of historical revisionism by allowing the approval of a few school textbooks omitting or glossing over Japan's militant past, although the most recent controversial book, the \"New History Textbook\" was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan and despite the efforts of the Japanese nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731, and the comfort women of World WarII, all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past.\nIn 2005, a history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform which had been approved by the government in 2001, sparked huge outcry and protests in China and Korea. It referred to the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities such as the Manila massacre as an \"incident\", glossed over the issue of comfort women, and made only brief references to the death of Chinese soldiers and civilians in Nanjing. A copy of the 2005 version of a junior high school textbook titled \"New History Textbook\" found that there is no mention of the \"Nanjing Massacre\" or the \"Nanjing Incident\". Indeed, the only one sentence that referred to this event was: \"they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December\".\nTaiwan.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was a Japanese colony that was used as a strategic base for military operations against China and Southeast Asia. Native Han Chinese inhabitants on the island were given the option of moving back to the mainland, although few did, and some put up an armed resistance against the Japanese. This formed the backbone of the nascent Taiwanese independence movement. In the period before the war in the Pacific widened, Japan came to regard Taiwan as an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\" and an important stepping stone in its military expansion.\nThere were indigenous Taiwanese who worked in Japan's defense and war-related industries in Taiwan that abetted Japan's war efforts. Many Taiwanese served in the Japanese military, including units that fought in China, resulting in the combat deaths of nearly 30,000. The future President, Lee Teng-hui (aa Kuomintang member) was one of those conscripted.\nAfter the surrender, Taiwan and the Penghu islands were put under the administrative control of the Republic of China (ROC) government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The ROC proclaimed Taiwan Retrocession Day on 25 October 1945. However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established People's Republic of China in mainland China nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco, as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement. Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.\nIn 1952, the Treaty of Taipei was signed separately between the ROC and Japan that basically followed the same guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the Taiwanese people and the juridical person should be the people and the juridical person of the ROC. Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender which specifically accepted the Potsdam Declaration which refers to the Cairo Declaration. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World WarII, including Taiwan.\nTraditionally, the Republic of China government has held celebrations marking the Victory Day on 9 September (now known as Armed Forces Day) and Taiwan's Retrocession Day on 25 October. However, after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential election in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the pro-independent DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold Taipei held a series of talks in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the presidential election in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.\nJapanese women left in China.\nSeveral thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China. The majority of these were women, and they married mostly Chinese men and became known as \"stranded war wives\" (zanryu fujin).\nThe Japanese government claims that these women had willingly chosen to stay in China, believing that women thirteen years of age and older were capable of making the decision to stay or leave China. Due to this, many women faced legal and cultural concerns about returning to Japan, such as less employment opportunities, less governmental aid and discrimination. Many of these women had gotten married and started families with Chinese men, which produced children ineligible to enter Japan due to their lack of Japanese citizenship. Additionally, Japan created repatriation legislation determined by both based on age (if they were minors) and if the individual willfully stayed in China or was forcibly separated from Japan. Other factors such as poor Sino-Japanese relations as well as poorer communication to rural areas, where many of these women lived, also prevented many Japanese women from returning to Japan.\nKorean women left in China.\nIn China some Korean comfort women stayed behind instead of going back to their native land. Most Korean comfort women who were left behind in China married Chinese men.\nKorean women and young girls brought to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War were brought by the Japanese as comfort women. These women were used as a sexual outlet by Japanese soldiers. Since the early 1930s, the Japanese brought more than two hundred thousand women, mostly Korean women, to China; however some estimates reach up to five hundrend thousand women. Many of the women became pregnant and gave birth to children. Some women recall being raped by Japanese soldiers more than fifty times a day. While some of these Korean women also stayed in China and married Chinese men and started families, many were killed by the Japanese towards the end of the war. Those who returned to Korea faced social barring and stigmatism, making it difficult for these women to move on from their horrific pasts, and some knowing of the shame they would face stayed in China.\nCommemorations.\nThree major museums in China commemorate China's War of Resistance, including the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. China also holds parades, memorials and other annual events, often held on September 3, to commemorate the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. These events reflect on events of the war, such as the Nanjing Massacre, while creating a collective sense of national unity and remembrance.\nJapan holds a national memorial on August 15, which features statements from government officials and many Japanese visit the Yasukuni Shrine, which continues to be a controversial point in Japanese relations with China and South Korea. Museums such as the Yushukan Museum in Tokyo, which has an exhibit dedicated to the Second Sino-Japanese War containing artifacts of military elites, and memorial museums for Hiroshima and Nagasaki all allow the Japanese to remember the events of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.\nThe days during which each country holds its respective commemorations relate to events surrounding the end of World War II. China observes September 3 as that day, marking when Japan officially surrendered in Tokyo. Japan observes August 15 as it is the day when Emperor Hirohito declared Japan's surrender.\nCasualties.\nThe conflict lasted eight years, two months, and two days (from 7 July 1937 to 9 September 1945). The total number of casualties that resulted from this war (and subsequently theater) equaled more than half the total number of casualties that later resulted from the entire Pacific War.\nJapanese.\nThe Japanese recorded around 1.1 to 1.9million military casualties during all of World WarII (which includes those killed, wounded, and missing). The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, was 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria and Burma campaign).\nAnother source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died or went missing in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of the 1,130,000 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers who died during World WarII, 39 percent died in China.\nThen in \"War Without Mercy\", John W. Dower claims that a total of 396,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of this number, the Imperial Japanese Army lost 388,605 soldiers, and the Imperial Japanese Navy lost 8,000 soldiers. Another 54,000 soldiers also died after the war had ended, mostly from illness and starvation. Of the 1,740,955 Japanese soldiers who died during World WarII, 22 percent died in China.\nJapanese statistics, however, lack complete estimates for the wounded. From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940. From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end. Chinese forces also report that by May 1945, 22,293 Japanese soldiers were captured as prisoners. Many more Japanese soldiers surrendered when the war ended.\nContemporary studies from the Beijing Central Compilation and Translation Press state that the Japanese suffered a total of 2,227,200 casualties, including 1,055,000 dead and 1,172,341 injured. This Chinese publication analyzes statistics provided by Japanese publications and claims these numbers were largely based on Japanese publications.\nBoth Nationalist and Communist Chinese sources report that their respective forces were responsible for the deaths of over 1.7\u00a0million Japanese soldiers. Nationalist War Minister He Yingqin himself contested the Communists' claims, finding it impossible for a force of \"untrained, undisciplined, poorly equipped\" guerrillas of Communist forces to have killed so many enemy soldiers.\nThe Nationalist Chinese authorities ridiculed Japanese estimates of Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear much lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.\nUse of chemical and biological weapons.\nDespite Article 23 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, article V of the Treaty in Relation to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare, article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles and a resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May 1938, condemning the use of poison gas by the Empire of Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army frequently used chemical weapons during the war.\nAccording to Walter E. Grunden, history professor at Bowling Green State University, Japan permitted the use of chemical weapons in China because the Japanese concluded that Chinese forces did not possess the capacity to retaliate in kind. The Japanese incorporated gas warfare into many aspects of their army, which includes special gas troops, infantry, artillery, engineers and air force; the Japanese were aware of basic gas tactics of other armies, and deployed multifarious gas warfare tactics in China. The Japanese were very dependent on gas weapons when they were engaged in chemical warfare.\nJapan used poison gas at Hankow during the Battle of Wuhan to break fierce Chinese resistance after conventional Japanese assaults were repelled by Chinese defenders. Rana Mitter writes, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Under General Xue Yue, some 100,000 Chinese troops pushed back Japanese forces at Huangmei. At the fortress of Tianjiazhen, thousands of men fought until the end of September, with Japanese victory assured only with the use of poison gas.\nAccording to Freda Utley, during the battle at Hankow, in areas where Japanese artillery or gunboats on the river could not reach Chinese defenders on hilltops, Japanese infantrymen had to fight Chinese troops on the hills. She noted that the Japanese were inferior at hand-to-hand combat against the Chinese, and resorted to deploying poison gas to defeat the Chinese troops. She was told by General Li Zongren that the Japanese consistently used tear gas and mustard gas against Chinese troops. Li also added that his forces could not withstand large scale deployments of Japanese poison gas. Since Chinese troops did not have gas-masks, the poison gases provided enough time for Japanese troops to bayonet debilitated Chinese soldiers.\nDuring the battle in Yichang of October 1941, Japanese troops used chemical munitions in their artillery and mortar fire, and warplanes dropped gas bombs all over the area; since the Chinese troops were poorly equipped and without gas-masks, they were severely gassed, burned and killed.\nAccording to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the Imperial General Headquarters. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938. They were also used during the invasion of Changde. Those orders were transmitted either by Prince Kan'in Kotohito or General Hajime Sugiyama. Gases manufactured in Okunoshima were used more than 2,000 times against Chinese soldiers and civilians in the war in China in the 1930s and 1940s\nBacteriological weapons provided by Shir\u014d Ishii's units were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague. During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These attacks caused epidemic plague outbreaks. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, of the 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with the disease, about 1,700 Japanese troops died when the biological weapons rebounded on their own forces. According to statistics from the Nationalist government, the Japanese army from July 1937 until September 1945 used poison gas 1,973 times. Based on available data, a total of 103,069 Chinese soldiers and civilians died from biological and chemical weapons.\nJapan gave its own soldiers methamphetamines in the form of Philopon.\nUse of suicide attacks.\nChinese armies deployed \"dare to die corps\" () or \"suicide squads\" against the Japanese.\nSuicide bombing was also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives, such as grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang, where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69982", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69982", "title": "Charles", "text": "Charles is a masculine given name predominantly found in English and French speaking countries. It is from the French form \"Charles\" of the Proto-Germanic name \u16b2\u16a8\u16b1\u16c1\u16da\u16a8\u16c9 (in runic alphabet) or \"*karilaz\" (in Latin alphabet), whose meaning was \"free man\". The Old English descendant of this word was \"\u010aearl\" or \"\u010aeorl\", as the name of King Cearl of Mercia, that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England.\nThe name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as \"Karolus\" (as in \"Vita Karoli Magni\"), later also as \"Carolus\".\nEtymology.\nThe name's etymology is a Common Germanic noun \"*karilaz\" meaning \"free man\", which survives in English as churl (&lt; Old English \"\u010beorl\"), which developed its deprecating sense in the Middle English period.\nSome Germanic languages, for example Dutch and German, have retained the word in two separate senses. In the particular case of Dutch, \"Karel\" refers to the given name, whereas the noun \"kerel\" means \"a bloke, fellow, man\".\nIn the form \"Charles\", the initial spelling \"ch-\" corresponds to the palatalization of the Latin group \"ca-\" to [t\u0283a] in Central Old French (Francien) and the final \"-s\" to the former subjective case (cas sujet) of masculine names in Old French like in Giles or James (&lt; Latin \"-us\", see Spanish/ Portuguese \"Carlos\").\nAccording to Julius Pokorny, the historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist, the root meaning of Charles is \"old man\", from Indo-European *\u011der-, where the \u011d is a palatal consonant, meaning \"to rub; to be old; grain.\" An old man has been worn away and is now grey with age.\nIn some Slavic languages, the name \"Drago\" (and variants: \"Dragomir\", \"Dragoslav\", etc., all based on the root \"drag\" 'dear') has been used as an equivalent for \"Charles\" (\"Karel\", etc.). This is based on the false etymology deriving \"Carl\" from Latin \"carus\" 'dear'. Examples are the Slovene politician Karel De\u017eman (1821\u20131889), also known as \"Dragotin De\u017eman\", and the Slovene historian Dragotin Lon\u010dar (1876\u20131954), baptized \"Carl\".\nHistory.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe name is atypical for Germanic names as it is not composed of two elements, but simply a noun meaning \"(free) man\". This meaning of \"ceorl\" contrasts with \"eorl\" (Old Norse \"jarl\") \"nobleman\" on one hand and with \"\u00feeow\" (Old Norse \"\u00fer\u00e6ll\") \"bondsman, slave\" on the other. As such it would not seem a likely candidate for the name of a Germanic king, but it is attested as such with Cearl of Mercia (fl.\u2009620), the first Mercian king mentioned by Bede in his \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\". It is a peculiarity of the Anglo-Saxon royal names that many of the rulers of the earliest period (6th to 7th centuries) have monothematic (simplex) names, while the standard dithematic names become almost universal from the 8th century. Compare the name of King Mul of Kent (7th century) which simply translates to \"mule\".\nCharles Martel, the son of Pepin of Herstal and Alpaida, was either illegitimate or the product of a bigamous marriage, and therefore indeed a \"free man\", but not of noble rank. After his victory at the Battle of Soissons (718), Charles Martel styled himself Duke of the Franks. Charles' eldest son was named Carloman (c.\u2009710\u00a0\u2013 754), a rare example of the element \"carl-\" occurring in a compound name. \nThe \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" names an earlier \"Carloman\" as the father of Pepin of Landen, and thus the great-great-grandfather of the Charles Martel. This would place the name \"Carloman\" in the 6th century, and open the possibility that the Frankish name \"Carl\" may originate as a short form of \"Carloman\". The only other compound name with the \"Carl-\" prefix is \"Carlofred\" (\"Carlefred\"), attested in the 7th century; as a suffix, it occurs in the rare names \"Altcarl\" and \"Gundecarl\" (9th and 11th centuries, respectively).\nCharlemagne (742\u2013814) was Charles Martel's grandson. After Charlemagne's reign, the name became irrevocably connected with him and his Carolingian dynasty.\nAfter Charlemagne, the name Charles (\"Karol\") became even the standard word for \"king\" in Slavic (Czech and Slovak \"kr\u00e1l\", Polish \"kr\u00f3l\"; South Slavic \"kral\" \u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b, \"kr\u0203lj\" \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459; Russian \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c), Baltic (Latvian \"karalis\", Lithuanian \"karalius\") and Hungarian (\"kir\u00e1ly\").\nCharlemagne's son Charles the Younger died without issue, but the name resurfaces repeatedly within the 9th-century Carolingian family tree, so with Charles the Bald (823\u2013877), Charles the Fat (839\u2013888) Charles of Provence (845\u2013863), Charles the Child (847/848\u2013866) and Charles the Simple (879\u2013929).\nLater Middle Ages and Early Modern history.\nThe name survives into the High Middle Ages (Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine; Charles, Count of Valois; Charles I, Count of Flanders (Charles the Good, beatified in 1882); Charles I of Naples; Charles I of Hungary). Karl Sverkersson was a king of Sweden in the 12th century, counted as \"Charles VII\" due to a genealogical fiction of the 17th century by Charles \"IX\", but actually the first king of Sweden with this name.\nCharles resurfaces as a royal name in Germany with Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1316\u20131378, counted as \"the fourth\" after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Fat) and in France with Charles IV of France (1294\u20131328, \"the fourth\" after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Simple), and becomes comparatively widespread in the Late Middle Ages (Charles I, Duke of Savoy, Charles III, Duke of Savoy).\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500\u20131558) gives rise to a tradition of Charlses in Habsburg Spain (Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, Charles II of Spain, Charles III of Spain, Charles IV of Spain).\nThe numbering scheme for the kings of Sweden was continued in modern times with Charles X Gustav, Charles XI, Charles XII, Charles XIII, Charles XIV John and Charles XV.\nCharles I of England (1600\u20131649) is followed by Charles II of England (1630\u20131685). The Province of Carolina is named during the rule of Charles II, after Charles I.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine (1661\u20131742).\nModern history.\nCarlism is a political movement in Spain seeking the establishment of a separate line of the Bourbon family on the Spanish throne. This line descended from Infante Carlos, Count of Molina (1788\u20131855), and was founded due to dispute over the succession laws and widespread dissatisfaction with the Alfonsine line of the House of Bourbon. The movement was at its strongest in the 1830s, causing the Carlist Wars, and had a revival following Spain's defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898, and lasted until the end of the Franco regime in 1975 as a social and political force\nCharles Floyd (1782\u20131804) was the only casualty in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Charles DeRudio (1832\u20131910) was an Italian aristocrat, would-be assassin of Napoleon III, and later a career U.S. Army officer who fought in the 7th U.S. Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Charles Albert Varnum (1849\u20131936) was the commander of the scouts in the Little Bighorn Campaign and received the Medal of Honor for his actions in a conflict following the Battle of Wounded Knee.\n\"Lonesome\" Charley Reynolds (1842\u20131876) was a scout in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment who was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n\"Carl\" has been a very popular male given name in the United States during the late 19th to early 20th centuries, consistently ranking in the top 30 male given names in the US from 1887 to 1938, and remaining among the top 100 until the 1980s, but since declining below rank 500. \"Charles\" has always been among the top 100 names in the U.S. since records started in 1880. In addition, it is among the top 100 names given in England and Wales; the current King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, Charles III, is a notable bearer of the name. In 2022, it was the 26th most popular name given to boys in Canada.\nDerived feminine names.\nCaroline and Charlotte are feminine given names derived from \"Carl\".\nCharlotte is late medieval, e.g. Charlotte of Savoy (1441\u20131483), Charlotte of Cyprus (1444\u20131487). It was introduced to Britain in the 17th century, and gave rise to hypocorisms such as \"Lottie, Tottie, Totty\".\nCaroline is early modern, e.g. Caroline of Ansbach (1683\u20131737). It has given rise to numerous variations, such as \" Carlyn, Carolina, Carolyn, Karolyn, Carolin, Karolina, Karoline, Karolina, Carolien\", as well as hypocorisms, such as \"Callie, Carol, Carrie\", etc.\nAnother derived feminine name is Carla (Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish), a name which dates from early Italy.\nRegional forms:\nList of notable people.\nIn religion.\nSaints.\nThere are a number of historical figures known as \"Saint Charles\", although few are recognized across confessions. \nIn the context of English and British history, \"Saint Charles\" is typically Charles I of England, recognized as a saint in the Anglican confession only. \nIn Roman Catholicism, the best known Saint Charles is Charles Borromeo (1538\u20131584), an Italian cardinal, canonized by Pope Paul V in 1606.\nCharles, Duke of Brittany (1319\u20131364) had been canonized after his death, but Pope Gregory XI annulled this. Charles the Good (died 1127) is sometimes referred to as a saint, but while he was beatified in 1904, he has not been canonized.\nOther Saints of the Roman Catholic Church, canonized after 1900:\nBeatified:\n\"See #History above for medieval and early modern royalty and nobility.

In 1980 he shared the Age Book of the Year award for his novel \"Homesickness\".\nHe was born in Adelaide, South Australia, a son of Cyril Lindsay Bail (1914\u20131966). He has lived most of his life in Australia except for sojourns in India (1968\u201370), England and Europe (1970\u201374). He lives in Sydney.\nHe was trustee of the National Gallery of Australia from 1976 to 1981 and wrote a book on Australian artist Ian Fairweather.\nA portrait of Bail by the artist Fred Williams is hung in the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. The portrait was done while both Williams and Bail were Council members of the National Gallery of Australia.\nCareer.\nHe is most well known for \"Eucalyptus\", which won the Miles Franklin Award in 1999. His other work includes the novels \"Homesickness\", which was a joint winner of The Age Book of the Year in 1980, and \"Holden's Performance\", another award-winner. Reviewers recently compared Bail's \"Notebooks 1970-2003\" with Proust, Gide and Val\u00e9ry's. \"The Pages\" [2008] was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. His latest novel, \"The Voyage\", was released in November 2012.\nLaurie Clancy suggests that Bail is, with Peter Carey and Frank Moorhouse, one of the chief innovators in Australian short story writing, and that he was part of its revival in the 1970s. He notes that Bail is particularly interested in the relationship between language and reality, and that this is evident in his early short stories. About the story \u2018Portrait of Electricity\u2019 from the collection \"Contemporary Portraits and Other Stories\" (1975), Clancy says that \"the story displays the strange mixture of surrealist fantasy and broad satire of Australian mores that characterizes all of Bail's work\".\nAfter early success with short fiction, Bail turned to the novel as a form commensurate with his vision of life's complexity, which emerges in all its perplexing intricacy in \"Homesickness\". This first novel describes the unscripted, global travels of a group of Australian tourists to diverse museums, real and imaginary. His next book, \"Holden's Performance\", dealt more overtly with issues of national identity and the diverse forces that shape individual character. His later novels explored related issues in terms of a key binary: in \"Eucalyptus\", these are empirical knowledge and imagination, and in \"The Pages\" psychology and philosophy. Bail prides himself on being a novelist of ideas, who is determined to be audacious in his creations and to challenge reader expectations and complacency.\nThe standard study of his work is Michael Ackland's \"The Experimental Fiction of Murray Bail\" (2012).\nPersonal life.\nBail is the second of four children. His father worked in the tramways and his mother was a homemaker. He attended Norwood Technical High School.\nBail started working in advertising agencies in Adelaide and Melbourne. He and his first wife moved to India in 1968, where he worked in an advertising agency in Bombay. He contracted amoebic dysentery on his travels, and went to London for treatment at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. There he decided the novel he had written in India was worthless, so he threw it in the garbage. He remained in London for five years, the first year being spent on the dole, before returning to Australia in 1975.\nBail has been married and divorced twice. He was first married in 1965, and divorced in 1988. His second wife was fellow writer Helen Garner, whom he married in 1992. They divorced in 1998.\nBibliography.\nShort fiction.\n\"The Drover's Wife\" was used by Sue Brooks for her 1984 short film. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest city in Argolis and a major center in the same prefecture, having nearly twice the population of the prefectural capital, Nafplio.\nSince the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138\u00a0km2. It is from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years.\nA resident of the city of Argos is known as an Argive ( , ; ). However, this term is also used to refer to those ancient Greeks generally who assaulted the city of Troy during the Trojan War; the term is more widely applied by the Homeric bards.\nNumerous ancient monuments can be found in the city today. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local economy.\nEtymology.\nThere are several proposed etyma. The name is associated with the legendary Argus, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Asty (, \"Citadel of Phoroneus\"). Both the personal name and placename are linked to the word (), which meant \"white\" or \"shining\"; possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the Argolic plain during harvest time. According to Strabo, the name could have even originated from the word () 'field' by metathesis of the consonants.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nHerodotus first recorded the myth of the traditional story of Argos being the origin of the ancient Macedonian royal house of the Argead dynasty (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, Arge\u00e1dai) of Philip II and Alexander the Great. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In classical times, Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars. \nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7,000 years ago in the late Neolithic, located on the foot of Aspida hill. Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. And while the name \"Argos\" is generally accepted to have a Hellenic Indo-European etymology, \"Larissa\" is generally held to derive from a Pre-Greek substrate.\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among Nemea, Corinth and Arcadia. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake Lerna, which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\nMycenaean Argos.\nArgos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of Mycenae and Tiryns became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\nArchaic Argos.\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King Pheidon. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the Argolid and challenged Sparta's dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the Battle of Hyssiae in 669\u2013668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle. During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\nClassical Argos.\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of \"stasis\". The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city. Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra. For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos's neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC. This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens. This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC. This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC. Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\nArgos played a minor role in the Corinthian Wars against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos remained an important but politically inconsistent polis in the Peloponnese. Although it was counted among the four major Greek cities by Isokrates in 346 BC, alongside Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, this was primarily due to its symbolic status as the legendary birthplace of the Argead dynasty, the royal house of Macedon. In reality, Argos was militarily and politically weakened, plagued by internal strife and civic violence throughout the 4th century BC.\nIn the 350s BC, Argos joined Messene and Megalopolis in resisting renewed Spartan aggression, particularly during Archidamos III\u2019s campaigns against the anti-Spartan alliance. The Argives participated in defending Megalopolis but quickly withdrew after a defeat at Orneai and the arrival of Theban reinforcements, reflecting a broader pattern of military reluctance and limited effectiveness.\nAfter the Peace of Philocrates in 346 BC, Argos increasingly engaged with Philip II of Macedon. While Demosthenes accused Argive leaders of collaborating with Macedon, this relationship appears to have been driven more by strategic concerns than ideological alignment. Macedonian sympathizers, including Myrtis, Teledamos, and Mnaseas, held power in the city by 330 BC. However, Argos maintained a cautious neutrality during key conflicts, such as the Battle of Chaironeia in 338 BC, where it sent no troops to support either side.\nDespite Argos\u2019s neutral stance, Philip II rewarded the polis in 337 BC with Spartan territory as part of a broader reordering of Peloponnesian borders intended to weaken Sparta and reward its rivals. Argos received either the contested region of Thyreatis, the eastern seaboard of Mount Parnon, or both, though the exact territorial allocation remains debated. This expansion made Argos one of the largest territorial states in the Peloponnese, controlling an area reaching up to 1,400\u00a0km\u00b2.\nThe decision to grant Argos territory was likely influenced by its symbolic connection to the Argeads and its longstanding enmity with Sparta. However, Philip\u2019s limited trust in Argos, due to its earlier alliance with Athens in 342 BC and its absence at Chaironeia, may have tempered the extent of his generosity. Later Macedonian kings, such as Antigonus III Doson, would reaffirm Argive control over disputed areas like Zarax.\nDemocracy in Classical Argos.\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416. Democracy was first established after a disastrous defeat by the Spartans at the Battle of Sepeia in 494. So many Argives were killed in the battle that a revolution ensued, in which previously disenfranchised outsiders were included in the state for the first time.\nArgive democracy included an Assembly (called the \"aliaia\"), a Council (the \"bola\"), and another body called 'The Eighty,' whose precise responsibilities are obscure. Magistrates served six-month terms of office, with few exceptions, and were audited at the end of their terms. There is some evidence that ostracism was practiced.\nHellenistic Argos.\nFollowing the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Argos joined the anti-Macedonian coalition during the Lamian War alongside Athens, Aitolia, Messenia, and others. This shift from its previous ambivalence under Philip II reflected the rise of anti-Macedonian sentiment and leadership within the city. However, Argos\u2019s commitment was limited; like other Peloponnesian poleis, it showed little resolve in sustained military engagement, and after early enthusiasm, returned to a pattern of defensive caution.\nIn 318 BC, when Polyperchon, the regent of Macedon, issued a \"diagramma\" ordering the restoration of regimes as they had been under Philip II and Alexander. He addressed a specific letter to Argos and the other cities, urging the exile or execution of pro-Antipatrid leaders and the confiscation of their property. The fact that Argos was the only polis explicitly named underscores its symbolic significance as the legendary homeland of the Argead dynasty. The Argive assembly initially aligned itself with Polyperchon and his son Alexandrer; however, in the summer of 316 BC, Cassander installed Apollonides as the strategos of Argos and garrisoned the city. While Apollonides campaigned in Arcadia the following year, the Argives invited Polyperchon\u2019s son Alexander to retake the city. Apollonides's campaign was successful (he captured Stymphalus in a night attack), but was cut short. Upon hearing of the Argive's treachery, Apollonides returned to Argos enacted a brutal purge: approximately 500 supporters of Polyperchon were burned alive in the prytaneion. The conspirators not burned alive were either exiled or put to death. This event was only the second major purge in Argive history after the infamous Scytalism (, ) of 370BC and may have eliminated as much as 5% of the hoplite citizen class.\nThis \u201cdecapitation\u201d of the political leadership likely contributed to Argos\u2019s declining engagement in inter-polis affairs and its later detachment from emerging federal formations such as the Achaean League. Cassander likely certainly installed a pro-Macedonian oligarchy afterward, which remained in control until 303 BC when Argos joined several northern and central Peloponnesian poleis which defected to Demetrius. The liberation of Argos was mythologized by the Argives themselves in inscriptions that attributed the city\u2019s freedom to divine intervention, notably from Apollo, while omitting Demetrius entirely.\nThe political status of Argos after the Antigonid defeat at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC is unclear. While Plutarch refers to Demetrius recovering various Peloponnesian cities that had turned against him, he does not identify them by name, so Argos\u2019s inclusion remains speculative. Other poleis in the Argolic Akte like as Troizen were likely brought back under Demetrius\u2019s influence in 295 BC. Troizen\u2019s later contribution of ships and troops to his Asian expedition in 286 BC suggests that at least some level of Antigonid control or cooperation persisted. After Demetrius\u2019s death, the broader control of the Argolic cities becomes difficult to trace. It is uncertain whether Gonatas inherited authority over these areas. Troizen did continue to host a Macedonian garrison into the early 270s, which was expelled during a campaign by the Spartan regent Cleonymus. However, no comparable military activity is recorded for Argos during this time.\nBy 272 BC, during the Epirote king Pyrrhus\u2019s invasion of the Peloponnese, Argos appears to have been autonomous but politically fractured. While Pyrrhus was campaigning in the Peloponnese, the Argives invited him to intervene in a civic dispute. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, Pyrrhus hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused Battle of Argos in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped. While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him. Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his Life of Pyrrhus.\nRoman and Byzantine period.\nUnder Roman rule, Argos was part of the province of Achaea. While prosperous during the early principate, Argos along with much of Greece and the Balkans experienced disasters during the Crisis of the 3rd Century when external threats and internal revolts left the Empire in turmoil. During Gallienus's reign, marauding bands of Goths and Heruli sailed down from the Black Sea in AD267 and devastated the Greek coastline and interior. Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes and Argos were all sacked. Gallienus finally cut off their retreat north and destroyed them with great slaughter at Naissus in Moesia.\nWith the death of the last emperor over a unified Empire, Theodosius I, the Visigoths under their leader Alaric I descended into Greece in 396\u2013397 A.D., sacking and pillaging as they went. Neither the eastern or western Roman warlords, Rufinus (consul) or Stilicho, made an effective stand against them due to the political situation between them. Athens and Corinth were both sacked. While the exact level of destruction for Argos is disputed due to the conflicting nature of the ancient sources, the level of damage to the city and people was considerable. Stilicho finally landed in western Greece and forced the Visigoths north of Epirus. Sites said to have been destroyed in Argos include the Hypostyle hall, parts of the agora, the odeion, and the Aphrodision. In the late 7th century, it became part of the Theme of Hellas, and later of the Theme of the Peloponnese.\nCrusader and Ottoman rule.\nIn the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the Crusaders captured the castle built on Larisa Hill, the site of the ancient acropolis, and the area became part of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia. In 1388, it was sold to the Republic of Venice, but was taken by the Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos before the Venetians could take control of the city; he sold it anyway to them in 1394. The Crusaders established a Latin bishopric. Venetian rule lasted until 1463, when the Ottomans captured the city.\nIn 1397, the Ottomans plundered Argos, carrying off part of the population, to sell as slaves. The Venetians repopulated the town and region with Albanian settlers, granting them long-term agrarian tax exemptions. Together with the Greeks of Argos, they supplied stratioti troops to the armies of Venice. Throughout the Ottoman\u2013Venetian wars, many Albanians died or were captured in service to the Venetians; at Nafpaktos, Nafplio, Argos, Methoni, Koroni and Pylos. Furthermore, 8,000 Albanian stratioti, most of them along with their families, left the Peloponnese to continue their military service under the Republic of Venice or the Kingdom of Naples. At the end of the Ottoman\u2013Venetian wars, a large number of Albanians had fled from the Peloponnese to Sicily. Some historians consider the French military term \"argoulet\" to derive from the Greek \"argetes\", or inhabitant of Argos, as a large number of French stratioti came from the plain of Argos.\nDuring Ottoman rule, Argos was divided in four mahalas, or quarters; the Greek (R\u00fbm) mahala, Liepur mahala, Bekir Efenti mahala and Karamoutza or Besikler mahala, respectively corresponding to what is now the northeastern, the northwestern, the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. The Greek mahala was also called the \"quarter of the unfaithful of Archos town\" in Turkish documents, whereas Liepur mahala (the quarter of the rabbits) was composed mostly of Albanian emigrants and well-reputed families. Karamoutza mahala was home to the most prominent Turks and boasted a mosque (modern-day church of Agios Konstadinos), a Turkish cemetery, Ali Nakin Bei's serail, Turkish baths and a Turkish school. It is also at this period when the open market of the city is first organised on the site north to Kapodistrias's barracks, at the same spot where it is held in modern times. A mosque would have existed there, too, according to the city planning most Ottoman cities followed.\nArgos grew exponentially during this time, with its sprawl being unregulated and without planning. As French explorer Pouqueville noted, \"its houses are not aligned, without order, scattered all over the place, divided by home gardens and uncultivated areas\". Liepur mahala appears to have been the most organised, having the best layout, while Bekir mahala and Karamoutza mahala were the most labyrinthine. However, all quarters shared the same type of streets; firstly, they all had main streets which were wide, busy and public roads meant to allow for communication between neighbourhoods (typical examples are, to a great extent, modern-day Korinthou, Nafpliou and Tripoleos streets). Secondary streets were also common in all four quarters since they lead to the interior of each mahala, having a semi-public character, whereas the third type of streets referred to dead-end private alleys used specifically by families to access their homes. Remnants of this city layout can be witnessed even today, as Argos still preserves several elements of this Ottoman type style, particularly with its long and complicated streets, its narrow alleys and its densely constructed houses.\nIndependence and modern history.\nWith the exception of a period of Venetian domination in 1687\u20131715, Argos remained in Ottoman hands until the beginning of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, when wealthy Ottoman families moved to nearby Nafplio due to its stronger walling.\nAt that time, as part of the general uprising, many local governing bodies were formed in different parts of the country, and the \"Consulate of Argos\" was proclaimed on 28 March 1821, under the Peloponnesian Senate. It had a single head of state, Stamatellos Antonopoulos, styled \"Consul\", between 28 March and 26 May 1821.\nLater, Argos accepted the authority of the unified Provisional Government of the First National Assembly at Epidaurus, and eventually became part of the Kingdom of Greece. With the coming of governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, the city underwent efforts of modernisation. Being an agricultural village, the need for urban planning was vital. For this reason, in 1828, Kapodistrias himself appointed mechanic Stamatis Voulgaris as the creator of a city plan which would offer Argos big streets, squares and public spaces. However, both Voulgaris and, later, French architect de Borroczun's plans were not well received by the locals, with the result that the former had to be revised by Zavos. Ultimately, none of the plans were fully implemented. Still, the structural characteristics of de Borroczun's plan can be found in the city today, despite obvious proof of pre-revolutionary layout, such as the unorganised urban sprawl testified in the area from Inachou street to the point where the railway tracks can be found today.\nIn 1829, Argos housed the Fourth National Assembly, an important event in modern Greek history, which made major changes like establishing the Senate of Greece and adopting the phoenix as the country's first currency.\nAfter talks concerning the intentions of the Greek government to move the Greek capital from Nafplio to Athens, discussions regarding the possibility of Argos also being a candidate as the potential new capital became more frequent, with supporters of the idea claiming that, unlike Athens, Argos was naturally protected by its position and benefited from a nearby port (Nafplio). Moreover, it was maintained that construction of public buildings would be difficult in Athens, given that most of the land was owned by the Greek church, meaning that a great deal of expropriation would have to take place. On the contrary, Argos did not face a similar problem, having large available areas for this purpose. In the end, the proposition of the Greek capital being moved to Argos was rejected by the father of king Otto, Ludwig, who insisted in making Athens the capital, something which eventually happened in 1834.\nDuring the German occupation, Argos airfield was frequently attacked by Allied forces. One of the raids was so large that it resulted in the bombing of the city on 14 October 1943, with the casualties of about 100 dead Argives and several casualties, and 75 of the Germans. The bombing started from the airfield heading southeast, hitting the monastery of Katakrykmeni and several areas of the city, up to the railway station.\nMythology.\nThe mythological kings of Argos are (in order): Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, Argus, Criasus, (Phorbas, Triopas is sometimes between Criasus and Iasus in some sources), Iasus, Agenor, (Crotopus and Sthenelus was between Agenor and Gelanor in some sources), Gelanor AKA Pelasgus, Danaus, Lynceus, Abas, Proetus, Acrisius, Perseus, Megapenthes, (Argeus and Anaxagoras comes after in some sources).\nAn alternative version supplied by Tatian of the original 17 consecutive kings of Argos includes Apis, Argios, Kriasos and Phorbas between Argus and Triopas, explaining the apparent unrelation of Triopas to Argus.\nThe city of Argos was believed to be the birthplace of the mythological character Perseus, the son of the god Zeus and Dana\u00eb, who was the daughter of the king of Argos, Acrisius.\nAfter the original 17 kings of Argos, there were three kings ruling Argos at the same time (see Anaxagoras), one descended from Bias, one from Melampus, and one from Anaxagoras. Melampus was succeeded by his son Mantius, then Oicles, and Amphiaraus, and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers Alcmaeon and Amphilochus.\nAnaxagoras was succeeded by his son Alector, and then Iphis. Iphis left his kingdom to his nephew Sthenelus, the son of his brother Capaneus.\nBias was succeeded by his son Talaus, and then by his son Adrastus who, with Amphiaraus, commanded the disastrous war of the Seven against Thebes. Adrastus bequeathed the kingdom to his son, Aegialeus, who was subsequently killed in the war of the Epigoni. Diomedes, grandson of Adrastus through his son-in-law Tydeus and daughter Deipyle, replaced Aegialeus and was King of Argos during the Trojan war. This house lasted longer than those of Anaxagoras and Melampus, and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, soon after the exile of Diomedes.\nEcclesiastical history.\nAfter Christianity became established in Argos, the first bishop documented in extant written records is Genethlius, who in 448 AD took part in the synod called by Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople that deposed Eutyches from his priestly office and excommunicated him. The next bishop of Argos, Onesimus, was at the 451 Council of Chalcedon. His successor, Thales, was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the Roman province of Hellas sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian to protest the killing of Proterius of Alexandria. Bishop Ioannes was at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680, and Theotimus at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). The local see is today the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Argolis.\nUnder 'Frankish' Crusader rule, Argos became a Latin Church bishopric in 1212, which lasted as a residential see until Argos was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1463 but would be revived under the second Venetian rule in 1686. Today the diocese is a Catholic titular see.\nGeography.\nSubdivisions.\nThe former municipality and current municipal unit, is subdivided into the following communes and their respective settlements:\nClimate.\nArgos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"). It is one of the hottest places in Greece during summer. Argos has generally cold winters, although due to the local climate, some winter months may have little rainfall. The weather of Argos includes an abundant amount of sunny days throughout the year, even in the winter. Temperatures below zero degrees Celsius are recorded mostly in the nightly hours during the winter months. Snowfalls are generally rare there, although not unheard of. The most recent significant snowfall in Argos occurred in early January 2017 during a large European cold wave. There is also a degree of variation in the annual rainfall volumes in Argos, as rainfall in Argos usually is between 300 and 800 millimeters depending the year.\nCharacteristics.\nOrientation.\nThe city of Argos is delimited to the north by dry river Xerias, to the east by Inachos river and Panitsa stream (which emanates from the latter), to the west by the Larissa hill (site of homonymous castle and of a monastery called Panagia Katakekrymeni-Portokalousa) and the Aspida Hill (unofficially Prophetes Elias hill), and to the south by the Notios Periferiakos road.\nThe Agios Petros (Saint Peter) square, along with the eponymous cathedral (dedicated to saint Peter the Wonderworker), make up the town centre, whereas some other characteristic town squares are the Laiki Agora (Open Market) square, officially Dimokratias (Republic) square, where, as implied by its name, an open market takes place twice a week, Staragora (Wheat Market), officially Dervenakia square, and Dikastirion (Court) square. Bonis Park is an essential green space of the city.\nCurrently, the most commercially active streets of the city are those surrounding the Agios Petros square (Kapodistriou, Danaou, Vassileos Konstantinou streets) as well as Korinthou street. The Pezodromi (Pedestrian Streets), i.e. the paved Michael Stamou, Tsaldari and Venizelou streets, are the most popular meeting point, encompassing a wide variety of shops and cafeterias. The neighborhood of Gouva, which extends around the intersection of Vassileos Konstantinou and Tsokri streets, is also considered a commercial point.\nIn the center of the city, next to the St. Peter's church, there is an artificial lake that was constructed and filled during an extensive redevelopment works in the city, which lasted between February 2015 and April 2016. During the work for the redevelopment of the city's square the floor of the old (now demolished) church of St. Nicholas was found, which was located north of the present-day church of St. Peter, that was built after 1865. Pursuant to a decision of the Central Archaeological Council, the floor and part of the sidewalls of the old church were covered with dirt in early March 2016.\nOn 15 February 2022 a new statue of Heracles was unveiled. It is a replica of a statue made by Lysippus of Sicyon in the 4th century BC. The Roman copy of Lysippus's statue is known as the Farnese Hercules, and it is exhibited in Naples, Italy.\nIn March 2022 the construction of the fountain in St. Peter's square was completed. In the base of the marble fountain there are four lions. Above the visitor can see four members of the Danaids. The fountain has a width of 7 meters and a height of 5 meters, while the fountain was designed in collaboration with the Supreme School of Fine Arts in Athens.\nThe city has three monasteries that are located in Larissa hill.\nPopulation.\nIn 700 BC there were at least 5,000 people living in the city. In the fourth century BC, the city was home to as many as 30,000 people.\nToday, according to the 2021 Greek census, the city has a population of 21,891. It is the largest city in Argolis, larger than the capital Nafplio.\nEconomy.\nThe primary economic activity in the area is agriculture. Citrus fruits are the predominant crop, followed by olives and apricots. The area is also famous for its local melon variety, Argos melons (or Argitiko). There is also important local production of dairy products, factories for fruits processing.\nConsiderable remains of the ancient and medieval city survive and are a popular tourist attraction.\nMonuments.\nMost of Argos's historical and archaeological monuments are currently unused, abandoned, or only partially renovated:\nA great number of archaeological findings, dating from the prehistoric ages, can be found at the Argos museum, housed at the old building of Dimitrios Kallergis at Saint Peter's square. The Argos airfield, located in the homonymous area (Aerodromio) in the northwest outskirts of the city, is also worth mentioning. The area it covers was created in 1916\u20131917 and was heavily used during the Greco-Italian War and for the training of new Kaberos school aviators for the Hellenic Air Force Academy. It also constituted an important benchmark in the organization of the Greek air forces in southern Greece. Furthermore, the airfield was used by the Germans for the release of their aerial troops during the Battle of Crete. It was last used as a landing/takeoff point for spray planes (for agricultural purposes in the olive tree cultivations) up until 1985.\nTransportation.\nArgos is connected via regular bus services with neighbouring areas as well as Athens. In addition, taxi stands can be found at the Agios Petros as well as the Laiki Agora square. A good road network ensures the connection of the city with the surrounding towns, villages and the rest of Peloponnese and the country.\nThe city also has a railway station which, at the moment, remains closed due to an indefinite halt to all railway services in the Peloponnese area by the Hellenic Railways Organisation. However, in late 2014, it was announced that the station would open up again, as part of an expansion of the Athens suburban railway in Argos, Nafplio and Korinthos, however the plan never came in fruition. Finally in mid 2020 it was announced by the administration of Peloponnese Region their cooperation with the Hellenic Railways Organisation for the metric line and stations maintenance for the purpose of the line's reoperation in the middle of 2021. As of April 2023, no steps have been taken to prepare for reopening of the railway lines, to the dismay of the local population.\nEducation.\nArgos has a wide range of educational institutes that also serve neighbouring sparsely populated areas and villages. In particular, the city has seven dimotika (primary schools), four gymnasia (junior high), three lyceums (senior high), one vocational school, one music school as well as a Touristical Business and Cooking department and a post-graduate ASPETE department. The city also has two public libraries.\nFor the academic year 2020\u20132021, the beginning of operations for a faculty of Rural Economy of the University of Peloponnese in Argos was planned. However, the creation of this faculty was cancelled by the Greek ministry of education.\nThere is a municipal children's-youth library next to the Bonis Park, and another one next to Aggeli Bobou street.\nMayors of Argos.\nThe municipality was established in 1834 and operated till 1914 and again since 1925 till 2010 when it was abolished. During 1914\u20131925, it was downgraded into community, due to having less than 10,000 population. Before the Kapodistrias reform in 1997, municipality of Argos contained only the community of Argos. First mayor was Hristos Vlassis.\nSports.\nArgos hosts two major sport clubs with presence in higher national divisions and several achievements, Panargiakos F.C. football club, founded in 1926 and AC Diomidis Argous handball club founded in 1976. Other sport clubs that are based in Argos: A.E.K. Argous, Apollon Argous, Aristeas Argous, Olympiakos Argous, Danaoi and Panionios Dalamanaras.\nThe city has a municipal sports' center, an indoor gym and a municipal swimming bath that was opened in May 2021.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nArgos is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70014", "revid": "2663537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70014", "title": "Gracie Allen", "text": "American actress (1895\u20131964)\nGrace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen (July 26, 1895 \u2013 August 27, 1964) was an American vaudevillian, singer, actress, and comedian who became internationally famous as the zany partner and comic foil of husband George Burns, her straight man, appearing with him on radio, television and film as the duo Burns and Allen.\nFor her contributions to the television industry, Allen was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6672 Hollywood Boulevard. She and Burns were inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988.\nCostar Bea Benaderet said of Allen in 1966, \"She was probably one of the greatest actresses of our time.\"\nEarly life.\nAllen was born in San Francisco, to George Allen and Margaret Theresa (\"Molly\") Allen (n\u00e9e Darragh; later Mrs. Edward Pidgeon), who were both of Irish Catholic descent. She made her first appearance on stage at age three, and was given her first role on the radio by Eddie Cantor. She graduated from Star of the Sea Convent School, for girls,&lt;ref name=\"sfgenealogy/sosjun52\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1914,&lt;ref name=\"sfgate/3296424\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and during that time became a talented dancer.\n\"George Allen was a song and dance man who abandoned his family when Gracie was about five years old. Her mother later married Edward Pidgeon, a police captain.\"&lt;ref name=\"encyclopedia/gracie-allen\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nShe soon began performing Irish folk dances with her three sisters, who were billed as \"The Four Colleens\". In 1909, Allen joined her sister, Bessie, as a vaudeville performer. At a performance in 1922, Allen met George Burns, and the two formed a comedy act. They were married on January 7, 1926 in Cleveland by a justice of the peace.\nAllen was born with heterochromia, giving her two different color eyes, one blue and one green. Her left arm and shoulder were badly scarred when a boiling pot of tea fell on her as a child; as a result, she wore long-sleeved dresses throughout her life. Allen also suffered from crippling migraine headaches.\nBirthdate myth.\nSome discrepancy exists as to her date of birth. Depending on the source, Allen is alleged to have been born on July 26 in 1895, 1896, 1902, or 1906. All public vital records held by the city and county of San Francisco were destroyed in the earthquake and great fire of April 1906. Her husband George Burns professed not to know exactly how old she was, though it was presumably he who provided the date of July 26, 1902 that appears on her death record. Allen's crypt marker also shows her year of birth as 1902.\nAmong Allen's signature jokes was a dialogue in which she would claim that she was born in 1906. Her foil would press her for proof or corroborating information, and she would reply that her birth certificate had been destroyed in the earthquake. Her foil would point out that she was born in July, but that the earthquake was three months earlier in April. Allen would simply smile and reply: \"Well, it was an \"awfully big\" earthquake.\"\nPresumably the most reliable information comes from U.S. Census data collected on June 1, 1900 that shows Grace Allen, age four (born in July 1895), along with her parents and five siblings. This proves that Allen was born before 1900 and indicates that the birthdate of July 26, 1895 may be correct. Additionally, the yearbook from her senior year of high school has been located; its 1914 date is consistent with her having been born in 1895.\nDouble act.\nThe Burns and Allen act began with Allen as the straight man, setting up Burns to deliver the punchlines and receive the laughs. In his book \"\", Burns explained that he had noticed that Allen's straight lines were bringing more laughs than did his punchlines, so he cannily flipped the act, making himself the straight man so that Allen would elicit the laughter. Audiences immediately fell in love with Allen's character, which combined the traits of naivete, zaniness and innocence. The reformulated team, focusing on Allen, toured the country, eventually headlining in major vaudeville houses. Many of their famous routines were preserved in one- and two-reel short films, including \"Lambchops\" (1929), made while the couple was still performing on the stage.\nBurns attributed all of the couple's early success to Allen, ignoring his own brilliance as a straight man. He summarized their act by saying: \"All I had to do was say, 'Gracie, how's your brother?' and she talked for 38 years. And sometimes I didn't even have to remember to say 'Gracie, how's your brother?'\"\n\"The character was simply the dizziest dame in the world, but what made her different from all the other \"Dumb Doras\" was that Gracie played her as if she were totally sane, as if her answers actually made sense.\" - George Burns\nRadio.\nIn the early 1930s, like many stars of the era, Burns and Allen graduated to radio. The show was originally a continuation of the flirtation act from their vaudeville and short-film routines. In 1935, famed composer and arranger Ferde Grofe joined them as musical director. Burns realized that they were too old for that type of material and changed the show's format in the fall of 1941 into the situation comedy for which they are best remembered: a working showbusiness married couple negotiating ordinary problems caused by Gracie's \"illogical logic\", usually with the help of neighbors Harry and Blanche Morton and their announcer Bill Goodwin (later replaced by Harry von Zell during the run of their television series).\nPublicity stunts.\nBurns and Allen frequently used running gags as publicity stunts. During 1932\u201333, they pulled off one of the most successful in the business: a year-long search for Allen's supposedly missing brother. Allen would make unannounced cameo appearances on other shows, asking if anyone had seen her brother. However, her brother did not find it comical and eventually asked them to stop; he was so irked by the gag's popularity that he disappeared from society at the height of its popularity.\nIn 1940, Allen announced that she was running for president of the United States on the Surprise Party ticket. Burns and Allen embarked on a cross-country whistle-stop campaign tour on a private train, performing their live radio show in various cities. In one of her campaign speeches, Gracie said, \"I don't know much about the Lend-Lease Bill, but if we owe it, we should pay it.\" Another typical quip on the campaign trail was: \"Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house.\" The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo, and its motto was \"It's in the bag.\" As part of the gag, Duell, Sloan and Pearce published a book, \"How to Become President by Gracie Allen\" (in reality, written by Burns and Allen writer Charles Lofgren) that included photographs from their nationwide campaign tour and the Surprise Party convention. Allen received an endorsement from students at Harvard University.\nAllen was also the subject of one of S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance mystery novels, \"The Gracie Allen Murder Case\". Allen said: \"S.S. Van Dine is silly to spend six months writing a novel when you can buy one for $2.95.\"\nIn another publicity stunt, Allen played a piano concert at the Hollywood Bowl (and later at Carnegie Hall). The Burns and Allen staff hired a composer to write the \"Concerto for Index Finger\", a joke piece in which the orchestra would play madly, only to pause while Allen played a one-finger scale with a final incorrect note. The orchestra would then play a musical piece that developed around the wrong note. On her final solo, Allen would finally hit the right note, causing the entire orchestra to applaud. The actual index-finger playing was performed offstage by a professional pianist. The concerto was featured in the film \"Two Girls and a Sailor\" (1944) with an orchestra conducted by Albert Coates.\nFilms.\nIn the early 1930s, Burns and Allen appeared in several short films in which they performed some of their classic vaudeville routines. They also appeared in two full-length movies with W. C. Fields: \"International House\" (1933) and \"Six of a Kind\" (1934). Burns and Allen also appeared in three out of the four \"Big Broadcast\" ensemble comedies including \"The Big Broadcast\" (1932) with Bing Crosby, \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\" (1935) with Crosby, and \"The Big Broadcast of 1937\" (1936) with Jack Benny. They were also in \"We're Not Dressing\" (1934), billed directly under Crosby and Carole Lombard.\nIn 1937, Burns and Allen starred with Fred Astaire in \"A Damsel in Distress\", a musical with an original score by George Gershwin that introduced the song \"A Foggy Day\". It was Astaire's first RKO film without dancing partner Ginger Rogers. Astaire's costar Joan Fontaine was not a dancer, and he was reluctant to dance on screen alone. He also felt the script needed more comic relief to enhance the overall appeal of the film. Burns and Allen had each worked in vaudeville as dancers before forming their act, and when word of the project reached them, they called Astaire and he asked them to audition. Burns contacted an act whom he had once seen performing a dance using small whisk brooms. For the next several weeks, he and Allen practiced the complicated routine for their audition. When they presented the dance to Astaire, he liked it so much that he asked them to teach it to him, and it was added to the film with the three of them dancing together. Burns and Allen also matched Astaire step-by-step in the film's demandingly epic dance sequence in a funhouse including amazing visuals with distorted mirrors.\nTheir next film the following year was \"College Swing\" (1938) starring Burns and Allen top-billed above Martha Raye and Bob Hope with a stellar supporting cast featuring Edward Everett Horton, Betty Grable, Jackie Coogan, John Payne, Robert Cummings, and Jerry Colonna. The picture was directed by Raoul Walsh.\nA lively musical comedy came next titled \"Honolulu\" (1939) starring Eleanor Powell, Robert Young and Burns and Allen billed above the title. Unusually, Burns and Allen performed separately through most of the film until the end, with Allen singing and dancing the energetic titular song with Powell at one point while Burns is off-screen.\nThat same year, Allen's popularity was such that S.S. Van Dine wrote one of his Philo Vance detective novels featuring her as the principal character titled \"The Gracie Allen Murder Case\". The zanily comedic book was adapted into a film, also titled \"The Gracie Allen Murder Case\" (1939). Allen was billed above Warren William (the actor then portraying Philo Vance in the series of Vance films), and without Burns. The result was so successful that Allen was cast two years later in a similar mystery/comedy film titled \"Mr. and Mrs. North\" (1942) in which she is top-billed as a comedic detective, again without Burns in the cast. \nAllen made her last film appearance in a musical cameo as an amusing concert pianist in \"Two Girls and a Sailor\", without Burns, but remained in radio and would segue into series television with her husband six years later.\nTelevision.\nIn the fall of 1949, having apparently put their movie career behind them but working continuously in radio, Burns and Allen became part of the CBS talent raid. Their good friend and frequent guest star Jack Benny had already departed NBC for CBS, and CBS head William S. Paley made it clear that he believed that talent, not the network, made the difference, which was not the case at NBC. Benny convinced Burns and Allen (among others) to join him in the move to CBS. The \"Burns and Allen\" radio show became part of the CBS lineup, and a year later, they also brought their show to television as \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\". They continued to use the formula that had kept them longtime radio stars, playing themselves only now as television stars, still living next door to Harry and Blanche Morton. They concluded each show with a brief dialogue performance in the style of their classic vaudeville and earlier radio routines. Burns always ended the show with, \"Say goodnight, Gracie\", to which Allen simply replied, \"Goodnight\" (Allen never said, \"Goodnight, Gracie\", as legend has it).\nAllen retired in 1958, and Burns tried to continue without her. The show was renamed \"The George Burns Show\" with the cast intact except for Allen. The show's setting was changed from the Burns home to his office, with Blanche working as Burns' secretary so that she could help Allen keep an eye on him. The renamed show barely lasted a year.\nPrivate life.\nIn the 1930s, Burns and Allen adopted two children, Sandra Jean and Ronald Jon.\nEight years before his death, Burns publicly admitted that once in their marriage, in the 1950s, he cheated on Allen. In guilt over the one-night affair, Burns gave Allen a $10,000 diamond ring and a $750 silver centerpiece. Allen learned about the affair but never let on to Burns that she knew, and the couple never discussed it.\nDeath.\nAllen, who had a history of heart disease, died from a heart attack in Hollywood on August 27, 1964. An 1895 birth year would place her age at death as 69. Her remains were interred in a crypt at the Freedom Mausoleum in the Sanctuary of Heritage at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.\nBurns' remains were interred at her side in 1996 when he died at the age of 100. The marker on the crypt was changed from \"Grace Allen Burns\u2014Beloved Wife And Mother (1902\u20131964)\" to \"Gracie Allen (1902\u20131964) and George Burns (1896\u20131996)\u2014Together Again\".\nGracie Award.\nThe Gracie Award is presented by the Alliance for Women in Media to recognize exemplary programming created by women, for women and about women in radio, television, cable and web-based media, including news, drama, comedy, commercials, public service, documentary and sports. The awards program encourages the realistic and multifaceted portrayal of women in entertainment, news, features and other programs. Allen has twice been nominated to the National Women's Hall of Fame, though she has not been inducted. She has been honored by James L. Brooks, who named Gracie Films after her.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70020", "revid": "51044874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70020", "title": "George Burns", "text": "American entertainer (1896\u20131996)\nGeorge Burns (born Nathan Birnbaum; January 20, 1896\u00a0\u2013 March 9, 1996) was an American comedian, actor, writer, and singer, and one of the few entertainers whose career successfully spanned vaudeville, radio, film, and television. His arched eyebrow and cigar-smoke punctuation became familiar trademarks. He and his wife Gracie Allen appeared on radio, television and film as the comedy duo Burns and Allen.\nAt age 79, Burns experienced a sudden career revival as an amiable, beloved, and unusually active comedy elder statesman in the 1975 film \"The Sunshine Boys\", for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Burns was born Nathan Birnbaum () on January 20, 1896, in New York City, the ninth of 12 children born to Hadassah \"Dorah\" (n\u00e9e Bluth; ; 1857\u20131927) and Eliezer Birnbaum (; 1855\u20131903), known as Louis or Lippa, Jewish immigrants who had come to the United States from Ropczyce, Galicia, now Poland. Burns was a member of the First Roumanian-American Congregation.\nHis father was a substitute cantor at the local synagogue but usually worked as a coat presser. During the influenza epidemic of 1903, Lippe Birnbaum contracted the flu and died at the age of 47. Burns, called Nattie or Nate at the time, went to work to help support the family, shining shoes, running errands and selling newspapers.\nWhen he got a job as a syrup maker in a local candy shop at age seven, Burns was \"discovered\", as he later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne of the Burns brothers' first regular gigs was operating the curtains at the vaudeville and nickelodeon theatre of Frank Seiden, father of Joseph Seiden, who later became a Yiddish film producer. Burns started smoking cigars when he was 14.\nBurns was drafted into the United States Army when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, but failed the physical examination because he was extremely nearsighted. To hide his Jewish heritage, he adopted the stage name by which he would be known for the rest of his life. He later claimed that he selected the name George Burns because there were two active star professional baseball players with the name (George H. Burns and George J. Burns, unrelated), each of whom accumulated more than 2,000 hits and held some major-league records. Burns also was reported to have taken \"George\" from his brother Izzy (who had first adopted the name because he hated his own) and \"Burns\" from the Burns Brothers Coal Company, from whose trucks he stole coal as a youth.\nHis first wife was Hannah Siegel (stage name Hermosa Jose), one of his dance partners. The marriage lasted 26 weeks and occurred only because Siegel's family would not permit her to tour with Burns unless they were married. They divorced at the end of the tour.\nBurns normally partnered with a woman, sometimes in an adagio dance routine, sometimes in comic patter. Though he had an apparent flair for comedy, he never quite clicked with any of his partners until he met Gracie Allen, a young Irish Catholic woman, in 1923. \"All of a sudden\", he later said, \"the audience realized I had a talent. They were right. I did have a talent\u2014and I was married to her for 38 years.\" Burns wed Allen in 1926.\nStage to screen.\nBurns and Allen began their career in motion pictures with a series of comic short films in the late 1920s and early 1930s, such as \"The Big Broadcast\" (1932) with Bing Crosby, \"International House\" (1933) and \"Six of a Kind\" (1934) with W. C. Fields, \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\" with Crosby again, \"The Big Broadcast of 1937\" with Jack Benny, \"A Damsel in Distress\" (1937) with Fred Astaire and Joan Fontaine, and \"College Swing\" (1938) with Bob Hope and Martha Raye. \"Honolulu\" (1939) with Eleanor Powell and Robert Young was Burns's last film for nearly 40 years, though Allen starred in two more pictures without him.\nIn 1938, Paramount producer and managing director William LeBaron was planning a vehicle for Burns and Allen to team with established star Bing Crosby, with a script written by Don Hartman and Frank Butler. But the story didn't fit Burns and Allen's style, so LeBaron ordered rewrites to fit two male co-stars: Crosby and Bob Hope. The project became \"Road to Singapore\" (1940), the first in a long-running and popular series of \"Road\" films.\nRadio stars.\nBurns and Allen first appeared on the radio as the comedy relief for bandleader Guy Lombardo. In his memoir \"The Third Time Around\", Burns shared a letter from a college fraternity complaining that its weekly dance parties were interrupted by Burns and Allen routines.\nBurns and Allen found their own show and radio audience, first airing on February 15, 1932. Their show was based on their classic stage routines and sketch comedy in which their style was woven into multiple smaller scenes, in a manner similar to that of the short films that they had made in Hollywood. They were also known for clever publicity stunts, such as Allen's hunt for her missing brother that carried over into guest spots on other radio shows. In April 1935 they added Ferde Grof\u00e9 as musical director.\nThe couple was portrayed at first as unmarried, with Allen the object of Burns's affections as well as those of other cast members. Bandleaders Ray Noble (known for his phrase \"Gracie, this is the first time we've ever been alone\") and Artie Shaw played Allen's love interests. Singer Tony Martin also played Allen's unwilling love interest, whom she comically threatened to fire if he did not reciprocate her romantic interest.\nWith ratings declining and their audience familiar with their real-life marriage, Burns and Allen adapted their radio show in 1941 to present them as a married couple. Artie Shaw, who also appeared as a character in some of the show's sketches, was the show's bandleader at one time. Allen's character also changed slightly during this era, often being mean to Burns.\nAs this format grew stale over the years, in 1941 Burns and his fellow writers redeveloped the show as a situation comedy. The reformat focused on the couple's married life and their friends and neighbors, including Elvia Allman as Tootsie Sagwell, a man-hungry spinster in love with Bill Goodwin. The characters of Harry and Blanche Morton became a mainstay of the program.\nAs with \"The Jack Benny Program\", the new \"George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen Show\" portrayed Burns and Allen as entertainers with their own weekly radio show. Goodwin remained, and the music was now led by Meredith Willson (later to be better known for composing the Broadway musical \"The Music Man\"). Willson also played himself on the show as na\u00efve, friendly and shy with women. The new format's success made it one of the few classic radio comedies to completely reinvent itself and regain great success.\nSupporting players.\nThe supporting cast during this phase included Mel Blanc as the melancholy, ironically named \"Happy Postman\" (his catchphrase was \"Remember, keep smiling!\"); Bea Benaderet (later Cousin Pearl in \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", Kate Bradley in \"Petticoat Junction\" and the voice of Betty Rubble in \"The Flintstones\") and Hal March (later the host of \"The $64,000 Question\") as neighbors Blanche and Harry Morton; and the various members of Allen's ladies' club, the Beverly Hills Uplift Society. One running gag during this period, stretching into the television era, was Burns's questionable singing voice; Allen lovingly called him \"Sugar Throat\". The show received and maintained a Top 10 rating for the rest of its radio life.\nNew network.\nIn 1949, after 12 years at NBC, the couple took the show back to its original network CBS, where they had risen to fame from 1932 to 1937. Their friend Jack Benny reached a negotiating impasse with NBC over the corporation he set up (\"Amusement Enterprises\") to package his show, the better to put more of his earnings on a capital-gains basis and avoid the 80% taxes levied on very high earners in the World War II period. CBS executive William S. Paley convinced Benny to move to CBS (Paley, among other things, impressed Benny with his attitude that the performers make the network, not the other way around, as NBC chief David Sarnoff reputedly believed); Benny in turn convinced several NBC stars to join him, including Burns and Allen. Thus, CBS reaped the benefits when Burns and Allen moved to television in 1950.\nTelevision.\n\"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\".\nOn television, \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" put faces to some of the radio characters audiences had come to love (they already knew Burns and Allen's faces from their films). A number of significant changes were seen in the show:\nBurns and Allen also took a cue from Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's Desilu Productions and formed a company of their own, McCadden Corporation (named after the street on which Burns's brother lived), headquartered on the General Service Studio lot in the heart of Hollywood, and set up to film television shows and commercials. Besides their own hit show (which transitioned from a biweekly live series to a weekly filmed version in 1952), the couple's company produced such television series as \"The Bob Cummings Show\" (later syndicated and rerun as \"Love That Bob\"); \"The People's Choice\", starring Jackie Cooper; \"Mona McCluskey\", starring Juliet Prowse; and \"Mister Ed\", starring Alan Young and a talented \"talking\" horse. Several of Jack Benny's 1953\u201355 filmed episodes were also produced by McCadden for CBS.\n\"The George Burns Show\".\n\"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" ran on CBS Television from 1950 to 1958, when Burns at last consented to Allen's retirement. The onset of heart trouble in the early 1950s had left her exhausted from full-time work and she had been anxious to stop, but could not say no to Burns.\nBurns attempted to continue the show (for new sponsor Colgate-Palmolive on NBC), but without Allen, the show ended after a year.\n\"Wendy and Me\".\nBurns subsequently created \"Wendy and Me\", a sitcom in which he co-starred with Connie Stevens, Ron Harper, and J. Pat O'Malley. He acted primarily as the narrator, and secondarily as the adviser to Stevens's Gracie-like character. The first episode involved the nearly 69-year-old Burns watching his younger neighbor's activities with amusement, just as he had watched the Burns and Allen television show while it was unfolding to get a jump on what Gracie was up to in its final two seasons. Also as in the Burns and Allen television show, Burns frequently broke the fourth wall by talking directly to viewers. The series only lasted a year. In a promotion, Burns had joked that \"Connie Stevens plays Wendy, and I play 'me'.\"\n\"The Sunshine Boys\".\nAfter Gracie died in 1964, Burns immersed himself in work. McCadden Productions co-produced the television series \"No Time for Sergeants\", based on the hit Broadway play; Burns also produced Juliet Prowse's 1965\u201366 NBC situation comedy, \"Mona McCluskey\". At the same time, he toured the U.S. playing nightclub and theater engagements with such diverse partners as Carol Channing, Dorothy Provine, Jane Russell, Connie Haines, and Berle Davis. He also performed a series of solo concerts, playing university campuses, New York's Philharmonic Hall and winding up a successful season at Carnegie Hall, where he wowed a capacity audience with his show-stopping songs, dances, and jokes.\nIn 1974, Burns's close friend Jack Benny signed to play one of the lead roles in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of Neil Simon's \"The Sunshine Boys\" (Red Skelton was originally the other, but he objected to some of the script's language). But Benny's health had begun to fail, and he advised his manager, Irving Fein, to let Burns fill in for him on a series of nightclub dates to which Benny had committed around the U.S.\nBurns, who enjoyed working, accepted the job for what would be his first feature film appearance for 36 years. As he recalled years later:\n \"The happiest people I know are the ones that are still working. The saddest are the ones who are retired. Very few performers retire on their own. It's usually because no one wants them. Six years ago Sinatra announced his retirement. He's still working.\"\u2014George Burns\nIll health prevented Benny from working on \"The Sunshine Boys\"; he died of pancreatic cancer on December 26, 1974. Heartbroken, Burns said that the only time he ever wept in his life other than Allen's death was when Benny died. He was chosen to give one of the eulogies at the funeral and said, \"Jack was someone special to all of you, but he was so special to me\u00a0... I cannot imagine my life without Jack Benny, and I will miss him so very much.\" Burns then broke down and had to be helped to his seat. People who knew Burns said he never really came to terms with Benny's death.\nSix weeks before filming started, Burns had triple bypass surgery.\nBurns replaced Benny in the film as well as the club tour, a move that turned out to be one of the biggest breaks of his career; his wise performance as faded vaudevillian Al Lewis won him the 1975 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and permanently secured his career resurgence. At 80, Burns was the oldest Oscar winner in the history of the Academy Awards, a record that stood until Jessica Tandy won an Oscar for \"Driving Miss Daisy\" in 1989.\n\"Oh, God!\".\nIn 1977, Burns made another hit film, \"Oh, God!\", playing the omnipotent title role opposite singer John Denver as an earnest but befuddled supermarket manager, whom God picks at random to revive his message. The image of Burns in a sailor's cap and light springtime jacket as the droll Almighty influenced his subsequent comedic work, as well as that of other comedians. At a celebrity roast in his honor, Dean Martin adapted a Burns crack: \"When George was growing up, the Top 10 were the Ten Commandments\".\nBurns appeared in this character along with Vanessa Williams on the September 1984 cover of \"Penthouse\" magazine, the issue that contained Williams's notorious nude photos, as well as the first appearance of underage pornographic film star Traci Lords. A blurb on the cover announced \"Oh God, she's nude!\"\n\"Oh, God!\" inspired two sequels, \"Oh, God! Book II\" (in which the Almighty engages a precocious schoolgirl played by Louanne Sirota to spread the word) and \"Oh, God! You Devil\"\u2014in which Burns played a dual role as God and the devil, with the soul of a would-be songwriter (played by Ted Wass) at stake.\nLater films.\nAfter guest-starring on \"The Muppet Show\" and \"Alice\", Burns appeared in 1978's \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", the film based on The Beatles' album of the same name and also recorded a cover of Fixing A Hole for the film. In 1979, at 83, Burns starred in two feature films, \"Just You and Me, Kid\" and \"Going in Style\". He remained active in films and TV past his 90th birthday. One of his last films was 1988's \"18 Again!\", based on his half-novelty, half-country music-based hit single, \"I Wish I Was 18 Again\". In this film, Burns played an 81-year-old self-made millionaire industrialist who switched bodies with his awkward, artistic, 18-year-old grandson (played by Charlie Schlatter).\nBurns also did regular nightclub stand-up acts in his later years, usually portraying himself as a lecherous old man. He always smoked a cigar onstage and reputedly timed his monologues by the amount the cigar had burned down. For this reason, he preferred cheap El Producto cigars as the loosely wrapped tobacco burned longer. Burns once quipped: \"In my youth, they called me a rebel. When I was middle-aged, they called me eccentric. Now that I'm old, I'm doing the same thing I've always done and they're calling me senile.\"\nFor most of his life, Burns would smoke between 10 to 20 cigars a day. Arthur Marx estimated that Burns smoked around 300,000 cigars during his lifetime, starting at age 14. In his final years, he smoked no more than four a day, and he never used cigarettes or marijuana, saying, \"Look, I can't get any more kicks than I'm getting. What can marijuana do for me that show business hasn't done?\" His last feature film role was the cameo role of Milt Lackey, a 100-year-old stand-up comedian, in the 1994 comedy mystery \"Radioland Murders\".\nFinal years and death.\nEight years before his death, Burns publicly admitted that once in their marriage, in the 1950s, he had cheated on Allen. In guilt over the one-night affair, Burns gave Allen a $10,000 diamond ring and a $750 silver centerpiece. Allen learned about the affair but never let on to Burns that she knew, and the couple never discussed it. Burns recounted that years later he discovered his wife Gracie had told her friend Mary Livingstone (the wife of comedian Jack Benny) about the episode, finishing her account by saying to Mary, \"You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again; I could use a new centerpiece.\"\nBurns was still appearing at major hotel/casinos in Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe during the early 1980s. When he turned 90 in 1986, the city of Los Angeles renamed the northern end of Hamel Road \"George Burns Road.\" City regulations prohibited naming a city street after a living person, but an exception was made for Burns. In celebration of Burns's 99th birthday in 1995, Los Angeles renamed the eastern end of Alden Drive \"Gracie Allen Drive.\" Burns was present at the unveiling ceremony (one of his last public appearances), and quipped: \"It's good to be here at the corner of Burns &amp; Allen. At my age, it's good to be anywhere!\" George Burns Road and Gracie Allen Drive cross just a few blocks west of the Beverly Center mall in the heart of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Burns served as honorary chairman of the center's endowment drive.\nBurns remained in good health for most of his life, in part thanks to a daily exercise regimen of swimming, walks, sit-ups, and push-ups. He bought new Cadillacs every year and drove until the age of 93. After that, Burns had chauffeurs drive him around. In his later years, he also had difficulty reading fine print.\nBurns suffered a head injury after falling in his bathtub in 1994 and underwent surgery to remove fluid in his skull. He never fully recovered, and his performing career came to an end. In February 1995, Burns, in one of his final television appearances, was presented with the first SAG Lifetime Achievement Award by the Screen Actors Guild. When he was 96, he had signed a lifetime contract with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to perform stand-up comedy there, which included the guarantee of a show on his centenary, January 20, 1996. But when that day came, he was too weak to give a performance. In December 1995, Burns was well enough to attend a Christmas party hosted by Frank Sinatra (who turned 80 that month), where he reportedly caught the flu, which weakened him further. He released a statement joking about how he would love for his 100th birthday to have \"a night with Sharon Stone.\" His last television appearance came in a commercial for the Australian Football League's centenary season in 1996, which aired after his death.\nOn March 9, 1996, Burns died in his Beverly Hills home of heart failure. His funeral was held three days later at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather church in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale. As much as he looked forward to reaching age 100, Burns also said, about a year before he died, that he also looked forward to death, saying that on the day he would die, he would be with Allen again in Heaven. Upon being interred with Allen, the crypt's marker was changed from, \"Grace Allen Burns\u2014Beloved Wife And Mother (1902\u20131964)\" to \"Gracie Allen (1902\u20131964) &amp; George Burns (1896\u20131996)\u2014Together Again\". Burns had always said that he wanted Allen to have top billing.\nLegacy.\nGeorge Burns has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a motion pictures star at 1639 Vine Street, a television star at 6510 Hollywood Boulevard, and a live performance star at 6672 Hollywood Boulevard. The first two stars were placed during the initial installations of 1960, while the third-star ceremony was held in 1984, in the new category of live performance, or live theatre, established that year. Burns is also a member of the Television Hall of Fame, where he and Gracie Allen were inducted in 1988. There is a street named after Burns in San Antonio, Texas.\nHe is the subject of Rupert Holmes's one-actor play \"Say Goodnight, Gracie\".\nBibliography.\nBurns was a bestselling author who wrote ten books:\nFilmography.\nFeatures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShort subjects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n In their debut series, Burns and Allen shared the bill with Guy Lombardo and his orchestra. The pair launched themselves into national stardom with their first major publicity stunt, Allen's ongoing search for her missing brother.\n This series featured another publicity stunt which had Allen running for President of the United States.\n Advertised a brand new product called Spam; this show featured musical numbers by jazz great Artie Shaw.\n This series featured a radical format change, in that Burns and Allen played themselves as a married couple for the first time, and the show became a full-fledged domestic situation comedy. This was Burns's response to a marked drop in ratings under the old \"Flirtation Act\" format (as he later recalled, he finally realized \"our jokes are too young for us\").\n Broadcast live every other week for the first two seasons, 26 episodes per year. Starting in the third season, all episodes were filmed and broadcast weekly, 40 episodes per year. A total of 291 episodes were created.\n An unsuccessful attempt to continue the format of the Burns and Allen show without Allen, the rest of the cast intact.\n George plays narrator in this short-lived series, just as he had in the Burns and Allen show, but with far less on-screen time, as the focus is on a young couple played by Connie Stevens and Ron Harper. Stevens is, essentially, playing a version of Allen's character.\n Another short-lived series, a weekly comedy anthology program whose only connecting thread was George's presence as host. He does not appear in any of the actual storylines. He was 89 years old when the series was produced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
