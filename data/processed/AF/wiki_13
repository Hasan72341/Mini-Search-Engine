The son of the 2nd Earl of Burlington and 3rd Earl of Cork, Burlington never took more than a passing interest in politics despite his position as a Privy Counsellor and a member of both the British House of Lords and the Irish House of Lords. \nHis great interests in life were architecture and landscaping, and he is remembered for being a builder and a patron of architects, craftsmen and landscapers, Indeed, he is credited with bringing Palladian architecture to Britain and Ireland. His major projects include Burlington House, Westminster School, Chiswick House and Northwick Park.\nLife.\nLord Burlington was born in Yorkshire into a wealthy Anglo-Irish aristocratic family, the only son of Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington and his wife, Juliana Boyle (n\u00e9e Noel; 1672\u20131750). He succeeded to his titles and extensive estates in Yorkshire and Ireland at the age of nine, after his father's death in February 1704. During his minority, which lasted until 1715, his English and Irish lands, as also his political interests and patronages, were managed by his mother.\nBurlington showed a fondness for music at an early age. Georg Frideric Handel dedicated two operas to Burlington while staying at his residence Burlington House: \"Teseo\" and \"Amadigi di Gaula\". According to Hawkins, Francesco Barsanti dedicated the six recorder sonatas of his Op. 1 to Lord Burlington, although the dedication must have appeared on the edition sold by Peter Bressan, before Walsh &amp; Hare engraved the works c. 1727.\nThree foreign Grand Tours taken between 1714 and 1719, and a further trip to Paris in 1726, gave him opportunities to develop his taste. His professional skill as an architect (always supported by a mason-contractor) was extraordinary in an English aristocrat. He carried his copy of Andrea Palladio's book \"I quattro libri dell'architettura\" with him when touring the Veneto in 1719, but made notes on a number of blank pages, having found the region flooded and many villas inaccessible. It was on this tour that he acquired the passion for Palladian architecture. In 1719, he was one of the main subscribers of the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage.\nLord Burlington's first project, appropriately, was one of his own London residences, Burlington House, where he dismissed his baroque architect James Gibbs when he returned from the continent in 1719, and employed the Scottish architect Colen Campbell, with the history-painter-turned-designer William Kent assigned for the interiors. The courtyard front of Burlington House, prominently sited in Piccadilly, was the first major executed statement of Neo-Palladianism.\nIn the 1720s, Burlington and Campbell parted, and Burlington was assisted in his projects by the young Henry Flitcroft (\"Burlington Harry\"), who developed into a major architect of the second Neo-Palladian generation, Daniel Garrett, a straightforward Palladian architect of the second rank, and some draughtsmen.\nLord Burlington never closely inspected Roman ruins or made detailed drawings on the sites; he relied on Palladio and Scamozzi as his interpreters of the classic tradition to do so. Burlington's Palladio drawings include many reconstructions of Vitruvius' Roman buildings, which he planned to publish. In the meantime, he adapted the palazzo facade in the illustration for the London house of General Wade at Old Burlington Street in 1723, which was published for \"Vitruvius Britannicus\" iii (1725). \nThis publication put a previously unknown Palladio design into circulation. Another source of his inspiration were drawings he collected, some drawings of Palladio himself which had belonged to Inigo Jones, and many more of Inigo Jones' pupil John Webb, which William Kent published in 1727 (although a date of 1736 is generally accepted) as \"Some Designs of Mr Inigo Jones\"... with some additional designs that were by Kent and Burlington. The important role of Jones' pupil Webb in transmitting the palladian-neo-palladian heritage was not understood until the 20th century. \nBy the early 1730s, Palladian style had triumphed as the generally accepted manner for a British country house or public building. For the rest of his life, Lord Burlington was \"the Apollo of the arts\" as Horace Walpole phrased it\u2014 and Kent, \"his proper priest.\"\nIn 1731, Alexander Pope, who had been a friend of Burlington since about 1715, addressed the first of his \"Moral Essays\" to him, on the subject \"Of False Taste\". This described good taste in specific interests of his, such as landscaping, gardens and architecture.\nIn 1739, Lord Burlington was involved in the founding of a new charitable organisation called the Foundling Hospital. Burlington was a governor of the charity, but did not formally take part in planning the construction of this large Bloomsbury children's home, completed in 1742. The architect for the building was a Theodore Jacobsen, who took on the commission as an act of charity.\nMany of Lord Burlington's projects have suffered from rebuilding or additions, from fire, or from losses due to urban sprawl. In many cases, his ideas were informal: at Holkham Hall, the architect Matthew Brettingham recalled that \"the general ideas were first struck out by the Earl of Burlington and the Earl of Leicester, assisted by Mr. William Kent.\" Brettingham's engraved publication of Holkham credited Burlington specifically with the ceilings for the portico and the north dressing room.\nLord Burlington's architectural drawings, inherited by his son-in-law, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, are preserved at Chatsworth House, and enable attributions that would not otherwise be possible. In 1751, he sent some of his drawings to Francesco Algarotti in Potsdam, together with a book on Vitruvius.\nMarriage and children.\nBurlington married Lady Dorothy Savile on 21 March 1720, the daughter of William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax and his second wife, Lady Mary Finch.\nMary was the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Lady Essex Rich (died 1684). Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and Anne Cheeke. Anne was the daughter of Sir Thomas Cheeke of Pirgo and an earlier Lady Essex Rich (died 1659). This Lady Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick and Lady Penelope Devereux. Essex was probably named after her maternal grandfather Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Her maternal grandmother was Lettice Knollys.\nThey had three daughters:\nBurlington died at Chiswick House, aged 59. Upon his death, the Earldom of Cork passed to a cousin, John Boyle, and the title of the Earl of Burlington became extinct. It was recreated in 1831 for his grandson, George Cavendish, and is now held by the Cavendish family as a courtesy title for the Dukes of Devonshire.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1702, it was designated a fusilier regiment and became the Welch Regiment of Fusiliers; the prefix \"Royal\" was added in 1713, then confirmed in 1714 when George I named it the Prince of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. In 1751, after reforms that standardised the naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). In 1881, the final title of the regiment was adopted.\nIt retained the archaic spelling of \"Welch\", instead of \"Welsh\", and \"Fuzileers\" for \"Fusiliers\"; these were engraved on swords carried by regimental officers during the Napoleonic Wars. After the 1881 Childers Reforms, normal spelling was used officially, but \"Welch\" continued to be used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56.\nIt should not be confused with the Welch Regiment, a different unit (formed in 1881 from the 41st and 69th) which recruited in South and West, rather than North Wales, and became part of the Royal Regiment of Wales or RRW in 1969.\nOne of the few regiments to retain its original title, in March 2006 the Royal Welch Fusiliers was amalgamated with the RRW and became 1st Battalion, Royal Welsh, with RRW as the 2nd Battalion.\nHistory.\nFormation; 1689 to 1773.\nThe regiment was raised by Henry Herbert at Ludlow on 16 March 1689, following the 1688 Glorious Revolution and exile of James II. It served throughout the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, including the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, and the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 which brought the campaign to an end. It joined Allied forces fighting in the Nine Years War and at Namur in August 1695, took part in the attack on the Terra Nova earthwork that inspired the song 'The British Grenadiers.'\nOn the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702, it became the Welch Regiment of Fuzilieers; this denoted units equipped with light-weight muskets or 'fusils' used to protect the artillery, although the distinction later became obsolete. It served throughout Marlborough's campaigns in the Low Countries, including the battles of Schellenberg, Blenheim and Ramillies.\nIn 1714, George I gave it the title of the Prince of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. The next 28 years were spent on garrison duty in England and Scotland, until it returned to Flanders in 1742 for the War of the Austrian Succession. At Dettingen in June 1743, it rallied after being driven back by the elite French Maison du Roi cavalry; its steadiness was a major contribution to what is considered a fortunate victory. It incurred 323 casualties at Fontenoy in May 1745, before a brief period in Scotland during the 1745 Rising. Over 240 members of the regiment were lost at Lauffeld in July 1747, a defeat that led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.\nFollowing the 1751 reforms that standardised naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). In the opening battle of the Seven Years' War, it was part of the Minorca garrison that surrendered to the French in June 1756; given free passage to Gibraltar, from 1758 it campaigned in Germany. In the same year the 2nd Battalion was separated from the regiment and became the 68th Regiment of Foot.\nAt Minden in August 1759, it was one of the infantry units that routed the French cavalry, an achievement still celebrated as Minden Day by their successor unit, the Royal Welsh. Between 1760 and 1762, it fought in the battles of Warburg, Kloster Kampen 1760 and Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, before the war ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.\nWhen the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, the regiment was posted to North America. The light infantry and grenadier companies took heavy losses at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775; it participated in nearly every campaign up to the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781. At Yorktown, it was the only British regiment not to surrender its colours, which were smuggled out by a junior officer.\nIn the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, it was posted to the West Indies in 1794 and participated in the 1795 capture of Port-au-Prince before returning home in 1796. As part of the expeditionary force assigned to the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, it fought at Alkmaar in October 1799.\n19th century.\nApart from Egypt and the Battle of Alexandria in 1801 and the Invasion of Martinique in 1809 the regiment saw little action in the Napoleonic Wars until being sent to the Peninsula in 1810. Between 1811 and 1814, it fought in many of Wellington's actions, including the battles of Albuera, Badajoz, Salamanca, Nivelle and Toulouse. At the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, it was part of Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Mitchell's 4th Brigade in the 4th Infantry Division.\nIn the nineteenth century, the regiment took part in the Crimean War, the Second Opium War, the Indian Mutiny and the Third Anglo-Burmese War.\nThe Cardwell Reforms of 1872 linked most infantry regiments in pairs, but because the 23rd already had two battalions it was unaffected. Cardwell also introduced 'Localisation of the Forces', which established permanent regimental depots in county towns and brigaded the regular regiments with their local Militia and Volunteer battalions. For the 23rd, this included:\nThe Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further. The regiments were given names rather than numbers the regiment officially became The Royal Welsh Fusiliers on 1 July 1881, although \"Welch\" was used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56. The depot became the 23rd Regimental District depot, and the militia and volunteers became numbered battalions of their linked regiment (though the Royal Flint Rifles joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps): \nThe 1st battalion served in the 1899 to 1902 Second Boer War; and returned home from South Africa on the SS \"Ortona\" in January 1903.\nThe 2nd battalion was stationed at Hong Kong from 1898 to 1902, and served in the multinational force involved in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. They fought alongside the United States Marine Corps (see pages 32\u201333 in official USMC paper published in 1995). They transferred to India in October 1902, and were stationed at Chakrata.\n20th century.\nThe Haldane Reforms of 1908 converted the remaining Militia into the Special Reserve (SR) and the Volunteers into the Territorial Force (TF). The battalions were now numbered sequentially within their regiment. The TF battalions of the RWF were given subtitles in 1909:\nThe four TF Battalions constituted the North Wales Brigade in the Welsh Division.\nFirst World War; Regular Army.\nThe 1st and 2nd battalions served on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918 and took part in some of the hardest fighting of the war, including Mametz Wood in 1916 and Passchendaele or Third Ypres in 1917. Claims in 2008 they participated in the semi-mythical Christmas 1914 Football Game with the Germans have since been disproved.\nA number of writers fought with the regiment in France and recorded their experiences; David Thomas (killed 1916), Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon all served with the 1st Battalion. John Bernard Pye Adams, a captain with the 1st Battalion, was wounded in 1916, and while on medical leave, wrote \"Nothing of Importance\", his recollections of trench life. Adams did not live to see its publication \u2014 after returning to the front in January 1917, he died in action a month later. His book, published a few months after his death, was the only memoir of trench experiences published in Great Britain during the war and was well received by both \"The Times\" and the \"Daily Telegraph\".\nJ C Dunn, a medical officer with the 2nd Battalion who had also served in the 1899\u20131902 Boer War, published \"The War the Infantry Knew\" in 1931. A collection of letters and diary entries from over 50 individuals, it is considered a classic by military historians for its treatment of daily life and death in the trenches.\n\"Good-Bye to All That\" by Robert Graves was first published in 1929 and has never been out of print; in one anecdote, he records the Regimental Goat Major being charged with 'prostituting the Royal Goat' in return for a stud fee. Graves also edited \"Old Soldiers Never Die\", published in 1933; a rare example of the war seen by an ordinary soldier, it was written by Frank Richards, a pre-war regular recalled in 1914, who served on the Western Front until the end of the war. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn, killed at Passchendaele in 1917, were members of Kitchener battalions.\nFirst World War; Territorial and War Service.\nThe TF battalions raised 2nd and 3rd Line battalions; in addition, the regiment raised over a dozen 'war service' battalions, informally known as Kitchener or Pals battalions.\nThe 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion was one of the first TF units to see active service, landing in France in November 1914, where it remained until January 1919. Between 1915 and 1918, another ten Royal Welch Kitchener battalions also fought on the Western Front, including the battles of Loos, the Somme and Passchendaele; a number of these were disbanded in early 1918 due to manpower shortages. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn served with The 11th (Service) Battalion landed in Salonika in November 1915, where it remained for the duration of the war.\nThe 5th, 6th, 7th Territorial battalions fought at Gallipoli as part of the 53rd (Welsh) Division; by January 1916, it contained 162 officers and 2,428 men, approximately 15% of full strength. The 8th Kitchener Battalion was also at Gallipoli as part of 13th (Western) Division. They remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, the 53rd (Welsh) taking part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the 13th (Western) in the Mesopotamian campaign.\nInterwar.\nThe TF was reformed in 1920 and reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year. In 1938 the 5th (Flintshire) Battalion was converted into 60th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. Just before the outbreak of World War II the Territorial Army was doubled in size and the battalions created duplicates:\nSecond World War; Regular Army.\nThe regiment was awarded 27 battle honours for World War II, with more than 1,200 fusiliers killed in action or died of wounds.\nDuring the Second World War, the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers was a Regular Army unit and part of the 6th Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division. It served in France in 1940 with the British Expeditionary Force. The battalion fought in the short but fierce battles of France and Belgium and was forced to retreat and be evacuated during the Dunkirk evacuation. After two years spent in the United Kingdom, waiting and preparing for the invasion that never came (Operation Sea Lion), the 1st RWF and the rest of 2nd Division were sent to British India to fight the Imperial Japanese Army after a string of defeats inflicted upon the British and Indian troops. The battalion was involved in the Burma Campaign, particularly the Battle of Kohima, nicknamed \"Stalingrad of the East\" due to the ferocity of fighting on both sides, that helped to turn the tide of the campaign in the South East Asian theatre.\nThe 2nd Battalion was part of 29th Independent Infantry Brigade throughout the war. In 1942, it fought in the Battle of Madagascar, then part of Vichy French, before being transferred to the South-East Asian Theatre. In 1944, the battalion and brigade became part of 36th British Infantry Division, previously an Indian Army formation.\nBoth battalions came under the command of Lieutenant-General Bill Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army. This was known as the 'Forgotten Fourteenth,' allegedly because it fought in a theatre that seemed largely unnoticed and had little importance to the war.\nSecond World War; Territorial and War Service.\nThe 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions, all Territorial units, served in 158th (Royal Welch) Brigade assigned to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. They took part in the Battle of Normandy at Hill 112, where the 53rd Division suffered heavy casualties. Due to heavy fighting and casualties in Normandy, some of the battalions were posted to different brigades within the division. The 53rd again suffered heavily during Operation Veritable (the Battle of the Reichswald) under command of the First Canadian Army, in which action the British and Canadians, and the 53rd Division in particular, endured some of the fiercest fighting of the entire European Campaign against German paratroops.\nThe 8th, 9th and 10th Battalions were 2nd Line Territorial battalions raised in 1939 as duplicates of the 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions respectively. The battalions initially served in the 115th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division, itself a 2nd Line duplicate of the 53rd (Welsh) Division.\nThe 8th and 9th battalions never saw action abroad, remaining in the UK throughout the war in a training role, supplying trained replacements to units overseas. In this capacity, the 9th battalion served with the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division and the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division.\nIn the summer of 1942, the 10th battalion was converted into the 6th (Royal Welch) Battalion, Parachute Regiment. The 6th Parachute Battalion was assigned to the 2nd Parachute Brigade, alongside the 4th and 5th Parachute battalions, originally part of the 1st Airborne Division. The battalion played a small part in the Allied invasion of Italy during Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing aimed at capturing the port of Taranto. After that, the 2nd Para Brigade became an independent brigade group. The brigade took part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France, being the only British troops to do so (see 2nd Parachute Brigade in Southern France). In late 1944, the brigade was sent to Greece to support pro-Western forces in the Greek Civil War, a forgotten but brutal episode now seen as the first act of the post-1945 Cold War.\nIn 1938, the 5th Battalion transferred to the Royal Artillery as 60th Anti-Tank Regiment and in 1939, added a 2nd-Line duplicate, 70th Anti-Tank Regiment. Unlike 1914\u20131918, there were relatively few service battalions, one being 11th (Home Defence) Battalion, raised in 1939 as part of the Home Guard. Formed in 1940, the 12th battalion became 116th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in January 1942 and served with 53rd (Welsh) Division until disbanded in December 1944.\nPost Second World War.\nThe 2nd Battalion Royal Welch remained overseas after the Second World War, with a posting to Burma (still a colony until 4 January 1948) and performed internal security duties. On 7 March 1947 a party aboard a train were ambushed by bandits and seven soldiers were killed.\nThe regiment did not take part in the Gulf War, but did perform several tours in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) before being deployed to the Balkans.\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars, the regiment came to attention when 33 of their men and 350 other UN servicemen part of UNPROFOR were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs at Gora\u017ede on 28 May 1995. The situation caused some political debate as the UN troops had been given orders only to \"deter attacks\" and did not have a mandate or adequate equipment to fully defend the mainly Muslim town of Gora\u017ede, which was initially declared \"safe\" by the UN, thus rendering them exposed when armed members of the Army of Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Army) ignored the NATO ultimatum and attacked the town without warning. The regiment managed to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until they were forced to retreat into bunkers \u2013 those who did not make it quickly enough were taken hostage \u2013 and remained trapped underground while BiH Army reinforcements arrived and fought back. The commanding officer, Lt Col Jonathon Riley (later promoted to Lieutenant General), broke with protocol and directly reported to then Prime Minister John Major about the situation over the phone while in the bunker. All the men were eventually safely rescued. An unprecedented five gallantry awards, seven mentions in despatches and two Queen's Commendations for Valuable Service were awarded to the regiment. Although the incident was largely unreported at that time, the regiment was credited in hindsight by observers for saving the town from a possible genocide\u2014after failing to take Gora\u017ede, the Bosnian Serbs continued north to Srebrenica, where they would massacre over 8,000 Bosniaks.\nAmalgamation.\nIt was one of only five line infantry regiments never to have been amalgamated in its entire history, the others being The Royal Scots, The Green Howards, The Cheshire Regiment, and The King's Own Scottish Borderers. However, in 2004, it was announced that, as part of the restructuring of the infantry, the Royal Welch Fusiliers would merge with the Royal Regiment of Wales to form a new large regiment, the Royal Welsh.\nTo honour the links between the regiment and the United States Marine Corps on the 16 September 1945 a set of Marine colours were presented to the regiment at the parish church in Wrexham to commemorate their close connection (see page 32 in official USMC paper published in 1995).\nThe regiment has a chapel within St Giles Parish Church Wrexham containing their colours and other items. There is an image available taken in 2013.\nRegimental museum.\nThe Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum is located in Caernarfon, Wales.\nBattle honours.\nThe regiment was awarded the following battle honours:\nVictoria Crosses.\nThe following members of the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross:\nColonels-in-Chief.\nThe Colonels-in-Chief of the Regiment were:\nRegimental Colonels.\nThe Colonels of the Regiment were:\nAlliances.\nThe regiment had an alliance with the Canadian Royal 22e R\u00e9giment from 1927 until its amalgamation in 2006; this alliance included the frequent exchange of personnel between the two regiments.\nRegimental mascot.\nAs with the Royal Regiment of Wales, the regiment traditionally had a goat, never called a mascot. The tradition dated back to at least 1775, and possibly to the regiment's formation. The goat was always named 'Billy'.\nUniform.\nSoldiers of this regiment were distinguishable by the unique feature of the \"flash\", consisting of five overlapping black silk ribbons (seven inches long for soldiers and nine inches long for officers) on the back of the uniform jacket at neck level. This is a legacy of the days when it was normal for soldiers to wear pigtails. In 1808, this practice was discontinued but when the order was issued the RWF were serving in Nova Scotia and had not received the instruction when the regiment departed to join an expedition to the West Indies. In 1834 the officers of the 23rd Foot were finally granted permission by William IV to wear this non-regulation item as a distinction on the full dress uniform as \"a peculiarity whereby to mark the dress of that distinguished regiment\". This was extended to all ranks in 1900.\nKhaki service dress replaced the scarlet tunic as the principal uniform, and the Army Council attempted to remove the flash during the First World War, citing the grounds that it would help the Germans identify which unit was facing them. As Fusilier officer Robert Graves reported, \"the regiment retorted by inquiring on what occasion since the retreat from Corunna, when the regiment was the last to leave Spain, with the keys of the town postern in the pocket of one of its officers, had any of His Majesty's enemies seen the back of a Royal Welch Fusilier?,\" and the matter remained \"in abeyance throughout the war.\" The efforts of the regiment to retain the distinction was further reinforced at a medal ceremony when King George V saw an officer of the regiment in the line. He ordered an About Turn and seeing the flash still on the tunic said \"sotto voce\", \"don't ever let anyone take it from you!\" The wearing of the flash on service dress was extended to other ranks in 1924.\nAs a fusilier regiment, the RWF wore a hackle, which consisted of a plume of white feathers mounted behind the cap-badge of the modern beret. The full dress of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, as worn by the entire regiment until 1914, included a racoon-skin hat (bearskin for officers) with a white hackle and a scarlet tunic with the dark blue facings of a Royal regiment. This uniform continued to be worn by the RWF's Corps of Drums and the Regimental Pioneers until the merger of 2006.\nRegimental Prayer.\nThe Regimental Collect (or prayer as it is also known as) was in Welsh:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tragwyddol Dduw, a gyfododd trwy dy nerth yr Arglwydd Iesu Grist o\u2019r meirw, gynnal fe weddiwn, gwrhydri hynafol y Ffiwsilwyr Cymreig, fel yr oddefwn galedi yn \u00f4l ei esiampl, ac y cyfodwn gydag ef i lewyrch fel yr hal yn dy deyrnas, trwy\u2019r un Iesu Grist ein Harglwydd.

Founded in Hamburg in 1877 to specialise in steel-hulled ships, its most famous product was the World War II battleship \"Bismarck\". In the 1930s, its owners established the Hamburger Flugzeugbau aircraft manufacturer which, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, adopted the name of its parent company. Following a difficult period after the war, B+V was revived, changing ownership among several owners, such as Thyssen Group and Star Capital. In 2016 it became a subsidiary of L\u00fcrssen and supplied both the military and civilian markets before becoming subsidiary of Rheinmetall in 2025. \nThe company serves two areas \u2013 new construction of warships as NVL B.V. &amp; Co. KG, and new construction and refitting of megayachts.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nBlohm &amp; Voss was founded on 5 April 1877 by Hermann Blohm and Ernst Voss (or Vo\u00df) as a general partnership, to build steel-hulled ships. It established a shipyard on the island of Kuhwerder, near the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, covering with of water frontage and three building berths, two suitable for ships of up to length. The company name was shown with the ampersand, as B&amp;V, until 1955.\nShipbuilding was at that time dominated by the British, with even German customers preferring to buy from them. Initial business was confined to ship repairs, although B&amp;V managed to build and later sell the three-masted barque \"National\". Eventually the first new-build order arrived for the small cargo paddle-steamer \"Burg\", and the business took off. By 1882, the company had gained a reputation for quality and punctuality and was prospering.\nInitially, their products were steel-hulled sailing ships designed for long sea voyages. At that time steamships had a relatively short range, while many of the advantages of steel construction still applied to sailing ships as much as to steam. The company built its first steamship in 1900, while still continuing to build sailing ships until the late 1930s.\nThe Nazi era, 1933\u20131945.\nWhen Hermann Blohm died, his two sons Rudolf Blohm and Walther Blohm took over. Ernst Voss left soon afterwards. By this time the company was in financial crisis, so the Blohm brothers diversified into aircraft, setting up the Hamburger Flugzeugbau (see below) in the summer of 1933.\nWith the rise of the Nazi Party to power in 1933, Germany began to rearm and both companies became increasingly involved in the programme. The shipyard built both civilian craft and warships for the government, including the battleship , before manufacturing U-boats in quantity.\nIn 1944 a subcamp of Neuengamme concentration camp was set up at the company's shipyard in Hamburg-Steinwerder. It supplied labour to the company from July 1944 to April 1945. A report dated 29 August states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRudolf Blohm was present during this visit.\nA memorial stands on the site of the camp and the company continues to pay an undisclosed amount to the Fund for Compensation of Forced Laborers. Steinwerder was badly damaged during the bombing of Hamburg in World War II and at the end of it, shipbuilding was forbidden.\nHamburger Flugzeugbau.\nIn 1933 Blohm &amp; Voss was suffering a financial crisis from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long-range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. They formed the Hamburger Flugzeugbau that summer.\nMost of the aircraft built by HFB/B&amp;V would in fact be other companies' designs and major subassemblies, contracted under license, including tens of thousands of aircraft each for Dornier, Heinkel, Junkers and Messerschmitt. Alongside its volume manufacturing the company also maintained its own design office and workshops which continued to develop and build new types throughout the company's life. The first planes it produced were designated with the official RLM company code \"Ha\".\nThe aircraft produced by Hamburger Flugzeugbau were still commonly associated with Blohm &amp; Voss and this was causing confusion, so in September 1937 Hamburger Flugzeugbau was renamed \"Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm &amp; Voss\" and the RLM changed its company code to \"BV\".\nIts most significant designs were flying boats, mainly used by the Luftwaffe for maritime patrol and reconnaissance. Most numerous was the BV 138 \"Seedrache\" (initiated as the Ha 138), a twin-boom trimotor, while the BV 222 \"Wiking\" was much larger. Largest of all was the BV 238 prototype, the largest aircraft built by any of the Axis forces. Other notable types include the asymmetric BV 141, which was built in moderate numbers but did not enter production.\nAt the end of the war, aircraft production was shut down. Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH (HFB) re-emerged in 1956, still under the ownership of Walther Blohm but no longer connected to B+V. It reopened the former B+V aircraft factory at Finkenwerder and subsequently underwent various further changes of ownership and company name, eventually becoming part of Airbus.\nPostwar.\nAfter the Second World War, the British continued to demolish the shipyards of Steinwerder. B&amp;V, unable to restart shipbuilding work, all but ceased to exist for several years.\nIn 1950, B&amp;V created a new subsidiary company, Steinwerder Industrie AG, to manufacture machinery and boilers on the site. Its shipyard fortunes began to revive in 1952 when the new company was allowed to restart ship repair work and the City of Hamburg subsequently guaranteed it credit. By 1953 some 900 workers were back in employment. The building of new ships would later also be allowed again; the first ship built was the Wappen von Hamburg in 1955. During this period of resurrection the level of investment required meant that B&amp;V moved out of private hands and became a publicly quoted company, 50% owned by Phoenix-Rheinrohr AG, itself soon to be consolidated into the Thyssen Group. Even so, B&amp;V would never regain its former size. In 1966 it took over neighbouring shipbuilder H. C. St\u00fclcken Sohn.\nDuring the postwar years, B+V built oil rigs and developed a market for other offshore products such as support ships and pipelines. The company has also built ships for numerous commercial customers, including luxury yachts. \"Eclipse\", built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, is in length making it the second longest private yacht in the world. B+V still administers the Elbe 17 dry dock at Hamburg. The semi-submersible drilling rig \"Chris Chenery\" was constructed in 1974 for The Offshore Co. of Houston, US. When Thyssen AG and Krupp merged in 1999, B+V became a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.\nIn December 2001, Blohm+Voss, Nordseewerke and Friedrich Lurssen Werft were awarded the contract to build the first five K130 MEKO frigates for the German Navy. The first of them, \"Braunschweig\", was built at Blohm+Voss, launched in April 2006 and commissioned in April 2008. Several problems with the equipment fit delayed commissioning, and the last was commissioned in 2013.\nIn 2011 ThyssenKrupp agreed the sale of the Blohm+Voss civil shipbuilding division to British investment company STAR Capital Partners. The military division remained with ThyssenKrupp.\nIn October 2016, regulatory approval was given for L\u00fcrssen to acquire Blohm+Voss from STAR Capital Partners. In April 2017 the company dismissed 300 employees from which were 1000.\nIn September 2017, the German Navy commissioned the construction of five K130 corvettes by a consortium of North German shipyards including ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Blohm+Voss, and the German Naval Yards in Kiel. The L\u00fcrssen Group, which would be the main contractor in the production of the vessels, distributed its work between the two sites at Wolgast and B+V Hamburg to build only two, \"K\u00f6ln\" in 2021 and \"Emden\" in 2022. The contract was worth around 2 billion euros.\nOn 25 July 2019, Peter L\u00fcr\u00dfen invested \u20ac20 million into the shipyard. Dock 10 was covered with a roof 200m-long and 50m-high for a cost of \u20ac13\u00a0million. The mounting of steel pillars above the dock's walls started in October 2020. On 29 April 2021, the hull of the yacht \"Opera\", also called \"Coral Ocean\", was transferred from Dock 17 to Dock 10 and both were tugged to Berne, Germany to stay at least 2 years. The previous 146-m \"Sassi\", which was burned to the point that only the engine section block remained, formed part of \"Opera\". L\u00fcr\u00dfen's Dock 3 was transferred to the Jade shipyard at Wilhelmshaven. In Berne, a hall was extended. \"Mein Schiff 3\" then docked in Dock 17, followed by \"AIDAcara\" and \"AIDAmar\", the latest cruise ships to visit the dock.\nSince October 2021.\nAccording to an interview and meeting published in \"Hamburger Morgenpost\" on 30 September 2021 and repeated at \"Hamburger Abendblatt\", the workforce was advised that L\u00fcrssen would no longer refit cruise ships in Hamburg anymore. The new building department was dissolved. All six floating docks were in review. The repair division was not a success. Despite the around 20 million euros invested in modern shipyard technology, the subletting of many halls and the shrinkage to only around a third of the used shipyard area, the costs were still too high and is not yet fit for the future. The location is too expensive compared to other shipyards, so structural measures and cost adjustments were necessary.\nIn a statement, NVL B.V. &amp; Co. KG, military naval ships construction, which belonged to L\u00fcrssen was sold to Rheinmetall in September 2025.\nShips built.\nBlohm &amp; Voss was established in the days of sail and, although it built ships with steel hulls from the first, it did not produce a significant steamship until 1900. Of the many hundreds of ships built by B+V, notable examples include:\nWarships.\nModern warships.\nShips built using the MEKO system are listed at MEKO.\nOther modern warships designed and built by B&amp;V include:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This creates, in effect, a virtual object database that can be used from within the program.\nIn object-oriented programming, data-management tasks act on objects that combine scalar values into objects. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a \"Person object\" with an attribute/field to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain \"PhoneNumber objects\" and so on. Each such address-book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as methods to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.\nBy contrast, relational databases, such as SQL, group scalars into tuples, which are then enumerated in tables. Tuples and objects have some general similarity, in that they are both ways to collect values into named fields such that the whole collection can be manipulated as a single compound entity. They have many differences, though, in particular: lifecycle management (row insertion and deletion, versus garbage collection or reference counting), references to other entities (object references, versus foreign key references), and inheritance (non-existent in relational databases). As well, objects are managed on-heap and are under full control of a single process, while database tuples are shared and must incorporate locking, merging, and retry. Object\u2013relational mapping provides automated support for mapping tuples to objects and back, while accounting for all of these differences.\nThe heart of the problem involves translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomized form that is capable of being stored in the database while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent.\nOverview.\nImplementation-specific details of storage drivers are generally wrapped in an API in the programming language in use, exposing methods to interact with the storage medium in a way which is simpler and more in line with the paradigms of surrounding code.\nThe following is a simple example, written in C# code, to execute a query written in SQL using a database engine.\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nstring sql = \"SELECT id, first_name, last_name, phone, birth_date, sex, age FROM persons WHERE id = 10\";\nList&lt;Person&gt; result = context.Persons.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList();\nstring name = result[0][\"first_name\"];\nIn contrast, the following makes use of an ORM-job API which makes it possible to write code that naturally makes use of the features of the language.\nPerson person = repository.GetPerson(10);\nstring firstName = person.GetFirstName();\nThe case above makes use of an object representing the storage repository and methods of that object. Other frameworks might provide code as static methods, as in the example below, and yet other methods may not implement an object-oriented system at all. Often the choice of paradigm is made for the best fit of the ORM into the surrounding language's design principles.\nPerson person = Person.Get(10);\nComparison with traditional data access techniques.\nCompared to traditional techniques of exchange between an object-oriented language and a relational database, ORM often reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.\nDisadvantages of ORM tools generally stem from the high level of abstraction obscuring what is actually happening in the implementation code.\nObject-oriented databases.\nAnother approach is to use an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) or document-oriented databases such as native XML databases that provide more flexibility in data modeling. OODBMSs are databases designed specifically for working with object-oriented values. Using an OODBMS eliminates the need for converting data to and from its SQL form, as the data is stored in its original object representation and relationships are directly represented, rather than requiring join tables/operations. The equivalent of ORMs for document-oriented databases are called object-document mappers (ODMs).\nDocument-oriented databases also prevent the user from having to \"shred\" objects into table rows. Many of these systems also support the XQuery query language to retrieve datasets.\nObject-oriented databases tend to be used in complex, niche applications. One of the arguments against using an OODBMS is that it may not be able to execute ad-hoc, application-independent queries. For this reason, many programmers find themselves more at home with an object-SQL mapping system, even though most object-oriented databases are able to process SQL queries to a limited extent. Other OODBMS provide replication to SQL databases, as a means of addressing the need for ad-hoc queries, while preserving well-known query patterns.\nChallenges.\nA variety of difficulties arise when considering how to match an object system to a relational database. These difficulties are referred to as the object\u2013relational impedance mismatch.\nAn alternative to implementing ORM is use of the native procedural languages provided with every major database. These can be called from the client using SQL statements. The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is used to abstract these statements and offer a lightweight object-oriented interface to the rest of the application.\nORMs are limited to their predefined functionality, which may not cover all edge cases or database features. They usually mitigate this limitation by providing users with an interface to write raw queries, such as Django ORM.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tradition holds that during his papacy he determined the various prerogatives of the clergy and defined the grades of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.\nHyginus instituted godparents at baptism to assist the baptised during their Christian life. He also decreed that all churches be consecrated. He is said to have died a martyr, though no records verify this. The chronology of the early bishops of Rome cannot be determined with any degree of exactitude today.\nHistory.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Hyginus was a Greek by birth. Irenaeus says that the gnostic Valentinus came to Rome in Hyginus' time, remaining there until Anicetus became pontiff.\nCerdo, another Gnostic and predecessor of Marcion of Sinope, also lived at Rome in the reign of Hyginus; by confessing his errors and recanting, he succeeded in obtaining readmission into the Church but eventually fell back into heresy and was expelled from the Church.\nThe \"Liber Pontificalis\" also relates that this pope organized the hierarchy and established the order of ecclesiastical precedence (\"\"). This general observation recurs also in the biography of Pope Hormisdas. According to Louis Duchesne, the writer probably referred to the lower orders of the clergy.\nThe ancient sources contain no information as to his having died a martyr. At his death he was buried on the Vatican Hill, near Saint Peter's tomb. His feast is celebrated on 11 January.\nHis feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is also 11 January.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59205", "revid": "163732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59205", "title": "Pope Pius X", "text": "Head of the Catholic Church from 1903 to 1914\nPope Pius X (; born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto; 2 June 1835\u00a0\u2013 20 August 1914) was head of the Catholic Church from 4 August 1903 until his death in August 1914. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, and for promoting liturgical reforms and Thomist scholastic theology. He initiated the preparation of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the first comprehensive and systemic work of its kind, which was ultimately promulgated by his successor. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.\nPius X was devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Confidence; while his papal encyclical \"Ad diem illum\" took on a sense of renewal that was reflected in the motto of his pontificate. He advanced the Liturgical Movement by formulating the principle of \"participatio actuosa\" (active participation of the faithful) in his motu proprio, \"Tra le sollecitudini\" (1903). He encouraged the frequent reception of Holy Communion, and he lowered the age for First Communion, which would become a lasting innovation of his papacy.\nLike his predecessors, he promoted Thomism as the principal philosophical method to be taught in Catholic institutions. He vehemently opposed various 19th-century philosophies that he viewed as an intrusion of secular errors incompatible with Catholic dogma, especially modernism, which he critiqued as the synthesis of every heresy.\nPius X was known for his firm demeanour and sense of personal poverty, reflected by his membership of the Third Order of Saint Francis. He regularly gave sermons from the pulpit, a rare practice at the time. After the 1908 Messina earthquake he filled the Apostolic Palace with refugees, long before the Italian government acted. He rejected any kind of favours for his family, and his close relatives chose to remain in poverty, living near Rome. He also undertook a reform of the Roman Curia with the Apostolic Constitution \"Sapienti consilio\" in 1908.\nAfter his death, a strong cult of devotion followed his reputation for piety and holiness. He was beatified in 1951 and canonized in 1954 by Pope Pius XII. A statue bearing his name stands within Saint Peter's Basilica, and his birth town was renamed Riese Pio X after his death.\nEarly life and ministry.\nGiuseppe Melchiorre Sarto was born in Riese, Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia, Austrian Empire (now in the province of Treviso, Veneto, Italy), in 1835. He was the second born of ten children of Giovanni Battista Sarto (1792\u20131852), the village postman, and Margherita Sanson (1813\u20131894). He was baptised 3 June 1835. Though poor, his parents valued education, and Giuseppe walked to school each day.\nGiuseppe had three brothers and six sisters: Giuseppe Sarto (born 1834; died after six days), Angelo Sarto (1837\u20131916), Teresa Parolin-Sarto (1839\u20131920), Rosa Sarto (1841\u20131913), Antonia Dei Bei-Sarto (1843\u20131917), Maria Sarto (1846\u20131930), Lucia Boschin-Sarto (1848\u20131924), Anna Sarto (1850\u20131926), Pietro Sarto (born 1852; died after six months). As Pope, he rejected any kind of favours for his family: his brother remained a postal clerk, his favourite nephew stayed on as village priest, and his three single sisters lived together in humble circumstances in Rome.\nGiuseppe, nicknamed as \"Bepi\" by his mother, had so much natural exuberance that his teacher often had to cane his backside. Despite this, he was an excellent student who focused on homework before hobbies or recreations. In the evenings after sports or games with friends, he would spend ten minutes in prayer before returning home. He also served as an altar boy. By the age of ten, he had completed the two elementary classes of his village school as well as Latin study with a local priest; henceforth he had to walk four miles to the gymnasium in Castelfranco Veneto for further classes. For the next four years, he would attend Mass before breakfast and his long walk to school. He often carried his shoes to make them last longer. As a poor boy, he was often teased for his meager lunches and shabby clothes but never complained to his teachers.\nIn 1850, he received the tonsure from his parish priest, who wrote to the Cardinal of Venice to secure Sarto a scholarship to the Seminary of Padua, \"where he finished his classical, philosophical, and theological studies with distinction\".\nOn 18 September 1858, Sarto was ordained a priest by Giovanni Antonio Farina, Bishop of Treviso (later canonized), and became a chaplain at Tombolo. While there, Sarto expanded his knowledge of theology, studying Thomas Aquinas and canon law, while carrying out most of the functions of the sickly parish priest Constantini. Often, Sarto sought to improve his sermons by the advice of Constantini, who referred to one of his earliest as \"rubbish\". In Tombolo, Sarto's reputation for holiness grew so much that some of the people call him \"Don Santo\".\nIn 1867, he was named archpriest of Salzano. He restored the local church and expanded the hospital, the funds coming from his own begging, wealth and labour. He won the people's affection when he worked to assist the sick during the cholera outbreak of the early 1870s. He was appointed a canon of the cathedral and chancellor of the Diocese of Treviso, also acting as spiritual director and rector of the Treviso seminary and examiner of the clergy. As chancellor he made it possible for public school students to receive religious instruction. As a priest and later bishop, he often struggled to bring religious instruction to rural and urban youth who could not attend Catholic schools. At one stage, a large stack of hay caught fire near a cottage, and when Sarto arrived he addressed the frantic people, \"Don't be afraid, the fire will be put out and your house will be saved!\" At that moment, the flames turned in the other direction, sparing the cottage. Despite his many duties, Sarto often made time for an evening walk with children preparing for their First Communion.\nIn 1879, Bishop Federico Maria Zinelli died, and Sarto was elected vicar capitular to care for the diocese until the installation of a new bishop in June 1880.\nAfter 1880, Sarto taught dogmatic theology and moral theology at the seminary in Treviso. On 10 November 1884, he was appointed bishop of Mantua by Pope Leo XIII. He was consecrated six days later in Rome in the church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine, Rome, by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, assisted by Pietro Rota, and by Giovanni Maria Berengo. He was appointed to the honorary position of assistant at the pontifical throne on 19 June 1891. Sarto required papal dispensation from Pope Leo XIII before episcopal consecration as he lacked a doctorate, making him the last pope without a doctorate until Pope Francis.\nWhen Sarto travelled back to his hometown from Rome after his consecration, he immediately went to visit his mother. There, she repeatedly kissed his ring and said to him: \"But you would not have this fine ring, son, if I did not have this\", showing him her wedding ring.\nCardinalate and patriarchate.\nPope Leo XIII made him a cardinal of the order of cardinal priests in a secret consistory on 12 June 1893. In a public consistory on 15 June, the Pope gave him his cardinal's red galero, assigned him the titular church of San Bernardo alle Terme, and appointed him Patriarch of Venice. This caused difficulty, however, as the government of reunified Italy claimed the right to nominate the Patriarch, since the previous sovereign, the Emperor of Austria, had exercised that power. The poor relations between the Roman Curia and the Italian civil government since the annexation of the Papal States in 1870 placed additional strain on the appointment. The number of vacant sees soon grew to 30. Sarto was finally permitted to assume the position of patriarch in 1894. In regard to being named as a cardinal, Sarto told a local newspaper that he felt \"anxious, terrified and humiliated\".\nAfter being named cardinal and before leaving for Venice, he visited his mother. Overwhelmed with emotion, she asked: \"My son, give your mother a last blessing\", sensing that it would be the last time that they would see each other. Arriving in Venice, he was formally enthroned on 24 November 1894.\nAs cardinal-patriarch, Sarto avoided politics, allocating his time to social works and strengthening parochial credit unions. However, in his first pastoral letter to the Venetians, Sarto argued that in matters pertaining to the Pope, \"There should be no questions, no subtleties, no opposing of personal rights to his rights, but only obedience.\"\nIn April 1903, Pope Leo XIII reportedly said to Lorenzo Perosi: \"Hold him very dear, Perosi, as in the future he will be able to do much for you. We firmly believe he will be our successor\". As a cardinal, he was considered by the time of his papal election as one of the most prominent preachers in the Church despite his lesser fame globally. In his role as a cardinal, Sarto held membership in the congregations for Bishops and Regulars, Rites, and Indulgences and Sacred Relics.\nPapal election of 1903.\nLeo XIII died 20 July 1903, and at the end of that month the conclave convened to elect his successor. Before the conclave, Sarto had reportedly said, \"rather dead than pope\", when people discussed his chances for election. In one of the meetings held just before the conclave, Cardinal Victor-Lucien-Sulpice L\u00e9cot spoke with Sarto in French, however, Sarto replied in Latin, \"I'm afraid I do not speak French\". L\u00e9cot replied, \"But if Your Eminence does not speak French you have no chance of being elected because the Pope must speak French\", to which Sarto said, \"Deo Gratias! I have no desire to be pope\".\nAccording to historians, the favorite was the late pope's secretary of state, Cardinal Mariano Rampolla. On the first ballot, Rampolla received 24 votes, Gotti had 17 votes, and Sarto 5 votes. On the second ballot, Rampolla had gained five votes, as did Sarto. The next day, it seemed that Rampolla would be elected. However, the Polish Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko from Krak\u00f3w, in the name of Emperor Franz Joseph (1848\u20131916) of Austria-Hungary, proclaimed a veto (\"jus exclusivae\") against Rampolla's election. Many in the conclave protested, and it was even suggested to disregard the veto.\nHowever, the third vote had already begun, resulting in no clear winner but increasing support for Sarto, with 21 votes. The fourth vote showed Rampolla with 30 votes and Sarto with 24. It seemed clear that the cardinals were moving toward Sarto.\nThe following morning, the fifth vote gave Rampolla 10 votes, Gotti 2, and Sarto 50. Thus, on 4 August 1903, Sarto was elected to the pontificate. This marked the last known exercise of a papal veto by a Catholic monarch.\nAt first, it is reported, Sarto declined the nomination, feeling unworthy. He had been deeply saddened by the Austro-Hungarian veto and vowed to rescind these powers and excommunicate anyone who communicated such a veto during a conclave. With the cardinals asking him to reconsider, he went into solitude in the Pauline Chapel, and after deep prayer he accepted the position. Cardinal Luigi Macchi announced Sarto's election at around 12:10pm.\nSarto took as his papal name Pius X, out of respect for his recent predecessors of the same name, particularly Pope Pius IX (1846\u20131878), who had fought against theological liberals and for papal supremacy. He explained: \"As I shall suffer, I shall take the name of those Popes who also suffered\". Pius X's traditional coronation took place the following Sunday, 9 August 1903. As pope, he became ex officio Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation.\nPontificate.\nThe pontificate of Pius X was noted for conservative theology and reforms in liturgy and Church law. In what became his motto, the Pope in 1903 devoted his papacy to \"Instaurare Omnia in Christo\", \"to restore all things in Christ.\" In his first encyclical (\"E supremi apostolatus\", 4 October 1903), he stated his overriding policy: \"We champion the authority of God. His authority and Commandments should be recognized, deferred to, and respected.\"\nContinuing his simple origins, he wore a pectoral cross of gilded metal on the day of his coronation; and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope declared he always wore it and had brought no other with him. He was well known for reducing papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the Pope dining alone, since the time of Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends to eat with him.\nWhen chided by Rome's social leaders for refusing to make his peasant sisters papal countesses, he responded: \"I have made them sisters of the Pope; what more can I do for them?\"\nHe developed a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught them catechism. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him and talk about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to save children from religious ignorance.\nNoted for his humility and simplicity, he declared that he had not changed personally save for his white cassock. Aides consistently needed to remind him not to wipe his pen on the white cassock, as he had previously done on his black cassock which hid stains. The new pope's schedule was quite similar each day. He rose at 4:00am before celebrating Mass at 6:00am. He was at his desk at 8:00am to receive private audiences. On his desk stood statues of John Vianney and Joan of Arc, both of whom he beatified in his papacy. At noon, he conducted a general audience with pilgrims, then had lunch at 1:00pm with his two secretaries or whomever else he invited to dine with him. Resting for a short while after lunch, Pius X would then return to work before dining at 9:00pm and a final stint of work before sleep.\nChurch reforms and theology.\nRestoration in Christ and Mariology.\nIn his 1904 encyclical \"Ad diem illum\", he views Mary in the context of \"restoring everything in Christ\".\nHe wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Spiritually we all are her children and she is the mother of us, therefore, she is to be revered like a mother. Christ is the Word made Flesh and the Savior of mankind. He had a physical body like every other man: and as savior of the human family, he had a spiritual and mystical body, the Church. This, the Pope argues has consequences for our view of the Blessed Virgin. She did not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely that He might be made man taking His human nature from her, but also, by giving him her human nature, that He might be the Redeemer of men. Mary, carrying the Savior within her, also carried all those whose life was contained in the life of the Savior. Therefore, all the faithful united to Christ, are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head. Through a spiritual and mystical fashion, all are children of Mary, and she is their Mother. Mother, spiritually, but truly Mother of the members of Christ (S. Aug. L. de S. Virginitate, c. 6).During Pius X's pontificate, many famed Marian images were granted a canonical coronation: Our Lady of Aparecida, Our Lady of the Pillar, Our Lady of the Cape, Our Lady of Chiquinquira of Colombia, Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos, Our Lady of La Naval de Manila, Virgin of Help of Venezuela, Our Lady of Carmel of New York, the Marian icon of Santuario della Consolata and the Immaculate Conception within the \"Chapel of the Choir\" inside Saint Peter's Basilica were granted this prestigious honor.\n\"Tra le sollecitudini\" and Gregorian chant.\nWithin three months of his coronation, Pius X published his \"motu proprio\" \"Tra le sollecitudini\". Classical and Baroque compositions had long been favoured over Gregorian chant in ecclesiastical music. The Pope announced a return to earlier musical styles, championed by Lorenzo Perosi. Since 1898, Perosi had been Director of the Sistine Chapel Choir, a title which Pius X upgraded to \"Perpetual Director\". The Pope's choice of Joseph Pothier to supervise the new editions of chant led to the official adoption of the Solesmes edition of Gregorian chant.\nLiturgical reforms and communion.\nPius X worked to increase devotion among both clergy and laity, particularly in the Breviary, which he reformed considerably, and the Mass.\nBesides restoring to prominence Gregorian chant, he placed a renewed liturgical emphasis on the Eucharist, saying, \"Holy Communion is the shortest and safest way to Heaven.\" To this end, he encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion. This also extended to children who had reached the \"age of discretion\", though he did not permit the ancient Eastern practice of infant communion. He also emphasized frequent recourse to the Sacrament of Penance so that Holy Communion would be received worthily. Pius X's devotion to the Eucharist would eventually earn him the honorific of \"Pope of the Blessed Sacrament\", by which he is still known among his devotees.\nIn 1910, he issued the decree \"Quam singulari\", which changed the age at which Communion could be received from 12 to 7 years old, the age of discretion. The Pope lowered the age because he wished to impress the event on the minds of children and stimulate their parents to new religious observance; this decree was found unwelcome in some places due to the belief that parents would withdraw their children early from Catholic schools, now that First Communion was carried out earlier. Pius X even personally distributed First Communion to a four-year-old boy the day after the child was presented to him and demonstrated an exceptional understanding of the meaning of the sacrament. When people would criticize Pius X for lowering the age of reception, he simply quoted the words of Jesus, \"let the little children come to me\".\nPius X said in his 1903 \"motu proprio\" \"Tra le sollecitudini\", \"The primary and indispensable source of the true Christian spirit is participation in the most holy mysteries and in the public, official prayer of the Church.\"\nHe also sought to modify papal ceremonies to underscore their religious significance by eliminating occasions for applause. For example, when entering his first public consistory for the creation of cardinals in November 1903, he was not carried above the crowds on the \"sedia gestatoria\" as was traditional. He arrived on foot wearing a cope and mitre at the end of the procession of prelates \"almost hidden behind the double line of Palatine Guards through which he passed\".\nAnti-modernism.\nPope Leo XIII had sought to revive the inheritance of Thomas Aquinas, 'the marriage of reason and revelation', as a response to secular Enlightenment. Under Pius X, \"neo-Thomism\" became the blueprint for theology.\nMost controversially, Pius X vigorously condemned the theological movement he termed 'Modernism', which he regarded as a heresy endangering the Catholic faith. The movement was linked especially to certain Catholic French scholars such as Louis Duchesne, who applied modern critical methods to Church history, drawing together archaeology and topography to supplement literature and setting ecclesiastical events with contexts of social history. Alfred Loisy, a student of Duchesne, denied that some parts of Scripture were literally rather than metaphorically true. In contradiction to Thomas Aquinas, they argued that there was an unbridgeable gap between natural and supernatural knowledge. From the traditional viewpoint, such investigations led inevitably to relativism and scepticism. The modernist and relativist theological trends tried to assimilate modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant as well as rationalism into Catholic theology.\nAnti-Modernists viewed these notions as contrary to the dogmas and traditions of the Catholic Church. In the decree entitled \"Lamentabili sane exitu\" (\"A Lamentable Departure Indeed\") of 3 July 1907, Pius X formally condemned 65 propositions, mainly drawn from the works of Alfred Loisy and concerning the nature of the Church, revelation, biblical exegesis, the sacraments, and the divinity of Christ. That was followed by the encyclical \"Pascendi dominici gregis\" (or \"Feeding the Lord's Flock\"), which characterized Modernism as the \"synthesis of all heresies.\"\nEscalating the campaign, Pius X ordered that all clerics take the Anti-Modernist oath, \"Sacrorum antistitum\". The Pope's aggressive stance against Modernism caused some disruption within the Church, although only about 40 clerics refused to take the oath. Catholic scholarship with Modernist tendencies was greatly discouraged, and theologians who wished to pursue lines of inquiry in line with Secularism, Modernism, or Relativism were threatened with sanctions up to excommunication.\nPius X's attitude toward the Modernists was uncompromising. He also instituted the \"Sodalitium Pianum\" (or League of Pius V), an anti-Modernist network of informants, which was much criticised due to its accusations of heresy on limited evidence. This campaign was run by Monsignor Umberto Benigni in the Department of Extraordinary Affairs in the Secretariat of State, which distributed anti-Modernist propaganda and gathered information on \"culprits\". In Benigni's secret code, Pius X was known as \"Mama\". Among those it investigated was the teacher of church history, Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII), but the Holy Office cleared him of all charges.\nCatechism of Saint Pius X.\nIn his 1905 letter \"Acerbo nimis\", Pius X mandated the establishment of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (catechism class) in every parish in the world, and he extolled cathetical training as a method of religious teaching.\nThe \"Catechism of Pius X\" is his realisation of a simple, plain, brief, popular catechism for uniform use throughout the whole world; it was used in the ecclesiastical province of Rome and for some years in other parts of Italy; it was not, however, prescribed for use throughout the universal Church. It was issued in 1908 in Italian as \"Catechismo della dottrina Cristiana, Pubblicato per Ordine del Sommo Pontifice San Pio X\". An English translation (\"Catechism of Saint Pius X\") runs to 115 pages.\nPope Benedict XVI praised its \"simplicity of exposition and depth of content. Also because of this, Pius X's catechism might have friends in the future.\" Asked in 2003 whether the almost 100-year-old work was still valid, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said: \"The faith as such is always the same. Hence the Catechism of Saint Pius X always preserves its value. Whereas ways of transmitting the contents of the faith can change instead. And hence one may wonder whether the Catechism of Saint Pius X can in that sense still be considered valid today.\"\nThe Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), a canonically irregular, traditionalist fraternity, recommends the Catechism of Saint Pius X over the 1992 \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\".\nReform of canon law.\nCanon law of the Catholic Church varied from region to region with no overall prescriptions. On 19 March 1904, Pope Pius X named a commission of cardinals to draft a universal set of laws. Two of his successors worked in the commission: Giacomo della Chiesa, who became Pope Benedict XV, and Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII. This first Code of Canon Law was promulgated by Benedict XV on 27 May 1917, with an effective date of 19 May 1918, and remained in effect until Advent 1983, when Pope John Paul II, promulgated the contemporary canon law.\nReform of Church administration.\nPius X reformed the Roman Curia with the constitution \"Sapienti Consilio\" (29 June 1908) and specified new rules enforcing a bishop's oversight of seminaries in the encyclical \"Pieni l'animo\". He established regional seminaries (closing some smaller ones), and promulgated a new plan of seminary study. He also barred clergy from administering social organizations.\nChurch policies towards secular governments.\nPius X reversed the accommodating approach of Leo XIII towards secular governments, appointing Rafael Merry del Val as Cardinal Secretary of State (Merry del Val would later have his own cause opened for canonization in 1953, but still has not been beatified). When the French president \u00c9mile Loubet visited the Italian monarch Victor Emmanuel III (1900\u20131946), Pius X, still refusing to accept the annexation of the papal territories by Italy, reproached the French president for the visit and refused to meet him. This led to a diplomatic break with France and to the 1905 Law of Separation between church and state, by which the Church lost government funding in France. The Pope denounced this law in his encyclicals \"Vehementer Nos\" and \"Gravissimo officii munere\", and removed two French bishops for recognising the Third Republic. However, support came to him from all over the world, notably from the missionary bishop Peter Joseph Hurth. On May 5, 1907, Hurth took part in a public gathering of Indian Catholics in Calcutta in support of the pope and the Catholics of France. Eventually, France expelled the Jesuits and broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican.\nThe Pope adopted a similar position toward secular governments in Portugal, Ireland, Poland, Ethiopia, and in other states with large Catholic populations. His opposition to international relations with Italy angered the secular powers of these countries, as well as a few others like the United Kingdom and Russia. In Ireland, Protestants increasingly worried that a proposed \"Home Rule\" by an Irish parliament representing the Catholic majority (rather than the \"status quo\" of rule by Westminster since the 1800 Union of Ireland and Great Britain) would result in \"Rome Rule\" due to Pius X's uncompromising stance being followed by Irish Catholics (Ultramontanism).\nIn 1908, the papal decree \"Ne Temere\" came into effect which complicated mixed marriages. Marriages not performed by a Catholic priest were declared legal but sacramentally invalid, worrying some Protestants that the Church would counsel separation for couples married in a Protestant church or by civil service. Priests were given discretion to refuse mixed marriages or to lay conditions upon them, commonly including a requirement that the children be raised Catholic. The decree proved particularly divisive in Ireland, with its large Protestant minority, contributing indirectly to the subsequent political conflict there and provoking debates in the British House of Commons. The long-term effect of \"Ne Temere\" in Ireland was that Irish Unionism which had had strongholds in Dublin as well as Ulster, but existed to some extent on the entire island of Ireland, declined overall and became virtually exclusively a phenomenon of what is today Northern Ireland. Furthermore, while historically both Protestant Irish nationalists and Catholic Unionists existed, the split over who should rule Northern Ireland eventually came to almost exactly match the confessional divide.\nAs secular authority challenged the papacy, Pius X became more aggressive. He suspended the \"Opera dei Congressi\", which coordinated the work of Catholic associations in Italy, as well as condemning \"Le Sillon\", a French social movement that tried to reconcile the Church with liberal political views. He also opposed trade unions that were not exclusively Catholic.\nPius X partially lifted decrees prohibiting Italian Catholics from voting, but he never recognised the Italian government.\nRelations with the Kingdom of Italy.\nInitially, Pius maintained his prisoner in the Vatican stance, but with the rise of socialism he began to allow the \"Non Expedit\", which prohibited Catholics from voting, to be relaxed. In 1905, he authorized bishops in his encyclical \"Il fermo proposito\" to offer a dispensation allowing their parishioners to exercise their legislative rights when \"the supreme good of society\" was at stake.\nRelations with Poland and Russia.\nUnder Pius X, the traditionally difficult situation of Polish Catholics in Russia did not improve. Although Nicholas II of Russia issued a decree on 22 February 1903, promising religious freedom for the Catholic Church, and in 1905 promulgated a constitution which included religious freedom, the Russian Orthodox Church felt threatened and insisted on stiff interpretations. Papal decrees were not permitted and contacts with the Vatican remained outlawed.\nActivities for the United States.\nIn 1903, Pius X negotiated a deal with the United States Government, allowing it to purchase all land owned by Catholic friars in the recently acquired territory of the Philippines for a total of $7 million ($ in 2024). The agreement was made between Pius X and Philippine Governor-General William Howard Taft after previous negotiations between Taft and Pope Leo XIII had failed.\nIn 1908, Pius X lifted the United States out of its missionary status, in recognition of the growth of the Church in America. Fifteen new dioceses were created in the US during his pontificate, and he named two American cardinals. He was very popular among American Catholics, often depicted as an ordinary man from a poor family, raised by God to the papal throne.\nIn 1910, the Pope refused an audience with former Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks, who had addressed the Methodist association in Rome, as well as with former President Theodore Roosevelt, who intended to address the same association.\nOn 8 July 1914, Pope Pius X approved the request of Cardinal James Gibbons to invoke the patronage of the Immaculate Conception for the construction site of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.\nMiracles during the Pope's lifetime.\nOther than the stories of miracles performed through the Pope's intercession after his death, there are also stories of miracles performed by the Pope during his lifetime. On one occasion, during a papal audience, Pius X was holding a paralyzed child who wriggled free from his arms and then ran around the room. On another occasion, a couple (who had made confession to him while he was bishop of Mantua) with a two-year-old child with meningitis wrote to the Pope and Pius X then wrote back to them to hope and pray. Two days later, the child was cured.\nCardinal Ernesto Ruffini (later the Archbishop of Palermo) had visited the Pope after Ruffini was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and the Pope had told him to go back to the seminary and that he would be fine. Ruffini gave this story to the investigators of the pontiff's cause for canonization.\nOnce, a man who suffered from a paralyzed arm begged Pius X for his help. Taking his arm in his hand, the Pope simply said, \"have confidence in the Lord ... only have faith and the Lord will heal you\". At that moment, the man could actually move his arm, calling out to the Pope joyfully who simply put a finger to his lips so as not to draw any attention to what had happened, indicating that the man simply hold his peace. Another case saw an Irish girl covered in sores taken to see the Pope by her mother. When Pius X saw her, he placed his hand on her head, and the sores completely disappeared. Another case saw a Roman schoolgirl contract a serious foot disease that rendered her crippled since she was only a year old. Through a friend she managed to acquire one of the Pope's socks and was told that she would be healed if she wore it, which she did. At the moment she placed the sock on, the diseased foot was instantly healed. When Pius X heard about this, he laughed and said, \"What a joke! I wear my own socks every day and still I suffer from constant pain in my feet!\"\nOther activities.\nIn addition to the political defense of the Church, liturgical reforms, anti-modernism, and the beginning of the codification of canon law, the papacy of Pius X saw the reorganisation of the Roman Curia. He also sought to update the education of priests, seminaries and their curricula were reformed. In 1904 Pope Pius X granted permission for diocesan seminarians to attend the College of St. Thomas. He raised the college to the status of \"Pontificium\" on 2 May 1906, thus making its degrees equivalent to those of the world's other pontifical universities. By Apostolic Letter of 8 November 1908, signed by the Supreme Pontiff on 17 November, the college was transformed into the \"Collegium Pontificium Internationale Angelicum\". It would become the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" in 1963.\nPius X published 16 encyclicals; among them was \"Vehementer nos\" on 11 February 1906, which condemned the 1905 French law on the separation of the State and the Church. Pius X also confirmed, though not infallibly, the existence of Limbo in Catholic theology in his 1905 Catechism, saying that the unbaptized \"do not have the joy of God but neither do they suffer... they do not deserve Paradise, but neither do they deserve Hell or Purgatory.\" On 23 November 1903, Pius X issued a papal directive, a \"motu proprio\", that banned women from singing in church choirs (i.e. the architectural choir).\nPius established the first World Migrant Day in 1914, now the World Day of Migrants and Refugees.\nIn the Prophecy of St. Malachy, the collection of 112 prophecies about the popes, Pius X appears as \"Ignis Ardens\" or \"Ardent Fire\".\nOpposition to Zionism.\nOn 26 January 1904, Pius X received the founder of Zionism Theodor Herzl in an audience; Herzl had hoped to convince the Vatican to support his movement. Pius X was respectful towards Herzl, but would not support the establishment of a modern State of Israel, citing the refusal of the Jewish people to acknowledge Jesus as the biblical Messiah.\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nPius X beatified a total of 131 individuals (including groups of martyrs and those by recognition of \"cultus\") and canonized four. Those beatified during his pontificate included Marie-Genevi\u00e8ve Meunier (1906), Rose-Chr\u00e9tien de la Neuville (1906), Valentin de Berriochoa (1906), Clair of Nantes (1907), Zdislava Berka (1907), John of Ruysbroeck (1908), Andrew Nam Thung (1909), Agatha Lin (1909), Agnes De (1909), Joan of Arc (1909), and John Eudes (1909). Those canonized by him were Alexander Sauli (1904), Gerard Majella (1904), Clement Mary Hofbauer (1909), and Joseph Oriol (1909).\nIn 1908 Pope Pius X named John Chrysostom a patron saint of preachers.\nConsistories.\nPius X created 50 cardinals in seven consistories held during his pontificate which included noted figures of the Church during that time such as D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Joseph Mercier (1907) and Pietro Gasparri (1907). In 1911, he increased American representation in the cardinalate based on the fact that the United States was expanding; the Pope also named one cardinal \"in pectore\" (Ant\u00f3nio Mendes Belo, whom the media accurately speculated on) in 1911 whose name he later revealed in 1914. Pius X also named as a cardinal Giacomo della Chiesa, his immediate successor, Pope Benedict XV.\nAmong the cardinals whom he nominated came the first Brazilian-born (and the first Latin American-born; Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti) and the first from the Netherlands (Willem Marinus van Rossum) since 1523. The consistory of 1911 was the largest number of cardinals elevated at a single consistory in roughly a century.\nIn 1911, the Pope reportedly wished to elevate Diomede Panici to the cardinalate; however, Panici died before the promotion ever took place. Furthermore, this came after Panici was originally considered but passed for the elevation by Pope Leo XIII who even had considered elevating Panici's brother. In the 1914 consistory, Pius X considered naming the Capuchin friar Armando Pietro Sabadel to the cardinalate; however, Sabadel declined the Pope's invitation.\nDeath and burial.\nIn 1913, Pope Pius X suffered a heart attack, and subsequently lived in the shadow of poor health. In 1914, the Pope fell ill on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August 1914); it was an illness from which he would not recover, and it was reported that he suffered from a fever and lung complications. His condition was worsened by the events leading to the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), which reportedly sent the 79-year-old into a state of melancholy.\nWhile the Pope's condition was classified as serious, alarming symptoms did not develop until 19 August. While Pius X spent most of that day in and out of consciousness, he said at one stage, \"In ancient times, the Pope by a word might have stayed the slaughter, but now he is impotent\". The Pope shortly after received the Last Rites and eventually, an old bronchial infection that the Pope had previously had in years past returned, further hastening his decline. The disease which he had been suffering extended to the bronchial tree resulting in pneumonia that killed him.\nHe died at 1:20am on Thursday, 20 August 1914, only a few hours after the death of Jesuit leader Franz Xavier Wernz, and on the very day when German forces marched into Brussels. In a moment of lucidity just moments before he died, Pius X is reported to have said: \"Now I begin to think the end is approaching. The Almighty in His inexhaustible goodness wishes to spare me the horrors which Europe is undergoing\". His sister, Anna, was praying at his bedside when Pius X died. The Pope's last act of life was to kiss the little crucifix that he had clasped in his hands at around 1:15am.\nPius X was buried in a simple and unadorned tomb in the crypt below Saint Peter's Basilica. His body was laid in state on 21 August in red pontifical vestments and then interred following the Requiem Mass following his coffin lying in state on a large catafalque in the Sistine Chapel. His original tombstone bore the inscription: \"Pope Pius X, poor and yet rich, gentle and humble of heart, unconquerable champion of the Catholic Faith, whose constant endeavor it was to renew all things in Christ\". Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this in his burial and successive popes have continued this tradition. Pius X's tomb is located near the tombs of both Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II under the altar of the Presentation.\nHe is succeeded by Giacomo della Chiesa, who was known as Pope Benedict XV.\nExhumation.\nOn 19 May 1944, the body of Pius X was exhumed for inspection as part of the beatification process, during which the remains were found to be miraculously incorrupt. In 1959, the remains of the late pope were sent, with the permission of Pope John XXIII (himself a former Patriarch of Venice), to Venice. Before the remains were taken to Venice via a train on 11 April, Pope John XXIII led a small prayer service alongside some other cardinals. The body was exposed for the veneration of the faithful at St Mark's Basilica for one month (12 April\u201310 May) before it was returned to the late pope's original resting place, with Cardinal Giovanni Urbani acting as the papal legate for the month-long event.\nCanonization.\nAlthough Pius X's canonization took place in 1954, the events leading up to it began immediately with his death. A letter of 24 September 1916 by Monsignor Leo, Bishop of Nicotera and Tropea, referred to Pius X as \"a great Saint and a great Pope.\" To accommodate the large number of pilgrims seeking access to his tomb, more than the crypt would hold, \"a small metal cross was set into the floor of the basilica,\" which read \"Pius Papa X\", \"so that the faithful might kneel down directly above the tomb\". Masses were held near his tomb until 1930.\nDevotion to Pius X between the two world wars remained high. On 14 February 1923, in honor of the 20th anniversary of his accession to the papacy, the first moves toward his canonization began with the formal appointment of those who would carry out his cause. The event was marked by the erecting of a monument in his memory in St. Peter's Basilica. On 19 August 1939, Pope Pius XII (1939\u201358) delivered a tribute to Pius X at Castel Gandolfo. On 12 February 1943, a further development of Pius X's cause was achieved, when he was declared to have displayed heroic virtues, gaining therefore the title \"Venerable\".\nOn 19 May 1944, Pius X's coffin was exhumed and was taken to the Chapel of the Holy Crucifix in St. Peter's Basilica for the canonical examination.\nUpon opening the coffin, the examiners found the body of Pius X remarkably well preserved, despite the fact that he had died 30 years before and had made wishes not to be embalmed. According to Jerome Dai-Gal, \"all of the body\" of Pius X \"was in an excellent state of conservation\". At the canonical recognition of his mortal body were present the Italian cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Nicola Canali.\nAfter the examination and the end of the apostolic process towards Pius X's cause, Pius XII bestowed the title of Venerable Servant of God upon Pius X. His body was exposed for 45 days (Rome was liberated by the Allies during this time), before being placed back in his tomb.\nFollowing this, the process towards beatification began, and investigations by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (SCR) into miracles performed by intercessory work of Pius X took place. The SCR would eventually recognize two miracles. The first involved Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Deperras, a nun who had bone cancer and was cured on 7 December 1928 during a novena in which a relic of Pius X was placed on her chest. The second involved the nun Benedetta De Maria, who had cancer, and in a novena started in 1938, she eventually touched a relic statue of Pius X and was cured.\nPope Pius XII officially approved the two miracles on 11 February 1951; and on 4 March, Pius XII, in his \"De Tuto\", declared that the Church could continue in the beatification of Pius X. His beatification took place on 3 June 1951 at St. Peter's before 23 cardinals, hundreds of bishops and archbishops, and a crowd of 100,000 faithful. During his beatification decree, Pius XII referred to Pius X as \"Pope of the Eucharist\", in honor of Pius X's expansion of the rite to children.\nThe cause for Pius X's canonization was opened on 24 November 1951. On 17 February 1952, Pius X's body was transferred from its tomb to the Vatican basilica and placed under the altar of the Chapel of the Presentation in St. Peter's Basilica. The pontiff's body lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see.\nOn 29 May 1954, less than three years after his beatification, Pius X was canonized, following the SCR's recognition of two more miracles. The first involved Francesco Belsami, an attorney from Naples who had a pulmonary abscess, who was cured upon placing a picture of Pope Pius X upon his chest. The second miracle involved Sr. Maria Ludovica Scorcia, a nun who was afflicted with a serious neurotropic virus, and who, upon several novenas, was entirely cured. The canonization Mass was presided over by Pius XII at Saint Peter's Basilica before a crowd of about 800,000 of the faithful and Church officials at St. Peter's Basilica. Pius X became the first pope to be canonized since Pius V in 1712.\nHis canonization ceremony was taped and recorded by television news broadcasters, including NBC.\nPrayer cards often depict the sanctified pontiff with instruments of Holy Communion. In addition to being celebrated as the \"Pope of the Blessed Sacrament\", Pius X is also the patron saint of emigrants from Treviso. He is honored in numerous parishes in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and the United States.\nThe number of parishes, schools, seminaries and retreat houses named after him in Western countries is very large, partly because he was very well known, and his beatification and canonization in the early 1950s was during a period of time following World War II when there was a great deal of new construction in cities and population growth in the era of the baby boom, thus leading to Catholic institutional expansion that correlated with the growing society.\nPius X's feast day was assigned in 1955 to 3 September, to be celebrated as a Double. It remained thus for 15 years. In the 1960 calendar, the rank was changed to Third-Class Feast. The rank in the General Roman Calendar since 1969 is that of Memorial and the feast day is obligatorily celebrated on 21 August, closer to the day of his death (20 August, impeded by the feast day of St Bernard).\nThe Confraternity of Christian Doctrine was a big supporter of his canonization, partly because he had ordained the need for its existence in every diocese and because it had received a great deal of episcopal criticism, and it was thought that by canonizing the Pope who gave them their mandate, this would help inoculate against this criticism. They initiated a prayer crusade for his canonization that achieved the participation of over two million names.\nAfter the Pope's canonization, another miracle is said to have taken place when a Christian family activist named Clem Lane suffered a major heart attack and was placed in an oxygen tent, where he was given extreme unction. A relic of the Pope was placed over his tent, and he recovered to the great surprise of his doctors. A sister of Loretto at Webster College in St Louis, Missouri, claimed that her priest brother had been cured through the Pope's intercession as well.\nPapal coat of arms.\nThe personal papal arms of Pius X are composed of the traditional elements of all papal heraldry before Pope Benedict XVI: the shield, the papal tiara, and the keys, symbolizing papal authority.\nThe shield is charged in two parts, as it is \"per fess\". In upper shield (\"chief\") shows the arms of the Patriarch of Venice, which was Pius X's see from 1893 to 1903. It consists of the Lion of Saint Mark proper and haloed in silver upon a silver-white background, displaying a book with the inscription of \"\" on the left page and \"\" on the right page. This means \"Peace to you, Mark, my evangelist\", the motto of Venice as the final resting place of Mark the Evangelist; however, the arms of the Republic of Venice have red background. Previous Patriarchs of Venice had combined their personal arms with these arms of the Patriarchate. The same \"chief\" can be seen in the arms of the later popes who were Patriarchs of Venice upon election to the See of Rome, John XXIII and John Paul I. Renditions of this part of Pius X's arms depict the lion either with or without a sword, and sometimes only one side of the book is written on.\nThe lower shield displays the arms of Pius X as Bishop of Mantua: an anchor proper cast into a stormy sea (the blue and silver wavy lines), lit up by a single six-pointed star of gold. These were inspired by Hebrews Chapter 6, Versicle 19, (English: \"The hope we have is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul\") Bishop Sarto had said, \"hope is the sole companion of my life, the greatest support in uncertainty, the strongest power in situations of weakness.\"\nAlthough not present upon his arms, the most famous motto of Pius X was: \"Instaurare omnia in Christo\" (English: \"To restore all things in Christ\"), allegedly his last words before his death.\nIn fiction.\nThe life of Pope Pius X is depicted in the 1951 movie \"Gli uomini non-guardano il cielo\" by Umberto Scarpelli. The movie is centered on the year 1914, as the Pope grieves over the threat that is incumbent and is consoled by his nephew.\nA satirical depiction of Pope Pius X is presented in Flann O'Brien's novel \"The Hard Life\", as the Irish characters travel from Dublin to Rome and gain a personal interview with the Pope, which ends very badly.\nIn poetry.\nIn the poem \"Zone\" by Guillaume Apollinaire, Pope Pius X is referred to as , the most modern European.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Gelasius was a prolific author whose style placed him on the cusp between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Some scholars have argued that his predecessor Felix III may have employed him to draft papal documents, although this is not certain.\nDuring his pontificate he called for strict Catholic orthodoxy, more assertively demanded obedience to papal authority, and, consequently, increased the tension between the Western and Eastern Churches. Surprisingly, he also had cordial relations with the Ostrogoths, who were Arians (i.e., Non-trinitarian Christians), and therefore perceived as heretics from the perspective of Nicene Christians.\nPlace of birth.\nThere is some confusion regarding where Gelasius was born: according to the \"Liber Pontificalis\" he was born in the Roman province of Africa (present-day Tunisia), referred to as \"natione Afer\", while in a letter addressed to the Roman Emperor Anastasius he stated that he was \"born a Roman\" (\"Romanus natus\").

Conant opined that the latter assertion probably merely denotes that he was born in Roman Africa before the Vandals invaded it.\nAcacian schism.\nThe papal election of Gelasius on 1 March 492 was a gesture of continuity: Gelasius inherited the conflicts of Pope Felix III with Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius and the patriarch of Constantinople and exacerbated them by insisting on the obliteration of the name of the deceased Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople from the diptychs, in spite of every ecumenical gesture offered by the contemporaneous Patriarch Euphemius.\nThe split with the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople was inevitable, from the Western view, because they considered the Monophysite view of Jesus Christ having only a Divine nature a heresy. Gelasius authored the book \"De duabus in Christo naturis\" (\"On the dual nature of Christ\"), which described Catholic doctrine in the matter. Thus Gelasius, for all the conservative Latinity of his style of writing, was on the cusp of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages.\nDuring the Acacian schism, Gelasius advocated the primacy of the See of Rome over the universal Church, both East and West, and he presented this doctrine in terms that became the model for successive popes, who also claimed papal supremacy because of their succession to the papacy from the first supreme pontiff, Peter the Apostle.\nIn 494, Gelasius authored the very influential letter \"Duo sunt\" to Anastasius on the subject of the relation of Church and state, which letter had political impact for more than a millennium: Pope Gregory XVI quoted from it in his letter to the Swiss clergy, \"Commissum divinitus\" (17 May 1835), responding to the Baden articles, which gave some of the Swiss cantons authority over church matters including the sacraments.\nSuppression of the Lupercalia.\nCloser to home, after a long contest Gelasius finally suppressed the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia, which had persisted for several generations among a nominally Christian population. Gelasius' letter to the senator Andromachus treated the primary contentions of the controversy and incidentally provided some details of the festival, which combined fertility and purification, that might have been lost otherwise. \nAlthough the Lupercalia was a festival of purification, which had given its name \"\"dies februatus\", from \"februare\"\" (\"to purify\"), to the month of February, it was unrelated to the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also commonly denominated \"Candlemas\", which latter feast commemorates the fulfillment of the Holy Family's ceremonial obligations pursuant to Mosaic law 40 days after the birth of the first son. In the instance of the Holy Family, that occurred 40 days after Christmas, on 2 February.\nDeath.\nAfter a brief yet dynamic ministry, Gelasius died on 21 November 496. His feast day is 21 November.\nWorks.\nGelasius was one of the most prolific authors of the early bishops of Rome. Over 100 Gelasian letters survive, although 49 of these are fragmentary, some as short as several lines. 6 treatises are extant that bear the name of Gelasius. According to Cassiodorus, the reputation of Gelasius attracted to his name other works not by him. Although his dogmatic letters connected to the Acacian Schism were widely circulated in late antiquity, and have been the focus of much scholarly interest, the majority of Gelasius' letters were in fact concerned with the administration of the church of suburbicarian Italy.\n\"Decretum Gelasianum\".\nThe most famous of pseudo-Gelasian works is the list \"De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis\" (\"On books to be received and not to be received\"), also denominated the \"Decretum Gelasianum\", which is believed to be connected to the pressure for orthodoxy during his pontificate and intended to be read as a decretal by Gelasius on the canonical and apocryphal books, which internal evidence reveals to be of later date. Thus the determination of the canon of Sacred Scripture has traditionally been attributed to Gelasius.\n\"Gelasian Sacramentary\".\nIn the Latin Catholic tradition, the pseudo \"Gelasian Sacramentary\" is in fact a liturgical book that was derived from Roman sources and transcribed, with inclusion of native Gallican liturgical elements, near Paris in the middle of the 8th century. While including the texts of some prayers that Gelasius composed, he was not a principal author or compiler of the book. The manuscript (Vatican, Vatican Library, Reg. lat. 316 + Paris, National Library, ms. lat. 7193, fol. 41\u201356) is actually titled the \"Liber sacramentorum Romanae ecclesiae\" (\"Book of Sacraments of the Roman Church\").\nThe attribution to Gelasius is premised in part at least on the chronicle of the Supreme Pontiffs that is denominated the \"Liber Pontificalis\", which states of Gelasius that he \"fecit etiam et sacramentorum praefationes et orationes cauto sermone et epistulas fidei delimato sermone multas\" (\"he also made prefaces to the sacraments and prayers in careful language and many epistles in polished language regarding the faith\"). An old tradition linked the book to Gelasius, apparently based on the ascription of Walafrid Strabo to him of what evidently is this book.\nLegacy.\nCardinal Giuseppe Maria Tomasi quoted a portion of a missal that was attributed to Gelasius in the Mass that was entitled 'Contra obloquentes' and published it. The section read: Grant, We beseech Thee, O Lord, that we do not trouble ourselves about the contradiction of spurious minds, but once that very wickedness has been spurned let us pray that you suffer us neither to be frightened by the unjust criticisms, nor to be attracted to the insidious flatteries, but rather to love that which Thou dost command ... In 1751, Pope Benedict XIV published this quotation within his Apostolic Constitution \"Providas\" that attacked freemasonry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterature.\nThe primary source for the biography of Pope Saint Gelasius I, beside the \"Liber Pontificalis\", is a \"vita\" written by Cassiodorus' pupil Dionysius Exiguus."}

He was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria's reign. In 1829 he was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". He published his first solo collection of poems, \"Poems, Chiefly Lyrical\", in 1830. \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana\", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his poems ultimately proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\nTennyson also focused on short lyrics, such as \"Break, Break, Break\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\", and \"Crossing the Bar\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as \"Ulysses\" and \"The Lotos-Eaters\". \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote notable blank verse, including \"Idylls of the King\", \"Ulysses\", and \"Tithonus\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\nA number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplace in the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" (\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\"), \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAlfred Tennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England. He was born into a successful middle-class family of minor landowning status distantly descended from John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers, and Francis Leke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale. His father, George Clayton Tennyson, was an Anglican clergyman who served as rector of Somersby (1807\u20131831), also rector of Benniworth (1802\u20131831) and Bag Enderby, and vicar of Grimsby (1815). He raised a large family and \"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman, and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at Mablethorpe and Skegness on the eastern coast of England\". George Clayton Tennyson was the elder son of the attorney and member of Parliament George Tennyson, JP, DL, of Bayons Manor and Usselby Hall, who had also inherited the estates of his mother's family, the Claytons, and married Mary, daughter and heiress of John Turner, of Caistor, Lincolnshire. George Clayton Tennyson was however pushed into a career in the church and passed over as heir in favour of his younger brother Charles. Their mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Stephen Fytche, vicar of St James' Church, Louth (1764), and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between Horncastle and Louth. Tennyson's father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".\nTennyson, recalling the poetic influences of his youth, said, \"as a boy I was an enormous admirer of Byron.\" Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens, and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was 17. One of those brothers, Charles Tennyson Turner, later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's future wife; the other was Frederick Tennyson. Another of Tennyson's brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.\nThe psychologist William James, in his book \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\", quoted Tennyson concerning a type of experience with which Tennyson was familiar: A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has often come upon me through repeating my own name. All at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this was not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the sure, utterly beyond words\u2026\nEducation and first publication.\nTennyson was a student of King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth, from 1816 to 1820. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles. A portrait of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts is in Trinity's collection.\nAt Cambridge, he met Arthur Hallam and William Henry Brookfield, who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of \"his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles\" entitled \"Poems by Two Brothers\", published in 1827.\nIn 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". Reportedly, \"it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor's gold medal\". He published his first solo collection of poems, \"Poems Chiefly Lyrical\" in 1830. \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana\", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nReturn to Lincolnshire, second publication, Epping Forest.\nIn the spring of 1831, Tennyson's father died, requiring him to leave Cambridge before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. Arthur Hallam came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson's sister, Emilia Tennyson.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThe May Queen\nYOU must wake and call me early, call me early, \n mother dear;\nTo-morrow 'll be the happiest time of all the glad \n new-year, \u2013\nOf all the glad new-year, mother, the maddest, \n merriest day;\nFor I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to \n be Queen o' the May.\nAs I came up the valley, whom think ye should \n I see\nBut Robin leaning on the bridge beneath the \n hazel-tree?\nHe thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave \n him yesterday, \u2013\nBut I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to \n be Queen o' the May.\nThey say he's dying all for love, \u2013 but that can \n never be;\nThey say his heart is breaking, mother, \u2013 what \n is that to me?\nThere's many a bolder lad 'll woo me any sum-\n mer day;\nAnd I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to \n be Queen o' the May.\nIf I can, I'll come again, mother, from out my \n resting-place;\nThough you'll not see me, mother, I shall look \n upon your face;\nThough I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken \n what you say,\nAnd be often, often with you when you think I'm \n far away. \nSo now I think my time is near; I trust it is. \n I know\nThe blessed music went that way my soul will \n have to go.\nAnd for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day;\nBut Effie, you must comfort her when I am past \n away.\nAnd say to Robin a kind word, and tell him not \n to fret;\nThere's many worthier than I, would make him \n happy yet.\nIf I had lived \u2013 I cannot tell \u2013 I might have \n been his wife;\nBut all these things have ceased to be, with my \n desire of life.\nForever and forever, all in a blessed home,\nAnd there to wait a little while till you and \n Effie come, \u2013\nTo lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your \n breast, \u2013\nAnd the wicked cease from troubling, and the \n weary are at rest.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"From \"The May Queen\" poem by Alfred Tennyson\"\nIn 1833, Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of \"The Lady of Shalott\". The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while on a holiday in Vienna. Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In the Valley of Cauteretz\" and \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\", a long poem detailing the \"Way of the Soul\".\nTennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson's son recalled: \"there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...\". Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. According to Tennyson's grandson Sir Charles Tennyson, Tennyson met Thomas Carlyle in 1839, if not earlier. The pair began a lifelong friendship, and were famous smoking companions. Some of Tennyson's work even bears the influence of Carlyle and his ideas. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham.\nThird publication.\nOn 14 May 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two-volume \"Poems\", of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as \"Locksley Hall\", \"Break, Break, Break\", and \"Ulysses\", and a new version of \"The Lady of Shalott\", have met enduring fame. \"The Princess: A Medley\", a satire on women's education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. W. S. Gilbert later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in \"The Princess\" (1870) and in \"Princess Ida\" (1884).\nIt was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\", dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, succeeding William Wordsworth. In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married Emily Sellwood, whom he had known since childhood, in the village of Shiplake. They had two sons, Hallam Tennyson (b.\u00a011 August 1852)\u2014named after his friend\u2014and Lionel (b.\u00a016 March 1854).\nTennyson rented Farringford House on the Isle of Wight in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856. He eventually found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to Aldworth, in West Sussex in 1869. However, he retained Farringford and regularly returned there to spend the winters.\nPoet Laureate.\nIn 1850, after Wordsworth's death and Samuel Rogers' refusal, Tennyson was appointed Poet Laureate; Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Leigh Hunt had also been considered. He held the position until his death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position, such as by authoring a poem of greeting to Princess Alexandra of Denmark when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King Edward VII. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in an ill-advised charge on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. Other works written in the post of Poet Laureate include \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition\".\nTennyson declined a baronetcy offered him by Benjamin Disraeli in 1865 and 1868, finally accepting a peerage in 1883 at William Ewart Gladstone's earnest solicitation. In 1884 Queen Victoria created him Baron Tennyson, of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884.\nTennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose \"Form, Riflemen, Form\", on the French crisis of 1859 and the Creation of the Volunteer Force, to \"Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering\", deploring Gladstone's Home Rule Bill. Tennyson's family were Whigs by tradition and Tennyson's own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the Liberal Party after the Whigs dissolved. Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. Upon passage of the Reform Act 1832, Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration.\nVirginia Woolf wrote a play called \"Freshwater\", showing Tennyson as host to his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and G. F. Watts. \nTowards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his \"religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism\": In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief. He wrote in \"In Memoriam\": \"There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.\" In \"Maud\", 1855, he wrote: \"The churches have killed their Christ\". In \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\", Tennyson wrote: \"Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate.\" In his play \"Becket\", he wrote: \"We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven\". Tennyson recorded in his \"Diary\" (p.\u00a0127): \"I believe in Pantheism of a sort\". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Baruch Spinoza on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, \"His view of God is in some ways mine\", in 1892.\nTennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth, aged 83. He was buried at Westminster Abbey. A memorial was erected in All Saints' Church, Freshwater. His last words were, \"Oh that press will have me now!\". He left an estate of \u00a357,206. Tennyson Down and the Tennyson Trail on the Isle of Wight are named after him, and a monument to him stands on top of Tennyson Down. Lake Tennyson in New Zealand's high country, named by Frederick Weld, is assumed to be named after Tennyson.\nHe was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son Hallam, who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second Governor-General of Australia.\nTennyson and the Queen.\nAlthough Albert, Prince Consort, was largely responsible for Tennyson's appointment as Laureate, Queen Victoria became an ardent admirer of Tennyson's work, writing in her diary that she was \"much soothed &amp; pleased\" by reading \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" after Albert's death.\nThe two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, \"very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair &amp; a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him.\"\nTennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" had been.\nThe art of Tennyson's poetry.\nAs source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter, from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of John Keats and other Romantic poets published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of \"Break, Break, Break\" emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of \"I come from haunts of coot and hern\" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of \"Come down O maid from yonder mountain height\" illustrate his telling combination of onomatopoeia, alliteration, and assonance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary Robert Browning as \"insane\", symptomatic of \"mental infirmity\". His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and words, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of metre; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the quantitative metres of Greek and Latin poetry to English. He reflects the Victorian period of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among Victorian writers in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his \"Englishness\" and his masculinity. Well-known among his longer works are \"Maud\" and \"Idylls of the King\", the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including \"Mariana\", \"The Lotos Eaters\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\", \"In Memoriam\"), possibly reflecting Tennyson's lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. T. S. Eliot described Tennyson as \"the saddest of all English poets\", whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a \"surface\" to his poetry's \"depths, to the abyss of sorrow\". Other poets such as W. H. Auden maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the \"stupidest\" of all the English poets, adding that: \"There was little about melancholia he didn't know; there was little else that he did.\"\nInfluence on Pre-Raphaelite artists.\nTennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848 Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of \"Immortals\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including John Keats and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings. \"The Lady of Shalott\" alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt, John William Waterhouse (three versions), and Elizabeth Siddal.\nTennyson heraldry.\nA heraldic achievement of Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge, showing arms: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Gules, a bend nebuly or thereon a chaplet vert between three leopard's faces jessant-de-lys of the second\"; Crest: \"A dexter arm in armour the hand in a gauntlet or grasping a broken tilting spear enfiled with a garland of laurel\"; Supporters: \"Two leopards rampant guardant gules sem\u00e9e de lys and ducally crowned or\"; Motto: \"Respiciens Prospiciens\" (\"Looking backwards (is) looking forwards\").\nThese are a difference of the arms of Thomas Tenison (1636\u20131715), Archbishop of Canterbury, themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century Denys family of Glamorgan and Siston in Gloucestershire, themselves a difference of the arms of Thomas de Cantilupe (c. 1218\u20131282), Bishop of Hereford, henceforth the arms of the See of Hereford; the name \"Tennyson\" signifies \"Denys's son\", although no connection between the two families is recorded.\nWorks.\nA list of works by Tennyson follows:\nMusical settings.\nMichael William Balfe's setting of \"Come Into the Garden, Maud\" was a popular success in 1857, as sung by the celebrated tenor Sims Reeves. Arthur Somervell's \"Maud\" (1898) used thirteen poems (not all of them complete) for his song cycle, enough \"to retain a cogent narrative\". Stephen Banfield believes it is \"the nearest an English composer ever came to writing a substantial, Romantic song-cycle\".\nCharles Villiers Stanford set \"Crossing the Bar\" for high voice and piano in April 1880, a year after the poem has been first published. Maude Val\u00e9rie White (four songs, 1885) and Liza Lehmann (10 songs, 1899) both composed song cycles selecting passages from \"In Memoriam\". Roger Quilter set \"Now sleeps the crimson petal\" (from \"The Princess\") for voice and orchestra in 1905. \"The splendour falls on castle walls\" (also from \"The Princess\"), has been set by many composers, including Arnold Bax, Benjamin Britten, Cecil Armstrong Gibbs, Gustav Holst, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Charles Wood. Tennyson deplored the use of unauthorised repetition in song settings, a device used by many composers, and so tried to circumvent this by supplying his own, as in \"Break, Break, Break\" (set by Sidney Lanier in 1871 and Cyril Rootham in 1906), and the repetition of \"dying\" in \"The splendour falls\", which as Trevor Hold points out, \"has been a god-send to every composer who has set it\".\nPopular culture.\nTennyson's \"Ulysses\" was quoted in the 2012 James Bond film \"Skyfall\", with the character M (played by actress Judi Dench) reciting the poem. The film's soundtrack also included an accompanying track, composed by Thomas Newman, that is titled \"Tennyson\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The exact definition and reference datum varies according to the context (e.g., aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, or atmospheric pressure). Although the term \"altitude\" is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.\nIn aviation, altitude is typically measured relative to mean sea level or above ground level to ensure safe navigation and flight operations. In geometry and geographical surveys, altitude helps create accurate topographic maps and understand the terrain's elevation. For high-altitude trekking and sports, knowing and adapting to altitude is vital for performance and safety. Higher altitudes mean reduced oxygen levels, which can lead to altitude sickness if proper acclimatization measures are not taken.\nVertical distance measurements in the \"down\" direction are commonly referred to as \"depth\".\nAviation.\nThe term \"altitude\" can have several meanings, and is always qualified by explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. \"true altitude\"), or implicitly through the context of the communication. Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.\nAviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum.\nPressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30\u00a0m) is the flight level, and is used above the transition altitude ( in the US, but may be as low as in other jurisdictions). So when the altimeter reads the country-specific flight level on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at \"Flight level XXX/100\" (where XXX is the transition altitude). When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92\u00a0inHg or 1013.25\u00a0hPa).\nOn the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter, which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.\nThere are several types of altitude in aviation:\nThese types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:\nAtmospheric studies.\nAtmospheric layers.\nThe Earth's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions. These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles. The altitudes stated below are averages:\nThe K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, at an altitude of above sea level, by convention defines represents the demarcation between the atmosphere and space. The thermosphere and exosphere (along with the higher parts of the mesosphere) are regions of the atmosphere that are conventionally defined as space.\nHigh altitude and low pressure.\nRegions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at above sea level.\nAt high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.\nTemperature profile.\nThe temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly , and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.\nHowever, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8\u00a0\u00b0C per kilometer (or per 1000\u00a0feet) of altitude.\nThe presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5\u00a0\u00b0C per kilometer or per 1000\u00a0feet).\nAs an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49\u00a0\u00b0C per kilometer (3.56\u00a0\u00b0F per 1,000\u00a0feet). The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.\nFinally, only the troposphere (up to approximately of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes notable convection; in the stratosphere, there is little vertical convection.\nHumans.\nMedicine recognizes that altitudes above start to affect humans, and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above for more than two years. As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen. The lack of oxygen above can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema. The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry. It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude. However, above , (in the \"death zone\"), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible.\nThere is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes. Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia.\nHowever, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.\nAthletes.\nFor athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance. For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than with the letter \"A\".\nAthletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming.\nOther organisms.\nDecreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.\nThere is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures. These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity.\nHowever, some species, such as birds, thrive at high altitude. Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold economically liberal positions, while economic nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade.\nMost nations are today members of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade agreements. States can unilaterally reduce regulations and duties on imports and exports, as well as form bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Free trade areas between groups of countries, such as the European Economic Area and the Mercosur open markets, establish a free trade zone among members while creating a protectionist barrier between that free trade area and the rest of the world. Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas, taxes and non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the 1973 oil crisis). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.\nEconomists are generally supportive of free trade. There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth and economic stability. However, in the short run, liberalization of trade can cause unequally distributed losses and the economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.\nEconomics.\nEconomic models.\nTwo simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota. An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.\nMost economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist Ha-Joon Chang, a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system. Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.\nIf the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries, it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as import substitution industrialization, is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.\nTariffs.\nThe chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market and hence in the domestic market is Pworld. The tariff increases the domestic price to Ptariff. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from QS1 to QS2 and causes domestic consumption to decline from QC1 to QC2.\nThis has three effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.\nAn almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.\nSometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the gains from free trade are larger than the losses.\nA 2021 study found that across 151 countries over the period 1963\u20132014, \"tariff increases are associated with persistent, economically and statistically significant declines in domestic output and productivity, as well as higher unemployment and inequality, real exchange rate appreciation, and insignificant changes to the trade balance.\"\nTechnology and innovation.\nEconomic models indicate that free trade leads to greater technology adoption and innovation.\nProductivity and welfare.\nA 2023 study in \"Journal of Political Economy\" found that reductions in trade costs since 1980 caused increases in agricultural productivity, food consumption and welfare across the world. The welfare gains were particularly large in some developing countries.\nTrade diversion.\nAccording to mainstream economics theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to economic inefficiency through the process of trade diversion. It is efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This reason is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the Doha Round.\nOpinions.\nEconomist opinions.\nThe literature analyzing the economics of free trade is rich. Economists have done extensive work on the theoretical and empirical effects of free trade. Although it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade provides a net gain for society. In a 2006 survey of American economists (83 responders), \"87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade\" and \"90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries\".\nQuoting Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, \"Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards\". In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that \"freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment\".\nPaul Krugman stated that free trade is greatly beneficial to the world as a whole, and especially beneficial to people in poorer nations, since it allows them to increase their standards of living. He also stated in 2007 that, as the US trades more with less-industrialized countries whose workers are paid less than equivalent US workers (2007 wages in Mexico were 1/10 what they were in the US, and in China less than 1/20), increased trade with those countries will put downward pressure on unskilled labor rates in the US.\nPublic opinions.\nAn overwhelming number of people internationally \u2013 both in developed and developing countries \u2013 support trade with other countries, but are more split when it comes to whether or not they believe trade creates jobs, increases wages, and decreases prices. The median belief in advanced economies is that trade increases wages, with 31 percent of people believing it does, compared to 27 percent who believe it does not. In emerging economies, 47 percent of people believe trade increases wages, compared to 20 percent who says it lowers wages. There is a positive relationship of 0.66 between the average GDP growth rate for the years 2014 to 2017 and the percentage of people in a given country that say trade increases wages. Most people, in both advanced and emerging economies, believe that trade increases prices. 35 percent of people in advanced economies and 56 percent in emerging economies believe trade increases prices, and 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively, believe that trade lowers prices. Those with a higher level of education are more likely than those with less education to believe that trade lowers prices.\nHistory.\nEarly era.\nThe notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in 16th century Imperial Spain. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria was \"the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas\". Vitoria made the case under principles of \"jus gentium\". However, it was two early British economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form.\nEconomists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically. For example, Smith pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt, Greece and Rome, but also of Bengal (East India) and China. Netherlands prospered greatly after throwing off Spanish Imperial rule and pursuing a policy of free trade. This made the free trade/mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries. Free trade policies have battled with mercantilist, protectionist, isolationist, socialist, populist and other policies over the centuries.\nThe Ottoman Empire had liberal free trade policies by the 18th century, with origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673, in 1740 which lowered duties to only 3% for imports and exports and in 1790. Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade such as J. R. McCulloch in his \"Dictionary of Commerce\" (1834), but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as \"an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition\" in the 1846 Corn Laws debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been \"some of the finest manufactures of the world\" in 1812.\nTrade in colonial America was regulated by the British mercantile system through the Acts of Trade and Navigation. Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced (New England was famous for smuggling), but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the American Revolution. \"The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong\", wrote Dickerson, \"was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders\".\nFree trade came to what would become the United States as a result of the American Revolution. After the British Parliament issued the Prohibitory Act in 1775, blockading colonial ports, the Continental Congress responded by effectively declaring economic independence, opening American ports to foreign trade on 6 April 1776 \u2013 three months before declaring sovereign independence.\nIn March 1801, the Pope Pius VII ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the Papal States with the \"motu proprio\" \"Le pi\u00f9 colte\". Despite this, the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the Papal States.\nIn Britain, free trade became a central principle practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Large-scale agitation was sponsored by the Anti\u2013Corn Law League. Under the Treaty of Nanking, China opened five treaty ports to world trade in 1843. The first free trade agreement, the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty, was put in place in 1860 between Britain and France which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe.\nMany classical liberals, especially in 19th and early 20th century Britain (e.g. John Stuart Mill) and in the United States for much of the 20th century (e.g. Henry Ford and Secretary of State Cordell Hull), believed that free trade promoted peace. Woodrow Wilson included free-trade rhetoric in his \"Fourteen Points\" speech of 1918:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, all we see it, is this: [...]\n3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.\nAccording to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about United States trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. A review by the \"Economist\" of Irwin's 2017 book \"Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy\" notes:\nPolitical dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.\nAccording to Paul Bairoch, since the end of the 18th century, the United States has been \"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the Jeffersonians strongly opposed protectionism. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Alexander Hamilton's themes within the Whig Party under the name American System. The opposition Democratic Party contested several elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry. The Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries. The economist Henry Charles Carey became a leading proponent of the American System of economics. This mercantilist American System was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan.\nThe fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a \"Henry Clay tariff Whig\", strongly opposed free trade and implemented a 44% tariff during the Civil War, in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort and in part to protect favored industries. Congressman William McKinley (later to become President of the United States) introduced tariffs in 1890 which raised the average duty on imports to almost 50%, an increase designed to protect domestic industries and workers from foreign competition, as promised in the Republican platform. It represented protectionism, a policy supported by Republicans and denounced by Democrats. It was a major topic of fierce debate in the 1890 congressional elections, which gave a Democratic landslide. Democrats replaced the McKinley Tariff with the Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act in 1894, which lowered tariff rates.\nDuring the interwar period, economic protectionism took hold in the United States, most famously in the form of the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression. From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.\nPost\u2013World War II.\nSince the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The United States helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later the World Trade Organization, although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s, the International Trade Organization. Since the 1970s, United States governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, and the Dominican Republic\u2013Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006.\nIn Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world.\nModern era.\nMost countries in the world are members of the World Trade Organization which limits in certain ways but does not eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. Most countries are also members of regional free trade areas that lower trade barriers among participating countries. The European Union and the United States are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. in 2018, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership came into force, which includes eleven countries that have borders on the Pacific Ocean.\nDegree of free trade policies.\nFree trade may apply to trade in goods and services. Non-economic considerations may inhibit free trade as a country may espouse free trade in principle but ban certain drugs, such as ethanol, or certain practices, such as prostitution, and limiting international free trade.\nSome degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world. From 1820 to 1980, the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from 11 to 32%. In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%. The American economist C. Fred Bergsten devised the bicycle theory to describe trade policy. According to this model, trade policy is dynamically unstable in that it constantly tends towards either liberalization or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and multilateral trade negotiations must constantly pedal towards greater liberalization. To achieve greater liberalization, decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work as this will both reduce the backlash against globalization and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.\nIn \"Kicking Away the Ladder\", development economist Ha-Joon Chang reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth and notes that many of the now-industrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history. The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the Corn Laws which restricted import of grain in 1846 in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for manufactures only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40\u201350% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century. The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands and to a lesser degree Belgium. Chang describes the export-oriented industrialization policies of the Four Asian Tigers as \"far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents\".\nFree trade in goods.\nThe Global Enabling Trade Report measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destinations. The index summarizes four sub-indexes, namely market access; border administration; transport and communications infrastructure; and business environment. As of 2016, the top 30 countries and areas were the following:\nPolitics.\nAcademics, governments and interest groups debate the relative costs, benefits and beneficiaries of free trade.\nArguments for protectionism fall into the economic category (trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy) or into the moral category (the effects of trade might help the economy but have ill effects in other areas). A general argument against free trade is that it represents neocolonialism in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns about:\nEconomic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories. \nDomestic industries often oppose free trade on the grounds that lower prices for imported goods would reduce their profits and market share. For example, if the United States reduced tariffs on imported sugar, sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits, and sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices. The economic theory of David Ricardo holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose. Since each of the domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little, domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the reduction in tariffs. More generally, producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets.\nSocialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum exploitation of workers by capital. For example, Karl Marx wrote in \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848): \"The bourgeoisie [...] has set up that single, unconscionable freedom \u2013 free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation\". Marx supported free trade, however, solely because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution. He also viewed the tendency to support protectionism out of spite for free trade to be unsound. That is because Marx viewed protectionism as a means for domestic firms to establish \"large-scale\" industry within its borders, which would inevitably make it dependent on the world market so that it could make more revenue for example. He also argues that protectionism does not stop a country from developing a domestic economic system that ironically mirrors competitive free trade.\nMany anti-globalization groups oppose free trade based on their assertion that free-trade agreements generally do not increase the economic freedom of the poor or of the working class and frequently make them poorer.\nSome opponents of free trade favor free-trade theory but oppose free-trade agreements as applied. Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as materially harming the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade \"per se\". For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the United States into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost (dumping) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers.\nResearch shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education. Hainmueller and Hiscox find:\nthat the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena, than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security. This is not to say that the latter types of calculations are not important in shaping individuals' views of trade \u2013 just that they are not being manifest in the simple association between education and support for trade openness A 2017 study found that individuals whose occupations are routine-task-intensive and who do jobs that are offshorable are more likely to favor protectionism.\nResearch suggests that attitudes towards free trade do not necessarily reflect individuals' self-interests.\nColonialism.\nVarious proponents of economic nationalism and of the school of mercantilism have long portrayed free trade as a form of colonialism or imperialism. In the 19th century, such groups criticized British calls for free trade as cover for British Empire, notably in the works of American Henry Clay, architect of the American System.\nFree-trade debates and associated matters involving the colonial administration of Ireland\nhave periodically (such as in 1846 and 1906) caused ructions in the British Conservative (Tory) Party (Corn Law issues in the 1820s to the 1840s, Irish Home Rule issues throughout the 19th and early-20th centuries).\nEcuadorian President Rafael Correa (in office from 2007 to 2017) denounced the \"sophistry of free trade\" in an introduction he wrote for a 2006 book, \"The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords\", which was written in part by Correa's Energy Minister Alberto Acosta. Citing as his source the 2002 book \"Kicking Away the Ladder\" written by Ha-Joon Chang, Correa identified the difference between an \"American system\" opposed to a \"British System\" of free trade. The Americans explicitly viewed the latter, he says, as \"part of the British imperialist system\". According to Correa, Chang showed that Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton (in office 1789\u20131795), rather than List, first presented a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism.\nAlternatives.\nThe following alternatives to free trade have been proposed: protectionism, imperialism, balanced trade, fair trade, and industrial policy.\nUnder balanced trade, nations are required to provide a fairly even reciprocal trade pattern; they cannot run large trade deficits or trade surpluses. Fair trade involves allowing trade but taking into account other interests, such as dirigisme, protecting labor rights, environmentalism, etc.\nProtectionism.\nProtectionism involves tariffs to protect domestic goods and industry from international competition, and to raise government revenue in lieu of other forms of taxation.\nIn 1846, the United Kingdom abolished the Corn Laws (which had restricted import of grain), in response to the famine in Ireland and other domestic pressures over food prices. It also reduced protectionism for manufactures, but only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height. Tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. \nThe United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40\u201350% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century. The 2016 presidential election marked the beginning of the trend of returning to protectionism in the United States, an ideology incorporated into Republican president Donald Trump's platform and largely maintained by his successor Joe Biden.\nImperialism.\nImperialism entails unequal exchange for the benefit of the mother country, often at the expense of the colonies. The imperial trade practices of the British and Spanish Empires were contributing factors to the American Revolution and the Spanish American Wars of Independence.\nBelgium also engaged in unequal exchange, most notoriously in the Congo Free State (CFS) under King Leopold II. In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Berlin Treaty, not only did the CFS become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but Leopold had also been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS.\nIn literature.\nThe value of free trade was first observed and documented in 1776 by Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations\", writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. [...] If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.\nThis statement uses the concept of absolute advantage to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism, the dominant view surrounding trade at the time which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports and thus amass wealth. Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the goods in which they are most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. However, the concept of absolute advantage does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.\nThis theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to David Ricardo, who expanded on it in his 1817 book \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\", it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good, but on the relative opportunity costs of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky.\nExceptionally, Henry George's 1886 book \"Protection or Free Trade\" was read out loud in full into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen. American economist Tyler Cowen wrote that \"Protection or Free Trade\" \"remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day\". Although George is very critical towards protectionism, he discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor:\nWe all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land; we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals, the building of railways, the deepening of harbors, the improvement of steamships as beneficial. But if such things are beneficial, how can tariffs be beneficial? The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities; the effect of tariffs is to increase it. If the protective theory be true, every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased.\nGeorge considers the general free trade argument inadequate. He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class, unless accompanied by a shift towards a \"single tax\" in the form of a land value tax.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a child, she was trained by her father for a future musical career. \nAt the age of eighteen she eloped with the actor Robert Baddeley, then on the stage at Drury Lane. She made her first appearance on 27 April 1765, as Ophelia in \"Hamlet.\" She also played Cordelia in \"King Lear\", Imogen in \"Cymbeline\" and later Olivia in \"Twelfth Night\". In 1769, she joined David Garrick's theatre company when he staged the Stratford Jubilee. In that year she appeared in a Royal Command Performance of The Clandestine Marriage on 12 October. She appeared as Fanny Sterling with Robert as Canton and Thomas King as Lord Ogleby. These three were painted in that role by Johan Zoffany and the painting is now owned by the Garrick Club.\nBaddeley was noted as a talented singer rather than as an actress, she obtained engagements at Ranelagh and Vauxhall Gardens to public acclaim.\nLife as a courtesan.\nAt the height of her success and after separating from her husband in 1770, she discovered that she could sustain herself financially by finding wealthy benefactors and establishing herself as a courtesan to them. Probably her best-known lover was Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne. She was famous for her beauty, and was also noted for her extravagant lifestyle. Her overspending and ultimate failure in managing her finances eventually obliged her to take refuge from her creditors in Dublin, Ireland and later Edinburgh, Scotland. Her benefactors gone, and her own health in decline, she made her last appearance on the stage in Edinburgh in 1785. \nShe died of consumption, aged 41, the following year at her lodging at Shakespeare Square in Edinburgh at the east end of Princes Street.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59214", "revid": "50798191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59214", "title": "Customs", "text": "Government agency which regulates the flow of goods and collects duties\nCustoms is an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal effects, and hazardous items, into and out of a country. Traditionally, customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties (i.e. tariffs) and other taxes on import and export. In recent decades, the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues: taxation, security, and trade facilitation.\nEach country has its own laws and regulations for the import and export of goods into and out of a country, enforced by their respective customs authorities; the import/export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden entirely. A wide range of penalties are faced by those who break these laws.\nOverview.\nTaxation.\nThe traditional function of customs has been the assessment and collection of customs duties, which is a tariff or tax on the importation or, at times, exportation of goods. Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are held in a customs area, often called a bonded store, until processed. Authorized ports are usually recognized customs areas.\nTrade facilitation.\nA more recent objective of customs has been trade facilitation, which is the streamlining of processing of import and export of goods to reduce trade transaction costs. The contemporary understanding of the \u201ctrade facilitation\u201d concept is based on the Recommendation No. 4 of UN/CEFACT \u201cNational Trade Facilitation Bodies\u201d. According to its provisions (para. 14),\nfacilitation covers formalities, procedures, documents and operations related to international trade transactions. Its goals are simplification, harmonization and standardization, so that transactions become easier, faster and more economical than before.\nSecurity.\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States has become the cardinal factor in prompting a significant strengthening of the security component of modern customs operations, after which security-oriented control measures for supply chains have been widely implemented for the aims of preventing risk identification. At airports today, customs functions as the point of no return for all passengers; once passengers have cleared customs, they cannot go back. Anyone arriving at an airport must also clear customs before they can officially enter a country. Those who breach the law will be detained by customs and likely returned to their original location. The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by migration authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements. Border control authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants, and deny the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country.\nThe most complete guidelines for customs security functions implementation is provided in the World Customs Organization Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE), which has had five editions in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2018, respectively.\nPrivatization of customs.\nCustoms is part of one of the three basic functions of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting pre-shipment inspection agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country's customs is obliged to accept the agency's report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry.\nWhile engaging a pre-shipment inspection agency may appear justified in a country with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure has not been able to plug the loophole and protect revenue. It has been found that evasion of customs duty escalated when pre-shipment agencies took over. It has also been alleged that involvement of such agencies has caused shipping delays. Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy. In many countries, import and export data are issued on the basis of national laws (Transparency Laws / \"Freedom of Information Act\").\nThere have, however, been some speed bumps when transitioning customs over from the public to private sector. Factors such as an incompetent private sector, government's reluctance to change the traditional roles of customs, neglecting priority-setting and lack of transparency in the transition process have slowed the rate at which the public to private transition has taken place.\nRed and green channels.\nIn most countries, customs procedures for arriving passengers at major international airports, ports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels. Passengers with goods to declare (carrying goods above the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel, which houses the full-scale customs facilities, while passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel, which only houses a one-way gate. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, so if a passenger goes through a green channel and is found to be in possession of a prohibited item, or failure to declare dutiable items the passenger can be subject to a fine, the item being seized, and in some cases result in an arrest and criminal prosecution. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back to baggage claim; however, there is a connecting corridor between the two channels, to allow customs officials to redirect passengers to the appropriate channel (for example, passengers with an abnormally large amount of luggage may be redirected from the green channel to the red, where they will be inspected to ensure their luggage contains nothing above customs limits).\nThe use of this channel systems enables having a common baggage claim area for domestic and international flights; since domestic passengers, by definition, do not have goods which require a customs declaration, they exit the baggage claim via the green channel, while passengers connecting from an international flight to a domestic one will undergo customs inspection in their final destination, rather than the layover airport.\nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States do not officially operate a red and green channel system; however, some airports have adopted this layout.\nBlue channel.\nAirports in EU countries also have a blue channel. As the EU is a customs union, travellers between EU countries do not have to pay customs duties. Value-added tax (VAT) and excise duties may be applicable if the goods are subsequently sold, but these are collected when the goods are sold, not at the border. Passengers arriving from other EU countries go through the blue channel, where they may still be subject to checks for prohibited or restricted goods. Luggage tickets for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified. In the recent years usage of the blue channel for customs purposes has become limited mostly to flights between the Schengen Area member states of the EU and the remainder of EU member states, while flights which cross the border of neither the customs union nor the Schengen Area are in practice treated as domestic, and therefore, the people travelling on them do not go through customs procedure at all, only passing through the physical facility housing the customs channel to exit the baggage claim.\nRed point phone.\nAll airports in the United Kingdom operate a channel system; however, some airports do not have a red channel, instead having a red point phone which serves the same purpose.\nSummary of basic customs rules.\nEurope.\nThe basic customs law is harmonized across Europe within the European Union Customs Union. This includes customs duties and restrictions. Customs tax typically applies from \u20ac22 to \u20ac150. For more information, see regulations of each member state.\nFor customs declarations in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, the \"Single Administrative Document\" (SAD) is used as a basis.\nGermany.\nUp to \u20ac22, there are no taxes. From \u20ac22 up to \u20ac150, it is necessary to pay VAT (EUSt in Germany), which is 7% or 19% depending on the goods. From \u20ac150 it is necessary to pay VAT and customs.\nRomania.\nCustoms may be very strict, especially for goods shipped from anywhere outside the EU. Up to \u20ac10 goods/package.\nItaly.\nCustoms in Italy takes additional 22% VAT (Value-added tax) for goods imported from outside the European Union even if the VAT is already paid to the origin country sender.\nCzech Republic and Slovakia.\nUp to \u20ac22, there are no taxes. From \u20ac22 up to \u20ac150, it is necessary to pay VAT (DPH in Czech/Slovak), which is 21%. From \u20ac150, it is necessary to pay VAT and customs. Customs may range from zero to 10% depending on the type of imported goods.\nUkraine.\nUkraine has had 5 reforms of its customs authorities. The recent one, in 2019, reorganized State Fiscal Service into the State Customs Service. The reform attempt seeks to digitize customs procedures, get market-level wages, innovate customs checkpoints, integrate into EU customs community, open reference database of customs inspections.\nThe Americas.\nCanada.\nIn 2003, Canada replaced the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency with the current Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA performs searches at Canadian ports of entry and detains illegal immigrants, along with preventing contraband from entering the country. Tariffs are administered under Canada's \"Customs Tariff Act\".\nUnited States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEvery person arriving at a US port of entry is subject to inspection by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers for compliance with immigration, customs and agriculture regulations. This public service is administered on almost a million visitors who enter the US daily. Travelers are screened for a number of prohibited items including; gold, alcoholic beverages, firearms and soil. A wide range of penalties face those non-compliers.\nThe United States imposes tariffs or \"customs duties\" on imports of goods, being 3% on average. The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the importer of record. Individuals arriving in the United States may be exempt from duty on a limited amount of purchases, and on goods temporarily imported (such as laptop computers) under the ATA Carnet system. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product, with duties ranging from zero to 81% of the value of the goods. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and civil and criminal penalties against involved parties. The CBP enforces customs rules. All goods entering the United States are subject to inspection by CBP prior to legal entry.\nUruguay.\nUruguayan Customs place a cap on the importation of personal packages to up to 3 packages of a nominal value of no more than US$200 which can be entered into the country without extra charge. For a package to be included in the 3 free slots, the addressee must register the package with the Uruguayan Postal Service linking the tracking code, their address, national ID number phone and email address. Should a package arrive prior to registration the package must pay the 60% tax and no less than US$10. Any personal package worth more than US$200 or after the 3 free packages, must pay a 60% tax. This severely limits the public's ability to buy products online. Due to Uruguay's small population and market, many popular and specialty products are unavailable in the regular marketplace, forcing Uruguayans to strategically pool several purchases together and max each one of their free slots.\nArgentina.\nCustoms may be very strict. Goods valued up to US$500 brought in by plane and up to US$300 by sea or land are free of duties and taxes, cellphones and laptop computers are duty free regardless of their value only one per passenger, clothing and other personal use items are free of taxes. Above those values, tax is 50% of the value of all acquired goods summed up.\nAsia.\nIndonesia.\nMain article: Directorate General of Customs and Excise\n\"Direktorat Jenderal Bea dan Cukai\" (abbreviated \"Bea Cukai\" or DJBC), works under the Ministry of Finance (Indonesia) and performs various duties relating to the traffic of goods entering or leaving the Customs Area such as the collection of import/export duties, monitoring prohibition and restriction of certain goods, collecting excise and other state levies based on legislation apply. DJBC envisions itself as \"The leading customs and excise institution globally\" and has three missions:\nInternational Customs Day.\nInternational Customs Day recognizes the role of agencies and customs officials in maintaining border security around the world. It focuses on the workers and their working conditions as well as the challenges that some customs officers face in their job. Custom agencies hold employee appreciation events where custom officers are recognized for their work. Several agencies also hold events for the public where they explain their jobs and responsibilities in a transparent manner.\nEach year, at the end of January is celebrated the International Customs Day with a particular theme, as follows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Minnelli is known for her renditions of American standards and is known for her signature songs which include (\"New York, New York\", \"Cabaret\", and \"Maybe This Time\"). Throughout her later years, she has suffered serious health problems and avoided huge concerts in favor of small retrospective performances. Her life was profiled in the 2024 documentary, \"\".\nEarly life.\nMinnelli was born on March 12, 1946, at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood. She is the daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli. Her parents named her after Ira Gershwin's song \"Liza (All the Clouds'll Roll Away)\". Minnelli has a half-sister, Lorna, and half-brother, Joey, from Garland's marriage to Sid Luft.

In 1961, she moved to New York City, attending High School of Performing Arts and later, Chadwick School.\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nDuring 1961, Minnelli was an apprentice at the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis, Massachusetts. She appeared in the chorus of \"Flower Drum Song\" and played the part of Muriel in \"Take Me Along\". She began performing professionally at the age of 17 in 1963 in an Off-Broadway revival of the musical \"Best Foot Forward\", for which she received the Theatre World Award, and also toured in \"The Fantasticks\", opposite Elliott Gould.\nThe next year, her mother invited her to perform with her in concert at the London Palladium. Both concerts were recorded and released as an album. Minnelli attended Scarsdale High School for one year, starring in a production of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" that then went to Israel on tour. She turned to Broadway at 19, and won her first Tony Award as a leading actress for \"Flora the Red Menace\". It was the first time that she worked with the musical pair John Kander and Fred Ebb.\nMusic.\nMinnelli began as a nightclub singer as an adolescent, making her professional nightclub debut at the age of 19 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. That same year she began appearing in other clubs and on stage in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York City. Her success as a live performer led her to record several albums for Capitol Records: \"Liza! Liza!\" (1964), \"It Amazes Me\" (1965), and \"There Is a Time\" (1966). In her early years, she recorded traditional pop standards as well as show tunes from various musicals in which she starred. Because of this fact, William Ruhlmann named her \"Barbra Streisand's little sister\". The Capitol albums \"Liza! Liza!\", \"It Amazes Me\", and \"There Is a Time\" were reissued on the two-CD compilation \"The Capitol Years\" in 2001, in their entirety.\nFrom 1968 to the 1970s, Minnelli also recorded her albums \"Liza Minnelli\" (1968), \"Come Saturday Morning\" and \"New Feelin\"' (both 1970) for A&amp;M Records. In 1973, Minnelli sang back up with Ronnie Spector for Alice Cooper's song \"Teenage Lament '74\" from the album \"Muscle of Love\" (1973). She released her solo albums \"The Singer\" (1973) and \"Tropical Nights\" (1977) on Columbia Records.\nIn 1989, Minnelli collaborated with the Pet Shop Boys on \"Results\", an electronic dance-style album. The release hit the top 10 in the UK and charted in the U.S., spawning four singles: \"Losing My Mind\"; \"Don't Drop Bombs\"; \"So Sorry, I Said\"; and \"Love Pains\". Later that year, she performed \"Losing My Mind\" live at the Grammy Awards ceremony before receiving a Grammy Legend Award (the first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Minnelli, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Smokey Robinson, and Willie Nelson). With this award, she became one of only 16 people\u2014a list that includes composer Richard Rodgers, Whoopi Goldberg, Barbra Streisand, and John Gielgud and others\u2014to win an Emmy, Grammy, Tony Award and Academy Award.\nIn April 1992, Minnelli appeared at the tribute concert for her late friend Freddie Mercury, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with the surviving members of the rock band Queen at Wembley Stadium in London. In 1996, Minnelli released a studio album titled \"Gently\".

Her first credited film role was as the love interest in \"Charlie Bubbles\" (1967), Albert Finney's only film as director and star, although four years earlier, she did voiceover work for the animated film \"Journey Back to Oz\", a sequel to \"The Wizard of Oz\". Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother, Judy Garland) in what would have been her first credited film role had it been released in 1964 as planned\u2014the Filmation production was delayed, eventually being released in the UK during 1972.\nMinnelli appeared in \"The Sterile Cuckoo\" (1969), Alan J. Pakula's first feature film as Director, as Pookie Adams, a needy, eccentric teenager. Her performance was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She played another eccentric character in \"Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon\" (1970), directed by Otto Preminger. A nude scene in that film, filmed in a Massachusetts cemetery, resulted in a misdemeanor complaint by family of those buried there, and a \"Liza Minnelli Bill\" was introduced the following year to penalise filming in Massachusetts cemeteries without permission.\nMinnelli appeared in her best-known film role, Sally Bowles, in the film version of \"Cabaret\" (1972). She said that one of the things she did to prepare was to study photographs of actresses Louise Glaum and Louise Brooks and the dark-haired women of the era in which the film is set. Minnelli won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance, along with a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and also Sant Jordi Award and David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress.\nFollowing the success of \"Cabaret\", Bob Fosse and Minnelli teamed for \"Liza with a \"Z\"\", a concert for television that aired twice, then was not seen again until a 2005 restoration.\nMinnelli appeared in three expensive flops in three years, with \"Variety\" suggesting by 1978 that she was the number-one choice for box office poison. First was \"Lucky Lady\" (1975), then she worked with her father in \"A Matter of Time\" (1976), co-starring Ingrid Bergman and then \"New York, New York\" (1977), which gave Minnelli her best known signature song. She sometimes performed duets on stage with Frank Sinatra, who recorded a cover version (for his \"\" album).\nMinnelli made fewer film appearances from then on, but her next film, \"Arthur\" (1981), where she starred as Dudley Moore's love interest, was a big hit. She returned to film for \"Rent-A-Cop\" and \"\" (both 1988) and \"Stepping Out\" (1991), a musical comedy drama. She later appeared in \"The Oh in Ohio\" in 2006, which received only a limited release in theatres.\nTelevision.\nDuring the 1950s, Minnelli appeared as a child guest on Art Linkletter's show and sang and danced with Gene Kelly on his first television special in 1959. She was a guest star in one episode of \"Ben Casey\" and was a frequent guest on chat shows of the day, including making numerous appearances on shows hosted by Jack Paar, Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, Joe Franklin, Dinah Shore and Johnny Carson. During the 1960s, she made several guest appearances on \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" as well as other variety shows such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"The Hollywood Palace\", and \"The Judy Garland Show\".\nIn 1964, Minnelli appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode \"Nightingale for Sale\" on Craig Stevens's short-lived series \"Mr. Broadway\". In 1965, she starred in the television special, \"The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood\". A soundtrack was released to coincide with the specials. In 1970, she headlined her first television special, entitled \"Liza\", with guest stars Anthony Newley, and Randy Newman. In 1972, she starred in the Bob Fosse-directed \"Liza with a Z.\"\nIn 1980, she made two television specials, \"Goldie and Liza Together\", with Goldie Hawn, and \"An Evening with Liza Minnelli\". In 1984, she made a guest appearance as Princess Alecia in 'The Princess and the Pea' episode of Faerie Tale Theatre. In 1985, she starred in a made-for-TV movie, \"A Time to Live\", and in 1988, she appeared in \"Sam Found Out: A Triple Play\".\nIn December 1992, American Public Television aired \"Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall\" produced by Phil Ramone and Chris Giordano. The show received six Emmy nominations and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics, awarded to Fred Ebb and John Kander. This was followed by appearances in two more made-for-TV movies: \"Parallel Lives\", and \"The West Side Waltz\", in 1994 and 1995, respectively.\nMuch later in her career, Minnelli made appearances on shows such as a recurring role on \"Arrested Development\" and guest spots on \"\", \"Drop Dead Diva\", and \"Smash\". In the UK, she appeared on the Ruby Wax, Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross shows, and in October 2006, participated in a comedy skit on Charlotte Church's show and was featured on Michael Parkinson's show.\nIn November 2009, American Public Television aired \"Liza's at the Palace\", taped from September 30 to October 1, 2009, in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand's Hollywood Theatre. The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, were previously involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972's Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning \"Liza with a Z\".\nLater career.\nMinnelli returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical \"Victor/Victoria\", replacing Julie Andrews. In his review, \"New York Times\" critic Ben Brantley wrote \"her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond.\"\nAfter a serious case of viral encephalitis in 2000, doctors predicted that Minnelli would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and perhaps not be able to speak again. However, taking vocal and dance lessons daily (especially with Sam Harris, Luigi Faccuito, Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), she managed to recover. She appeared on a September 19, 2001, episode of \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\", notable because it was Rosie's first show back following the September 11 attacks. Despite having had vocal surgery shortly before, she sang her signature song, \"New York, New York\", and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend Michael Jackson to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang \"Never Never Land\" and the televised \"You Are Not Alone\" at the concert produced by future husband David Gest. Minnelli told reporters: \"I am stable as a table.\"\nGest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in \"Liza's Back\" in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song \"Over the Rainbow\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation.\nFrom 2003 through 2005, she appeared as a recurring character on the Emmy Award-winning TV sitcom \"Arrested Development\" as Lucille Austero (also known as \"Lucille 2\"), the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward Buster Bluth and Buster's brother Gob. Minnelli appeared in the role for the show's fourth season in 2013.\nOn December 14, 2004, Minnelli made her first appearance in the UK after a long absence, performing as a special guest at the annual Royal Variety Performance. The performance was presented by the BBC, and was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales. It was staged at the London Coliseum, celebrating both its centenary year and the theatre's re-opening after an extensive four-year restoration.\nIn 2005, Minnelli made her first film appearance in more than 15 years, in \"The Oh in Ohio\".\nIn September 2006, Minnelli made a guest appearance on the long-running drama \"\" in \"Masquerade\", a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on October 31, 2006.\nMinnelli also completed guest vocals on My Chemical Romance's 2006 concept album \"The Black Parade\", portraying \"Mother War\", a dark conception of the main character's mother in the song \"Mama\".\nIn 2007, it was announced that Minnelli was working on an album in tribute to Kay Thompson. This turned into Minnelli's return to Broadway in a new solo concert at the Palace Theatre titled \"Liza's at The Palace...!\", which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009. In her second act, she performed a series of numbers created by Thompson.\nMinnelli was a character in the Australian musical \"The Boy from Oz\" (a biography of her first husband, Peter Allen) starring Hugh Jackman. In the show's Broadway production, she was portrayed by Stephanie J. Block. In October 2009, Minnelli toured Australia and appeared on \"Australian Idol\" as a mentor and guest judge. Minnelli made a cameo appearance in the May 2010 release of \"Sex and the City 2\", in which she covered Beyonc\u00e9's hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and Cole Porter's \"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\". She made a starring appearance in December 2010 in \"The Apprentice\".\nAlso in 2010, Minnelli released an album of a number of American standards \"unplugged\" with long-time collaborator Billy Stritch, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs are said to have been recorded several years prior and later released as the album \"Confessions\".\nOn June 14, 2012, Minnelli headlined at Hampton Court Palace Festival. On May 9, 2014, Minnelli had a guest appearance on Cher's Dressed to Kill Tour in Brooklyn, performing \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" with Cyndi Lauper and Rosie O'Donnell.\nIn 2024, Minnelli announced her plans to release her memoir, \"Kids, Wait Till You Hear This!\", on March 10, 2026.\nPersonal life.\nMinnelli had long suffered from alcoholism and had been addicted to prescription drugs, originating from a Valium prescription after her mother died. Her use of recreational drugs in the 1970s was noted by Andy Warhol, who in a 1978 diary entry recalled Minnelli arriving at Halston's house and imploring the host to \"Give me every drug you've got.\" Along with Warhol and Bianca Jagger, Minnelli made frequent appearances at New York City nightclubs during the late 1970s, including Studio 54. Minnelli left her 1984 musical \"The Rink\" to enter the Betty Ford Clinic.\nOf the many physical ailments that Minnelli has, as a result of her long and demanding career as a dancer, one is inherited. She has lived and performed with scoliosis since her youth, and actually developed unique and signature dance moves and techniques because of the pain: \n\"I found out that because of the scoliosis, if I lean back one way it hurts. The only reason I do anything like I do is because it\u2019s the only way I can do it without hurting! Literally. It\u2019s really funny. It is so weird ... I\u2019ve got two false hips, a wired-up knee, scoliosis, which I\u2019ve always had, and three crushed disks, but I feel great. I dance every day.\u201d\nMinnelli is an Episcopalian.\nMinnelli's friendships have included the singer Adam Ant, whom she advised on what to wear when he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II after the 1981 Royal Variety Performance at which his band Adam and the Ants performed. Ant in turn namechecked Minnelli in the track \"Crackpot History and the Right To Lie\" on his 1982 solo album \"Friend or Foe\".\nDuring an Australian visit in 1964, Minnelli and her then-boyfriend Peter Allen were invited to the opening of the Compass Centre in Bankstown, Sydney. They were awarded the titles of King and Queen of the Compass Centre.\nMarriages and relationships.\nMinnelli has married and divorced four times. Her first marriage was to Australian entertainer Peter Allen on March 3, 1967. Allen was Judy Garland's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the mid-1960s. Minnelli and Allen agreed to a trial separation on April 9, 1970. Their divorce was finalized on July 24, 1974. Minnelli told \"The Advocate\" editor-in-chief Judy Wieder in September 1996, \"I married Peter, and he didn't tell me he was gay. Everyone knew but me. And I found out ... well, let me put it this way: I'll never surprise anybody coming home as long as I live. I call first!\"\nAfter her separation from Allen, Minnelli was engaged to actor Desi Arnaz Jr and comic actor Peter Sellers.\nMinnelli married Jack Haley Jr., a producer and director, on September 15, 1974. His father, Jack Haley, was Minnelli's mother's co-star in \"The Wizard of Oz\" who played the Tin Man. They divorced in April 1979.\nMinnelli was married to Mark Gero, a sculptor and stage manager, from December 4, 1979, until their divorce in January 1992.\nMinnelli was married to David Gest, a concert promoter, from March 16, 2002, until their separation in July 2003 and divorce in April 2007. The wedding boasted over 1,200 guests at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, with Michael Jackson as the best man, Elizabeth Taylor as the matron of honor, and a bridal party that included Mia Farrow, Gina Lollobrigida, Petula Clark, Mya, and Janet Leigh among others. Gest was reportedly gay, as was her first husband. In a 2003 lawsuit, Gest alleged that Minnelli beat him in alcohol-induced rages during their marriage. Minnelli denied the accusations, claiming Gest was simply after her money. The suit was dismissed in September 2006 for lack of triable issue of fact.\nShe also had relationships with Rock Brynner (son of Yul Brynner), Mikhail Baryshnikov, Billy Stritch, and film director Martin Scorsese. Her close friendship with French pop singer Charles Aznavour was described by Aznavour as \"more than friends and less than lovers.\"\nMinnelli has no children despite numerous attempts; one pregnancy left her with a hiatal hernia as a result of the medical steps taken to try to save the baby.\nPhilanthropy.\nThroughout her lifetime, Minnelli has served on various charities and causes. She served on the board of directors of The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) for 20 years, a nonprofit educational organization that introduces parents to the field of child brain development. In a 2006 interview with Randy Rice at Broadwayworld.com, Minnelli said that she was the person who told Elizabeth Taylor about HIV/AIDS while talking about their mutual friend Rock Hudson. She has also dedicated much time to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, which was co-founded by Taylor.\nIn 2007, she stated in an interview with \"Palm Springs Life\": \"AmfAR is important to me because I've lost so many friends that I knew [to AIDS]\". In 1994, she recorded the Kander &amp; Ebb tune \"The Day After That\" and donated the proceeds to AIDS research. The same year, she performed the song in front of thousands in Central Park at the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\nAwards and nominations.\nIn 1991, for her contribution to live performance, Minnelli was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. She was made a Knight of the French Legion of Honour. She also received an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, a Grammy Award, and three Tony Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other ways of solving quadratic equations, such as completing the square, yield the same solutions.\nGiven a general quadratic equation of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; representing an unknown, and coefficients &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; representing known real or complex numbers with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the values of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; satisfying the equation, called the \"roots\" or \"zeros\", can be found using the quadratic formula,\nformula_1\nwhere the plus\u2013minus symbol \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\" indicates that the equation has two roots. Written separately, these are:\nformula_2\nThe quantity &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is known as the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If the coefficients &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are real numbers then when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the equation has two distinct real roots; when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the equation has one repeated real root; and when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the equation has \"no\" real roots but has two distinct complex roots, which are complex conjugates of each other.\nGeometrically, the roots represent the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; values at which the graph of the quadratic function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, a parabola, crosses the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis: the graph's &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-intercepts. The quadratic formula can also be used to identify the parabola's axis of symmetry.\nDerivation by completing the square.\nThe standard way to derive the quadratic formula is to apply the method of completing the square to the generic quadratic equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The idea is to transform the equation into the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for some expressions &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; written in terms of the coefficients; take the square root of both sides; and then isolate &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nWe start by dividing the equation by the quadratic coefficient &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which is allowed because &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is non-zero. Afterwards, we subtract the constant term &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to isolate it on the right-hand side:\nformula_3\nThe left-hand side is now of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and we can \"complete the square\" by adding a constant &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to obtain a squared binomial &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;&lt;wbr /&gt;&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this example we add &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to both sides so that the left-hand side can be factored (see the figure):\nformula_4\nBecause the left-hand side is now a perfect square, we can easily take the square root of both sides:\nformula_5\nFinally, subtracting &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; from both sides to isolate &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; produces the quadratic formula:\nformula_6\nEquivalent formulations.\nThe quadratic formula can equivalently be written using various alternative expressions, for instance\nformula_7\nwhich can be derived by first dividing a quadratic equation by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, resulting in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, then substituting the new coefficients into the standard quadratic formula. Because this variant allows re-use of the intermediately calculated quantity &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, it can slightly reduce the arithmetic involved.\nSquare root in the denominator.\nA lesser known quadratic formula, first mentioned by Giulio Fagnano, describes the same roots via an equation with the square root in the denominator (assuming &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;):\nformula_8\nHere the minus\u2013plus symbol \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;\" indicates that the two roots of the quadratic equation, in the same order as the standard quadratic formula, are\nformula_9\nThis variant has been jokingly called the \"citardauq\" formula (\"quadratic\" spelled backwards).\nWhen &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; has the opposite sign as either &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, subtraction can cause catastrophic cancellation, resulting in poor accuracy in numerical calculations; choosing between the version of the quadratic formula with the square root in the numerator or denominator depending on the sign of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can avoid this problem. See below.\nThis version of the quadratic formula is used in Muller's method for finding the roots of general functions. It can be derived from the standard formula from the identity &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, one of Vieta's formulas. Alternately, it can be derived by dividing each side of the equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to get &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, applying the standard formula to find the two roots &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and then taking the reciprocal to find the roots &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of the original equation.\nOther derivations.\nAny generic method or algorithm for solving quadratic equations can be applied to an equation with symbolic coefficients and used to derive some closed-form expression equivalent to the quadratic formula. Alternative methods are sometimes simpler than completing the square, and may offer interesting insight into other areas of mathematics.\nCompleting the square by \u015ar\u012bdhara's method.\nInstead of dividing by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to isolate &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, it can be slightly simpler to multiply by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; instead to produce &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which allows us to complete the square without need for fractions. Then the steps of the derivation are:\nApplying this method to a generic quadratic equation with symbolic coefficients yields the quadratic formula:\nformula_10\nThis method for completing the square is ancient and was known to the 8th\u20139th century Indian mathematician \u015ar\u012bdhara. Compared with the modern standard method for completing the square, this alternate method avoids fractions until the last step and hence does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side.\nBy substitution.\nAnother derivation uses a change of variables to eliminate the linear term. Then the equation takes the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in terms of a new variable &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and some constant expression &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, whose roots are then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nBy substituting &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; into &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, expanding the products and combining like terms, and then solving for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, we have:\nformula_11\nFinally, after taking a square root of both sides and substituting the resulting expression for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; back into &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; the familiar quadratic formula emerges:\nformula_12\nBy using algebraic identities.\nThe following method was used by many historical mathematicians:\nLet the roots of the quadratic equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; be &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The derivation starts from an identity for the square of a difference (valid for any two complex numbers), of which we can take the square root on both sides:\nformula_13\nSince the coefficient &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, we can divide the quadratic equation by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to obtain a monic polynomial with the same roots. Namely,\nformula_14\nThis implies that the sum &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and the product &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Thus the identity can be rewritten:\nformula_15\nTherefore,\nformula_16\nThe two possibilities for each of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are the same two roots in opposite order, so we can combine them into the standard quadratic equation:\nformula_17\nBy Lagrange resolvents.\nAn alternative way of deriving the quadratic formula is via the method of Lagrange resolvents, which is an early part of Galois theory.\nThis method can be generalized to give the roots of cubic polynomials and quartic polynomials, and leads to Galois theory, which allows one to understand the solution of algebraic equations of any degree in terms of the symmetry group of their roots, the Galois group.\nThis approach focuses on the roots themselves rather than algebraically rearranging the original equation. Given a monic quadratic polynomial &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; assume that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are the two roots. So the polynomial factors as\nformula_18\nwhich implies &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSince multiplication and addition are both commutative, exchanging the roots &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; will not change the coefficients &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;: one can say that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are symmetric polynomials in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Specifically, they are the elementary symmetric polynomials \u2013 any symmetric polynomial in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be expressed in terms of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; instead.\nThe Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is to ask whether, given coefficients of a polynomial each of which is a symmetric function in the roots, one can \"break\" the symmetry and thereby recover the roots. Using this approach, solving a polynomial of degree &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is related to the ways of rearranging (\"permuting\") &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; terms, called the symmetric group on &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; letters and denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. For the quadratic polynomial, the only ways to rearrange two roots are to either leave them be or to transpose them, so solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.\nTo find the roots &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, consider their sum and difference:\nformula_19\nThese are called the \"Lagrange resolvents\" of the polynomial, from which the roots can be recovered as\nformula_20\nBecause &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a symmetric function in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, it can be expressed in terms of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; specifically &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; as described above. However, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is not symmetric, since exchanging &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; yields the additive inverse &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. So &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; cannot be expressed in terms of the symmetric polynomials. However, its square &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; \"is\" symmetric in the roots, expressible in terms of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Specifically &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;&lt;wbr /&gt;&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;&lt;wbr /&gt;&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which implies &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Taking the positive root \"breaks\" the symmetry, resulting in\nformula_21\nfrom which the roots &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are recovered as\nformula_22\nwhich is the quadratic formula for a monic polynomial.\nSubstituting &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; yields the usual expression for an arbitrary quadratic polynomial. The resolvents can be recognized as\nformula_23\nrespectively the vertex and the discriminant of the monic polynomial.\nA similar but more complicated method works for cubic equations, which have three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the \"resolving polynomial\") relating &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a quartic equation (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved. The same method for a quintic equation yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.\nNumerical calculation.\nThe quadratic formula is exactly correct when performed using the idealized arithmetic of real numbers, but when approximate arithmetic is used instead, for example pen-and-paper arithmetic carried out to a fixed number of decimal places or the floating-point binary arithmetic available on computers, the limitations of the number representation can lead to substantially inaccurate results unless great care is taken in the implementation. Specific difficulties include catastrophic cancellation in computing the sum &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; catastrophic calculation in computing the discriminant &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; itself in cases where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; degeneration of the formula when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is represented as zero or infinite; and possible overflow or underflow when multiplying or dividing extremely large or small numbers, even in cases where the roots can be accurately represented.\nCatastrophic cancellation occurs when two numbers which are approximately equal are subtracted. While each of the numbers may independently be representable to a certain number of digits of precision, the identical leading digits of each number cancel, resulting in a difference of lower relative precision. When &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, evaluation of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; causes catastrophic cancellation, as does the evaluation of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. When using the standard quadratic formula, calculating one of the two roots always involves addition, which preserves the working precision of the intermediate calculations, while calculating the other root involves subtraction, which compromises it. Therefore, na\u00efvely following the standard quadratic formula often yields one result with less relative precision than expected. Unfortunately, introductory algebra textbooks typically do not address this problem, even though it causes students to obtain inaccurate results in other school subjects such as introductory chemistry.\nFor example, if trying to solve the equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; using a pocket calculator, the result of the quadratic formula &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; might be approximately calculated as:\nformula_24\nEven though the calculator used ten decimal digits of precision for each step, calculating the difference between two approximately equal numbers has yielded a result for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; with only four correct digits.\nOne way to recover an accurate result is to use the identity &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In this example &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be calculated as &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;&lt;wbr /&gt;&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which is correct to the full ten digits. Another more or less equivalent approach is to use the version of the quadratic formula with the square root in the denominator to calculate one of the roots (see above).\nPractical computer implementations of the solution of quadratic equations commonly choose which formula to use for each root depending on the sign of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThese methods do not prevent possible overflow or underflow of the floating-point exponent in computing &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which can lead to numerically representable roots not being computed accurately. A more robust but computationally expensive strategy is to start with the substitution &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, turning the quadratic equation into\nformula_25\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is the sign function. Letting &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, this equation has the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, for which one solution is &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; and the other solution is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The roots of the original equation are then &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nWith additional complication the expense and extra rounding of the square roots can be avoided by approximating them as powers of two, while still avoiding exponent overflow for representable roots.\nHistorical development.\nThe earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems reducible to solving quadratic equations. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation.\nThe Greek mathematician Euclid (circa 300 BC) used geometric methods to solve quadratic equations in Book 2 of his \"Elements\", an influential mathematical treatise Rules for quadratic equations appear in the Chinese \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\" circa 200 BC. In his work \"Arithmetica\", the Greek mathematician Diophantus (circa 250 AD) solved quadratic equations with a method more recognizably algebraic than the geometric algebra of Euclid. His solution gives only one root, even when both roots are positive.\nThe Indian mathematician Brahmagupta included a generic method for finding one root of a quadratic equation in his treatise \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\" (circa 628 AD), written out in words in the style of that time. His solution of the quadratic equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; was as follows: \"To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value.\"\nIn modern notation, this can be written &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The Indian mathematician \u015ar\u012bdhara (8th\u20139th century) came up with a similar algorithm for solving quadratic equations in a now-lost work on algebra quoted by Bh\u0101skara II. The modern quadratic formula is sometimes called \"Sridharacharya's formula\" in India and \"Bhaskara's formula\" in Brazil.\nThe 9th-century Persian mathematician Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b solved quadratic equations algebraically. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 Ren\u00e9 Descartes published \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" containing special cases of the quadratic formula in the form we know today.\nGeometric significance.\nIn terms of coordinate geometry, an axis-aligned parabola is a curve whose &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-coordinates are the graph of a second-degree polynomial, of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are real-valued constant coefficients with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nGeometrically, the quadratic formula defines the points &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; on the graph, where the parabola crosses the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis. Furthermore, it can be separated into two terms,\nformula_26\nThe first term describes the axis of symmetry, the line &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. The second term, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, gives the distance the roots are away from the axis of symmetry.\nIf the parabola's vertex is on the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis, then the corresponding equation has a single repeated root on the line of symmetry, and this distance term is zero; algebraically, the discriminant &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIf the discriminant is positive, then the vertex is not on the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis but the parabola opens in the direction of the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis, crossing it twice, so the corresponding equation has two real roots. If the discriminant is negative, then the parabola opens in the opposite direction, never crossing the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-axis, and the equation has no real roots; in this case the two complex-valued roots will be complex conjugates whose real part is the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; value of the axis of symmetry.\nDimensional analysis.\nIf the constants &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and/or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are not unitless then the quantities &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; must have the same units, because the terms &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; agree on their units. By the same logic, the coefficient &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; must have the same units as &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, irrespective of the units of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of physical quantities has been set up correctly.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the Seven Sisters oil companies. Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with Gulf's headquarters, the Gulf Tower, being Pittsburgh's tallest building until the completion of the U.S. Steel Tower.\nGulf Oil Corporation (GOC) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both rebranding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro-Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia &amp; York.\nOther aspects of the Gulf brand name, and a number of the constituent business divisions of GOC, have continued to exist. In its present incarnation, is a \"new economy\" business, employing very few people directly and its assets mainly in the form of intellectual property: brands, product specifications and scientific expertise. The rights to the brand in the United States are owned by Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLC), which operates service stations and petroleum terminals; it is headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. The corporate vehicle at the center of the Gulf network outside the United States, excluding Spain and Portugal, is Gulf Oil International, a company owned by the Hinduja Group. That company's focus is primarily in the provision of downstream products and services to a mass market through joint ventures, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, and distribution arrangements. In Spain and Portugal, the Gulf brand is owned by TotalEnergies SE.\nHistory.\n1901\u20131982.\nThe business that became Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop oilfield near Beaumont, Texas. A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery at nearby Port Arthur to process the oil. The largest investors were Andrew Mellon and William Larimer Mellon Sr., of the Pittsburgh Mellon family. Other investors included many of Mellon's Pennsylvania clients as well as some Texas wildcatters. Mellon Bank and Gulf Oil remained closely associated thereafter. The Gulf Oil Corporation itself was formed in 1907 through the amalgamation of a number of oil businesses, principally the J.M. Guffey Petroleum Company, Gulf Pipeline Company, and Gulf Refining companies of Texas. The name of the company refers to the Gulf of Mexico where Beaumont lies.\nOutput from Spindletop peaked at around just after it was discovered and then started to decline. Later discoveries made 1927 the peak year of Spindletop production, but Spindletop's early decline forced Gulf to seek alternative sources of supply to sustain its substantial investment in refining capacity. This was achieved by constructing the 400-mile (640\u00a0km) Glenn Pool pipeline connecting oilfields in Oklahoma with Gulf's refinery at Port Arthur. The pipeline opened in September 1907. Gulf later built a network of pipelines and refineries in the eastern and southern United States, requiring heavy capital investment. Thus, Gulf Oil provided Mellon Bank with a secure vehicle for investing in the oil sector.\nGulf promoted the concept of branded product sales by selling fuel in containers and from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded fuel could be assured of its quality and consistent standard. (In the early 20th century, non-branded fuel in the United States was often contaminated or of unreliable quality).\nGulf Oil grew steadily in the inter-war years, with its activities mainly confined to the United States. The company was characterized by its vertically integrated business activities and was active across the whole spectrum of the oil industry: exploration, production, transport, refining and marketing. It also involved itself in associated industries such as petrochemicals and automobile component manufacturing. It introduced significant commercial and technical innovations, including the first drive-in service station (1913), complimentary road maps, drilling over water at Ferry Lake, and the catalytic cracking refining process (Gulf installed the world's first commercial catalytic cracking unit at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery complex in 1951). Gulf also established the model for the integrated, international \"oil major\", which refers to one of a group of very large companies that assumed influential and sensitive positions in the countries in which they operated. In 1924, it acquired the Venezuelan-American Creole Syndicate's leases in the strip of shallow water 1.5 kilometers (0.93\u00a0mi) wide along the Lake Maracaibo east shore.\nIn Colombia, Gulf purchased the Barco oil concession in 1926. The government of Colombia revoked the concession the same year, but after much negotiation Gulf won it back in 1931. However, during a period of over-capacity, Gulf was more interested in holding the reserve than developing it. In 1936 Gulf sold Barco to the Texas Corporation, now Texaco, and they would eventually all merge as Chevron.\nGulf had extensive exploration and production operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and Kuwait. The company played a major role in the early development of oil production in Kuwait, and through the 1950s and '60s apparently enjoyed a \"special relationship\" with the Kuwaiti government. This special relationship attracted unfavorable attention since it was associated with \"political contributions\" (see below) and support for anti-democratic politics, as evidenced by papers taken from the body of a Gulf executive killed in the crash of a TWA aircraft at Cairo in 1950.\nIn 1927 Gulf Oil obtained an option on an oil concession in Bahrain, which was sold to Standard Oil of California in 1928 and led to the founding of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Gulf Oil was also a minor shareholder in the Iraq Petroleum Company until 1934. In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was formed as a joint venture by Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) now BP, and Gulf. Both APOC and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the exploration for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938, but it was not until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and fuel being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd. (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1. While serving as General Manager and Vice President of Gulf Oil, Willard F. Jones facilitated the expansion of crude oil import from Kuwait, a nation that was - at the time - a yet incipient supply region to the United States. This expansion program implemented by Robert E. Garret and Jones consisted of construction of a fleet of supertankers and was meant to \"result in a sharp increase in the processing of crude oil and various petroleum products at a time when the domestic demand for (such) products (was) at an unprecedented peak.\"\nGulf expanded on a worldwide basis from the end of the Second World War. The company leveraged its international drilling experience to other areas of the world, and by mid-1943 had established a presence in the eastern oil fields of Venezuela as the Mene Grande Oil Company (See San Tom\u00e9, Venezuela). Much of the company's retail sales expansion was through the acquisition of privately owned chains of filling stations in various countries, allowing Gulf outlets to sell product (sometimes through \"matching\" arrangements) from the oil that it was \"lifting\" in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Some of these acquisitions were to prove less than resilient in the face of economic and political developments from the 1970s on. Gulf invested heavily in product technology and developed many specialty products, particularly for application in the maritime and aviation engineering sectors. It was particularly noted for its range of lubricants and greases.\nGulf Oil reached the peak of its development around 1970. In that year, the company processed of crude daily, held assets worth $6.5\u00a0billion ($ billion today), employed 58,000 employees worldwide, and was owned by 163,000 shareholders. In addition to its petroleum marketing interests, Gulf was a major producer of petrochemicals, plastics, and agricultural chemicals. Through its subsidiary, Gulf General Atomic, Inc., it was also active in the nuclear energy sector. Gulf abandoned its involvement in the nuclear sector after a failed deal to build atomic power plants in Romania in the mid-1970s.\nIn 1974, the Kuwait National Assembly took a 60 percent stake in the equity of KOC with the remaining 40 percent divided equally between BP and Gulf. The Kuwaitis took over the rest of the equity in 1975, giving them full ownership of KOC. This meant that Gulf (EH) had to start supplying its downstream operations in Europe with crude bought on the world market at commercial prices. The whole GOC(EH) edifice now became highly marginal in an economic sense. Many of the marketing companies that Gulf had established in Europe were never truly viable on a stand-alone basis. In 1976 during the nationalization of Venezuelan oil, the transfer of properties, benefits, equipment of Gulf Oil to PDVSA was carried out without any setback and with full satisfaction on both parts.\nGulf was at the forefront of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep-water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the \"Universe Ireland\" was added to Gulf's tanker fleet. At \u00a0long tons deadweight (DWT), this was the largest vessel in the world and incapable of berthing at most normal ports.\nGulf also participated in a partnership with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez Canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the M/V \"Betelgeuse\", in January 1979 (Whiddy Island disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.\nIn the 1970s, Gulf participated in the development of new oilfields in the UK North Sea and in Cabinda, although these were high-cost operations that never compensated for the loss of Gulf's interest in Kuwait. A mercenary army had to be raised to protect the oil installations in Cabinda during the Angolan civil war. The Angolan connection was another \"special relationship\" that attracted comment. In the late 1970s, Gulf was effectively funding a Soviet bloc regime in Africa while the US government was attempting to overthrow that regime by supporting the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.\nIn 1975, several senior Gulf executives, including chairman Bob Dorsey, were implicated in the making of illegal \"political contributions\" and were forced to step down from their positions. This loss of senior personnel at a critical time in Gulf's fortunes may have had a bearing on the events that followed.\nGulf's operations worldwide were struggling financially in the recession of the early 1980s, so Gulf's management devised the \"Big Jobber\" strategic realignment in 1981 (along with a program of selective divestments) to maintain viability. The Big Jobber strategy recognized that the day of the integrated, multi-national oil major might be over, since it involved concentrating on those parts of the supply chain where Gulf had a competitive advantage.\nMarketing and promotions.\nIn the late 1930s, Gulf's aviation manager, Major Alford J. Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned-up versions of the Grumman F3F Navy fighter, for promotional use by the company. Wearing Gulf Oil company colors and logos, the Grumman G-22 \"Gulfhawk II\", registered \"NR1050\", was delivered in December 1936, and in 1938 Maj. Williams flew it on a tour of Europe. A second scavenger pump and five drain lines were added to the engine installation that allowed the aircraft to be flown inverted for up to thirty minutes. This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A second airplane, the Grumman G-32 \"Gulfhawk III\", registered \"NC1051\", was delivered on May 6, 1938. Impressed by the Army Air Force in November 1942 for use as a VIP transport and designated a UC-103, it crashed in the southern Florida Everglades in early 1943.\nGulf Oil was the primary sponsor for NBC News special events coverage in the 1960s, notably for coverage of the U.S. space program. It also became a sponsor for a program called NBC News Special Report. The logo even appeared on the front cross-shaped desk of every special event and coverage broadcast by the network and it was notably used by Chet Huntley and David Brinkley or the other correspondents since the 1964 Republican National Convention. The company used the connection to its advantage by offering giveaway or promotional items at its stations, including sticker sheets of space mission logos, a paper punch-out lunar module model kit, and a book titled \"We Came in Peace,\" containing pictures of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Gulf was also a major sponsor of \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\", which also aired on NBC. Disney magazines and activity books were often given away with a gas fill-up. Gulf was also noted for its \"Tourgide\" road maps.\nOne particularly memorable Gulf advertisement carried by NBC during their coverage of the Apollo missions showed aerial and onboard views of the \"Universe Ireland\" with Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers singing \"Bringin' Home the Oil\" \u2013 a tribute to the opening of Gulf's operations in Bantry Bay.\nIn 1937, Gulf Oil became involved in racing when they purchased the racing car project of Ira Vail and Harry Miller and brought the project into the Gulf Research and Development Company. This produced innovative new cars that were the designs of Miller which became the first mid-engined cars to race in the Indianapolis 500. The cars also featured four-wheel-drive which was very novel at the time, disc brakes and a supercharged 6-cylinder engine. The only notable restriction was that the engine needed to run on standard Gulf pump fuel. Four of the cars were built with 3-liter engines and one was entered in the 1938 \"500\" but did not qualify as much testing was needed to get the car to the point of being ready for competition. Three of the Gulf-Miller cars were entered in 1939 with one, driven by George Bailey making the race with a second-row qualifying position. Another of the cars was crashed in practice and the third didn't attempt qualifying. The Bailey car dropped out of the race with a broken valve. In 1940, a fatal practice accident caused the team to withdraw. In 1941, two of the Gulf cars qualified but one was destroyed in a race morning garage fire and the other dropped out of the race early. Gulf sold the car in 1946 to Preston Tucker who ran it as the \"Tucker Torpedo Special\" that year in its last race appearance.\nGulf Oil was most synonymous for its association with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 is one of the most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film \"Le Mans\", Steve McQueen's character, \"Michael Delaney\", drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.\nFrom 1963 to 1980, Gulf Oil had a formal agreement with Holiday Inn, the world's largest lodging chain, for which Holiday Inn's in the U.S. and Canada would accept Gulf credit cards for food and lodging. In return, Gulf placed service stations on the premises of many Holiday Inn properties along major U.S. highways to provide one-stop availability for fuel, auto service, food and lodging. Many older Holiday Inns still have those original Gulf stations on their properties, some in operation and some closed, but few operate today as Gulf stations.\nGulf No-Nox fuel was promoted with a bucking horse leaving an imprint of two horseshoes. Several promotions centered on the two horseshoes. In 1966, bright orange 3-D plastic self-adhesive horseshoes for car bumpers were given away. Another popular giveaway was during the 1968 election season, gold horseshoe lapel pins featuring either a Democratic donkey or a Republican elephant.\nDemise.\nBy 1980, Gulf exhibited many of the characteristics of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.\nIts undoing as an independent company began in 1982 when T. Boone Pickens, an Amarillo, Texas, oilman and corporate raider (or greenmailer), and owner of Mesa Petroleum, made an offer for the comparatively larger (but still considered \"non-major\" oil company) Cities Service Company (more generally known by the name Citgo) from Tulsa, Oklahoma which was then trading in the low 20s. Pickens first privately offered $45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a $50 a share public offer when Cities' CEO rejected the friendly offer. Gulf forestalled Mesa's takeover attempt by offering $63 a share in a friendly offer which Cities (by then trading at $37) accepted. Cities then bought out Pickens for $55 a share. Once Pickens was gone, Gulf reneged on its buyout offer, supposedly over a dispute regarding accuracy of Cities Service's reserves, and the stock price of Cities plunged, triggering stockholder lawsuits as well as distrust for Gulf's management on Wall Street and among financing investment banks who bet big in assisting Gulf to defeat Mesa only to be left broke when Gulf backed out. Cities Service was ultimately sold to Occidental Petroleum, and the retail operations were resold to Southland Corporation, the operators of 7-Eleven stores. Gulf's termination of the Cities Service acquisition resulted in more than 15 years of shareholder litigation against Gulf (and later Chevron).\nWith declining margins in the industry and left without Citgo's reserves, Mesa and its investor partners kept hunting for a takeover target, only to discover while fighting Gulf for Citgo how increasingly top-heavy its portfolio and declining reserves were undervaluing its overall assets. They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil's stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC. In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company's stock, larger than the founding Mellon family's share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa's interest by calling a shareholders' meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation's by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would \"slim down\" Gulf's market share. Pickens had acquired the reputation of being a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.\nGulf management and directors took the view that the Mesa bid represented an undervaluation of the Gulf business as a long-term going concern and that it was not in the interest of Gulf shareholders. James Lee, Gulf's CEO and Chairman, even claimed during the November 1983 shareholders meeting to address the Mesa ownership that Pickens' royalty trust idea was nothing more than a \"get-rich-quick scheme\" that would undermine the corporation's profit potential in the coming decades. Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf's price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RCA) and finally, in March 1984, accepted an offer from Chevron of $80 per share, totalling US$billion (equivalent to $\u00a0billion in 2024), to act as its white knight. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760million (equivalent to $billion in 2024) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron. Pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for Gulf shareholders (as well as its management that fought him at every turn), Mesa's shares were the last to be paid out by Chevron.\nThe forced merger of Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate considering legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year\u2014before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government intervention in the matter and would veto any bill. However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned to testify before the Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a \"small operator\" successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or, in Gulf's case, a \"Fortune 10\" corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive \"Seven Sisters\" club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the \"non-major independents\". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that \"mostly all we talk about in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens\". Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 as well as some of the international operations.\nThe effect on the Pittsburgh area was severe as close to 900 PhD and research jobs and 600 headquarters (accounting, law, clerical) jobs were transferred to California or cut, a payroll of $54million (equivalent to $million in 2024) and corporate charity to 50 Western Pennsylvania organizations worth $2million/year (equivalent to $million/year in 2024). These losses were mitigated some with the donation of Gulf Labs in suburban north Pittsburgh to the University of Pittsburgh to be used as a research business incubator along with $5million (equivalent to $million/year in 2024) in maintenance and seed money. The \"Gulf Labs\" research complex consisted of 55 multi-story buildings with on and including several chemical labs, petroleum production and refining areas and even a nuclear laboratory complete with reactor in 1985 and employed close to 2,000 engineers and scientists operating with a $100million budget (equivalent to $million in 2024) from Gulf/Chevron. After its donation, it was renamed the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center or U-PARC and opened to small technology, computer and engineering firms as well as graduate level research.\nAftermath.\nBP, Chevron, Cumberland Farms and other companies that acquired former Gulf operations continued to use the Gulf name through the early 1990s. This caused consumer confusion in the US retail market as the parent companies would not accept each other's credit cards. All former Gulf stations franchised by BP and Chevron in the United States have since been converted to those names. Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLP), based in Framingham, Massachusetts, has bought a license for North American rights to the Gulf brand from Chevron. Chevron still owned the Gulf brand, but was making almost no direct use of it. In January 2010, GOLP bought the entire brand from Chevron and began a nationwide expansion campaign. GOLP operates a distribution network reaching from Maine to Ohio. Most Gulf-branded filling stations in North America are owned by Cumberland Farms of Framingham, which owns a two-thirds interest in GOLP. In addition there are some independently owned franchises still operating under the Gulf brand within North America, such as Nu-Tier Brands, Inc., which is licensed by GOLP to blend and distribute Gulf-branded lubricants.\nGulf Oil International (GOI) owns the rights to the Gulf brand outside the United States, Spain &amp; Portugal. It is now owned by the Hinduja Group. After they acquired a large share from the Taher family, a major Saudi Arabian family led by Dr. Abdulhadi H. Taher (former governor of the Saudi Petroleum and Mineral organization and board member of Aramco). GOI trades mainly in lubricants, oils, and greases. GOI is also involved in franchising the Gulf brand to operators in the petroleum and automotive sectors; Gulf-branded filling stations can be found in several countries including the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, Czechia, the Netherlands, Jordan, Finland, Armenia and Turkey. GOI has direct and indirect interests in a number of businesses that use the Gulf brand under license.\nThe Canadian exploration, production, and distribution arm of Gulf Oil was sold to Olympia and York in 1985. From 1992 it continued as an independent oil company (Gulf Canada Resources) until its acquisition by Conoco in 2002.\nMost Gulf downstream operations in Europe were sold to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) in early 1983. The associated Gulf filling stations were converted to trade under the Q8 brand by 1988. However, attempts to sell Gulf Oil (Great Britain) to KPC failed because of irrevocable GOC guarantees given earlier in regard to bonds issued to finance the construction of refinery facilities in the UK. GO(GB) was taken over by Chevron and its stations continued to use the Gulf brand name and insignia until 1997 when the network was sold to Shell, although by this stage a fairly large proportion of Gulf stations were supplied by jobbers rather than Gulf Oil (GB). Gulf completely withdrew from the UK in 1997. This represented the end of the last major \"downstream\" use of the Gulf brand by Chevron. In the UK, the Gulf brand is now licensed by Certas Energy (GB Oils), who also now own the Pace brand, which was coincidentally formerly owned by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.\nRevival.\nGOI and GOLP continue to sell Gulf-branded lubricants worldwide through a network of official licensed companies, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiary companies. Many of these official Gulf distributors carry out local marketing and sponsorship which help to raise the profile of the brand. Of these wholly owned subsidiaries Gulf Oil Corporation India has raised the market profile of the Gulf brand in the Middle East. GOCL have emerged as one of leading lubricants brands in India and run many marketing sponsorships targeted at the ever-growing youth sector in the country.\nGOI licenses the Gulf brand and logo in the UK to the Bayford group, one of the largest independent fuel distributors. Starting in 2001, a new Gulf network of independent stations began appearing across the UK, many of which offered leaded \"four-star\" petrol, for which Bayford had a special dispensation to sell. At the same time, Gulf Lubricants (UK) Ltd was set up to market Gulf products in the UK, mostly manufactured by the Gulf Netherlands operation. This return by Gulf to the UK after a four-year absence used the slogan \"The Return of the Legend\". The post-2001 Gulf presence in the UK is a wholly network-based operation. It involves almost no direct Gulf investment in fixed assets, corporate infrastructure, or manufacturing capability. This is a complete contrast to the pre-1997 presence.\nIn January 2010, after using the name since 1986, Gulf Oil LP acquired all right, title and interest in the Gulf brand name in the United States and announced plans to expand the use of the Gulf brand beyond its parent company's Northeastern United States base. Its promotions have included sponsorship of major sporting events in the area with advertisements for Gulf in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. To take one case as an illustrative example of the Gulf revival, after Texaco's 2001 merger with Chevron, many former Texaco stations in Pittsburgh switched to Gulf since Chevron does not service the Greater Pittsburgh area. As a result, the Texaco brand name disappeared from the area in June 2004 when the nonexclusive rights agreement with Shell expired, with Shell itself expanding in the area by means other than Texaco. However, in June 2006, Chevron gave exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. In New England, former Exxon stations have been rebranded as Gulf, in accordance with the consent decree that allowed the merger of Exxon and Mobil. Many of the former Exxon stations feature a rectangular logo that fit into the existing sign standards used by Exxon. Gulf refers to the look as its \"sunrise\" imaging.\nIn March 2016, Gulf MX announced that they will put their own filling stations in Mexico, which is planned to begin operations in July of the same year to compete with the local company (PEMEX) (as a result of the recent changes in the local laws in matter of energy and oil resources). As said by Sergio De La Vega (CEO of Gulf Mexico), in order to improve a better service, Gulf will make fidelity programs and dedicated smartphone apps. for customers (improving fuel payment into the same, fuel administration and better experience with fidelity programs as another additional benefits) adding to modern service stations with more quality-added services.\nMarketing.\nThe Gulf logo is still used around the world by various businesses. GOI uses it for their marketing activities to focus on the sponsorship of motorsport teams including MotoGP teams Aprilia Racing Team Gresini, Trackhouse Racing and Formula 1 teams McLaren and Williams. This sponsorship is used across the world by Gulf distributors, alongside local activity demonstrating the GOI company ethos of \"your local global brand\".\nIn July 2020, GOI announced a multi-year strategic partnership with long time partner McLaren which includes Gulf being the preferred lubricant supplier to McLaren Automotive and a special Gulf livery for the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix. In February 2023, GOI announced a multi-year partnership with Williams Racing. For the 2023 Singapore, Japanese and Qatar Grands Prix, Williams raced a special Gulf livery chosen by a fan vote. In 2024, GOI and Williams announced a partnership extension and expansion to include GOI's coffee brand Reviva Coffee as the official coffee partner of Williams from 2025 onwards.\nIn 2023, Swansea City announced Reviva Coffee as the club\u2019s new main shirt sponsor. Gulf Oil have previously sponsored Swansea City between 1993 and 1996. For the 2025\u201326 season, Swansea City unveiled its third kit in Gulf colors.\nGulf products.\nMost filling stations in Europe sell three types of fuel: unleaded, LRP, and diesel. Although these products lack any real brand differentiation, this has not always been the case. Until well into the 1970s, Gulf (in common with other oil companies) sold distinctive brands of petrol/gasoline including subregular Gulftane (briefly a midgrade low lead), Good Gulf regular, Gulf No-Nox premium, Gulf Super Unleaded, and Gulfcrest (Regular Unleaded). Gulfcrest was also a super premium grade in the 1950s and early 1960s. Gulf petrol was sold using the slogans \"Good Gulf Gasoline,\" and \"Gulf \u2013 the Gas with Guts.\" Gulf service stations often supplied customers with pens and key rings bearing these slogans. For a few years, beginning in 1966, Gulf stations in the U.S. gave away orange plastic \"Extra Kick Horseshoes\" to customers who filled their tanks with Gulf's No-Nox premium fuel (the novelty items were commonly mounted on bumpers).\nGOI still produces and sells a wide range of branded oil based products including lubricants and greases of all kinds. These include products for a variety of applications ranging from metal working oils to refrigeration oils. Car engine oils include the Gulf Formula, Gulf MAX, and Gulf TEC ranges. Heavy duty diesel engine lubricants include the Gulf Supreme and Gulf Superfleet ranges.\nIn the summer of 2013, Gulf Oil licensed the \"Gulf\" name for racing fuels in a return to the American racing scene for the 2014 competition season. The fuels were announced at the Performance Racing Industry Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, in December 2013. The racing fuels support the World Racing League and the Formula Atlantic Championship in the United States.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59219", "revid": "38411991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59219", "title": "Sicarii", "text": "Group of Jewish assassins during the Jewish\u2013Roman wars\nThe Sicarii were a group of Jewish assassins who were active throughout Judaea in the years leading up to and during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, which took place at the end of the Second Temple period. Often associated with the Zealots (although this relationship is uncertain), they conducted a high-profile campaign of targeted assassinations of Romans and of Jews who collaborated with them. They later became notorious for a reported mass suicide during the Siege of Masada. The group's signature weapon and namesake was a type of large dagger known as a \"sica\", which they concealed in their cloaks before attacking their targets at public gatherings, thereafter blending in with the crowds to escape undetected.\nOther than the Roman-era Jewish historian Josephus, there are no sources for the history and activities of the Sicarii. According to Josephus's account, the Sicarii's victims may have included Jonathan the High Priest, who was assassinated inside of the Second Temple shortly after being designated as the High Priest of Israel; and more than 700 Jewish women and children at Ein Gedi on the Dead Sea.\nTo date, the Sicarii are one of the earliest known organized \"cloak and dagger\" assassination forces, predating the Order of Assassins and the ninjas (among other examples) by many centuries. Due to there only being a single source on the group, their true allegiances and motives remain subjects of discussion among historians. The group is not believed to have engaged in open conflict beyond Masada and possibly the Zealot Temple siege, when they executed any Jews advocating surrender to the Roman army.\nIn modern Israel, the legacy of the Sicarii was widely reviewed as part of the Masada myth, which asserts that the group was entirely dedicated to preserving Jewish national dignity during the Jewish\u2013Roman wars. While it served as a means of promoting feelings of resilience and nationalist pride in ancient Jewish history, the narrative has been scrutinized for downplaying Josephus's description of the Sicarii's fanaticism and murders of numerous innocent Jews. However, the popularity of the Masada myth in Israeli society has waned since the late 20th century due to the Sicarii's extremist connotations, which inspired Jewish terrorist groups like the Sicarii of 1989\u20131990, who claimed responsibility for a number of attacks against Palestinians and against Israelis who expressed support for the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process.\nEtymology.\nIn the Koine Greek of Josephus the term \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \"sikarioi\" was used. In Latin, \"Sicarii\" is the plural form of \"Sicarius\" \"dagger-man\", \"sickle-man\". \"Sica\", possibly from Proto-Albanian *tsik\u0101 (whence Albanian \"thika\", \"knife\"), from Proto-Indo-European *\u1e31ey- (\"to sharpen\") possibly via Illyrian. In later Latin usage, \"sicarius\" was also the standard term for a murderer (see, e.g., the \"Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficiis\"), and to this day \"sicario\" is a salaried assassin in Spanish and a commissioned murderer in Italian and Portuguese.\nThe term \u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd (Sikari\u014dn) is used in Acts 21:38 of the New Testament as an accusation against Paul the Apostle, when a tribune asks if he is the Egyptian who led \"4,000 men of the \"sicarii\" into the desert\". It is translated as \"terrorists\" in the New International Version, \"murderers\" in the King James Bible and \"assassins\" in the American Standard Version. According to historian Steve Mason, this reference is problematic because it lacks a clear connection to anti-Roman sentiments and is \"best explained as a mangled recollection of Josephus.\"\nThe derived Spanish term \"sicario\" is used in contemporary Latin America to describe a contract killer.\nHistory.\nThe Sicarii are known to history from only one source \u2013 Josephus. In a 2009 study \"The Sicarii in Josephus's Judean War\", Professor Mark Brighton of Concordia University Irvine wrote that Josephus referred to the Sicarii directly fifteen times in eight separate contexts of \"The Jewish War\":\nBrighton also noted five passages where the Sicarii are not mentioned directly but their activity is implied from the wider context:\nVictims of the Sicarii are said by Josephus to have included the High Priest Jonathan, and 700 Jewish women and children at Ein Gedi. Some murders were met with severe retaliation by the Romans on the broader Jewish population of the region. However, on some occasions, the Sicarii would release their intended victim if their terms were met. Much of what is known about the Sicarii comes from the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" and \"The Jewish War\" by Josephus, who wrote that the Sicarii agreed to release the kidnapped secretary of Eleazar, governor of the Temple precincts, in exchange for the release of ten captured assassins.\nAt the beginning of the First Roman-Jewish War, the Sicarii, and (possibly) Zealot helpers (Josephus differentiated between the two but did not explain the main differences in depth), gained access to Jerusalem and committed a series of actions in an attempt to incite the population into war against Rome. In one account, given in the Talmud, they destroyed the city's food supply, using starvation to force the people to fight against the Roman siege, instead of negotiating peace. Their leaders, including Menahem ben Yehuda and Eleazar ben Ya'ir, were notable figures in the war, and the group fought in many battles against the Romans as soldiers. Together with a small group of followers, Menahem made his way to the fortress of Masada, took over a Roman garrison and slaughtered all 700 soldiers there. They also took over another fortress called Antonia and overpowered the troops of Agrippa II. He also trained them to conduct various guerrilla operations on Roman convoys and legions stationed around Judea.\nJosephus also wrote that the Sicarii raided nearby Hebrew villages including Ein Gedi, where they massacred 700 Jewish women and children.\nThe Zealots, Sicarii and other prominent rebels finally joined forces to attack and temporarily take Jerusalem from Rome in 66 AD, where they took control of the Temple in Jerusalem, executing anyone who tried to oppose their power. The local populace resisted their control and launched a series of sieges and raids to remove the rebel factions. The rebels eventually silenced the uprising and Jerusalem stayed in their hands for the duration of the war. The Romans returned to take back the city, counter-attacking and laying siege to starve the rebels inside. The rebels held out for some time, but the constant bickering and lack of leadership caused the groups to disintegrate. The leader of the Sicarii, Menahem, was killed by rival factions during an altercation. Finally, the Romans regained control and destroyed the whole city in 70 AD.\nEleazar and his followers returned to Masada and continued their rebellion against the Romans until 73 AD. The Romans eventually took the fortress and, according to Josephus, found that most of its defenders had died by suicide rather than surrender. In Josephus' \"The Jewish War\" (vii), after the fall of the Temple in AD 70, the \"sicarii\" became the dominant revolutionary Hebrew faction, scattered abroad. Josephus particularly associates them with the mass suicide at Masada in AD 73 and to the subsequent refusal \"to submit to the taxation census when Cyrenius was sent to Judea to make one,\" as part of their rebellion's religious and political goals.\nJudas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, was believed by some to be a sicarius. Modern historians typically reject this contention, mainly because Josephus in \"The War of the Hebrews\" (2:254\u20137) mentions the appearance of the Sicarii as a new phenomenon during the procuratorships of Felix (52\u201360 AD), having no apparent relation with the group called Sicarii by Romans at times of Quirinius. The 2nd century compendium of Jewish oral law, the Mishnah (\"Makhshirin\" 1:6), mentions the word \"sikrin\" (), perhaps related to Sicarii, and which is explained by the early rabbinic commentators as being related to the (= robbers), and to government personnel involved with implementing the laws of Sicaricon. Maimonides, in his Mishnah commentary (\"Makhshirin\" 1:6), explains the same word \"sikrin\" as meaning \"people who harass and who are disposed to being violent.\"\nLegacy.\nThe Sicarii were the basis of the Masada myth in early Zionism. They also served as the namesake of several modern Jewish militant groups, both Zionist and anti-Zionist\u2014most notably the Sicarii of 1989 and the Sikrikim.\nIn popular culture.\nIn \"The Chosen\", the first multi-season series about the life of Jesus of Nazareth, Simon the Zealot is called a \"Zealot Sicarii\" in episode 7 of Season 2 (\"Reckoning\").\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line formula_3 is a basis for the Euclidean topology on formula_3 because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of formula_3 can be written as a union of some family of open intervals.\nBases are ubiquitous throughout topology. The sets in a base for a topology, which are called basic open sets, are often easier to describe and use than arbitrary open sets. Many important topological definitions such as continuity and convergence can be checked using only basic open sets instead of arbitrary open sets. Some topologies have a base of open sets with specific useful properties that may make checking such topological definitions easier.\nNot all families of subsets of a set formula_6 form a base for a topology on formula_6. Under some conditions detailed below, a family of subsets will form a base for a (unique) topology on formula_6, obtained by taking all possible unions of subfamilies. Such families of sets are very frequently used to define topologies. A weaker notion related to bases is that of a subbase for a topology. Bases for topologies are also closely related to neighborhood bases.\nDefinition and basic properties.\nGiven a topological space formula_9, a base (or basis) for the topology formula_10 (also called a \"base for\" formula_6 if the topology is understood) is a family formula_12 of open sets such that every open set of the topology can be represented as the union of some subfamily of formula_1. The elements of formula_1 are called \"basic open sets\".\nEquivalently, a family formula_1 of subsets of formula_6 is a base for the topology formula_10 if and only if formula_12 and for every open set formula_19 in formula_6 and point formula_21 there is some basic open set formula_22 such that formula_23.\nFor example, the collection of all open intervals in the real line forms a base for the standard topology on the real numbers. More generally, in a metric space formula_24 the collection of all open balls about points of formula_24 forms a base for the topology.\nIn general, a topological space formula_9 can have many bases. The whole topology formula_10 is always a base for itself (that is, formula_10 is a base for formula_10). For the real line, the collection of all open intervals is a base for the topology. So is the collection of all open intervals with rational endpoints, or the collection of all open intervals with irrational endpoints, for example. Note that two different bases need not have any basic open set in common. One of the topological properties of a space formula_6 is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology, called the weight of formula_6 and denoted formula_32. From the examples above, the real line has countable weight.\nIf formula_1 is a base for the topology formula_10 of a space formula_6, it satisfies the following properties:\n(B1) The elements of formula_1 \"cover\" formula_6, i.e., every point formula_38 belongs to some element of formula_1.\n(B2) For every formula_40 and every point formula_41, there exists some formula_42 such that formula_43.\nProperty (B1) corresponds to the fact that formula_6 is an open set; property (B2) corresponds to the fact that formula_45 is an open set.\nConversely, suppose formula_6 is just a set without any topology and formula_1 is a family of subsets of formula_6 satisfying properties (B1) and (B2). Then formula_1 is a base for the topology that it generates. More precisely, let formula_10 be the family of all subsets of formula_6 that are unions of subfamilies of formula_52 Then formula_10 is a topology on formula_6 and formula_1 is a base for formula_10.\n(Sketch: formula_10 defines a topology because it is stable under arbitrary unions by construction, it is stable under finite intersections by (B2), it contains formula_6 by (B1), and it contains the empty set as the union of the empty subfamily of formula_1. The family formula_1 is then a base for formula_10 by construction.) Such families of sets are a very common way of defining a topology.\nIn general, if formula_6 is a set and formula_1 is an arbitrary collection of subsets of formula_6, there is a (unique) smallest topology formula_10 on formula_6 containing formula_1. (This topology is the intersection of all topologies on formula_6 containing formula_1.) The topology formula_10 is called the topology generated by formula_1, and formula_1 is called a subbase for formula_10. \nThe topology formula_10 consists of formula_6 together with all arbitrary unions of finite intersections of elements of formula_1 (see the article about subbase.) Now, if formula_1 also satisfies properties (B1) and (B2), the topology generated by formula_1 can be described in a simpler way without having to take intersections: formula_10 is the set of all unions of elements of formula_1 (and formula_1 is a base for formula_10 in that case).\nThere is often an easy way to check condition (B2). If the intersection of any two elements of formula_1 is itself an element of formula_1 or is empty, then condition (B2) is automatically satisfied (by taking formula_85). For example, the Euclidean topology on the plane admits as a base the set of all open rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides, and a nonempty intersection of two such basic open sets is also a basic open set. But another base for the same topology is the collection of all open disks; and here the full (B2) condition is necessary.\nAn example of a collection of open sets that is not a base is the set formula_86 of all semi-infinite intervals of the forms formula_87 and formula_88 with formula_89. The topology generated by formula_86 contains all open intervals formula_91, hence formula_86 generates the standard topology on the real line. But formula_86 is only a subbase for the topology, not a base: a finite open interval formula_94 does not contain any element of formula_86 (equivalently, property (B2) does not hold).\nExamples.\nThe set \u0393 of all open intervals in formula_96 forms a basis for the Euclidean topology on formula_96.\nA non-empty family of subsets of a set X that is closed under finite intersections of two or more sets, which is called a \u03c0-system on X, is necessarily a base for a topology on X if and only if it covers X. By definition, every \u03c3-algebra, every filter (and so in particular, every neighborhood filter), and every topology is a covering \u03c0-system and so also a base for a topology. In fact, if \u0393 is a filter on X then { \u2205 } \u222a \u0393 is a topology on X and \u0393 is a basis for it. A base for a topology does not have to be closed under finite intersections and many are not. But nevertheless, many topologies are defined by bases that are also closed under finite intersections. For example, each of the following families of subset of formula_96 is closed under finite intersections and so each forms a basis for \"some\" topology on formula_96:\nObjects defined in terms of bases.\nThe Zariski topology on the spectrum of a ring has a base consisting of open sets that have specific useful properties. For the usual base for this topology, every finite intersection of basic open sets is a basic open set.\nBase for the closed sets.\nClosed sets are equally adept at describing the topology of a space. There is, therefore, a dual notion of a base for the closed sets of a topological space. Given a topological space formula_143 a family formula_144 of closed sets forms a base for the closed sets if and only if for each closed set formula_145 and each point formula_115 not in formula_145 there exists an element of formula_144 containing formula_145 but not containing formula_150\nA family formula_144 is a base for the closed sets of formula_6 if and only if its dual in formula_143 that is the family formula_154 of complements of members of formula_144, is a base for the open sets of formula_156\nLet formula_144 be a base for the closed sets of formula_156 Then\nAny collection of subsets of a set formula_6 satisfying these properties forms a base for the closed sets of a topology on formula_156 The closed sets of this topology are precisely the intersections of members of formula_170\nIn some cases it is more convenient to use a base for the closed sets rather than the open ones. For example, a space is completely regular if and only if the zero sets form a base for the closed sets. Given any topological space formula_143 the zero sets form the base for the closed sets of some topology on formula_156 This topology will be the finest completely regular topology on formula_6 coarser than the original one. In a similar vein, the Zariski topology on A\"n\" is defined by taking the zero sets of polynomial functions as a base for the closed sets.\nWeight and character.\nWe shall work with notions established in .\nFix formula_6 a topological space. Here, a network is a family formula_175 of sets, for which, for all points formula_115 and open neighbourhoods \"U\" containing formula_115, there exists formula_113 in formula_175 for which formula_180 Note that, unlike a basis, the sets in a network need not be open.\nWe define the weight, formula_32, as the minimum cardinality of a basis; we define the network weight, formula_182, as the minimum cardinality of a network; the character of a point, formula_183 as the minimum cardinality of a neighbourhood basis for formula_115 in formula_6; and the character of formula_6 to be\nformula_187\nThe point of computing the character and weight is to be able to tell what sort of bases and local bases can exist. We have the following facts:\nThe last fact follows from formula_216 being compact Hausdorff, and hence formula_217 (since compact metrizable spaces are necessarily second countable); as well as the fact that compact Hausdorff spaces are metrizable exactly in case they are second countable. (An application of this, for instance, is that every path in a Hausdorff space is compact metrizable.)\nIncreasing chains of open sets.\nUsing the above notation, suppose that formula_218 some infinite cardinal. Then there does not exist a strictly increasing sequence of open sets (equivalently strictly decreasing sequence of closed sets) of length formula_219.\nTo see this (without the axiom of choice), fix\nformula_220\nas a basis of open sets. And suppose \"per contra\", that\nformula_221\nwere a strictly increasing sequence of open sets. This means\nformula_222\nFor\nformula_223\nwe may use the basis to find some formula_224 with formula_115 in formula_226. In this way we may well-define a map, formula_227 mapping each formula_228 to the least formula_229 for which formula_226 and meets\nformula_231\nThis map is injective, otherwise there would be formula_232 with formula_233, which would further imply formula_234 but also meets\nformula_235\nwhich is a contradiction. But this would go to show that formula_236, a contradiction.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It uses a variety of audio codecs, ranging from low-bitrate formats that can be used over dialup modems, to high-fidelity formats for music. It can be used as a streaming audio format, that is played at the same time as it is downloaded.\nIn the past, many internet radio stations used RealAudio to stream their programming over the internet in real time. In recent years, however, the format has become less common and has given way to more popular audio formats. RealAudio was heavily used by the BBC websites until 2009, though it was discontinued due to its declining use. BBC World Service, the last of the BBC websites to use RealAudio, discontinued its use in March 2011.\nFile extensions.\nRealAudio files were originally identified by a filename extension of .ra (for Real Audio). In 1997, RealNetworks also began offering a video format called RealVideo. The combination of the audio and video formats was called RealMedia and used the file extension .rm. However, the latest version of RealProducer, Real's flagship encoder, reverted to using .ra for audio-only files, and began using .rv for video files (with or without audio), and .rmvb for VBR video files. The .ram (Real Audio Metadata) and .smil (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) file formats are sometimes encountered as links from web pages (see .Streaming Audio section below).\nPlayers.\nThe official player for RealMedia content is RealNetworks' RealPlayer SP, currently at version 16, and is available for various platforms in binary form. Several features of this program have proven controversial (most recently, RP11's ability to record unprotected streaming media from web sites), and many alternative players have been developed. RealNetworks initially tried to discourage development of alternative players by keeping their audio format secret. However, in recent years, RealNetworks has made efforts to be somewhat more open, and has founded the Helix Community, a collaborative open source project, to extend their media framework.\nWhen RealAudio was introduced, RealNetworks disclosed no technical details about the audio format or how it was encoded, but it was soon noticed that some of the audio codecs used in RealAudio were identical to those used in cellular telephones and digital television. As these formats had been described in detail in various technical papers and standards documents, it was possible to write software capable of playing RealAudio based on this information.\nA variety of unofficial players now exist, including MPlayer, and Real Alternative. However, Real Alternative does not decode the audio data by itself, but relies on the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) from the official RealPlayer. Thus Real Alternative requires RealPlayer to be installed (or at least its DLLs) in order to function. Most other players are based on FFmpeg, which has its own audio codec library. The audio codecs in ffmpeg were written based on the publicly available information about the formats, and do not use the RealPlayer or Helix software. It is also possible to obtain codecs which allow Windows Media Player to play some versions of RealAudio.\nAlthough RealNetworks has made the Helix player available as an open source project, they have kept some of the audio codecs proprietary, and the Helix player can not play all RealAudio files.\nStreaming audio.\nRealAudio was developed as a streaming media format, meaning that it can be played while it is downloaded. It is possible to stream RealAudio using HTTP. In this case, the RealAudio file is retrieved similarly to a normal web page, but playback begins as soon as the first part is received and continues while the rest of the file is downloaded. Using HTTP streaming works best with pre-recorded files so some alternative protocols have been developed which work better for live broadcasts.\nThe first version of RealAudio used a proprietary protocol called PNA or PNM to send streaming audio data. RealNetworks later switched to the IETF standardized Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) but they use RTSP only to manage the connection. The actual audio data is sent with their own proprietary RDT protocol, which they initially kept secret. Recently, some specifications for the RDT protocol have been made public through the Helix Community project. By around 2004 the open-source MPlayer project developed a means of playing the RDT streams.\nIn many cases, web pages do not link directly to a RealAudio file. Instead, they link to a .ram (Real Audio Metadata) or SMIL file. This is a small text file containing a link to the audio stream. When a user clicks on such a link, the user's web browser downloads the .ram or .smil file and launches the user's media player. The media player reads the PNM or RTSP URL from the file and then plays the stream.\nWith RealPlayer SP, it is now possible to save an audio stream to a file. Other programs, including MPlayer, RM Downloader, VLC media player, StreamBox VCR, HiDownload and Real7ime Converter can also save streams to a file.\nRealAudio: Pioneering real-time music streaming in 1998.\nThis section details the launch of Internet Music Net, a website credited by DJ Vinatea as one of the first, if not the very first, to offer real-time music streaming in 1998. The website utilized the then-pioneering RealAudio (.RA) technology, paving the way for a new era of online music consumption. \nThe emergence of real-time music streaming in the late 1990s revolutionized online music access. In 1998, Internet Music Net became a pioneer in this domain, offering users the ability to listen to music directly through their web browsers using RealAudio technology.\nThe development of RealAudio by Progressive Networks in the mid-1990s enabled efficient streaming of audio content over the internet. Internet Music Net capitalized on this innovation, launching in 1998 (archived on Wayback Machine) as one of the first websites to offer real-time music streaming. While details about the specific features are limited due to the archived nature of the website, it likely offered functionalities such as artist selection and genre browsing.\nInternet Music Net pioneering approach paved the way for the widespread adoption of real-time music streaming services. The concept of on-demand music access, popularized by this website, laid the groundwork for the development of future industry giants like Spotify and Pandora.\nAlthough the ultimate fate of Internet Music Net remains unclear (e.g., did it cease operation or get acquired?), its contribution to the evolution of online music consumption remains undeniable. The website stands as a testament to the early efforts that shaped the way we experience music today.\nCodecs.\nRealAudio files are compressed using several audio codecs. Each codec is identified by a four character code. Below is a list of the codecs and the version in which each was introduced:\nWhile the newest version of RealPlayer should be able to play any RealAudio file, other programs may not support all codecs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(\"The Texas Company\") is an American oil brand owned and operated by Chevron Corporation. Its flagship product is its fuel \"Texaco with Techron\". It also owned the Havoline motor oil brand. Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to Shell plc through its American division. It was one of the first gas stations to exist.\nTexaco began as the \"Texas Fuel Company\", founded in 1902 in Beaumont, Texas, by Joseph S. Cullinan, Thomas J. Donoghue, and Arnold Schlaet upon the discovery of oil at Spindletop. The Texas Fuel Company was not set up to drill wells or to produce crude oil. To accomplish this, Cullinan organized the Producers Oil Company in 1902, as a group of investors affiliated with The Texas Fuel Company. Men such as John W. (\"Bet A Million\") Gates invested in \"certificates of interest\" to an amount of almost ninety thousand dollars. Future restructuring would merge Producers Oil Company and The Texas Fuel Company as Texaco when the company needed additional funding, which J.W. Gates provided in the amount of approximately $590,000 in return for company stock.\nTexaco was one of the Seven Sisters which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Its current logo features a white star in a red circle (a reference to the lone star of Texas), leading to the long-running advertising jingles \"You can trust your car to the man who wears the star\" and \"Star of the American Road.\" The company was headquartered in Harrison, New York, near White Plains, prior to the merger with Chevron.\nTexaco gasoline comes with Techron, an additive developed by Chevron, as of 2005, replacing the previous CleanSystem3. The Texaco brand is strong in the U.S., Latin America, and West Africa. It has a presence in Europe as well; for example, it is a well-known retail brand in the UK, with around 980 Texaco-branded service stations.\nHistory.\n1902\u201359: Beginnings.\nTexaco was founded in Beaumont, Texas as the \"Texas Fuel Company\" in 1902, by Jim Hogg, Joseph S. Cullinan, John Warne Gates, and Arnold Schlaet. On 1 May 1902, the Texas Company was formed from the assets of Texas Fuel assets, and additional capitalization. In 1905, it established an operation in Antwerp, Belgium, under the name Continental Petroleum Company, which it acquired control of in 1913. In 1915, Texaco moved to new 13 story offices on 1111 Rusk St., Houston, Texas. In 1928, Texaco became the first U.S. oil company to sell its gasoline nationwide under one single brand name in all of the then 48 states.\nIn 1931, Texaco purchased the Indian Oil Company, based in Illinois. This expanded Texaco's refining and marketing base in the Midwest and also gave Texaco the rights to Indian's Havoline motor oil, which became a Texaco product. The next year, Texaco introduced Fire Chief gasoline nationwide, a so-called \"super-octane\" motor fuel touted as meeting or exceeding government standards for gasoline for fire engines and other emergency vehicles. It was promoted through a radio program over NBC hosted by Ed Wynn, called the \"Texaco Fire Chief\".\nIn 1936, the Texas Corporation purchased the Barco oil concession in Colombia, and formed a joint venture with Socony-Vacuum, now Mobil, to develop it. Over the next three years the company engaged in a highly challenging project to drill wells and build a pipeline to the coast across mountains and then through uncharted swamps and jungles. During this time, Texaco also illegally supplied the fascist Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War with a total of oil. For these illegal sales to Francisco Franco's fascist forces the company was fined $20,000 for violating the Neutrality Act of 1937, although it continued to sell to Franco on credit until the end of the war.\nAlso in 1936, marketing operations \"East of Suez\" (including Asia, East Africa, and Australasia) were placed into a joint venture with Standard Oil Company of California \u2013 Socal (now Chevron) \u2013 under the brand name Caltex, in exchange for Socal placing its Bahrain refinery and Arabian oilfields into the venture. The next year, Texaco commissioned industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague to develop a modern service station design.\nIn 1938, Texaco introduced Sky Chief gasoline, a premium fuel developed from the ground up as a high-octane gasoline rather than just an ethylized regular product. In 1939, Texaco became one of the first oil companies to introduce a \"Registered Rest Room\" program to ensure that restroom facilities at all Texaco stations nationwide maintained a standard level of cleanliness to the motoring public.\nAfter the onset of World War II in 1939, Texaco's CEO, Torkild Rieber, admirer of Hitler, hired pro-Nazi assistants who cabled Berlin \"coded information about ships leaving New York for Britain and what their cargoes were.\" This espionage easily enabled Hitler to destroy the ships. In 1940, Rieber was forced to resign when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the \"Herald Tribune\" through information produced by British Security Coordination. Life Magazine portrayed Rieber's resignation as unfair, advocating that he only dined with Westrick, and lent him a company car.\nDuring the war, Texaco ranked 93rd among United States corporations in the value of military production contracts. In 1947, Caltex expanded to include Texaco's European marketing operations. That same year, Texaco merged its British operation with Trinidad Leaseholds under the name Regent; it gained full control of Regent in 1956, but the Regent brand remained in use until 1968\u20139. In 1954, the company added the detergent additive Petrox to its \"Sky Chief\" gasoline, which was also souped up with higher octane to meet the antiknock needs of new cars with high-compression engines.\nThe next year, Texaco became the sole sponsor of \"The Huntley-Brinkley Report\" on NBC-TV. In 1959, the Texas Company changed its corporate name to Texaco, Inc. to better reflect the value of the Texaco brand name, which represented the biggest selling gasoline brand in the U.S. and only marketer selling gasoline under one brand name in all (by then) 50 states. It also acquired McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Ltd. of Canada and changes its name to Texaco Canada Limited. Around this time, Paragon Oil, a major fuel oil distribution company in the northeastern U.S., was acquired.\n1964\u201398: Various ventures.\nIn 1964, Texaco introduced the \"Matawan\" service station design at a station in Matawan, New Jersey. Two years later, Texaco replaced the long-running banjo sign with a new hexagon logo that had previously been test-marketed with the \"Matawan\" station design introduced two years earlier. The new logo featured a red outline with TEXACO in black bold lettering and a small banjo logo with a red star and green T at bottom. The following year, the Regent name was replaced by Texaco at British petrol stations. In 1970, in response to increasingly-stringent federal vehicle emissions standards that would induce automakers to install catalytic converters requiring equipped vehicles to run on unleaded gasoline, Texaco introduced their first regular-octane no-lead gasoline at stations in the Los Angeles area and throughout Southern California. Lead-Free Texaco became available nationwide in 1974. On November 20, 1980, the Lake Peigneur/Jefferson Island disaster occurred. Two years later, a new service station design was introduced. Several product names were also changed with the advent of self-service, including Lead-free Texaco to Texaco Unleaded, Fire Chief to Texaco Regular, and Super Lead-free Sky Chief to Texaco Super Unleaded.\nAt the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, members of the Medell\u00edn Cartel (including Pablo Escobar), the Colombian military, the U.S.-based corporation Texas Petroleum, the Colombian legislature, small industrialists, and wealthy cattle ranchers came together in a series of meetings in Puerto Boyac\u00e1, and formed a paramilitary organization known as \"Muerte a Secuestradores\" (\"Death to Kidnappers\", MAS) to defend their economic interests, and to provide protection for local elites from kidnappings and extortion. By 1983, Colombian internal affairs had registered 240 political killings by MAS death squads, mostly community leaders, elected officials, and farmers. \nOn November 19, 1985, Pennzoil won a US$10.53-billion verdict against Texaco, the largest civil verdict in US history up to that date. The court case sprang from Texaco having established a signed contract to buy Getty Oil after Pennzoil entered into an unsigned\u2014yet binding\u2014buyout contract with Gordon Getty. In 1987, Texaco filed for bankruptcy. It was the largest in U.S. history until 2001.\nIn January 1988, Texaco became the first major corporation in the UK to declare compulsory testing for HIV, a decision denounced by the Lesbian and Gay Employment Rights organisation as 'disastrous, irresponsible and pointless.' It was picketed by protesters from ACT UP London in March 1989, who also called for a British boycott of its petroleum products.\nIn January 1989, Texaco and Saudi Aramco agreed to form a joint venture known as Star Enterprise in which Saudi Aramco would own a 50% share of Texaco's refining and marketing operations in the eastern U.S. and Gulf Coast. In 1989, Texaco introduced System3 gasolines in all three grades of fuel, featuring the latest detergent additive technology to improve performance by reducing deposits that clog fuel injection systems. The Toronto-based Texaco Canada Incorporated subsidiary was sold to Imperial Oil with all Texaco Canada retail operations converted to the Esso brand. Two years later, the company was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, as a result of massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco's Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents.\nIn 1994, Texaco's System3 gasolines were replaced by new CleanSystem3 gasoline, marketed with claims of improved engine performance through additives designed to clean carbon from car-engine intake valves and combustion chambers. In 1995, Texaco merged their Danish and Norwegian downstream operations with those of Norsk Hydro under the new brand HydroTexaco. This joint venture was sold in 2007 to Norwegian retail interests as YX Energi, following the purchase of Hydro by Statoil. In 1996, Texaco paid over $170 million to settle racial discrimination lawsuits filed by Black employees at the company. It was the largest racial-discrimination lawsuit settlement in the U.S. at the time, and was particularly damaging to Texaco's public relations when tapes were released of meetings with company executives planning to destroy incriminating evidence.\n1999\u2013present: Chevron Corporation.\nIn 1999, the company formed the joint venture Equilon with Shell Oil Company, combining their Western and Midwestern U.S. refining and marketing. This gave rise to the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court antitrust case of \"Texaco Inc. v. Dagher\", which cleared both Texaco and Shell of any antitrust liability concerning the pricing of Equilon's gasoline. That same year, another joint venture, Motiva Enterprises, was formed with Shell Oil Company and Saudi Aramco in which the Star Enterprise operations were merged with the Eastern and Gulf Coast U.S. refining and marketing operations of Shell.\nIn October 2000, Chevron Corporation agreed to buy Texaco for US$billion (equivalent to $\u00a0billion in 2024). The merger was completed October 9, 2001. As required by the FTC consent agreement, Texaco's interest in the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures were sold to Shell. Shell began re-branding its Texaco stations as Shell the next year. Around 2003, due to lack of demand, Texaco closed Refineria Panam\u00e1, a refinery in Col\u00f3n, Panama. In July 2004, Chevron regained non-exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. The following year, in August, Texaco introduced the Techron additive into its fuels in the U.S. and parts of Latin America. In 2007, Delek Benelux took over marketing activities for Chevron in Benelux, including 869 filling stations, mostly under the Texaco brand. In 2010, Chevron ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic US, removing its brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C.\nCorporate headquarters.\nPrior to the merger with Chevron, Texaco's headquarters was a building in Harrison, in Westchester County, New York, near White Plains. In 2002, Chevron Corporation sold the former Texaco Headquarters to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley bought the building and the surrounding for $42 million.\nTexaco leased 14 floors of the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City in the 1930s. As part of the leasing agreement with Texaco the building opened the Cloud Club, a lunch club for executives. Texaco's move to Westchester County in 1977 contributed to the closure of the Cloud Club in 1979.\nSponsorships.\nSports.\nTexaco is associated with the Havoline brand of motor oil and other automotive products. It was one of the sponsors of NASCAR with many drivers, such as Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett, Kenny Irwin Jr., Ricky Rudd, Jamie McMurray, Casey Mears, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Havoline continuously sponsored a car from the early 1980s to 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Texaco/Havoline ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and Chip Ganassi Racing. This brought a 20-plus-year relationship with the sport to a close.\nTexaco was also involved in open wheel racing, sponsoring the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston along with sponsoring drivers like Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti and his son Michael.\nIn Formula One, Texaco sponsored the Team Lotus in 1972 and 1973, and McLaren from 1974 to 1978. The company returned to Grand Prix racing at a smaller scale in 1997, with their brands appearing on the Stewart SF01 car. Their association with the team and its successor, Jaguar Racing, continued until the end of 2001, in the same timeline they also sponsored ITV's Formula 1 Coverage.\nTexaco sponsored the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Rover Vitesse factory team at the 1985 and 1986 European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) under their Bastos brand, and the Ford Sierra RS500 factory cars entered by Eggenberger Motorsport in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship (plus the 1988 ETCC and other European-based championships). Texaco also sponsored cars in the 1987 World Rally Championship.\nFrom 1987 to 1993, Texaco was the major sponsor (through its Australian Caltex offshoot) Colin Bond Racing in Australian touring car racing, first with the Alfa Romeo 75 in 1987, then the Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988 to 1992 and then Toyota Corollas in 1993. From 2000 until 2007, it was title sponsor of Stone Brothers Racing with Russell Ingall winning the 2005 championship. In 2016, Caltex became title sponsor of the Triple Eight Race Engineering car of Craig Lowndes, having previously been an associate sponsor of the team.\nFrom 1984 to 1998, Texaco were the title sponsors of the main One Day International cricket tournament in England, the Texaco Trophy. It also sponsored the Texaco Cup, a football tournament for clubs of the British Isles.\nEntertainment broadcast (music or comedy/variety).\nTexaco was long associated with the Metropolitan Opera as sole sponsor of its radio broadcasts for 63 years. It was identified as well with such entertainment legends as Ed Wynn, Fred Allen and Milton Berle (many of their shows were originally sponsored by Texaco \u2013 see Texaco Star Theatre, which includes the sponsorship lyrics of the opening theme: \"We're the men of Texaco, We work from Maine to Mexico...\"). Berle's program was broadcast in the same time slot as Fulton J. Sheen's religious program for a while, thus leading to Berle's oft-quoted quip, \"We both have the same boss \u2013 Sky Chief!\"\nTexaco was also the sponsor of the weekly Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, which air to this day since its inception in 1931.\nIn the 1930s, comedian Ed Wynn hosted a half hour stand-up comedy/variety show on the NBC Radio Network, billed as \"The Texaco Fire Chief\", a reference to its regular grade gasoline. This trend continued into the late 1940s, when Wynn was replaced by Milton Berle as television becoming the dominant medium. The title was changed to the 60-minute \"Texaco Star Theater\", which was also broadcast on NBC.\nIn a 1983 video for their song, \"Cruel Summer\", members of girl group Bananarama are depicted as working as mechanics at a Texaco gas station.\nEnvironmental issues.\nFrom 1965 to 1993, Texaco participated in a consortium to develop the Lago Agrio oil field in Ecuador. The company was accused of extensive environmental damage from these operations, and faces legal claims from both private plaintiffs and from the government of Ecuador. The case was widely publicized by environmental activists and was the subject of \"Crude\", a 2009 documentary film by Joe Berlinger.\nIn turn, Texaco's owner Chevron claims that it was being unfairly targeted as a deep pocket defendant, when the actual responsibility lies with the government and its national oil company, Petroecuador.\nTexaco allegedly decided to forgo their standard drilling practices in favor for a minor savings on the cost to produce a barrel of crude oil (approximately $3/barrel). Texaco allegedly dumped toxic wastewater directly into rivers and waste into unlined pits, and created pits that were fitted with overflow pipes to nearby waterways, with pits also never being emptied after the drilling operations were concluded. In total, it is estimated that over 18 billion gallons of toxic waste were released into the Amazon rainforest. In addition to the liquid pollution, it is alleged that workers burned off toxic natural gasses and some liquid waste, thus releasing highly toxic dioxins into the atmosphere.\nDiversification.\nThe NiMH chemistry used in modern hybrid vehicles was invented by ECD Ovonics founder Stan Ovshinsky, and Dr. Masahiko Oshitani of the Yuasa Company In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics's battery development and manufacturing. On October 10, 2001, Texaco purchased GM's share in GM Ovonics, and Chevron completed its acquisition of Texaco six days later. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is usually used in reference to a kind of fret in architecture, or to a badge or insignia used in military or police uniforms to indicate rank or length of service, or in heraldry and the designs of flags (see flag terminology).\nAncient history.\nAppearing on pottery and petrographs throughout the ancient world, the chevron can be considered to be one of the oldest symbols in human history, with V-shaped markings occurring as early as the Neolithic era (6th to 5th millennia BC) as part of the Vin\u010da symbols inventory. The Vin\u010da culture responsible for the symbols appear to have used the chevron as part of a larger proto-writing system rather than any sort of heraldic or decorative use, and are not known to have passed the symbol on to any subsequent cultures.\nMany comparatively recent examples appear from approximately 1800 BC onward, beginning as part of an archaeological recovery of pottery designs from the palace of Knossos on Crete in the modern day country of Greece. Furthermore the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma produced pottery with decorative repertoire confined to geometric designs such as chevrons.\nHeraldry.\nA chevron is one of the heraldic ordinaries, the simple geometrical figures which are the foundation of many coats of arms. A chevron is constructed by choosing a visually appealing angle such as the golden angle or any other angle the artist prefers. It can be subject to a number of modifications including inversion. When the ends are cut off in a way that looks like the splintered ends of a broken piece of wood, with an irregular zig-zag pattern, it is called \u00e9clat\u00e9. When shown as a smaller size than standard, it is a diminutive called a chevronel.\nChevrons appeared early in the history of heraldry, especially in Normandy. In Scandinavia the chevron is known as \"sparre\"; an early example appears in the arms of Armand Desmondly.\nRank insignia.\nIn Western European tradition, chevrons are used as an insignia of the ranks variously known, depending on the country, as non-commissioned officer or sub-officer ranks. This usage has become the worldwide norm, but there are many exceptions where other insignia, typically stripes but sometimes stars, are used for such ranks instead.\nMany countries, such as France and Italy, use chevrons proper, or colloquially, the chevrons \"point up\". Many others, such as most Commonwealth countries, use inverted chevrons, or colloquially, the chevrons \"point down.\"\nIn the United States, the Army and Marines use chevrons proper (although prior to the 20th century this was not true), while the Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard use inverted chevrons. Arcs, known as \"rockers\", are also added to chevrons to indicate higher rank.\nEnglish-speaking countries tend to use three chevrons for a sergeant and two for a corporal.\nCanadian and Australian Forces often refer to chevrons as \"hooks\". In the Dutch armed forces they are nicknamed \"banana peels\".\nIn the British Army, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, chevrons are worn point down to denote non-commissioned officer rank, with one for lance corporal, two for corporal, three for sergeant, and three with a crown for staff sergeant (known as colour sergeant in infantry regiments and the Royal Marines) or flight sergeant (RAF). Branch and tradition results in variations in rank titles (corporal of horse being the equivalent of sergeant in the Household Cavalry) and spellings (serjeant in The Rifles). Large chevrons are also worn on the sleeves of Royal Navy sailors to denote good conduct rather than rank.\nAlthough usually associated with non-commissioned officers, the chevron was originally used as an insignia to denote general officer ranks in the British Army. It was adopted from the insignia worn by cavalry during the 18th century, in particular the Household Cavalry. It was worn on the cuffs, forearms and tails of their coats, embroidered in gold bullion for the guards and silver for dragoons regiments. George III favoured the uniform of the Horse Guards, and his Windsor uniform followed a similar pattern. After 1768, a similar pattern uniform as worn by the King was introduced to general officers, with the number and spacing of the chevrons denoting rank. For example, a major general would wear his chevrons in pairs: two on the sleeves, and two on the tails. A lieutenant general would wear them in groups of three, and a full general's would be equidistant. This practice continued into the early Victorian era.\nVexillology.\nIn vexillology, a chevron is a V-shaped stripe placed on a flag. It most often issues from the hoist and points toward the fly, or rises from the base and points upward. Chevrons may also be inverted and can appear in other orientations or placements across the field. The device may be narrow or broad, single or repeated, and may reach the flag\u2019s edges or be couped (not touching them). A well-known example of a true chevron in flag design is the flag of the North American Vexillological Association. Other examples include the flag of Eva\u0148, Czech Republic, Tulsky, Russia or the flag of the Southern African Vexillological Association, which contains two chevrons, one inverted. A chevron is not to be confused with a triangle, wedge, or pile, which are solid shapes rather than angled stripes.\nOther uses as insignia.\nIn some armies, small chevrons are worn on the lower left sleeve to indicate length of service, akin to service stripes in the U.S. military. The Israel Defense Forces use chevrons in various orientations as organizational designators on their vehicles, specifically which company within a battalion they belong to.\nNATO armed forces use the \"\u039b\" chevron as insignia to represent the alliance between different armies, during peacekeeping missions.\nThe US-led coalition that took part in Operation Desert Storm used a black \"\u039b\" chevron in a similar manner as NATO forces use it on their ground vehicles. The design was created by a soldier from the 3rd Armored Division after the US military sought markings to identify coalition vehicles due to increased fratricide incidents. Its symbolism, according to the artist SGT Grzywa, was meant to be a V for Victory, a tribute to WWII Coalition Forces.\n\"V\" chevrons were historically used as the insignia of the Russian Volunteer Army during the Russian Civil War, and in modern times as one of the military insignia by Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Russian civilians have used it in support of their government.\nFrench car maker Citro\u00ebn uses a double chevron as its logo.\nChevrons on their side are also used as road signs to denote bends.\nFrom the early 1950s until the early 2000s, Simplex, Faraday and many other companies manufactured the chevron series fire alarm manual pull station. The handle was shaped in a way where the handle looked like an inverted chevron.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59231", "revid": "15638483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59231", "title": "Exception handling", "text": "Programming language construct for special conditions\nIn computing and computer programming, exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence of \"exceptions\" \u2013 anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing \u2013 during the execution of a program. In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered \"exception handler\"; the details of how this is done depend on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. \nExceptions are defined by different layers of a computer system, and the typical layers are CPU-defined interrupts, operating system (OS)-defined signals, programming language-defined exceptions. Each layer requires different ways of exception handling although they may be interrelated, e.g. a CPU interrupt could be turned into an OS signal. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.\nDefinition.\nThe definition of an exception is based on the observation that each procedure has a precondition, a set of circumstances for which it will terminate \"normally\". An exception handling mechanism allows the procedure to \"raise an exception\" if this precondition is violated, for example if the procedure has been called on an abnormal set of arguments. The exception handling mechanism then \"handles\" the exception.\nThe precondition, and the definition of exception, is subjective. The set of \"normal\" circumstances is defined entirely by the programmer, e.g. the programmer may deem division by zero to be undefined, hence an exception, or devise some behavior such as returning zero or a special \"ZERO DIVIDE\" value (circumventing the need for exceptions). Common exceptions include an invalid argument (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function), an unavailable resource (like a missing file, a network drive error, or out-of-memory errors), or that the routine has detected a normal condition that requires special handling, e.g., attention, end of file. Social pressure is a major influence on the scope of exceptions and use of exception-handling mechanisms, i.e. \"examples of use, typically found in core libraries, and code examples in technical books, magazine articles, and online discussion forums, and in an organization\u2019s code standards\".\nException handling solves the semipredicate problem, in that the mechanism distinguishes normal return values from erroneous ones. In languages without built-in exception handling such as C, routines would need to signal the error in some other way, such as the common return code and errno pattern. Taking a broad view, errors can be considered to be a proper subset of exceptions, and explicit error mechanisms such as errno can be considered (verbose) forms of exception handling. The term \"exception\" is preferred to \"error\" because it does not imply that anything is wrong - a condition viewed as an error by one procedure or programmer may not be viewed that way by another.\nThe term \"exception\" may be misleading because its connotation of \"anomaly\" indicates that raising an exception is abnormal or unusual, when in fact raising the exception may be a normal and usual situation in the program. For example, suppose a lookup function for an associative array throws an exception if the key has no value associated. Depending on context, this \"key absent\" exception may occur much more often than a successful lookup.\nHistory.\nThe first hardware exception handling was found in the UNIVAC I from 1951. \nArithmetic overflow executed two instructions at address 0 which could transfer control or fix up the result.\nSoftware exception handling developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward.\nHardware exceptions.\nThere is no clear consensus as to the exact meaning of an exception with respect to hardware. From the implementation point of view, it is handled identically to an interrupt: the processor halts execution of the current program, looks up the interrupt handler in the interrupt vector table for that exception or interrupt condition, saves state, and switches control.\nIEEE 754 floating-point exceptions.\nException handling in the IEEE 754 floating-point standard refers in general to exceptional conditions and defines an exception as \"an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application. That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.\"\nBy default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C language revision C99 for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.\nThe IEEE 754 standard uses the term \"trapping\" to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard. The standard recommends several usage scenarios for this, including the implementation of non-default pre-substitution of a value followed by resumption, to concisely handle removable singularities.\nThe default IEEE 754 exception handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, the 1996 Cluster spacecraft launch ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error. William Kahan claims the default IEEE 754 exception handling behavior would have prevented this.\nIn user interfaces.\nFront-end web development frameworks, such as React and Vue, have introduced error handling mechanisms where errors propagate up the user interface (UI) component hierarchy, in a way that is analogous to how errors propagate up the call stack in executing code. Here the error boundary mechanism serves as an analogue to the typical try-catch mechanism. Thus a component can ensure that errors from its child components are caught and handled, and not propagated up to parent components.\nFor example, in Vue.js, a component would catch errors by implementing codice_1\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pre/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhen used like this in markup:\n&lt;parent&gt;\n &lt;child&gt;&lt;/child&gt;\n&lt;/parent&gt;\nThe error produced by the child component is caught and handled by the parent component.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as (). Set had a positive role where he accompanied Ra on his barque to repel Apep (Apophis), the serpent of Chaos. Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant. He was lord of the Red Land (desert), where he was the balance to Horus' role as lord of the Black Land (fertile land).\nIn the Osiris myth, the most important Egyptian myth, Set is portrayed as the usurper who murdered and mutilated his own brother, Osiris. Osiris's sister-wife, Isis, reassembled his corpse and resurrected her dead brother-husband with the help of the goddess Nephthys. The resurrection lasted long enough to conceive his son and heir, Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set, and many of the ancient Egyptian myths describe their conflicts.\nFamily.\nSet is the son of Geb, the Earth, and Nut, the Sky; his siblings are Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. He married the latter, and though it has commonly been assumed that they were the parents of Anubis, some Egyptologists, such as Herman te Velde, have doubted whether Set was ever regarded as Anubis's father in ancient Egyptian religion (Osiris being the father of this god instead). Seth also had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat and Astarte in some accounts. From these relationships is said to be born a crocodile deity called Maga.\nName origin.\nThe meaning of the name \"Set\" is unknown, but it is thought to have been originally pronounced *\"s\u016bti\u1e96\" [\u02c8suw.tix\u02b2] based on spellings of his name in Egyptian hieroglyphs as \"st\u1e96\" and \"swt\u1e96\". The Late Egyptian spelling \"st\u0161\" reflects the palatalization of \"\u1e96\" while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like \"swtj.\" The Coptic form of the name, \u2ca5\u2c8f\u2ca7 \"S\u0113t,\" is the basis for the English vocalization.\nSet animal.\nIn art, Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the \"Set animal\", a beast not identified with any known animal, although it could be seen as resembling a Saluki, an aardvark, an African wild dog, a donkey, a hyena, a jackal, a pig, an antelope, a giraffe, or a fennec fox. The animal has a downward curving snout; long ears with squared-off ends; a thin, forked tail with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; and a slender canine body. Sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe, owing to the large flat-topped \"horns\" which correspond to a giraffe's ossicones. The Egyptians themselves, however, used distinct depictions for the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is usually depicted as a donkey or as a man with the head of a donkey, and in the \"Book of the Faiyum\", Set is depicted with a flamingo head.\nThe earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the Amratian culture (\"Naqada\u00a0I\") of prehistoric Egypt (3790\u20133500 BCE), although this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a ceremonial macehead of Scorpion II, a ruler of the Naqada III phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present on the mace.\nConflict of Horus and Set.\nAn important element of Set's mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew, Horus, for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in \"Contendings\", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.\nThe rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the \"Pyramid Texts\", the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.\nThe divine struggle involves many episodes. \"Contendings\" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.\nIn a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \"Contendings\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \"gives birth\" to the disk. In \"Contendings\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.\nAnother important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. Egyptologist Herman te\u00a0Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's eye, when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te\u00a0Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.\nIn any case, the restoration of the eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of \"ma'at\". Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.\nProtector of Ra.\nSet was depicted standing on the prow of Ra's barge defeating the dark serpent Apep. In some Late Period representations, such as in the Persian Period Temple of Hibis at Khargah, Set was represented in this role with a falcon's head, taking on the guise of Horus. In the \"Amduat\", Set is described as having a key role in overcoming Apep.\nSet in the Second Intermediate, Ramesside and later periods.\nDuring the Second Intermediate Period (1650\u20131550\u00a0BCE), a group of Near Eastern peoples, known as the \"Hyksos\" (literally, \"rulers of foreign lands\") gained control of Lower Egypt, and ruled the Nile Delta, from Avaris. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, Hadad, as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King Apophis is recorded as worshiping Set exclusively, as described in the following passage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;King Apophis chose for his Lord the god Seth. He did not worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.\u2014\u200a\nJan Assmann argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \"lonely\" god lacking personality, Set the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.\nWhen Ahmose\u00a0I overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, in c.\u20091522\u00a0BCE, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became xenophobic, and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.\nThe founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Ramesses I came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably Seti\u00a0I (literally, \"man of Set\") and Setnakht (literally, \"Set is strong\"). In addition, one of the garrisons of Ramesses\u00a0II held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses\u00a0II erected the so-called \"Year 400 Stela\" at Pi-Ramesses, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta.\nIn ancient Egyptian astronomy, Set was commonly associated with the planet Mercury.\nSet also became associated with foreign gods during the New Kingdom, particularly in the delta. Set was identified by the Egyptians with the Hittite deity Teshub, who, like Set, was a storm god, and the Canaanite deity Baal, being worshipped together as \"Seth-Baal\".\nAdditionally, Set is depicted in part of the Greek Magical Papyri, a body of texts forming a grimoire used in Greco-Roman magic during the fourth century CE.\nThe demonization of Set.\nAccording to Herman te\u00a0Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the Kushite and Persian empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.\nSet's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks would later associate Set with Typhon and Yahweh, a monstrous and evil force of raging nature (being the three of them depicted as donkey-like creatures, classifying their worshippers as onolatrists).\nSet and Typhon also had in common that both were sons of deities representing the Earth (Gaia and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, Zeus for Typhon). Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.\nAncient Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney shot an episode called \"The Birth of the Devil\" in the \"Out of Egypt\" documentary series. In this documentary, the scientist describes the process of demonization of Set and the positioning of the it as absolute evil on the opposite side, in parallel with the transition to monotheism in different regions from Rome to India, where God began to be perceived as the representative of absolute goodness.\nSet temples.\nSet was worshipped at the temples of Ombos (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near Kom Ombo), at Oxyrhynchus in Middle Egypt, and also in part of the Fayyum area.\nMore specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of Sepermeru, especially during the Ramesside Period. There, Set was honored with an important temple called the \"House of Set, Lord of Sepermeru\". One of the epithets of this town was \"gateway to the desert\", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called \"The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm\", and Ramesses\u00a0II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called \"The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\".\nThe two temples of Set and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets. Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Set is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna. The close association of Set temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this \"milieu\" is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another \"House of Set\" and another \"House of Nephthys\" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.\nPapyrus Bologna preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the \"House of Set\" in the now-lost town of Punodjem (\"The Sweet Place\"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Set) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: \"The ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples\".\nNothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts \u2014 for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Set, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Set's consort-goddess. When, by the Twentieth Dynasty, the \"demonization\" of Set was ostensibly inaugurated, Set was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome\u00a0VII, \"Hwt-Sekhem\"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.\nSet's cult persisted even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion, in outlying but important places like Kharga, Dakhlah, Deir el-Hagar, Mut, and Kellis. In these places, Set was considered \"Lord of the Oasis / Town\" and Nephthys was likewise venerated as \"Mistress of the Oasis\" at Set's side, in his temples (esp. the dedication of a Nephthys-cult statue). Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as \"Mistress\" in the Osirian temples of these districts as part of the specifically Osirian college. It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Set and Nephthys, as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys.\nIn modern religion.\nSet, in modern religious contexts, is recognized primarily through Kemetism and the Temple of Set. Kemetism, a modern revival of ancient Egyptian religion, acknowledges Set as a complex deity associated with chaos, storms, and warfare, yet also protector against the serpent Apep. The Temple of Set, founded in 1975, venerates Set as a figure of isolation and self-deification, emphasizing personal enlightenment and the exploration of the left-hand path.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the television series \"Doctor Who\", Set (using the name Sutekh and portrayed by Gabriel Woolf) is depicted as an alien entity bent on destroying all life. He first appears in the 1975 serial \"Pyramids of Mars\", where he schemes to escape an Egyptian pyramid he has been imprisoned in millennia ago by Horus. Sutekh returned after nearly 50 years in the 2024 Series 14 two-part finale \"The Legend of Ruby Sunday\" / \"Empire of Death\" as the God of Death in the Pantheon.\nIn recent digital reinterpretations of mythological figures, Set has appeared in small-scale mythology documentation websites and community archives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Those who study entomology are known as entomologists. In the past, the term \"insect\" was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of animals in other arthropod groups, such as arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. The field is also referred to as insectology in American English, while in British English insectology implies the study of the relationships between insects and humans.\nOver 1.3million insect species have been described by entomology.\nHistory.\nEntomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping). The natural Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 CE) wrote a book on the kinds of insects, while the scientist of Kufa, Ibn al-A'r\u0101b\u012b (760\u2013845 CE) wrote a book on flies, (). However scientific study in the modern sense began only relatively recently, in the 16th century. Ulisse Aldrovandi's (Concerning Insect Animals) was published in 1602. Microscopist Jan Swammerdam published \"The\" \"History of Insects\", correctly describing the reproductive organs of insects and metamorphosis. In 1705, Maria Sibylla Merian published the book about the tropical insects of Dutch Surinam.\nEarly entomological works associated with the naming and classification of species followed the practice of maintaining cabinets of curiosity, predominantly in Europe. This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy, and there developed a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the \"era of heroic entomology\". William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, \"Introduction to Entomology\", regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade spawned the \"era of economic entomology\" which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology.\nEntomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Jean-Henri Fabre, Vladimir Nabokov, Karl von Frisch (winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), and twice Pulitzer Prize winner E. O. Wilson.\nThere has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance, such as Sophie Lutterlough at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with butterflies and (to a lesser extent) dragonflies being the most popular.\nMost insects can easily be allocated to order, such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles). However, identifying to genus or species is usually only possible through the use of identification keys and monographs. Because the class Insecta contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 species of beetles alone) and the characteristics distinguishing them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a microscope), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of automated species identification systems targeted on insects, for example, Daisy, ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing.\nApplications.\nPest control.\nIn 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new professional certification program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a \"true entomologist\" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing a PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs or Associate Certified Entomologists.\nAs such, other credential programs managed by the Entomological Society of America have varying credential requirements. These different programs are known as Public Health Entomology (PHE), Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), and Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs) (ESA Certification Corporation). To be qualified in public health entomology (PHE), one must pass an exam on the types of arthropods that can spread diseases and lead to medical complications (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals also have to \"agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior\" (ESA Certification Corporation). Individuals who are planning to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), need to obtain at around 1\u20134 years of experience in pest management and successfully pass an exam, that is based on the information, with they are acquainted with (ESA Certification Corporation). Like in Public Health Entomology (PHE), those who want to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs) also have to \"agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior\" (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals must also be approved to use pesticides (ESA Certification Corporation). For those who plan on becoming Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs), individuals have to pass two exams and \"agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior\" (ESA Certification Corporation). As with this, they also have to fulfill a certain number of educational requirements every 12 months (ESA Certification Corporation).\nForensics.\nForensic entomology is a branch of forensic science that studies insects found on corpses or elsewhere around crime scenes. This includes studying the types of insects commonly found on cadavers, their life cycles, their presence in different environments, and how insect assemblages change with decomposition.\nMedicine.\nMedical entomology is focused upon insects and arthropods that impact human health. Veterinary entomology is included in this category, because many animal diseases can \"jump species\" and become a human health threat, for example, bovine encephalitis. Medical entomology also includes scientific research on the behavior, ecology, and epidemiology of arthropod disease vectors, and involves a tremendous outreach to the public, including local and state officials and other stake holders in the interest of public safety.\nSubdisciplines.\nMany entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own generic names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group:\nOrganizations.\nLike other scientific specialties, entomologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas.\nResearch collection.\nHere is a list of selected very large insect collections, housed in museums, universities, or research institutes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I suppose you are an entomologist?\"\n\"Not quite so ambitious as that, sir.

Its IMA symbol is Amp. Amphiboles can be green, black, colorless, white, yellow, blue, or brown. The International Mineralogical Association currently classifies amphiboles as a mineral supergroup, within which are two groups and several subgroups.\nMineralogy.\nAmphiboles crystallize into two crystal systems, monoclinic and orthorhombic. In chemical composition and general characteristics they are similar to the pyroxenes. The chief differences from pyroxenes are that (i) amphiboles contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl) and (ii) the basic structure is a double chain of tetrahedra (as opposed to the single chain structure of pyroxene). Most apparent, in hand specimens, is that amphiboles form oblique cleavage planes (at around 120 degrees), whereas pyroxenes have cleavage angles of approximately 90 degrees. Amphiboles are also specifically less dense than the corresponding pyroxenes. Amphiboles are the primary constituent of amphibolites.\nStructure.\nLike pyroxenes, amphiboles are classified as inosilicate (chain silicate) minerals. However, the pyroxene structure is built around single chains of silica tetrahedra while amphiboles are built around double chains of silica tetrahedra. In other words, as with almost all silicate minerals, each silicon ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions. In amphiboles, some of the oxygen ions are shared between silicon ions to form a double chain structure as depicted below. These chains extend along the [001] axis of the crystal. One side of each chain has \"apical\" oxygen ions, shared by only one silicon ion, and pairs of double chains are bound to each other by metal ions that connect apical oxygen ions. The pairs of double chains have been likened to I-beams. Each I-beam is bonded to its neighbor by additional metal ions to form the complete crystal structure. Large gaps in the structure may be empty or partially filled by large metal ions, such as sodium, but remain points of weakness that help define the cleavage planes of the crystal.\nIn rocks.\nAmphiboles are minerals of either igneous or metamorphic origin. Amphiboles are more common in intermediate to felsic igneous rocks than in mafic igneous rocks, because the higher silica and dissolved water content of the more evolved magmas favors formation of amphiboles rather than pyroxenes. The highest amphibole content, around 20%, is found in andesites. Hornblende is widespread in igneous and metamorphic rocks and is particularly common in syenites and diorites. Calcium is sometimes a constituent of naturally occurring amphiboles. Amphiboles of metamorphic origin include those developed in limestones by contact metamorphism (tremolite) and those formed by the alteration of other ferromagnesian minerals (such as hornblende as an alteration product of pyroxene). Pseudomorphs of amphibole after pyroxene are known as uralite.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe name \"amphibole\" derives from Greek (, lit.\u2009'double entendre'), implying ambiguity. The name was used by to include tremolite, actinolite and hornblende. The group was so named by Ha\u00fcy in allusion to the protean variety, in composition and appearance, assumed by its minerals. This term has since been applied to the whole group. Numerous sub-species and varieties are distinguished, the more important of which are tabulated below in two series. The formulae of each will be seen to be built on the general double-chain silicate formula RSi4O11.\nFour of the amphibole minerals are commonly called asbestos. These are: anthophyllite, riebeckite, the cummingtonite/grunerite series, and the actinolite/tremolite series. The cummingtonite/grunerite series is often termed amosite or \"brown asbestos\", and riebeckite is known as crocidolite or \"blue asbestos\". These are generally called amphibole asbestos. Mining, manufacture and prolonged use of these minerals can cause serious illnesses.\nMineral species.\nThe more common amphiboles are classified as shown in the following table:\nOther species.\nOrthorhombic series\nMonoclinic series\nSeries.\nCertain amphibole minerals form solid solution series, at least at elevated temperature. Ferrous iron usually substitutes freely for magnesium in amphiboles to form continuous solid solution series between magnesium-rich and iron-rich endmembers. These include the cummington (magnesium) to grunerite (iron) endmembers, where the dividing line is placed at 30% magnesium.\nIn addition, the orthoamphiboles, anthophyllite and gedrite, which differ in their aluminium content, form a continuous solid solution at elevated temperature. As the amphibole cools, the two end members exsolve to form very thin layers (lamellae).\nHornblende is highly variable in composition, and includes at least five solid solution series: magnesiohornblende-ferrohornblende (), tschermakite-ferrotschermakite (), edenite-ferroedenite (), pargasite-ferropargasite () and magnesiohastingstite-hastingsite (). In addition, titanium, manganese, or chromium can substitute for some of the cations and oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine for some of the hydroxide. The different chemical types are almost impossible to distinguish even by optical or X-ray methods, and detailed chemical analysis using an electron microprobe is required.\nGlaucophane to riebeckite form yet another solid solution series, which also extends towards hornblende and arfvedsonite.\nThere is \"not\" a continuous series between calcic clinoamphiboles, such as hornblende, and low-calcium amphiboles, such as orthoamphiboles or the cummingtonite-grunerite series. Compositions intermediate in calcium are almost nonexistent in nature. However, there is a solid solution series between hornblende and tremolite-actinolite at elevated temperature. A miscibility gap exists at lower temperatures, and, as a result, hornblende often contains exsolution lamellae of grunerite.\nDescriptions.\nOn account of the wide variations in chemical composition, the different members vary considerably in properties and general appearance.\nAnthophyllite occurs as brownish, fibrous or lamellar masses with hornblende in mica-schist at Kongsberg in Norway and some other localities. An aluminous related species is known as gedrite and a deep green Russian variety containing little iron as kupfferite.\nHornblende is an important constituent of many igneous rocks. It is also an important constituent of amphibolites formed by metamorphism of basalt.\nActinolite is an important and common member of the monoclinic series, forming radiating groups of acicular crystals of a bright green or greyish-green color. It occurs frequently as a constituent of greenschists. The name (from Greek \"\u1f00\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c2, \u1f00\u03ba\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2/akt\u00eds, akt\u00eenos\", a 'ray' and \"\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2/l\u00edthos\", a 'stone') is a translation of the old German word \"Strahlstein\" (radiated stone).\nGlaucophane, crocidolite, riebeckite and arfvedsonite form a somewhat special group of alkali-amphiboles. The first two are blue fibrous minerals, with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and crocidolite (blue asbestos) in ironstone formations, both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes. The latter two are dark green minerals, which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium, such as nepheline-syenite and phonolite.\nPargasite is a rare magnesium-rich variety of hornblende with essential sodium, usually found in ultramafic rocks. For instance, it occurs in uncommon mantle xenoliths, carried up by kimberlite. It is hard, dense, black and usually automorphic, with a red-brown pleochroism in petrographic thin section.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first domesticated in Mesoamerica, within modern-day southern Mexico and Central America. It is grown in several countries in regions with a tropical climate. In 2022, India produced 38% of the world's supply of papayas.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"papaya\" derives from the Caribbean Ta\u00edno \"paapa\u00eda\" and is also the name for the plant. Some etymologists argue that the word comes from the Mayan \"p\u00e1apay-ya\", which means \"mottled sapote\". However, the most commonly accepted etymology is the Ta\u00edno one, although it is possible that both word origins are interrelated. The name \"papaw\" or \"pawpaw\" is used alternatively for the fruit only in some regions, that name generally referring to \"Asimina triloba\", an unrelated tree and fruit.\nDescription.\nThe papaya is a small, sparsely branched tree, usually with a single stem growing from tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. All plant parts contain latex in articulated laticifers.\nFlowers.\nPapayas are dioecious. The flowers are five-parted and highly dimorphic; the male flowers have the stamens fused to the petals. There are two different types of papaya flowers. The female flowers have a superior ovary and five contorted petals loosely connected at the base.\nMale and female flowers are borne in the leaf axils; the male flowers are in multiflowered dichasia, and the female ones are in few-flowered dichasia. The pollen grains are elongated and approximately 35 microns in length. The flowers are sweet-scented, open at night, and are wind- or insect-pollinated.\nFruit.\nThe fruit is a large berry about long and in diameter. It is ripe when it feels soft (as soft as a ripe avocado or softer) and its skin has attained an amber to orange hue. Along the walls of the large central cavity are attached numerous black seeds.\nSkin, Seed.\nPapaya skin, pulp, and seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals, including carotenoids and polyphenols, as well as benzyl isothiocyanates and benzyl glucosinates, with skin and pulp levels that increase during ripening. The carotenoids, lutein and beta-carotene, are prominent in the yellow skin, while lycopene is dominant in the red flesh (table). Papaya seeds also contain the cyanogenic substance prunasin. The green fruit contains papain, a cysteine protease enzyme used to tenderize meat (see below).\nDistribution and habitat.\nNative to tropical America, papaya originates from southern Mexico and Central America. Papaya is also considered native to southern Florida, introduced by predecessors of the Calusa no later than AD 300. Spaniards introduced papaya to the Old World in the 16th century. Papaya cultivation is now nearly pantropical, spanning Hawaii, Central Africa, India, and Australia.\nWild populations of papaya are generally confined to naturally disturbed tropical forests. Papaya is found in abundance on Everglades hammocks following major hurricanes, but is otherwise infrequent. In the rain forests of southern Mexico, papaya thrives and reproduces quickly in canopy gaps while dying off in the mature closed-canopy forests.\nEcology.\nViruses.\nPapaya ringspot virus is a well-known virus within plants in Florida. The first signs of the virus are yellowing and vein-clearing of younger leaves and mottling yellow leaves. Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen, or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and, in time, become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are a darker green than the fruit. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit's quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is genetic modification.\nThe papaya mosaic virus destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves is left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as two weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has a mottling of colors, and the mosaic does not.\nFungi and oomycetes.\nThe fungus anthracnose attacks papaya, especially mature fruits. The disease starts small with very few signs, such as water-soaked spots on ripening fruits. The spots become sunken, turn brown or black, and may get bigger. In some of the older spots, the fungus may produce pink spores. The fruit ends up being soft and having an off flavor because the fungus grows into the fruit.\nThe fungus powdery mildew occurs as a superficial white presence on the leaf's surface, which is easily recognized. Tiny, light yellow spots begin on the lower surfaces of the leaf as the disease starts to make its way. The spots enlarge, and white powdery growth appears on the leaves. The infection usually appears at the upper leaf surface as white fungal growth. Powdery mildew is not as severe as other diseases.\nThe fungus-like oomycete \"Phytophthora\" causes damping-off, root rot, stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot. Damping-off happens in young plants by wilting and death. The spots on established plants start as white, water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots enlarge and eventually cause death. The disease's most dangerous feature is the fruit's infection, which may be toxic to consumers. The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.\nPests.\nThe papaya fruit fly lays its eggs inside of the fruit, possibly up to 100 or more eggs. The eggs usually hatch within 12 days when they begin to feed on seeds and interior parts of the fruit. When the larvae mature, usually 16 days after being hatched, they eat their way out of the fruit, drop to the ground, and pupate in the soil to emerge within one to two weeks later as mature flies. The infected papaya turns yellow and drops to the ground after the papaya fruit fly infestation.\nThe two-spotted spider mite is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish-yellow translucent oval pest. They all have needle-like piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by piercing the plant tissue with their mouthparts, usually on the underside of the plant. The spider mites spin fine threads of webbing on the host plant, and when they remove the sap, the mesophyll tissue collapses, and a small chlorotic spot forms at the feeding sites. The leaves of the papaya fruit turn yellow, gray, or bronze. If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.\nThe papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves. They eat papaya leaves, therefore damaging the fruit. There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars. The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage. The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage. The next instars are flattened, oval, and scale-like. In the final stage, the pupal whiteflies are more convex, with large, conspicuously red eyes.\nPapayas are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies like \"A. suspensa\", which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled papayas. The larvae of these flies then consume the fruit to gain nutrients until they can proceed into the pupal stage. This parasitism has led to extensive economic costs for nations in Central America.\nCultivation.\nHistorical accounts from 18th-century travelers and botanists suggested that papaya seeds were transported from the Caribbean to Malacca and then to India. From Malacca or the Philippines, papaya spread throughout Asia and into the South Pacific region. Credit for introducing papaya to Hawaii is often given to Francisco de Paula Mar\u00edn, a Spanish explorer and horticulturist, who brought it from the Marquesas Islands in the early 1800s. Since then, papaya cultivation has expanded to all tropical countries and many subtropical regions worldwide. Today, papaya is grown extensively across the globe, owing to its adaptability to various climates and its popularity as a tropical fruit.\nPapaya plants grow in three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female produces small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. The hermaphrodite can self-pollinate since its flowers contain both male stamens and female ovaries. Almost all commercial papaya orchards contain only hermaphrodites.\nOriginally from southern Mexico (particularly Chiapas and Veracruz), Central America, northern South America, and southern Florida the papaya is now cultivated in most tropical countries. In cultivation, it grows rapidly, fruiting within three years. It is, however, highly frost-sensitive, limiting its production to tropical climates. Temperatures below are greatly harmful, if not fatal. In Florida, California, and Texas, growth is generally limited to the southern parts of those states. It prefers sandy, well-drained soil, as standing water can kill the plant within 24 hours.\nCultivars.\nTwo kinds of papayas are commonly grown. One has sweet, red, or orange flesh, and the other has yellow flesh; in Australia, these are called \"red papaya\" and \"yellow papaw,\" respectively. Either kind, picked green, is called a \"green papaya.\"\nThe large-fruited, red-fleshed 'Maradol,' 'Sunrise,' and 'Caribbean Red' papayas often sold in U.S. markets are commonly grown in Mexico and Belize.\nIn 2011, Philippine researchers reported that by hybridizing papaya with \"Vasconcellea quercifolia\", they had developed papaya resistant to papaya ringspot virus (PRV), part of a long line of attempts to transfer resistance from \"Vasconcellea\" species into papaya.\nGenetically engineered cultivars.\n\"Carica papaya\" was the first transgenic fruit tree to have its genome sequenced. In response to the papaya ringspot virus outbreak in Hawaii in 1998, genetically altered papaya were approved and brought to market (including 'SunUp' and 'Rainbow' varieties.) Varieties resistant to PRV have some DNA of this virus incorporated into the plant's DNA. As of 2010, 80% of Hawaiian papaya plants were genetically modified. The modifications were made by University of Hawai\u02bbi scientists, who made the modified seeds available to farmers without charge.\nIn transgenic papaya, resistance is produced by inserting the viral coat protein gene into the plant's genome. Doing so seems to cause a similar protective reaction in the plant to \"cross-protection\", which involves using an attenuated virus to protect against a more dangerous strain. Conventional varieties of transgenic papaya has reduced resistance against heterologous (not closely related to the coat gene source) strains, forcing different localities to develop their own transgenic varieties. As of 2016, one transgenic line appears able to deal with three different heterologous strains in addition to its source.\nProduction.\nIn 2023, world production of papayas was 14 million tonnes, led by India with 37% of the total (table). \nGlobal papaya production grew significantly over the early 21st century, mainly as a result of increased production in India and demand by the United States. The United States is the largest importer of papayas worldwide.\nIn South Africa, papaya orchards yield up to 100 tonnes of fruit per hectare.\nToxicity.\nPapaya releases a latex fluid when not ripe, possibly causing irritation and an allergic reaction in some people. Because the enzyme papain acts as an allergen in sensitive individuals, meat that has been tenderized with it may induce an allergic reaction.\nVernacular names.\nThe papaya plant is known by various regional names in India, reflecting its widespread cultivation and use in local cuisines and traditional medicine.\nCulinary use.\nThe ripe fruit of the papaya is usually eaten raw, without skin or seeds. The black seeds are edible and have a sharp, spicy taste. The unripe green fruit is usually cooked due to its latex content.\nBoth green papaya fruit and its latex are rich in papain, a cysteine protease used for tenderizing meat and other proteins, as practiced currently by indigenous Americans, people of the Caribbean region, Pacific Islands, and the Philippines. It is included as a component in some powdered meat tenderizers. Papaya is not suitable for foods which set due to gelatin (such as jelly or aspic) because the enzymatic properties of papain prevent gelatin from setting.\nNutrition.\nRaw papaya pulp is 88% water, 11% carbohydrates, and contains negligible fat and protein (table). In a reference amount of , papaya fruit provides 43 kilocalories and is a significant source of vitamin C (69% of the Daily Value, DV) and a moderate source of folate (10% DV), but otherwise has a low content of micronutrients (table).\nSoutheast Asia.\nGreen papaya is used in Southeast Asian cooking, both raw and cooked. In some parts of Asia, the young leaves of the papaya are steamed and eaten like spinach.\nIn Myanmar, the unripe papaya are cut into slices and dipped into sour, fermented, or spicy seasonings and dips. In Myanmar and Thai recipes, the unripe papaya are cut into thinner slices to make papaya salad. The reason the unripe papaya is used is because of the firmer and crunchier texture.\nPapayas became a part of Filipino cuisine after being introduced to the islands via the Manila galleons. Unripe or nearly ripe papayas (with orange flesh but still hard and green) are julienned and are commonly pickled into \"atchara\", which is ubiquitous as a side dish to salty dishes. Nearly ripe papayas can also be eaten fresh as \"ensaladang papaya\" (papaya salad) or cubed and eaten dipped in vinegar or salt. Green papaya is also a common ingredient or filling in various savory dishes such as \"okoy\", \"tinola\", \"ginataan\", \"lumpia\", and \"empanada\", especially in the cuisines of northern Luzon.\nIn Indonesian cuisine, the unripe green fruits and young leaves are boiled for use as part of \"lalab\" salad, while the flower buds are saut\u00e9ed and stir-fried with chilies and green tomatoes as Minahasan papaya flower vegetable dish.\nIn Lao and Thai cuisine, unripe green papayas are used to make a type of spicy salad known in Laos as \"tam maak hoong\" or \"tam som\" and in Thailand as \"som tam.\" It is also used in Thai curries, such as \"kaeng som\".\nSouth America.\nIn Brazil and Paraguay, the unripe fruits are used to make sweets or preserves.\nTraditional medicine.\nIn traditional medicine, papaya leaves have been believed useful as a treatment for malaria, an abortifacient, a purgative, or smoked to relieve asthma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is Queensland's second-largest city after Brisbane, as well as Australia's sixth-largest city and the most populous non-capital city. The city's central business district is located roughly in the centre of the Gold Coast in the suburb of Southport. The urban area of the Gold Coast is concentrated along the coast, sprawling almost 60 kilometres, joining up with the Greater Brisbane metropolitan region to the north and to the state border with New South Wales to the south. Nicknames of the city include the \u2018Glitter Strip\u2019 and the \u2018Goldy\u2019. The demonym of a Gold Coast resident is Gold Coaster.\nThe area that became the Gold Coast was originally inhabited by the indigenous Yugambeh people. The city grew from a collection of small townships, the earliest being Nerang in 1865. From the 1920s onwards, tourism led to significant economic growth in the region, and by 1959 the Gold Coast was declared a city, with its first high-rise being built in 1960. The Gold Coast boomed from the 1980s onwards with skyscraper construction. This era was defined by the city's \u2018white-shoe brigade\u2019 developers, neon lights, and organised crime, particularly the yakuza and the Russian mafia. The late 20th century saw the city's tourism diversify with theme park openings, and in the early 21st century became an international destination for film production.\nThe Gold Coast has a diverse economy with strengths in health, tourism, arts and culture, and construction, with a GDP of AU$49.3\u00a0billion as of 2024. The city ranks highly as one of the country's cultural and creative hotspots, alongside content creators, a growing video games industry, and leads Australia in startups per capita.\nThe Gold Coast is central to the nation's entertainment industry with a major film and television production industry, leading to the city's metonym of Goldywood. The Gold Coast is also host of the AACTA Awards and the Gold Coast Film Festival.\nThe Gold Coast is a major tourist destination with a sunny, subtropical climate and has become widely known for its surfing beaches (such as Surfers Paradise), high-rise buildings, theme parks, nightlife, and rainforest hinterland.\nHistory.\nThe Gold Coast is the ancestral home of a number of Indigenous clans of the Yugambeh people, including the Kombumerri, Mununjali, and Wangerriburra clans. Europeans arrived in 1823 when explorer John Oxley explored the Tweed River. The hinterland's timber supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century.\nA number of small townships developed along the coast and in the hinterland. The western suburb of Nerang was surveyed and established as a base for the industry and by 1870 a town reserve had been set aside. By 1873, the town reserve of Burleigh Heads had also been surveyed and successful land sales had taken place. In 1875, the small settlement opposite the boat passage at the head of the Nerang River, known as Nerang Heads or Nerang Creek Heads, was surveyed and renamed Southport, with the first land sales scheduled to take place in Beenleigh. Southport quickly grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for wealthy Brisbane residents.\nPost-World War One Era saw the rise of the \"seaside shack\". The seaside shack provided the opportunity for the coastal \"getaway\" with modest investment. \u00a0From 1914 to 1946, they popped up all along the South Coast. Seaside shacks were exceedingly cheap and were an early use of the concept of recycling. Many were built of disused or second grade timber, all kinds of materials were used for the holiday seaside shack \u2013 including fibro cement, metal containers, and left-over farm sheds; even disused trams were sold off as seaside shacks.\nAfter the establishment of the Surfers Paradise Hotel in the late 1920s, the Gold Coast region grew significantly. The Gold Coast was originally known as the South Coast (because it was south of Brisbane). However, over-inflated prices for real estate and other goods and services led to the nickname of \"Gold Coast\" from 1950. South Coast locals initially considered the name \"Gold Coast\" derogatory. However, soon the \"Gold Coast\" simply became a convenient way to refer to the holiday strip from Southport to Coolangatta. The Town of South Coast was formed through the amalgamation of Town of Coolangatta and Town of Southport along with the coastal areas (such as Burleigh Heads) from the Shire of Nerang on 17 June 1949, with the effect of having the present-day Gold Coast coastal strip as a single local government area. As the tourism industry grew into the 1950s, local businesses began to adopt the term \"Gold Coast\" in their names, and on 23 October 1958 the Town of South Coast was renamed Town of Gold Coast. The area was proclaimed a city, less than one year later on 16 May 1959.\nThe area boomed in the 1980s as a leading tourist destination. In 1994, the City of Gold Coast local government area was expanded to include the Shire of Albert.\nIn 2007, the Gold Coast overtook the population of Newcastle, New South Wales, to become the sixth largest city in Australia and the largest non-capital city.\nThe Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nDemographics.\nIn the 2016 census, the urban area of the Gold Coast had a population of 540,559 people. According to the 2016 census, the population of the Gold Coast including rural areas was 569,997. The median age was 39 years old, 1 year older than the nationwide median. The male-to-female ratio was 48.6-to-51.4. The most commonly nominated ancestries were English (29.3%), Australian (22.5%), Irish (8.2%), Scottish (7.5%), and German (3.6%). 64% of people were born in Australia, while the other most common countries of birth were New Zealand (7.9%), England (5.2%), China and South Africa (1.2% each), and Japan (0.7%). Indigenous Australians accounted for 1.7% of the population. The most commonly spoken languages other than English were Mandarin (1.6%), Japanese (1.0%), Korean and Spanish (0.6% each), and Cantonese (0.5%).\nAccording to the Australian Official Census in 2021, the most common religious affiliations in Gold Coast reported were none (43.4%), Catholic (18.2%), Anglican (11.9%), Uniting Church (2.9%), Non-denominational Christian (3.1%), Presbyterian and Reformed (1.9%), Buddhism (1.4%), Pentecostal (1.3%), Baptist (1.1%), Hinduism (1.1%) and Islam (1.0%).\nGeography.\nThe Gold Coast is approximately half covered by forests of various types. This includes small patches of near-pristine ancient rainforest, mangrove-covered islands, and patches of coastal heathlands and farmland with areas of uncleared eucalyptus forest. Of the plantation pine forests that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, when commercial forest planting for tax minimisation was encouraged by the Commonwealth government, tiny remnants remain. Most of the Gold Coast area was covered by forest prior to European human settlement and extensive land clearing in the 19th century.\nGold Coast City lies in the southeast corner of Queensland, to the south of Brisbane, the state capital. The Albert River separates the Gold Coast from Logan City, a local government area south of the City of Brisbane.\nGold Coast City stretches from the Albert River, Logan River, and Southern Moreton Bay to the border with New South Wales (NSW) approximately south, and extends from the coast west to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range in World Heritage listed Lamington National Park.The southernmost town of Gold Coast City, Coolangatta, includes Point Danger and its lighthouse. Coolangatta is a twin city with Tweed Heads located directly across the NSW border. At , this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of North Stradbroke is slightly further east). From Coolangatta, approximately forty kilometres of holiday resorts and surfing beaches stretch north to the suburb of Main Beach, and then further on Stradbroke Island. The suburbs of Southport and Surfers Paradise form the Gold Coast's commercial centre. The major river in the area is the Nerang River. Much of the land between the coastal strip and the hinterland were once wetlands drained by this river, but the swamps have been converted into man-made waterways (over in length or over 9 times the length of the canals of Venice, Italy) and artificial islands covered in upmarket homes. The heavily developed coastal strip sits on a narrow barrier sandbar between these waterways and the sea.\nTo the west, the city borders a part of the Great Dividing Range commonly referred to as the Gold Coast hinterland. A section of the mountain range is protected by Lamington National Park and has been listed as a World Heritage area in recognition of its \"outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species\". The area attracts bushwalkers and day-trippers. Important rainforest pollinating and seed-dispersing Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) are found in the area and may be heard foraging at night.\nUrban structure.\nThe City of Gold Coast includes suburbs, localities, towns and rural districts.\nThe declaration of Southport as a Priority Development Area (PDA) and new investment into the CBD is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities.\nWaterways.\nWaterfront canal living is a feature of the Gold Coast. Most canal frontage homes have pontoons. The Gold Coast Seaway, between The Spit and South Stradbroke Island, allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from The Broadwater and many of the city's canal estates. Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent longshore drift and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.\nResidential canals were first built in the Gold Coast in the 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek and to the north along the Gold Coast Broadwater, South Stradbroke Island, Coomera River and southern Moreton Bay. Early canals included Florida Gardens and Isle of Capri which were under construction at the time of a 1954 flood. Recently constructed canals include Harbour Quays and Riverlinks completed in 2007. There are over of constructed residential waterfront land within the city that is home to over 80,000 residents.\nBeaches.\nThe city consists of of coastline, with some of the most popular surf breaks in Australia and the world, including South Stradbroke Island, The Spit, Main Beach, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Nobby's Beach, Miami, North Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Heads, Tallebudgera Beach, Palm Beach, South Palm Beach, Currumbin Beach, Tugun, Bilinga, North Kirra Beach Kirra, Coolangatta, Greenmount, Rainbow Bay, Snapper Rocks and Froggies Beach. There is almost 42\u00a0km of unbroken beachfront. Duranbah Beach is one of the world's best known surfing beaches and is often thought of as being part of Gold Coast City, but is actually just across the New South Wales state border in the Tweed Shire.\nThere are also beaches along many of the Gold Coast's of navigable tidal waterways. Popular inland beaches include Southport, Budds Beach, Marine Stadium, Currumbin Alley, Tallebudgera Estuary, Jacobs Well, Jabiru Island, Paradise Point, Harley Park Labrador, Santa Barbara, Boykambil and Evandale Lake.Beach safety and management\nThe Gold Coast has Australia's largest professional surf lifesaving service to protect people on the beaches and to promote surf safety throughout the community. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries carries out the Queensland Shark Control Program (SCP) to protect swimmers from sharks. Sharks are caught by using nets and baited drumlines off the major swimming beaches. Even with the SCP, sharks do range within sight of the patrolled beaches. Lifeguards will clear swimmers from the water if it is considered that there is a safety risk.\nGold Coast beaches have experienced periods of severe beach erosion. In 1967, a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise what to do about the beach erosion. The Delft Report was published in 1971 and outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches including Gold Coast Seaway, works at Narrow Neck that resulted in the Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy and works at the Tweed River that became the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project.\nBy 2005 most of the recommendations of the 1971 Delft Report had been implemented. City of Gold Coast commenced implementation of the Palm Beach Protection Strategy but ran into considerable opposition from the community participating in a NO REEF protest campaign. The City of Gold Coast Council then committed to completing a review of beach management practices to update the Delft Report. The Gold Coast Shoreline Management Plan will be delivered by organisations including the Environmental Protection Agency, City of Gold Coast and the Griffith Centre for Coastal Management. Gold Coast City is also investing into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway that provides sustainable transport along Gold Coast beaches.\nClimate.\nThe Gold Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa/Cwa\"), with mild to warm winters and hot, humid summers. The city experiences substantial summer precipitation mostly concentrated in thunderstorms and heavy showers with rain events occasionally lasting up to a few weeks at a time, while winter is pleasantly mild to warm with little rain. In fact, it is for this pleasant winter weather that both the city and the Sunshine Coast\u2014the coastal region north of Brisbane\u2014are internationally renowned. Extreme temperatures recorded at Gold Coast Seaway have ranged from on 19 July 2007 to on 22 February 2005, although the city rarely experiences temperatures above in summer or below in winter. The average temperature of the sea at Surfers Paradise ranges from in July and August to in February.\nGovernment.\nAdministratively, the Gold Coast is a local government area called the City of Gold Coast. The City of Gold Coast Council has 14 elected councillors, each representing a division of the city. Businessman Tom Tate is the current Mayor of the Gold Coast, first elected in 2012. Former mayors include Ron Clake, Gary Baildon, Lex Bell, Ray Stevens, Ern Harley and Sir Bruce Small, who was responsible for the development of many of the canal estates that are now home to thousands of Gold Coast residents.\nAt the state level, the Gold Coast area is represented by eleven members in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The seats they hold are: Bonney, Broadwater, Burleigh, Coomera, Currumbin, Gaven, Mermaid Beach, Mudgeeraba, Southport, Surfers Paradise and Theodore. Federally, the Gold Coast area is split between five divisions in the House of Representatives: Fadden (northern), Moncrieff (central) and McPherson (southern) are located entirely within the Gold Coast, while Forde (north-west) and Wright (south-west) encompass parts of the Gold Coast and other areas of Southeast Queensland.\nPolitically, the Gold Coast has often tilted conservative. It was a Country Party bastion for most of the first three decades after World War II, but increasing urbanisation has made it a Liberal stronghold. Labor has historically only done well around Labrador and Coolangatta. Only one Labor MP has ever represented a significant portion of the Gold Coast at the federal level since 1949; the three Gold Coast divisions have only returned Liberals since 1984. At the state level, Labor was fairly competitive in the Gold Coast for most of the early part of the 21st century. However, as part of its massive landslide in the 2012 state election, the Liberal National Party won every seat there. The LNP repeated its sweep of the Gold Coast seats at the 2015 election, and retained all but one Gold Coast seat at the 2017 state election.\nSouthport Courthouse is the city's major courthouse and has jurisdiction to hear petty criminal offences and civil matters up to A$250,000. Indictable offences, criminal sentencing and civil matters above A$250,000 are heard in the higher Supreme Court of Queensland which is located in Brisbane. There is also a subsidiary Magistrates Court, located at the southern suburb of Coolangatta.\nIn 2013 a brawl between members of Outlaw motorcycle gangs also called \"bikies\" who fought each other outside a Broadbeach restaurant caused mass fear to restaurant patrons and police. This led to the toughest anti-bikie laws introduced in Australia known as Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013.\nEconomy.\nIn fifty years, Gold Coast City has grown from a small beachside holiday destination to Australia's sixth largest city (and the country's most populous non-capital city). Situated within South East Queensland's growth corridor, the Gold Coast is one of Australia's fastest growing large cities, with a 5-year annual average population growth rate to 2015 of 1.8%, compared to 1.5% nationally. Gross Regional Product has risen from A$9.7\u00a0billion in 2001, to A$15.6\u00a0billion in 2008, a rise of 61 percent. Tourism remains fundamental to Gold Coast City's economy, with almost 10 million visitors a year to the area. In the past the economy was driven by the population derived industries of construction, tourism and retail. Some diversification has taken place, with the city now having an industrial base formed of marine, education, information communication and technology, food, tourism, creative, environment and sports industries. These nine industries have been identified as the key industries by the City of Gold Coast Council to deliver the city's economic prosperity. Gold Coast City's unemployment rate (5.6 per cent) is below the national level (5.9 per cent). The declaration of Southport as the Gold Coast central business district (CBD) and a Priority Development Area (PDA), as well as new investment into the CBD, is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities.\nThe Gold Coast Economic Development Strategy 2013\u20132023 outlines the framework for the city's long-term growth and prosperity. The strategy outlines actions in the following areas, Innovation, Culture, Infrastructure, Competitive business, Workforce, International.\nTourism.\nThe Gold Coast is the most popular tourist destination in Queensland. It is Australia's 5th most visited destination by international tourists. Around 10 million tourists visit the Gold Coast area every year consisting of 849,114 international visitors, 3,468,000 domestic overnight visitors and 5,366,000 daytrip visitors. Tourism is the region's biggest industry, directly contributing more than $4.4\u00a0billion into the city economy every year and directly accounting for one in four jobs in the city There are approximately 65,000 beds, of beach, of canal, 100,000 hectares of nature reserve, 500 restaurants, 40 golf courses and five major theme parks in the city.\nGold Coast Airport provides connection across Australia and internationally with airlines including Jetstar, Qantas, Air New Zealand, Scoot, Virgin Australia and Airasia X. Brisbane Airport is less than one hour from the centre of Gold Coast, and direct trains operate.\nGold Coast City has over 13,000 available guest rooms contributing over $335\u00a0million to the local economy each year. Accommodation options available range from hostels to five star resorts and hotels. Tourist attractions include surf beaches. The big atractions are the nyumorous theme parks in the area. Theme parks include Dreamworld, Sea World, Wet'n'Wild Water World, Warner Bros. Movie World, WhiteWater World, Topgolf, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, David Fleay Wildlife Park, Australian Outback Spectacular, and Paradise Country.\nSince the opening of what was then the world's highest residential tower in 2005 (it is now the 17th highest), the Q1 building has been a destination for tourists and locals alike. It is the second highest public vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere after the Eureka Tower in Melbourne. The observation deck at level 77 is the highest of its kind in Queensland and offers views in all directions, from Brisbane to Byron Bay. It towers over the Surfers Paradise skyline, with the observation deck high, and the spire extending nearly another hundred metres up. In total, the Q1 is high, making it the tallest building in Australia. Another famous tourist attraction are the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the Meter Maids dispense coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle. The Maids are still a part of the Surfers Paradise culture but the scheme is now run by private enterprise.\nChinatown, Gold Coast, is an integral part of the revitalisation of Southport as an international CBD.\nFilm production.\nThe Gold Coast is the major film production hub in Queensland and has accounted for 75% of all film production in Queensland since the 1990s, with an expenditure of around $150\u00a0million per year. The Gold Coast is the third largest film production centre in Australia, behind Sydney and Melbourne.It is the filming site for major motion pictures including \"Muriel's Wedding\" (1994), \"Ghost Ship\" (2002), \"Scooby-Doo\" (2002), \"House of Wax\" (2005), \"Superman Returns\" (2006), \"Unbroken\" (2014), \"The Inbetweeners 2\" (2014), \"San Andreas\" (2015), ' (2017), ' (2017), ' (2017), ' (2018), \"Aquaman\" (2018), \"Dora the Explorer\" (2019) and \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" (2021).\nVillage Roadshow Studios are adjacent to the Warner Bros Movie World Theme Park at Oxenford. The Studios consists of eight sound stages, production offices, editing rooms, wardrobe, construction workshops, water tanks and commissary. These sound stages vary in size and have an overall floor area of 10,844 sq metres, making Warner Roadshow Studio one of the largest studio lots in the Southern Hemisphere. The Queensland Government actively supports the film and television production industry in Queensland and provides both non-financial and financial assistance through the Pacific Film and Television Commission. The Park used to be another film studio.\nCulture.\nThe Gold Coast's culture has been affected by rapid development and traditional marketing programs orbiting around 'sun, sand, surf and sex.'\nDespite rapid socio-economic changes and a tourist-centred image, there is evidence of local resident-driven culture (such as surf gangs) in geographical pockets and a broader 'Gold Coaster' identity drawn from globalised resort and real estate marketing material. The Gold Coast hosts cultural activities that attract tourists and residents alike.\nMusic.\nMusic groups in this region include the Northern Rivers Symphony Orchestra and Operator Please. Musicians Cody Simpson and Ricki-Lee Coulter are from the Gold Coast. Music events include Big Day Out, Good Vibrations Festival, Summafieldayze, the Blues on Broadbeach Festival and V Festival (2007\u20132009).\nArts.\nHome of the Arts (HOTA) is the Gold Coast's premier cultural facility for visual and performing arts with a performance theatre, two cinemas and an underground venue. The theatre has hosted performance by the Imperial Russian Ballet, The Australian Ballet and the Queensland Ballet. Musicals, plays and a variety of performances are regularly scheduled. The city is also home to the Gold Coast City Art Gallery. Film festivals and the Comedy Club host international artists. A redeveloped Gold Coast cultural precinct opened before the city hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nSport.\nThe two most popular sports on the Gold Coast are Australian rules football and rugby league, of which the city is represented by professional teams in two most popular national competitions:\nBurleigh Bears rugby league football club play in the Queensland Cup and have won four premierships (in 1999, 2004, 2016 and 2019).\nRecreational activities on the Gold Coast include surfing, fishing, cycling, boating and golf. The Gold Coast area has numerous golf links, including Hope Island, Sanctuary Cove and The Glades.\nSporting facilities include the Carrara Stadium, Carrara Indoor Sport Centre, Nerang Velodrome and the Sports Super Centre. Newer facilities such as the http://, https://, https://, and the Gold Coast Sports Precinct have been built to accommodate the growing population.\nFormer World Wrestling Entertainment performer Nathan Jones comes from the Gold Coast, as do Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Grant Hackett, 2011 US Open tennis champion Samantha Stosur and Sally Pearson (who received the keys to the city).\nThe Gold Coast has garnered a reputation as a \"sporting graveyard\", as many of the professional clubs that have represented the Gold Coast in national leagues since the 1980s experience generally poor on-field performances, consistently struggle to support themselves financially, and have generally folded within a decade of being founded; as of 2019 no Gold Coast-based team has won a premiership in a national professional club competition. However, The Gold Coast Suns entered their first AFL Finals series in 2025 but lost in the semi finals against cross town rivals Brisbane Lions at The Gabba.\nCommonwealth Games.\nThe Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games, an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth, held between 4 and 15 April 2018. It was the fifth time Australia had hosted the Commonwealth Games and the first time a major multi-sport event achieved gender equality by having an equal number of events for male and female athletes. More than 4,400 athletes, including 300 para-athletes, from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event.\nThe venues such as Carrara Stadium, Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Carrara Indoor Sports Stadium, Gold Coast Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. Broadbeach Bowls Club Nerang Mountain Bike Trails, Coomera Indoor Sports Centre, Oxenford Studios, The Gold Coast Hockey Centre, Southport Broadwater Parklands, Gold Coast Aquatic Centre, Robina Stadium, The Currumbin Beachfront, and Coolangatta Beachfront were used for the Games.\nOlympic and Paralympic Games.\nGold Coast will be one of the three zones for the 2032 Summer Olympics and 2032 Summer Paralympics in Brisbane to use the venues as the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Gold Coast Zone will have seven venues, and will host nine Olympic and six Paralympic sports. The Gold Coast Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre will be used for the preliminary Volleyball along with Powerlifting and Sitting Volleyball during the Paralympics. Broadbeach Park Stadium will host Beach Volleyball for Olympics as well in the Football 5-a-side in the Paralympics. The Gold Coast Sports and Leisure Centre will be used for Judo and Wrestling in the Olympics and Boccia in the Paralympics. Southport Broadwater Parklands to be used for Triathlon and Marathon Swimming in the Olympics and will be used for Paratriathlon in the Paralympics. Coomera Indoor Sports Centre will host the Volleyball for the Olympics and will be used for Wheelchair Rugby in the Paralympics. The Robina Stadium will host the preliminary football matches. The Carrara Stadium could potentially host the Cricket matches if the IOC approves cricket in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\nOther events.\nThe Gold Coast 500 (formerly known as the Gold Coast 600 &amp; Gold Coast Indy 300) is a car racing event held annually, usually in October. The Surfers Paradise Street Circuit through the streets of Surfers Paradise and Main Beach. The Gold Coast 500 typically is accompanied by a range of on and off track events such as the Indy Undie Ball, Miss Indy Competition and the King of Burleigh Hill Billy cart Race which take place in the week prior to and/or during the race weekend. Formerly an IndyCar event, V8 Supercars are now the headline attraction, using a shorter track route, as the circuit was limited following the construction of the as the Light Rail line replaced the northbound traffic lanes on Surfers Paradise Boulevard which was previously used as the southern section of the street circuit.\nEach June, Coolangatta hosts Cooly Rocks On, a two-week 1950s and 1960s nostalgia festival with free entertainment and attractions, including hot rods, restored cars and revival bands playing music of the era. Every July, more than 25,000 congregate on the Gold Coast from around the world to participate in the Gold Coast Marathon. It is also the largest annual community sporting event held on the Gold Coast. In 2015, it will be held on 4\u20135 July and the 37th Gold Coast Airport Marathon is set to motivate and challenge more than 25,000 people of all ages and abilities. The Gold Coast Airport Marathon will feature an event for all ages and abilities, including the full Gold Coast Airport Marathon, ASICS Half Marathon, Southern Cross University Run, Suncorp Bank Challenge, and Junior Dash over .\nIn August Currumbin hosts the annual half distance Challenge Gold Coast triathlon, with the 1.9\u00a0km swim taking place in the Currumbin River, the 90\u00a0km bike going through the Currumbin and Tallebudgera Valleys in the Hinterland, and the 21.1\u00a0km run going along the beach to Elephant Rock and Tugun.\nLate November to early December sees thousands of school leavers across the country descend on the Gold Coast for Schoolies week, a two-week period of celebration and parties throughout Surfers Paradise, hosted by the City of Gold Coast. The event is often criticised nationally and locally for its portrayal of drinking and acts of violence, however every effort by the Queensland Police Service and State Government to ensure all school leavers have a good time are put into place, including locals volunteering by walking the streets and keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance.\nEarly each year the Gold Coast hosts one leg of the ASP World Tour of surfing, where some of the world's best surfers compete in the Quiksilver Pro at Coolangatta.\nHome of the Arts, Gold Coast located in Evandale, features a fine art gallery featuring local and international works from painting to sculpture and new media.

Southern Cross University also operates a smaller campus in Bilinga near the Gold Coast Airport. TAFE Queensland also has five campuses at Southport, Robina, Benowa, Coomera and Coolangatta.\nSchools and libraries.\nThere are over 100 primary and secondary schools, both public and private and of a variety of denominations, including the selective state high school Queensland Academy for Health Sciences and single-sex private schools The Southport School and St Hilda's School. The longest established public school on the Gold Coast is Southport State High School, having originally opened in 1916. There are a number of libraries located on the Gold Coast. For a full list see Gold Coast libraries.\nHealth.\nIn 2018, 61.6% of the city's population was overweight or obese.\nInfrastructure.\nUtilities.\nElectricity\nElectricity for the Gold Coast is sourced from Powerlink Queensland at bulk supply substations which is provided via the National Electricity Market from an interconnected multi-State power system. The Government-owned electricity corporation Energex distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland.\nWater supply\nThe Hinze Dam southwest of Nerang is the population's main water supply. The Little Nerang Dam which feeds into Hinze Dam can supplement part of the city area's water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate Gold Coast Water. Reforms of the way in which the water industry is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008\u201309. City of Gold Coast also sources water from Wivenhoe Dam, west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe's capacity, becomes low.\nWater shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.\nGold Coast Water has the capacity to supply up to 133 megalitres of desalinated water per day.\nTransport.\nThe car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using it as their sole mode of travelling to work. The Gold Coast has an extensive network of arterial roads that link coastal suburbs with inland suburbs. In recent years, local and state governments have invested money in transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast to combat the increasing congestion on many of the city's roads. The Gold Coast has an extensive public transport network that includes buses, heavy rail and light rail for commuting to work, visiting attractions, and travelling to other destinations. \nRoad.\nA number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The Pacific Motorway (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the Logan Motorway (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the Pacific Highway at the New South Wales/Queensland border near Tweed Heads. The Pacific Motorway is part of the Brisbane to Sydney corridor. Before the Tugun Bypass was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at Tugun. The Gold Coast Highway services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at Helensvale. Other arterial roads include the Smith Street Motorway which connects Southport, Gold Coast's CBD with the M1 in Parkwood. Other major roads include Reedy Creek Road, Nerang\u2013Broadbeach Road, Robina Parkway and Southport\u2013Burleigh Road.\nLight rail.\nThe Gold Coast's light rail service is called , a line between Helensvale and Broadbeach that also connects the key activity centres of Southport and Surfers Paradise. The G:link was opened in 2014 between Broadbeach and Southport, with an extension to Helensvale completed in 2017 in preparation for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nHeavy rail.\nQueensland Rail operates an inter-city rail service from Brisbane to the Gold Coast along the Gold Coast railway line. The line follows the same route as Brisbane's Beenleigh railway line, continuing on after reaching Beenleigh. It then follows a route similar to that of the Pacific Motorway, passing stations at Ormeau, Coomera, Helensvale, Nerang and Robina before terminating at Varsity Lakes. An extension of the Gold Coast line to the Gold Coast Airport is proposed.\nBus.\nKinetic Gold Coast operates all public passenger services in the city under contract by Translink which coordinates the public transport network in South East Queensland. Services are frequent during the day, with intervals being as little as 5 minutes. Kinetic operates over a fleet of over 400 buses operating on over 70 lines covering the entire city.\nAirports.\nThe main International Airport, Gold Coast Airport is located in Coolangatta, approximately south of Surfers Paradise. Services are provided to interstate capitals and major cities as well as to major New Zealand cities, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Singapore. In 2019, it was the sixth busiest airport in Australia.\nSmaller private airfields are located in the northern suburbs of Coombabah (Southport Airport) and Norwell (Heck Field), catering to flight training, recreational and general aviation users.\nReal estate.\nThe Gold Coast's real estate market is one of the most dynamic in Australia, characterised by a combination of coastal luxury properties, residential developments, and investment opportunities. According to data from SQM Research, the region has experienced significant property value growth in recent years, with both the median house and unit prices showing strong upward trends. The market's appeal is driven by its lifestyle offerings, proximity to major cities like Brisbane, and ongoing infrastructure improvements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.\nMarketing is usually conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Products can be marketed to other businesses (B2B) or directly to consumers (B2C). Sometimes tasks are contracted to dedicated marketing firms, like a media, market research, or advertising agency. Sometimes, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\nMarket orientations are philosophies concerning the factors that should go into market planning. The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, including the channels that will be used to advertise the product, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product's target market. Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.\nDefinition.\nMarketing is currently defined by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\". However, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. The AMA reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years. The interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008. The development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the AMA's 1935 version: \"Marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\". The newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\nRecent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. For instance, prolific marketing author and educator, Philip Kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. In 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\", and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\". A related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".\nSome definitions of marketing highlight marketing's ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. In this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\". For instance, the Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".\nIn the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts. However, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science. Marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.\nConcept.\nThe \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith's book \"The Wealth of Nations\" but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later. Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.\nGiven the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:\n \"Needs:\" Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.\n \"Wants:\" Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.\n \"Demands:\" When needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.\nMarketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer's \"unmet needs\". Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\" Needs-based segmentation (also known as \"benefit segmentation\") \"places the customers' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\" Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market. In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product's benefits meet the customer's needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.\nB2B and B2C marketing.\nThe two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing.\nB2B marketing.\nB2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies. The 7 P's of B2B marketing are: product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence. Some of the trends in B2B marketing include content such as podcasts, videos, and social media marketing campaigns.\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\nB2C marketing.\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.\nC2B marketing.\nConsumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or business-to-consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers. In this type of business model, businesses profit from consumers' willingness to name their own price or contribute data or marketing to the company, while consumers benefit from flexibility, direct payment, or free or reduced-price products and services. One of the major benefit of this type of business model is that it offers a company a competitive advantage in the market.\nC2C marketing.\nCustomer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.\nDifferences in B2B and B2C marketing.\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.\nMarketing management orientations.\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\" or \"a corporate state of mind\" or as an \"organizational culture.\" Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:\nMarketing plan.\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, the introduction of a new product, the revision of current marketing strategies for existing products, as well as an organisation's overall marketing strategy. The plan is created to accomplish specific marketing objectives, outlining a company's advertising and marketing efforts for a given period, describing the current marketing position of a business, and discussing the target market and marketing mix to be used to achieve marketing goals.\nAn organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Marketing plans start by identifying customer needs through market research and how the business can satisfy these needs. The marketing plan also shows what actions will be taken and what resources will be used to achieve the planned objectives.\nMarketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a conglomerate), the objective might be to increase the group's sales by 25% over a ten-year period.\nThe marketing mix.\nA marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\nThe 4Ps.\nThe 4Ps refers to four broad categories of marketing decisions, namely: \"product\", \"price\", \"promotion\", and \"place\". The origins of the 4 Ps can be traced to the late 1940s. The first known mention has been attributed to a Professor of Marketing at Harvard University, James Culliton.\nThe 4 Ps, in its modern form, was first proposed in 1960 by E. Jerome McCarthy; who presented them within a managerial approach that covered analysis, consumer behavior, market research, market segmentation, and planning. Phillip Kotler, popularised this approach and helped spread the 4 Ps model. McCarthy's 4 Ps have been widely adopted by both marketing academics and practitioners.\n The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the end-user's needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, and labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. Branding, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, brand, or company.\nCriticisms.\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis on an inside-out view. An \"inside-out\" approach is the traditional planning approach where the organization identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organization's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders. In contrast, an \"outside-in\" approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.\nFrom a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either \"promotion\" or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element. Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.\nModifications and extensions.\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions include \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of services marketing. Other extensions have been found necessary in retail marketing, industrial marketing and internet marketing.\nThe 4Cs.\nIn response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a 4 Cs classification in 1990. His classification is a more consumer-orientated version of the 4 Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing.\nOutline.\nConsumer (or client)\nThe consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer.\nCost\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.\nConvenience\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.\nCommunication\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.\nEnvironment.\nThe term \"marketing environment\" relates to all of the factors (whether internal, external, direct or indirect) that affect a firm's marketing decision-making/planning. A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\nResearch.\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between marketing research and market research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research. (Avoiding the word consumer, which shows up in both, market research is about distribution, while marketing research encompasses distribution, advertising effectiveness, and salesforce effectiveness).\nThe stages of research include:\nWell-known academic journals in the field of marketing with the best rating in VHB-Jourqual and Academic Journal Guide, an impact factor of more than 5 in the Social Sciences Citation Index and an h-index of more than 130 in the SCImago Journal Rank are\nThese are also designated as Premier AMA Journals by the American Marketing Association.\nSegmentation.\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects. The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning.\nSegmentation involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The \"DAMP\" acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of differentiation involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\nPositioning concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering.\nProduct life cycle.\nThe product life cycle (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\nIn the introduction stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\nDuring the growth stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\nWhen the product hits maturity, its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\nDuring decline, demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Compared to stop signs, traffic signals, and earlier forms of roundabouts, modern roundabouts reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions greatly by reducing traffic speeds through horizontal deflection and minimising T-bone and head-on collisions. Variations on the basic concept include integration with tram or train lines, two-way flow, higher speeds and many others.\nFor pedestrians, traffic exiting the roundabout comes from one direction, instead of three, simplifying the pedestrian's visual environment. Traffic moves slowly enough to allow visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles that run on petrol or diesel typically spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. When entering vehicles only need to give way, they do not always perform a full stop; as a result, by keeping a part of their momentum, the engine will require less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Research has also shown that slow-moving traffic in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake.\nModern roundabouts were first standardised in the UK in 1966 and were found to be a significant improvement over previous traffic circles and rotaries. Since then, modern roundabouts have become commonplace throughout the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom and France.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOrigins and demise of traffic circles.\nCircular junctions existed before roundabouts, including:\nAlthough some may still be referred to as \"roundabouts\", the operating and entry characteristics of these traffic circles differed considerably from modern roundabouts.\nCircular intersections were built in the United States, though many were large-diameter 'rotaries' that enabled high-speed merge and weave manoeuvres. Older-style traffic circles may control entering traffic by stop signs or traffic lights. Many allow entry at higher speeds without deflection, or require a stop and a 90-degree turn to enter. Because these circumstances caused a lot of vehicle collisions, construction of traffic circles and rotaries ceased in the 1950s, and some were removed.3:02\n1960s development of modern roundabouts.\nWidespread use of the modern roundabout began when the UK's Transport Research Laboratory engineers re-engineered and standardised circular intersections during the 1960s. Frank Blackmore led the development of the \"priority rule\" and subsequently invented the mini-roundabout to overcome capacity and safety limitations. The priority rule was found to improve traffic flow by up to 10%. In 1966, the United Kingdom adopted a rule at all circular junctions that required entering traffic to give way to circulating traffic. A Transportation Research Board guide reports that the modern roundabout represents a significant improvement, in terms of both operations and safety, when compared with older rotaries and traffic circles. The design became mandatory in the United Kingdom for all new roundabouts in November 1966. Australia and other British-influenced countries were the first outside the UK to build modern roundabouts.\nNorth American introduction since 1990s.\nIn the United States modern roundabouts emerged in the 1990s after years of planning and educational campaigning by Frank Blackmore and Leif Ourston, who sought to bring the by then well-established increased safety and traffic flow in other countries to America.5:03 The first was constructed in Summerlin, Nevada, in 1990 and was followed by another the following year. This roundabout occasioned dismay from residents, and a local news program said about it, \"Even police agree, [roundabouts] can be confusing at times.\" Between 1990 and 1995, numerous modern roundabouts were built in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Vermont.\nMunicipalities introducing new roundabouts often were met with some degree of public resistance, just as in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.\nIn the mid-2010s, about 3% of the then circa 4,000 U.S. modern roundabouts were located in Carmel, Indiana, whose mayor James Brainard had been actively promoting their construction; because of increased safety, injuries caused by car accidents in the city dropped by 80% after 1996.0:02 As of December 2015[ [update]] there were about 4,800 modern roundabouts in the United States. As an example, Washington state contained about 120 roundabouts as of October 2016[ [update]], all having been built since 1997, with more planned.\nThe first Canadian traffic circles were in Edmonton. There were seven such by 1954. However, they didn't gain popularity in the rest of the country until the 1990s. They became increasingly popular amongst traffic planners and civil engineers in the 15 years thereafter due to their success in Europe. By 2014 there were about 400 roundabouts in Canada at the time (most in Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario), or one per 90,000 inhabitants (compared to one per 84,000 inhabitants in the United States that year).\nModern roundabout.\nA \"\"modern\" roundabout\" is a type of looping junction in which road traffic travels in one direction around a central island and priority is given to the circulating flow. Signs usually direct traffic entering the circle to slow and to give way to traffic already on it.\nBecause low speeds are required for traffic entering roundabouts, they are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction \"radially\"; whereas older-style traffic circles may be designed to try to increase speeds, and have roads that enter the circle \"tangentially\".\nRoundabouts are normally not used on controlled-access highways because of the low speed requirement, but may be used on lower grades of highway such as limited-access roads. When such roads are redesigned to incorporate roundabouts, traffic speeds must be reduced via tricks such as curving the approaches.\nMany traffic circles have been converted to modern roundabouts, including the former Kingston traffic circle in New York and several in New Jersey. Others have been converted to signalised intersections, such as the Drum Hill Rotary in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, which is now six lanes wide and controlled by four separate intersections.\nJapan was first introduced to roundabouts in September 2014 to stop major accidents and traffic jams.\nTerminology.\nThe word \"roundabout\" dates from early 20th-century use in the United Kingdom. A \"roundabout\" is also a traditional English name given to amusement rides known as a carousel, or a merry-go-round in other English-speaking countries.\nIn U.S. dictionaries the terms \"roundabout\", \"traffic circle\", \"road circle\" and \"rotary\" are synonyms. However, several experts such as Leif Ourston have stressed the need to distinguish between the characteristics of the modern roundabout and the nonconforming traffic circle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation adopted the term \"modern roundabout\" to distinguish those that require entering drivers to give way to others. Many old traffic circles remain in the northeastern US. Some modern roundabouts are elongated to encompass additional streets, but traffic always flows in a loop.\nRotary.\nIn the United States, traffic engineers typically use the term \"rotary\" for large-scale circular junctions between expressways or controlled-access highways. Rotaries of this type typically feature high speeds inside the circle and on the approaches.\nIn the United States' New England region, however, a \"rotary\" is typically used as the general term for all roundabouts, including those with modern designs. State laws in these states mandate that traffic already driving in the rotary always has the right of way. For instance, in Massachusetts, \"Any operator of a vehicle entering a rotary intersection shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already in the intersection.\" In Rhode Island entering vehicles \"Yield to vehicles in the roundabout.\"\nOther terms.\nIn the dialect of Dundee in Scotland, a roundabout is called a \"circle\".\nIn the English West Midlands, \"island\" is in common use.\nIn the Channel Islands a third type of roundabout, known as \"Filter in Turn\", exists. Here approaching drivers neither give way to traffic on the roundabout, as normal, nor have priority over it, but take it in turns to enter from each. Almost all of Jersey's roundabouts are of this type.\nOperation and design.\nThe fundamental principle of modern roundabouts is that entering drivers give way to traffic within the roundabout without the need for traffic signals. Conversely, older traffic circles typically require circling drivers to give way to entering traffic. Roundabouts may also have an interior lane. Generally, exiting directly from an inner lane of a multi-lane roundabout is permitted, given that the intersecting road has as many lanes as the roundabout. By contrast, exiting from an inner lane of an older traffic circle is usually not permitted and traffic must first move into the outside lane.\nVehicles circulate around the central island in one direction at speeds of . In left-hand traffic countries they circulate clockwise (looking from above); in right-hand traffic, anticlockwise.\nMulti-lane roundabouts are typically less than in diameter; older traffic circles and roundabout interchanges may be considerably larger. Roundabouts are roughly the same size as signalled intersections of the same capacity.\nDesign criteria include: Deflection is required to avoid vehicles entering at excessive speeds.\nIslands.\nModern roundabouts feature a central island and sometimes pedestrian islands at each entry or exit often for decoration.\nDenmark has begun widespread adoption of particular high islands, or if not possible, obstacles such as hedges or a ring of trees in larger examples. This is done to further increase the safety benefits of roundabouts, as the obstacles have been found to discomfort drivers more so than the roundabout itself compared to conventional intersections, thus initiating further observation and care taking of the driver. In Denmark, it was found to decrease accidents in roundabouts by 27% to 84% depending on height and type. In studies, heights of 0-0.9, 1-1.9 and 2+ metres were evaluated. It was found that for all heights, especially accidents leading to human injuries were reduced the most, by -47% to -84% for the aforementioned heights. The level of irritation to drivers is not to be understated, as it is the crucial point of the design: to force drivers to pay attention to the sides of the driving direction. This leads to drivers complaining about these designs, as Denmark in most regards embraces designing road infrastructure, such that the wanted driving behaviour leads to comfort i.e., lane width corresponding to speed limit and obstacles encouraging slowdown near points of safety concern such as schools. Such is the controversy for drivers that seasoned driving teachers complain about this discomfort a decade after its safety is proven and adoption widespread.\nCentral.\nThe central island may be surrounded by a truck apron that is high enough to discourage drivers from crossing over it, but low enough to allow wide or long vehicles to navigate the roundabout. The island may provide a visual barrier, to alert approaching drivers to the presence of the roundabout, and to encourage drivers to focus on the traffic in the path of the circle. A visual barrier significantly reduces the accident rate. Otherwise, vehicles anywhere in or near the circle can cause those entering to stop and wait for them to pass, even if they are opposite, which unnecessarily reduces traffic flow. The barrier may be a landscaped mound, a raised wall, a tree or tall shrubs. Road signage or flagpoles may be erected at the top of a landscaped mound.\nSome communities use the island for monuments, the display of large public art or for a fountain. Pedestrians may be prohibited from crossing the circling lane(s). Access to the central island requires an underpass or overpass for safety.\nArt installations.\nRoundabouts have attracted art installations around the world:\nPedestrian.\nFor larger roundabouts, pedestrian islands at each entry/exit encourage drivers to slow and prepare to enter the circle. They also provide a refuge where pedestrians may pause mid-crossing.\nVehicles or bicycles entering or exiting the roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians.\nPedestrian crossing.\nPedestrian crossings at each entry/exit may be located at least one full car length outside the circle. The extra space allows pedestrians to cross behind vehicles waiting to enter the circle, and to allow exiting vehicles to stop for pedestrians without obstruction. Each pedestrian crossing may traverse a pedestrian island for protection that also forces drivers to slow and begin to change direction, encouraging slower, safer speeds. On the island, the pedestrian crossing may become diagonal, to direct the gaze of those crossing into exiting traffic.\nBicycles.\nPhysically separated bikeways best protect cyclists. Less optimally, terminating cycle lanes well before roundabout entrances requires cyclists to merge into the stream of motor traffic, but keeps cyclists in full view of drivers, at some cost in motor vehicle speed. Cyclists may also be permitted to use pedestrian crossings. \nTraditional cycle lanes increase vehicle\u2013bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist must look ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a pedestrian crossing. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To give way to a cyclist on the outside requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at Museum Road, Portsmouth, but were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing.\nThe roundabout at the Brown Road and Loop 202 interchange in Mesa, Arizona, adopts a U.S.-recommended design. On-street road markings direct cyclists to enter the pavement at the end of the bike lane. Cyclists who choose to travel on the wide pavement, cross roundabout arms perpendicularly, well outside the circle. A pedestrian island allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross one lane at a time.\nProtected roundabouts (or Dutch roundabout) were developed in the Netherlands, with cyclists separated from vehicles using dedicated lanes. As cyclists will conflict with motorists at the exit arms of the motorised roundabout, priority must be established. In the Netherlands, cyclists will normally be given priority to promote cycling over driving. As well as their use in the Netherlands and Denmark, these designs have been subsequently built in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nCapacity and delays.\nThe capacity of a roundabout varies based on entry angle, lane width, and the number of entry and circulating lanes. As with other types of junctions, operational performance depends heavily on the flow volumes from various approaches. A single-lane roundabout can handle approximately 20,000\u201326,000 vehicles per day, while a two-lane design supports 40,000 to 50,000.\nUnder many traffic conditions, a roundabout operates with less delay than signalised or all-way stop approaches. Roundabouts do not stop all entering vehicles, reducing both individual and queuing delays. Throughput further improves because drivers proceed when traffic is clear without waiting for a signal to change.\nRoundabouts can increase delays in locations where traffic would otherwise often not be required to stop. For example, at the junction of a high-volume and a low-volume road, traffic on the busier road would stop only when cross traffic was present, otherwise not having to slow for the roundabout. When the volumes on the roadways are relatively equal, a roundabout can reduce delays, because half of the time a full stop would be required. Dedicated left turn signals (in countries where traffic drives on the right) further reduce throughput.\nRoundabouts can reduce delays for pedestrians compared to traffic signals, because pedestrians are able to cross during any safe gap rather than waiting for a signal. During peak flows when large gaps are infrequent, the slower speed of traffic entering and exiting can still allow crossing, despite the smaller gaps.\nStudies of roundabouts that replaced stop signs and/or traffic signals found that vehicle delays were reduced 13\u201389 percent and the proportion of vehicles that stopped was reduced 14\u201356 percent. Delays on major approaches increased as vehicles slowed to enter the roundabouts.\nRoundabouts have been found to reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 15\u201345 percent, nitrous oxide emissions by 21\u201344 percent, carbon dioxide emissions by 23\u201337 percent and hydrocarbon emissions by 0\u201342 percent. Fuel consumption was reduced by an estimated 23\u201334 percent.\nCapacity modelling.\nMany countries have researched roundabout capacity. The software can help calculate capacity, delay and queues. Packages include ARCADY, Rodel, Highway Capacity Software and Sidra Intersection. ARCADY and Rodel are based on the Transport Research Laboratory mathematical model. The TRL approach is derived from empirical models based on geometric parameters and observed driver behaviour with regard to lane choice. Sidra Intersection software includes roundabout capacity models developed in Australia and the US.\nResearch on Australian roundabouts was conducted in the 1980s at the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB). Its analytical capacity and performance models differ from the TRL model significantly, following a lane-based gap-acceptance theory including geometric parameters.\nResearch on U.S. roundabouts sponsored by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) culminated in a capacity model that was included in the \"Highway Capacity Manual\" (HCM) Edition 6 and the \"TRB-FHWA Roundabout Informational Guide\" (NCHRP Report 672). The HCM Edition 6 model is based on lane-based gap-acceptance theory. A recent NCHRP survey of US state transport agencies found that Sidra Intersection is the most widely used software tool in the US for roundabout analysis.\nSafety.\nStatistically, modern roundabouts are safer for drivers and pedestrians than both older-style traffic circles and traditional intersections. Compared with these other forms of intersections, modern roundabouts experience 39% fewer vehicle collisions, 76% fewer injuries and 90% fewer serious injuries and fatalities (according to a study of a sampling of roundabouts in the United States, when compared with the junctions they replaced). At junctions with stop signs or traffic lights, the most serious accidents are right-angle, left-turn or head-on collisions where vehicles move fast and collide at high impact angles, e.g. head-on. Roundabouts virtually eliminate those types of crashes. Instead, most crashes are glancing blows at low angles of impact. Further, a study based on satellite imagery of all intersections in Australia observed consistently low speeds on roundabouts compared to other intersection types, contributing to reduced injury severity in case of a crash.\nSome larger roundabouts take foot and bicycle traffic through underpasses or alternate routes. However, an analysis of the New Zealand national crash database for the period 1996\u20132000 shows that 26% of cyclists reported injury crashes happened at roundabouts, compared to 6% at traffic signals and 13% at priority controlled junctions. The New Zealand researchers propose that low vehicle speeds, circulatory lane markings and mountable centre aprons for trucks can reduce the problem. The most common roundabout crash type for cyclists, according to the New Zealand study, involves a motor vehicle entering the roundabout and colliding with a cyclist who already is travelling around the roundabout (more than half of cyclist/roundabout crashes in New Zealand fall into this category). The next most common crash type involves motorists leaving the roundabout colliding with cyclists who are continuing farther around the perimeter.\nVision-impaired pedestrians.\nPoorly designed walkways increase risks for the vision-impaired, because it is more difficult than at a signalised intersection to audibly detect whether there is a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an audible sound can be generated to indicate that it is time to cross.\nThis issue has led to a conflict in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. One solution is to provide manually operated pedestrian crossing signals at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of light traffic, since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.\nSignalised pedestrian crossings are normally used on large-diameter roundabout interchanges rather than small-diameter modern roundabouts.\nTypes of circular intersections.\nLarge roundabouts, such as those used at motorway junctions, typically have two to six lanes and may include traffic lights to regulate flow.\nSome roundabouts have a divider or subsidiary deflection island, by means of which is provided a \"free flow\" segregated left- (or right-) turn lane (for the UK see Design Manual for Roads and Bridges TD 51/03) between traffic moving between two adjacent roads, and traffic within the roundabout, enabling drivers to bypass the roundabout.\nGyratory system.\nThe term \"gyratory\" (for example, Hanger Lane gyratory) is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for a large circular intersection with non-standard lane markings or priority arrangements, or where there are significant lengths of carriageway between the entry arms, or when buildings occupy the central island.\nIn the 21st century several gyratory systems in London have been removed, including Tottenham Hale and Elephant and Castle.\nSmaller, small and mini-roundabouts.\nAs the overall or external size of a roundabout (in the UK referred to as the Inscribed Circle Diameter \u2013 ICD) is reduced, the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of the vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases, this results in it being too easy \u2013 certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity \u2013 for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway \u2013 an annulus around the central island \u2013 is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of the carriageway by a combination of a slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance is more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.\nThe smaller the roundabout, the more such mitigation measures are likely to be abused \u2013 the less effective they will be. In the UK the minimum size for roundabouts with raised islands is 28 metre diameter ICD with a 4-metre diameter island. This threshold being driven primarily by vehicle geometry \u2013 which is globally relatively consistent \u2013 rather than driver behaviour, it is adopted in other jurisdictions too. Below this minimum size, the mini-roundabout prevails.\nMini-roundabouts.\nAfter developing the offside priority rule, Frank Blackmore, of the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, turned his attention to the possibility of a roundabout that could be built at sites lacking room for a conventional roundabout.\nMini-roundabouts can incorporate a painted circle or a low dome but must be fully traversable by vehicles. Motorists can drive over them when there is no other traffic, but it is dangerous to do so otherwise. Once the practice is established it may be difficult to discourage. Mini-roundabouts use the same right-of-way rules as standard roundabouts but produce different driver behaviour. Mini-roundabouts are sometimes grouped in pairs (a double mini-roundabout) or in \"chains\", simplifying navigation of otherwise awkward junctions. In some countries road signs distinguish mini-roundabouts from larger ones.\nMini-roundabouts are common in the UK, Ireland and Hong Kong (particularly on Hong Kong Island), as well as Irapuato in Mexico.\nIn the UK and also in other jurisdictions that have adopted mini-roundabouts, to drive across the central disc or dome when it is practicable to avoid it is an offence. Vehicles are required to treat the painted circle as if it were a solid island and drive around it. Some local authorities paint double white lines around the circle to indicate this, but these require permission from the Secretary of State for Transport. The central dome also must be able to be overrun by larger vehicles.\nIn the UK \u2013 and also in other highway jurisdictions \u2013 the maximum size (inscribed circle diameter) for a mini roundabout is 28 metres (30 yards).\nRaindrop roundabouts.\nThese roundabouts do not form a complete circle and have a \"raindrop\" or \"teardrop\" shape. They have also been used at bowtie intersections, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. In addition to their use at intersections, raindrop roundabouts are also used in dogbone interchanges (described below).\nBalcony roundabout.\nA balcony roundabout is just an elevated roundabout. They are constructed in such a way that vulnerable road users can cross underneath the roundabout. Footpaths and cycle paths along the different roads connect to the square under the roundabout. Vulnerable road users do not interfere with motorised traffic on the roundabout, reducing the risk of collision.\nTurbo roundabouts.\nIn the Netherlands, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Croatia, Germany, and the U.S. states of Alabama, California, and Florida, a relatively new type of two-lane roundabout designs is emerging, called \"turbo roundabouts\". These designs require motorists to choose their direction before entering the roundabout, thereby eliminating many conflicting paths and choices on the roundabout itself so that traffic safety is increased, as well as speed and capacity. These designs, seen from above, typically result in a spiralling flow of traffic. One minor drawback is that turbo roundabouts are often marked out such that a U-turn by means of the roundabout is not possible for drivers approaching on certain arms.\nSeveral variations of turbo roundabouts exist. They are frequently designed for the intersection of a major road crossing a road with less traffic.\nAn early application of the principle was a six-arm and therefore relatively large (and fast) non-circular roundabout at Stairfoot, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, which was given spiral marking about 1984. At that time the method was considered experimental and needed special consent from central authorities. The turbo roundabout was formally developed in 1996 in the Netherlands by Lambertus Fortuijn, a researcher from the Delft University of Technology. Similar roundabouts, with spiralling lane markings, have been used for many years in the UK e.g. the A176/A127 (eastbound) at Basildon, Essex (). However, it was not until 1997 that the UK's national highway authorities published guidance (DMRB TA-78/97) that in effect endorsed the use of spiral markings in certain circumstances.\nTurbo roundabouts can be built with raised lane separators (common in the Netherlands) or with lane markings only. The use of raised lane separators prevents road users from weaving (thereby reducing conflicts) but can make manoeuvring more difficult for large vehicles.\nAccording to simulations, a two-lane roundabout with three exits should offer 12\u201320% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout of the same size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research made it very clear that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it. At least 70 have been built in the Netherlands, while many turbos (or similar, lane splitting designs) can be found in southeast Asia. The turbo roundabout design is given as an example in the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.\nSub-sea roundabouts.\nA new development is the roundabout below the seabed, in locations where multiple undersea traffic tunnels join. The first such roundabout is in the Eysturoy Tunnel (Eysturoyartunnilin), opened in December 2020 in the Faroe Islands. It connects the main island Streymoy with two locations on the island Eysturoy that are separated by a long fjord, Sk\u00e1lafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur. So, three roads meet at this roundabout. Total length of the system is 11.24 km (6.98 mi). It was the largest ever infrastructure project in the Faroe Islands, estimated to have cost around a billion Danish kroner.\nMotorways.\nRoundabouts are generally not appropriate for placement on motorway or freeway mainlines because the purpose of such facilities is to provide for uninterrupted traffic flow. However, roundabouts are often used for the junction between the slip roads (called \"ramps\" in North America) and the intersecting road. A single roundabout, grade separated from the mainlines, may be used to create a roundabout interchange. This type of junction is common in the UK and Ireland.\nAlternatively, separate roundabouts also may be used at the slip road intersections of a diamond interchange to create what often is referred to as a \"dumbbell interchange\", which is increasingly common in both Europe and North America due to its reduced need for wide or multiple bridges. A variation of the dumbbell interchange, often called a \"dogbone interchange\", occurs when the roundabouts do not form a complete circle but are instead raindrop roundabouts (described above). This configuration reduces conflicts between vehicles entering the raindrop roundabouts from the ramps, reducing queueing and delays, compared with the dumbbell interchange.\nAdditional use of roundabouts for high-speed junctions is the 3-level stacked roundabout\u2014this is a roundabout interchange where \"both\" of the roadway mainlines are grade separated. In the United Kingdom, the M25/A3, M8/M73 and A1(M)/M18 interchanges are examples of this type. These junctions, however, have less capacity than a full free-flow interchange. A similar design to this is the three-level diamond interchange.\nMost junctions on Dublin's M50 motorway C-road were built using a standard roundabout interchange. The traffic volume of several of these junctions increased to a level higher than the capacity such roundabouts can accommodate, and in turn, have been converted into partially or fully free-flowing interchanges. One example is the Red Cow interchange. In Northern Ireland, the junction between the M1 and M12 (Craigavon connector motorway) is via a standard roundabout with a raised centre, three onslips and three offslips, and two lanes.\nIn the city of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, a roundabout connects two motorways, E22 from Lund, and the Inner ring road.\nIn the Netherlands, A6 motorway and A7 motorway used to cross near Joure using a roundabout until October 2017, when the junction was turned into a full Y-interchange. The junction between the A200 and the A9 uses a 3-level stacked roundabout. Near Eindhoven (the Leenderheide junction), the junction for the A2 uses a roundabout. An overpass was built for the A67 from Antwerp to Germany.\nNear Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, the Cheratte interchange between the A3/E40 and A25/E25 functions partially as a roundabout, with through traffic allowed to continue without entering the junction and traffic changing between motorways required to use the roundabout.\nRotary interchanges operate with traffic circles rather than roundabouts. Rotary interchanges are common in New England, particularly in the state of Massachusetts, but a European example of a rotary interchange may be found in Hinwil, Switzerland.\nSignalised roundabouts.\nA signalised roundabout is one where one or more entry is controlled by traffic signals, rather than by assumed priority. For each signalised entry there will also be a signalised stopline immediately upstream on the circulatory section. The signals prevent blocking on the roundabout, and balance and improve traffic capacity.\nExamples include the M50 in Dublin; the Cherry Street roundabout in Kowloon, Hong Kong; Sheriffhall Roundabout in Edinburgh, Scotland; Newton Circus in Singapore; and many of the roundabouts along the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City.\nAn evolution of the signalised roundabout has been proposed recently. It is based in avoiding stops by eliminating conflict points in roundabouts. This proposed new paradigm (SYROPS) forms platoons of vehicles (e.g. 2 x 3 cars) that arrive at the roundabout with speed identical to the average circulation speed in the roundabout and within the time interval (visualised as a rotating priority sector) assigned to his entrance, avoiding all the conflicts of passage and with it the stops and accelerations required in standard and in signalled roundabouts. Signalling signage is with lights for human drivers and optionally wireless for connected and autonomous vehicles.\nMagic roundabouts and ring junctions.\n\"Magic\" roundabouts (also known as \"ring junctions\") direct traffic in both directions around the central island. The first magic roundabout was constructed in 1972 in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, designed by Frank Blackmore, inventor of the mini-roundabout. The roundabout joins five roads and consists of a two-way road around the central island, with five mini-roundabouts meeting the incoming roads.\nThe name derives from the popular children's television series, \"The Magic Roundabout\", and is considered \"magic\" because traffic flows in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. This is achieved by surrounding the main island with one smaller roundabout per entry/exit street. This pattern directs traffic in the usual clockwise (in LHT installations) or counter-clockwise (in RHT installations) manner around each mini-roundabout. Exiting the mini-roundabouts, traffic may proceed around the central island either in the usual direction (via the outer loop), or in the inverse direction (the inner loop). The arrangement offers multiple paths between feeder roads. Drivers typically choose the shorter, most fluid route. Although the safety record is good, many drivers find this system intimidating, and some drivers go to great lengths to avoid them.\nSimilar systems to the Swindon design found elsewhere in the United Kingdom include the Plough Roundabout in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire (which has six intersections); Denham Roundabout in Denham, Buckinghamshire; Greenstead Roundabout in Colchester, Essex; and the Abbey Way Gyratory in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.\nChurchbridge Junction in Staffordshire is a magic gyratory. This type of junction is similar to a magic roundabout, except that the constituent roundabouts are connected by longer lengths of roadway.\nTrams.\nTram roundabouts, which are found in many countries, combine roundabouts for individual vehicles with tram lines. Large areas are needed for tram roundabouts that include a junction between tram lines. Tramways usually cross the centre of the roundabout. At busy junctions, this requires traffic lights or special signalling granting the trams priority. However, there are also roundabouts where trams and vehicles share the carriageway. Some roundabouts have a tram stop on the island.\nRailways.\nIn Jensen Beach, Florida, the main line of the Florida East Coast Railway running north\u2013south bisects the two-lane roundabout at the junction of Jensen Beach Boulevard running east\u2013west. It hosts three other roads and the service entrance to a large shopping plaza. Boom barriers line the railway crossings. The landscaped central island bisected by the tracks was originally kerbed, but 18-wheelers had trouble negotiating the roundabout, so the kerbs were replaced with painted concrete strips. The roundabout was built in the early 2000s and improved traffic flow, although long freight trains often cause delays.\nTwo roundabouts in the Melbourne metropolitan area, Highett, Victoria and Hampton, have heavy rail crossing the roundabout and through the inner circle. Boom barriers protect the railway from oncoming traffic at the appropriate points in the roundabout.\nAt the Driescher Kreisel in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, a railway serving a nearby paper factory crosses a roundabout located next to a shopping centre and pedestrian zone. The flow of traffic and pedestrians is governed by 14 barriers, 22 traffic lights and 8 loudspeakers. The barriers close three times daily for 7 minutes to allow trains to pass.\nIn New Zealand's South Island, two roundabouts join major roads where a railway cuts through. One is at the intersection between State Highway\u00a01 (as Sinclair Street and Main Street from the east) and Main Street (from the west), Park Terrace and Redwood Street in the city of Blenheim. Here the Main North Line bisects the roundabout and separates Park Terrace and Main Street eastbound from the rest of the roundabout. The other roundabout is located at Kumara Junction on the West Coast, where the Hokitika Branch separates State Highway\u00a06 southbound from SH 6 northbound and State Highway\u00a073. Both roundabouts are controlled by flashing red lights, with additional boom barriers at the Blenheim roundabout.\nThrough roundabout.\nAlso known as a hamburger roundabout, these junctions are signalised and have a straight-through section of carriageway for one of the major routes. The \"hamburger\" name derives from the fact that the plan view resembles the cross-section through a hamburger. The United Kingdom has examples on the A580 East Lancashire Road in St Helens, on Haydock Island in Merseyside (which also features the M6 passing overhead), and on the Astley/Boothstown border. More examples are the A6003 at Kettering, the A538 near Manchester Airport, the \"Showcase\" junction on A329 at Winnersh, Berkshire and the A63/A1079 Mytongate junction in Hull. Examples also exist in Bracknell, Hull, Bramcote in Nottinghamshire and Reading, as well as on the N2/M50 intersection in Dublin, Ireland. In Perth, Western Australia, one is found at the intersection of Alexander Drive, Morley Drive and The Strand. Throughabouts are very common in Spain, where they are called \"raquetas\" (Spanish for \"[tennis] racket\") or \"glorieta/rotonda partida\" (\"split roundabout\").\nOnly bicycle-pedestrian roundabouts.\nThe same features that make roundabouts attractive for roadway junctions led to their use at junctions of multi-use trails.\nThe University of California, Davis and Stanford University, as well as the Cape Cod and Old Colony rail trails have bicycle-pedestrian roundabouts. A roundabout along the Clear Creek Trail in Bloomington, Indiana, connects the main trail to its spur.\nRoundabouts are used on off-road bicycle trails in Florida, Colorado, Alaska, and Wisconsin.\nAn elevated roundabout is located in Eindhoven, serving pedestrian and bicycle traffic only, above the main conventional roadway intersection. It is known as the Hovenring.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A major political figure during the late Qing regime, he spearheaded a number of major modernisation programs and reforms and played a decisive role in securing the abdication of Puyi in 1912, which marked the collapse of the Qing regime and the end of imperial rule in China.\nBorn to an affluent Han family in Xiangcheng county, Yuan began his career in the Huai Army. He was sent to Joseon to head a Qing garrison in Seoul and was appointed imperial resident and supreme adviser to the Korean government after thwarting the Gapsin Coup in 1885. He was recalled to China shortly before the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, and received command of the first New Army, which paved the way for his rise to power. In 1898, Yuan formed an alliance with Empress Dowager Cixi and helped bring an end to the Guangxu Emperor's Hundred Days' Reform. Promoted to Viceroy of Zhili in 1902, Yuan quickly expanded the Beiyang Army into the best trained and most effective military force in China. He played an active role in the Late Qing reforms, which included the abolition of the imperial examination. Upon the death of Cixi in 1908 he fell from power and was forced into exile, but retained the loyalty of the Beiyang Army and as such remained an influential figure.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, the Qing court, desperate to maintain control as revolutionary forces seized key provinces, recalled Yuan from retirement and appointed him Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet. Leveraging his position as commander of the Beiyang Army, Yuan engaged in brief fighting with Sun Yat-sen's revolutionaries before opening negotiations, brokering a deal that led to the abdication of the child emperor Puyi in early 1912, effectively ending over two thousand years of imperial rule. In return, Yuan was chosen as the first official president of the Republic of China after Sun voluntarily stepped aside in his favor.\nYuan's desire for dictatorial power brought him into conflict with the National Assembly and the Kuomintang (KMT), provoking a second revolution which was decisively crushed. He then outlawed the KMT and dissolved the National Assembly. In December 1915, in an attempt to further secure his rule, Yuan restored the monarchy and proclaimed himself as the Hongxian Emperor (). The move was met with widespread opposition from the general populace, many of his closest supporters in the Beiyang Army, as well as foreign governments. Several military governors and provinces rose in open rebellion. In March 1916, Yuan formally abdicated and restored the Republic, having been emperor for only 83 days. He died of kidney failure in June at the age of 56, leaving behind a significantly weakened Beiyang government and a fragmented political landscape, which soon plunged China into a period of warlordism.\nEarly life.\nOn 16 September 1859, Yuan Shikai was born in the village of Zhangying () to the Yuan Clan which later moved 16 kilometres southeast of Xiangcheng to a hilly area that was easier to defend against bandits. There, the Yuan family had built the fortified village of Yuanzhaicun (). He was the fourth of six sons, and in 1866 was adopted by his father's younger brother, until he died in 1873. From that point Yuan was raised by several other uncles, before returning to Xiangcheng in 1878. During those years he had lived in the province of Shandong, and then in Nanjing and Beijing. Yuan's family was affluent enough to provide Yuan with a traditional Confucian education. As a young man he enjoyed riding, hunting with dogs, boxing, and entertainment with friends. Though hoping to pursue a career in the civil service, he failed the imperial examinations twice, in 1876 and 1879, leading him to decide on an entry into politics through the Huai Army, where many of his relatives served. His career began with the purchase of a minor official title in 1880, which was a common method of official promotion in the late Qing.\nBetween 1877 and 1878, Yuan accompanied one of his uncles who was sent to assist relief efforts after a drought in the province of Henan, and Yuan was praised by officials there for his role in helping manage the response, including in punishing those who embezzled relief funds. It was during that time that he began learning about leadership and politics, and made connections with senior government officials. After seeing the conditions in Henan as a result of the natural disaster there, Yuan wrote that he wanted to dedicate himself to \"serving the country\". Using his father's connections, Yuan traveled to Tengzhou, Shandong, and received a post on the military staff of the commander of the province's coastal defenses, Wu Changching, in 1881. Wu had owed a debt to Yuan's foster father, and also provided Yuan with tutors to help him study for another attempt at the imperial examination. Yuan planned to retake it, but this never happened because his deployment to Korea in 1882. Around this time he expressed his willingness to fight to defend China from foreign powers. Yuan's interest in military history and martials arts made him want to join the army, though he was disillusioned when he saw how poorly the soldiers were paid. Yuan's first marriage was in 1876 to a woman of the Yu family who bore him a first son, Keding, in 1878. Yuan Shikai married nine more concubines throughout the course of his life.\nYears in Joseon Korea.\nIn the early 1870s, Korea under the Joseon dynasty was in the midst of a struggle between isolationists under King Gojong's father Heungseon Daewongun, and progressives, led by Empress Myeongseong, who wanted to open trade. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan had adopted an aggressive foreign policy, contesting Chinese domination of the peninsula. Under the Treaty of Ganghwa, which the Koreans signed with reluctance in 1876, Japan was allowed to send diplomatic missions to Hanseong, and opened trading posts in Incheon and Wonsan. Amidst an internal power struggle in 1882 which resulted in the queen's exile, the Viceroy of Zhili, Li Hongzhang, sent 3,000 men of the Huai Army under Wu Changqing into Korea to restore stability, which became Yuan Shikai's first military deployment. Yuan distinguished himself during his service on Wu's staff in Korea, including both in battle and in his administrative ability, and was recommended for promotion to the rank of subprefect by Wu. Yuan also became known for enforcing strict discipline among the Chinese troops in Korea. In the spring of 1884, after Wu returned to China, Yuan became the commander of the Chinese forces in his place. The Korean king proposed that some of his troops be trained by the Chinese, and Yuan Shikai was put in charge of training the Korean royal guard, as the head of a new Capital Guard Command.\nChina's reassertion of suzerainty over Korea aggravated the split between pro-Japanese Korean progressives and pro-Chinese conservatives. In December 1884 the progressives attempted to form a new government with Japanese backing during the Gapsin Coup, and the conservatives led by Queen Min turned to the Chinese garrison for help. Yuan led his troops to defeat the outnumbered Japanese and recover King Gojong. The 26-year-old Yuan established himself as a resourceful leader, and from that point Viceroy Li Hongzhang gave him a critical role in regaining Chinese control of Korea. In October 1885, Yuan was appointed Chinese imperial resident in Korea by Li, restoring a custom that dated back to the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Yuan Shikai spent the next nine years in that position and operated as if he were above the law. He ended any attempts at reform, changed the composition of the Korean government, and worked to minimize any other foreign influence, especially Japanese. Yuan was allied to the corrupt Min oligarchy, and historians have characterized his reign in Korea as a \"dark age\". His behavior and rule created a lot of antagonism against him and China among Koreans. However, during those years China was able to maintain its control over Korea and contain Japanese and Russian influence. He wanted to remove Gojong from the throne on several occasions, but was prevented from doing so by Li Hongzhang.\nIn the early 1890s, the Japanese protested that China was obstructing Japan's trade with Korea, but more importantly a rebel movement that threatened Chinese interests, the Donghak Society, emerged in the Korean countryside. It existed for many years and held sporadic protests against corruption and foreign influence, but in early 1894 it had spread rapidly in opposition to the government's taxation policy. The rebels agreed to a ceasefire on 1 June 1894 to remove any pretext for foreign intervention, and on 2 June the Japanese cabinet decided to deploy troops to Korea only if China did so. The Min faction, not being aware of the latter and feeling threatened by the rebels, requested China to send reinforcements on 3 June. They were also advised in this by Yuan Shikai. Japan started military preparations immediately. Within days, over 2,000 Japanese troops landed in Korea and marched to Seoul, and additional troops and warships arrived during the following weeks. They quickly outnumbered the Chinese force in Korea. Yuan requested Li Hongzhang for permission to leave Korea in late June, but this was not granted for twenty days, and he left Seoul on 19 July by disguising himself as a Chinese servant of the Russian military attach\u00e9 on his way to Beijing. This ended his twelve years in Korea.\nYuan Shikai had three Korean concubines, one of whom was Korean Princess Li's relative, concubine Kim. 15 of Yuan's children came from these three Korean women.\nLate Qing dynasty.\nAfter returning to China, Yuan was appointed to a post in Zhejiang, but he did not take it up. The First Sino-Japanese War officially began on 1 August 1894 with Japan declaring war on China, and he spent the conflict assisting with the provision of supplies to the Chinese forces in Korea and northeast China, at the request of Li Hongzhang. At this point Yuan also had a positive reputation outside of China, due to his actions in Korea. Japanese Prime Minister It\u014d Hirobumi had asked Li Hongzhang about Yuan during their negotiations at the end of the war, and remarked that he was talented. Shortly before the Treaty of Shimonoseki ended the Sino-Japanese war in April 1895, U.S. Secretary of State John W. Foster attempted to convince Yuan to lead a military coup against the Qing dynasty.\nAfter China's best force, the Huai Army, had been defeated in the war with Japan, the Qing imperial court was willing to create units that were organized entirely along the European model. There were increasing calls after the war to reorganize the Chinese armed forces. Around this time, Yuan had the confidence of senior Qing officials, including Ronglu, the Minister of War, and Yikuang, Prince Qing. Several high-ranking officials, including Yikuang, Weng Tonghe, and Wang Wenshao, signed memorials to the throne in the fall of 1895 asking the Guangxu Emperor to appoint Yuan to oversee military modernization. He was known for having organized Korean forces, defeating the Japanese during the 1880s, and displaying management skills as a logistics officer during the most recent war. After a private meeting with the emperor on 2 August 1895 he was made a member of the council for military issues. Within days, he presented the emperor with a lengthy document on his proposal for creating a Western-style army under centralized Qing control. On 8 December 1895 Yuan was appointed as the commander of the Newly Created Army, which was created on the basis of the Pacification Army that had been raised during the war at the Huai Army training camp in Xiaozhan, near Tianjin.\nYuan immediately set about organizing the brigade-sized Newly Created Army, and spent the next three years developing a force at Xiaozhan that was different from any previous Chinese military, being not only equipped but also organized along the lines of the German Army, and funded by the central government. Particular attention was given to the recruitment and training of the soldiers and officers. It was organized into combat arms and several technical branches, and a staff officer system was also set up with German assistance. The unit was equipped with German weapons and supplies. The Newly Created Army became the basis for his rise to power, and in addition to Yuan, the brigade's officer corps included many other future leaders, including several presidents of the Republic of China and provincial governors. Already in 1896, Yuan's troops received praise from Ronglu, and in July 1897 Yuan was made the provincial judge of Zhili. Between 1895 and 1898 the emperor, being impressed with his efforts at modernizing the military, had several meetings with Yuan, which was rare for an official of his level. Yuan was seen as a member of the reform movement and supported it, though he was focused on his military service and was not involved in their political machinations. At the same Yuan maintained good relations with the conservative Manchu princes, notably Ronglu.\nThe Qing Court at the time was divided between progressives under the leadership of the Guangxu Emperor and conservatives under Empress Dowager Cixi, who had withdrawn to her Summer Palace and allowed the emperor to lead the government. In June 1898 the Guangxu Emperor launched the Hundred Days' Reform and started issuing dozens of edicts to make changes to China's culture, economy, military, and education system, with the support of reform-minded officials like Kang Youwei. He encountered a lot of resistance from the conservative nobles, who wanted Cixi to return, and his supporters, having no military power of their own, decided to ask Yuan Shikai for help. Yuan's role in these events continues to be debated by historians. The most widely held interpretation has been that the reform advocate Tan Sitong met with Yuan Shikai on 18 September 1898 and asked Yuan to use his troops to kill the conservatives and to arrest Cixi. Yuan betrayed them by giving this information to Ronglu on the evening of 20 September, and based on this, the next morning the conservatives launched a coup d'\u00e9tat that ended the Hundred Days' Reform and placed the Guangxu Emperor into confinement. Yuan's conversation with Ronglu has been accepted as the cause of the coup. However, more recently available evidence has led some historians to conclude that the coup was already being planned by the time Yuan had his conversation with Ronglu, and he was not the reason why it occurred. Yuan most likely knew that his troops would be no match for the larger forces around Beijing and wanted to protect his own position. His report to Ronglu was later used by Cixi to purge many reformers from the government.\nYuan was appointed as acting Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Trade Minister for ten days after the coup, which may have been an effort by the conservative faction to keep him away from his troops at Xiaozhan. Ronglu saw Yuan Shikai as reliable subordinate and his support allowed Yuan to not be punished, unlike the other reformers. Later that year several military units in northern China were placed under Ronglu's command as the Wuwei Corps, which also called the Guards Army. Yuan's Newly Created Army became the Right Division of the Guard Army. It was seen as the best trained and equipped among the five divisions of the army, and his success opened the way for his rise to the top in both military and political sectors. During 1899 he wrote several proposals to the Qing court in military reform. In June 1899, he was made the junior vice president of the Ministry of Works by Empress Dowager Cixi. As tensions increased between the locals and foreigners in the province of Shandong, beginning the Boxer Rebellion, Yuan was sent there in December 1899 as the acting provincial governor. He was confirmed as governor in March 1900.\nDuring his three-year tenure the Boxer Rebellion (1899\u20131901) erupted; Yuan ensured the suppression of Boxers in the province, though his troops took no active part outside Shandong itself. Yuan took the side of the pro-foreign faction in the imperial court. He refused to side with the Boxers and attack the Eight-Nation Alliance forces, joining with other Chinese governors who commanded substantial modernized armies like Zhang Zhidong not participating in the Boxer Rebellion. He and Zhang ignored Cixi's declaration of war against the foreign powers and continued to suppress the Boxers. This clique was known as the Mutual Defence Pact of Southeast China. In addition to suppressing the Boxers in Shandong, Yuan and his army (the Right Division) also helped the Eight-Nation Alliance suppress them in Zhili after captured Peking in August 1900. Yuan Shikai's forces massacred tens of thousands of people in their anti-Boxer campaign in Zhili. Yuan operated out of Baoding during the campaign, which ended in 1902. The Boxer Rebellion decimated the other divisions of the Guards Army, and after it was over the Qing court wanted rebuild the defenses of the Beijing area, appointing Yuan to oversee this task. In late 1901 he was made the acting Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Trade Minister after the death of Li Hongzhang, so he was also in charge of the foreign and military affairs of northern China. These appointments to powerful positions in the capital region showed the trust that the empress dowager had in Yuan Shikai. He was confirmed as viceroy in June 1902. Yuan was given several other offices around that time, including as director of the northern railways and director of telegraphs.\nHaving gained powerful allies that included Empress Dowager Cixi, and being appointed as the Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Trade Minister, Yuan was in a position that allowed him to expand his army and increase its funding. It was at this time that Yuan established the Beiyang Army, with the creation of the Left Division of the Beiyang Standing Army in October 1902. In December 1902 he was also ordered to train several thousand Manchu Bannermen, and these later became the 1st Division of the Beiyang Army, while the Left Division was renamed the 2nd Division. It was meant to become the core of a Chinese regular army, and although Yuan had a lot of influence over it, the central government had administrative control and provided the army's funding. In 1904 Yuan used the Russo-Japanese War to convince Cixi to authorize the creation of more divisions. Because of this the Beiyang Army reached a strength of 60,000 men. In mid-1902 he established a military staff to assist him in his role as Beiyang Army commander, and its two most prominent members were Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui. The \"Beiyang clique\" became the origin of the majority of warlords in northern China during the warlord period in the 1910s and 1920s. As one historian wrote, \"the [Beiyang] Army was the most significant military development in China between the [Xiang] and Huai Armies which suppressed the Taiping and [Nian] rebellions in the 1860's and the army that Chiang Kai-shek raised and employed in the northern expedition of 1926-27.\"\nIn 1905, acting on Yuan's advice, Dowager-Empress Cixi issued a decree ending the traditional Confucian examination system that was formalized in 1906. She ordered the Ministry of Education to implement a system of primary and secondary schools and universities with state-mandated curriculum, modelled after the educational system of Meiji-era Japan. On 27 August 1908, the Qing court promulgated \"Principles for a Constitution\", which Yuan helped to draft. This document called for a constitutional government with a strong monarchy (modelled after Meiji Japan and Bismarck's Germany), with a constitution to be issued by 1916 and an elected parliament by 1917.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the hunting-park, three miles to the south of Peking, is quartered the Sixth Division, which supplies the Guards for the Imperial Palace, consisting of a battalion of infantry and a squadron of cavalry. With this Division Yuan Shi Kai retains twenty-six modified Krupp guns, which are the best of his artillery arm, and excel any guns possessed by the foreign legations in Peking.\nThe Manchu Division moves with the Court and is the pride of the modern army.\nBy his strategic disposition Yuan Shi Kai completely controls all the approaches to the capital, and holds a force which he may utilize either to protect the Court from threatened attack or to crush the Emperor should he himself desire to assume Imperial power. Contrary to treaty stipulations made at the settlement of the Boxer trouble, the Chinese have been permitted to build a great tower over the Chien Men, or central southern gate, which commands the foreign legations and governs the Forbidden City. In the threatening condition of Chinese affairs it might be assumed that this structure had been undermined by the foreign community, but this has not been done, and if trouble again arise in Peking the fate of the legations will depend upon the success of the first assault which will be necessary to take it. The foreign legations are as much in the power of Yuan Shi Kai's troops in 1907 as they were at the mercy of the Chinese rabble in 1900.\nThe ultimate purpose of the equipped and disciplined troops is locked in the breast of the Viceroy of Chihli. Yuan Shi Kai's yamen in Tientsin is connected by telegraph and telephone with the Imperial palaces and with the various barracks of his troops. In a field a couple of hundred yards away is the long pole of a wireless telegraph station, from which he can send the message that any day may set all China ablaze.\n\"To-morrow in the East\", Douglas Story, pp.\u00a0224\u2013226.\nYuan Shikai's Han-dominated New Army was primarily responsible for the defence of Beijing, as most of the modernized Eight Banner divisions were destroyed in the Boxer Rebellion and the new modernized Banner forces were token in nature.\nThe Empress Dowager and the Guangxu Emperor died within a day of each other in November 1908. Sources indicate that the will of the emperor ordered Yuan's execution. Nonetheless, he avoided death. In January 1909, he was relieved of all his posts by the regent, Prince Chun. The public reason for Yuan's resignation was that he was returning to his home in the village of Huanshang (), the prefecture-level city of Anyang, due to a foot disease.\nDuring his three years of effective exile, Yuan kept contact with his close allies, including Duan Qirui, who reported to him regularly about army proceedings. Yuan had arranged for the marriage of his niece (whom he had adopted) to Duan as a means to consolidate power. The loyalty of the Beiyang Army was still undoubtedly behind him. Having this strategic military support, Yuan held the balance of power between various revolutionaries (like Sun Yat-sen) and the Qing court. Both wanted Yuan on their side.\nWuchang Uprising and Republic.\nThe Wuchang Uprising took place on 10 October 1911 in Hubei province. The southern provinces subsequently declared their independence from the Qing court, but neither the northern provinces nor the Beiyang Army had a clear stance for or against the rebellion. Both the Qing court and Yuan were fully aware that the Beiyang Army was the only Qing force powerful enough to quell the revolutionaries. The court requested Yuan's return on 27 October, but he repeatedly declined offers from the Qing court for his return, first as the Viceroy of Huguang, and then as Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet. Time was on Yuan's side, and Yuan waited, using his \"foot ailment\" as a pretext to his continual refusal.\nAfter further pleas by the Qing Court, Yuan agreed and eventually left his village for Beijing on 30 October, becoming prime minister on 1 November 1911. Immediately after that he asked the regent to withdraw from politics, which forced Zaifeng to resign as regent. This made way for Yuan to form a new, predominantly Han cabinet of confidants, with only one Manchu as Minister of Suzerainty. To further reward Yuan's loyalty to the court, the Empress Dowager Longyu offered Yuan the noble title Marquis of the First Rank (), an honour previously given only to 19th-century General Zeng Guofan for his raising of the Xiang Army to suppress the Taiping Rebellion. Meanwhile, in the Battle of Yangxia, Yuan's forces recaptured Hankou and Hanyang from the revolutionaries. Yuan knew that complete suppression of the revolution would end his usefulness to the Qing regime. Instead of attacking Wuchang, he began to negotiate with the revolutionaries.\nAbdication of child emperor.\nThe revolutionaries had elected Sun Yat-sen as the first Provisional President of the Republic of China, but they were in a weak position militarily, so they negotiated with the Qing, using Yuan as an intermediary. Yuan arranged for the abdication of the child emperor Puyi in return for being granted the position of President of the Republic of China. Puyi recalled in his autobiography the meeting between Longyu and Yuan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Dowager Empress was sitting on a kang [platform] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief as a fat old man [Yuan] knelt before her on a red cushion, tears streaming down his face. I was sitting to the right of the widow and wondering why both adults were crying. There was no one in the room other than the three of us and everything was very quiet; the fat man snorted as he spoke and I couldn't understand what he was saying\u00a0... This was the time when Yuan directly raised the question of abdication.\nSun agreed to Yuan's presidency after some internal bickering, but asked that the capital be situated in Nanjing. Yuan, however, wanted the geographic advantage of having the nation's capital close to his base of military power. Many theorized that Cao Kun, one of his trusted subordinate Beiyang military commanders, fabricated a coup d'\u00e9tat in Beijing and Tianjin, apparently under Yuan's orders, to provide an excuse for Yuan not to leave his sphere of influence in Zhili (present-day Hebei province). However, the claim that the coup was organized by Yuan has been challenged by others. The revolutionaries compromised again, and the capital of the new republic was established in Beijing. Yuan Shikai was elected Provisional President of the Republic of China by the Nanjing Provisional Senate on 14 February 1912, and sworn in on 10 March of that year.\nDemocratic elections.\nIn February 1913, democratic elections were held for the National Assembly in which the KMT scored a significant victory. Song Jiaoren zealously supported a cabinet system and was widely regarded as a candidate for prime minister.\nOne of Song's main political goals was to ensure that the powers and independence of China's Parliament be properly protected from the influence of the office of the president. Song's goals in curtailing the office of the president conflicted with the interests of Yuan, who, by mid-1912, clearly dominated the provisional cabinet and was showing signs of a desire to hold overwhelming executive power. During Song's travels through China in 1912, he had openly and vehemently expressed the desire to limit the powers of the president in terms that often appeared openly critical of Yuan's ambitions. When the results of the 1913 elections indicated a clear victory for the KMT, it appeared that Song would be in a position to exercise a dominant role in selecting the premier and cabinet, and the party could have proceeded to push for the election of a future president in a parliamentary setting. On 20 March 1913, Song Jiaoren was shot by a lone gunman in Shanghai, and died two days later. The trail of evidence led to the secretary of the cabinet and the provisional premier of Yuan's government. Although Yuan was considered by contemporary Chinese media sources as the man most likely behind the assassination, the main conspirators investigated by authorities either were themselves assassinated or disappeared mysteriously. For lack of evidence, Yuan was not implicated.\nBecoming emperor.\nTensions between the KMT and Yuan continued to intensify. After arriving in Peking, the elected Parliament attempted to gain control over Yuan, to develop a permanent constitution, and to hold a legitimate, open presidential election. Because he had authorized $100 million of \"reorganization loans\" from a variety of foreign banks, the KMT in particular were highly critical of Yuan's handling of the national budget. Yuan's crackdown on the KMT began in 1913, with the suppression and bribery of KMT members in the two legislative chambers. Anti-Yuan revolutionaries also claimed Yuan orchestrated the collapse of the KMT internally and dismissed governors interpreted as being pro-KMT.\nSecond revolution.\nSeeing the situation for his party worsen, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan in August 1913, and called for a Second Revolution, this time against Yuan Shikai. Subsequently, Yuan gradually took over the government, using the military as the base of his power. He dissolved the national and provincial assemblies, and the House of Representatives and Senate were replaced by the newly formed \"Council of State\", with Duan Qirui, his trusted Beiyang lieutenant, as prime minister. He relied on the American-educated Tsai Tingkan for English translation and connections with western powers. Finally, Yuan had himself elected president to a five-year term, publicly labelled the KMT a seditious organization, ordered the KMT's dissolution, and evicted all its members from Parliament. The KMT's \"Second Revolution\" ended in failure as Yuan's troops achieved complete victory over revolutionary uprisings. Provincial governors with KMT loyalties who remained willingly submitted to Yuan. Because those commanders not loyal to Yuan were effectively removed from power, the Second Revolution cemented Yuan's power.\nIn January 1914, China's Parliament was formally dissolved. To give his government a semblance of legitimacy, Yuan convened a body of 66 men from his cabinet who, on 1 May 1914, produced a \"constitutional compact\" that effectively replaced China's provisional constitution. The new legal status quo gave Yuan, as president, practically unlimited powers over China's military, finances, foreign policy, and the rights of China's citizens. Yuan justified these reforms by stating that representative democracy had been proven inefficient by political infighting.\nAfter his victory, Yuan reorganized the provincial governments. Each province was supported by a military governor () as well as a civil authority, giving each governor control of his own army. This helped lay the foundations for the warlordism that crippled China over the next two decades.\nDuring Yuan's presidency, silver coinage featuring his portrait was introduced. This coin type was the first \"dollar\" coin of the central authorities of the Republic of China to be minted in large quantities. It became a staple silver coin type during the first half of the 20th century and was struck for the last time as late as the 1950s. The coins were also extensively forged.\nJapan's 21 demands.\nIn 1914, Japan captured the German colony at Qingdao. In January 1915, Japan sent a secret ultimatum, known as the Twenty-One Demands, to Beijing. Japan demanded an extension of extraterritoriality, the sale of businesses in debt to Japan and the cession of Qingdao to Japan, and virtual control of finance and the local police. When these demands were made public, hostility within China was expressed in nationwide anti-Japanese demonstrations and an effective national boycott of Japanese goods. With support from Britain and the United States Yuan secured Japan's dropping part five of the demands, which would have given Japan a general control of Chinese affairs. However he did accept the less onerous terms and that led to a decline in the popularity of Yuan's government.\nRevival of hereditary monarchy.\nTo build up his own authority, Yuan began to re-institute elements of state Confucianism. As the main proponent of reviving Qing state religious observances, Yuan effectively participated as emperor in rituals held at the Qing Temple of Heaven. In late 1915, rumours were floated of a popular consensus that the hereditary monarchy should be revived. With his power secure, many of Yuan's supporters, notably monarchist Yang Du, advocated for a revival of the hereditary monarchy, asking Yuan to take on the title of Emperor. Yang reasoned that the Chinese masses had long been used to monarchic rule, the Republic had been effective only as a transitional phase to end Manchu rule, and China's political situation demanded the stability that only a dynastic monarchy could ensure. The American political scientist Frank Johnson Goodnow suggested a similar idea. Negotiators representing Japan had also offered to support Yuan's ambitions as one of the rewards for Yuan's support of the Twenty-One Demands.\nOn 20 November 1915, Yuan held a specially convened \"Representative Assembly\" which voted unanimously to offer Yuan the throne. On 12 December 1915, Yuan \"accepted\" the invitation and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Chinese Empire () under the era name of Hongxian (; i.e. \"Constitutional Abundance\"). The new Empire of China was to formally begin on 1 January 1916, when Yuan intended to conduct the accession rites. Soon after becoming emperor, the Yuan placed an order with the former imperial potters for a 40,000-piece porcelain set costing 1.4 million yuan, a large jade seal, and two imperial robes costing 400,000 yuan each.\nPublic and international reactions to dynastic monarchy's revival.\nYuan expected widespread domestic and international support for his reign. British diplomats and bankers had previously worked hard to help him succeed. They had set up a banking consortium that loaned Yuan's government \u00a325 million in April 1913. However, he and his supporters had badly miscalculated. Many of the emperor's closest supporters abandoned him, and the solidarity of the emperor's Beiyang clique of military prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dissolved. There were open protests throughout China denouncing Yuan. Foreign governments, including Japan, suddenly proved indifferent or openly hostile to him, not giving him the recognition anticipated. Rebels bombed the presidential palace from the air in 1916. Sun Yat-sen, who had fled to Tokyo and set up a base there, organized efforts to overthrow Yuan. The emperor's sons publicly fought over the title of \"Crown Prince\", and formerly loyal subordinates such as Duan Qirui and Xu Shichang left him to create their own factions.\nAbandonment of monarchy and death.\nFaced with widespread opposition, Yuan repeatedly delayed the accession rites in order to appease his foes, but his prestige was irreparably damaged and province after province continued to voice disapproval. On 25 December 1915, Yunnan's military governor, Cai E, rebelled, launching the National Protection War. The governor of Guizhou followed in January 1916, and Guangxi declared independence in March. Funding for Yuan's accession ceremony was cut on 1 March.\nYuan formally abdicated and restored the Republic on 22 March 1916 after being emperor for only 83 days; primarily due to these mounting revolts as well as declining health from kidney failure. This was not enough for his enemies, who called for his resignation as president, causing more provinces to rebel. Yuan died of kidney failure at 10 a.m. on 6 June 1916, at the age of fifty-six.\nYuan's remains were moved to his home province and placed in a large mausoleum in Anyang. In 1928, the tomb was looted by Feng Yuxiang and his soldiers during the Northern Expedition.\nYuan had a wife and nine concubines, who bore him 17 sons and 15 daughters, but only three were prominent: Prince Yuan Keding, Prince Yuan Kewen, and Prince Yuan Keliang.\nEvaluation and legacy.\nHistorians in China have considered Yuan's rule mostly negatively. He introduced far-ranging modernizations in law and social areas, and trained and organized one of China's first modern armies; but the loyalty Yuan had fostered in the armed forces dissolved after his death, undermining the authority of the central government. Yuan financed his regime through large foreign loans, and is criticized for weakening Chinese morale and international prestige, and for allowing the Japanese to gain broad concessions over China.\nJonathan Spence, however, notes in his influential survey that Yuan was \"ambitious, both for his country and for himself\", and that \"even as he subverted the constitution, paradoxically he sought to build on late-Qing attempts at reforms and to develop institutions that would bring strong and stable government to China.\" To gain foreign confidence and end the hated system of extraterritoriality, Yuan strengthened the court system and invited foreign advisers to reform the penal system.\nAfter Yuan's death, there was an effort by Li Yuanhong to revive the Republic by recalling the legislators who had been ejected in 1913, but this effort was confused and ineffective in asserting central control. Li lacked any support from the military. There was a short-lived effort in 1917 to revive the Qing dynasty led by the loyalist general Zhang Xun, but his forces were defeated by rival warlords later that year.\nAfter the collapse of Zhang's movement, all pretence of strength from the central government collapsed, and China descended into a period of warlordism. Over the next several decades, the offices of both the president and parliament became the tools of militarists, and the politicians in Peking became dependent on regional governors for their support and political survival. For this reason, Yuan is sometimes called \"the Father of the Warlords\". However, it is not accurate to attribute China's subsequent age of warlordism as a personal preference, since in his career as a military reformer he had attempted to forge a modern army based on the Japanese model. Throughout his lifetime, he demonstrated an understanding of staffing, military education, and regular transfers of officer personnel, combining these skills to create China's first modern military organisation. After his return to power in 1911, however, he seemed willing to sacrifice his legacy of military reform for imperial ambitions, and instead ruled by a combination of violence and bribery that destroyed the idealism of the early Republican movement.\nIn the CCTV Production \"Towards the Republic\", Yuan is portrayed through most of his early years as an able administrator, although a very skilled manipulator of political situations. His self-proclamation as Emperor is largely depicted as being influenced by external forces, especially that of his son, prince Yuan Keding.\nA \"bixi\" stone tortoise with a stelae in honour of Yuan Shikai, which was installed in Anyang's Huanyuan Park soon after his death, was (partly) restored in 1993.\nNames.\nChinese men before 1949 customarily used and were referred to by various names. Yuan's courtesy name was \"Weiting\" (Wade-Giles spelling: Wei-ting; ), and he used the pseudonym \"Rong'an\" (Wade-Giles spelling: Jung-an; ). He was sometimes referred to by the name of his birthplace, \"Xiangcheng\" (), or by a title for tutors of the crown prince, \"Kung-pao\" ().\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59262", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59262", "title": "Acridine", "text": "Organic compound used in dyes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nAcridine is an organic compound and a nitrogen heterocycle with the formula C13H9N. Acridines are substituted derivatives of the parent ring. It is a planar molecule that is structurally related to anthracene with one of the central CH groups replaced by nitrogen. Like the related molecules pyridine and quinoline, acridine is mildly basic. It is an almost colorless solid, which crystallizes in needles. There are few commercial applications of acridines; at one time acridine dyes were popular, but they are now relegated to niche applications, such as with acridine orange. The name is a reference to the acrid odour and acrid skin-irritating effect of the compound.\nIsolation and syntheses.\nCarl Gr\u00e4be and Heinrich Caro first isolated acridine in 1870 from coal tar. Acridine is separated from coal tar by extracting with dilute sulfuric acid. Addition of potassium dichromate to this solution precipitates acridine bichromate. The bichromate is decomposed using ammonia.\nAcridine and its derivatives can be prepared by many synthetic processes. In the Bernthsen acridine synthesis, diphenylamine is condensed with carboxylic acids in the presence of zinc chloride. When formic acid is the carboxylic acid, the reaction yields the parent acridine. With the higher larger carboxylic acids, the derivatives substituted at the \"meso\" carbon atom are generated.\nOther older methods for the organic synthesis of acridines include condensing diphenylamine with chloroform in the presence of aluminium chloride, by passing the vapours of orthoaminodiphenylmethane over heated litharge, by heating salicylaldehyde with aniline and zinc chloride or by distilling acridone (9-position a carbonyl group) over zinc dust. Another classic method for the synthesis of acridones is the Lehmstedt-Tanasescu reaction.\nIn enzymology, an acridone synthase (EC https://) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction\n3 malonyl-CoA + \"N\"-methylanthraniloyl-CoA \u21cc 4 CoA + 1,3-dihydroxy-\"N\"-methylacridone + 3 CO2\nThus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and \"N\"-methylanthraniloyl-CoA, whereas its three products are CoA, 1,3-dihydroxy-\"N\"-methylacridone, and CO2.\nReactions.\nAcridine displays the reactions expected of an unsaturated \"N\"-heterocycle. It undergoes \"N\"-alkylation with alkyl iodides to form alkyl acridinium iodides, which are readily transformed by the action of alkaline potassium ferricyanide to \"N\"-alkyl acridones.\nBasicity.\nAcridine and its homologues are weakly basic. Acridine is a photobase which has a ground state p\"K\"a of 5.1, similar to that of pyridine, and an excited state p\"K\"a of 10.6. It also shares properties with quinoline.\nReduction and oxidation.\nAcridines can be reduced to the 9,10-dihydroacridines, sometimes called leucoacridines. Reaction with potassium cyanide gives the 9-cyano-9,10-dehydro derivative. On oxidation with potassium permanganate, it yields acridinic acid (C9H5N(CO2H)2) otherwise known as quinoline-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Acridine is easily oxidized by peroxymonosulfuric acid to the acridine amine oxide. The carbon 9-position of acridine is activated for addition reactions.\nApplications.\nSeveral dyes and drugs feature the acridine skeleton. Many acridines, such as proflavine, also have antiseptic properties. Acridine and related derivatives (such as amsacrine) bind to DNA and RNA due to their abilities to intercalate. Acridine orange (3,6-dimethylaminoacridine) is a nucleic acid-selective metachromatic stain useful for cell cycle determination.\nDyes.\nAt one time acridine dyes were commercially significant, but they are now uncommon because they are not lightfast. Acridine dyes are prepared by condensation of 1,3-diaminobenzene derivatives. Illustrative is the reaction of 2,4-diaminotoluene with acetaldehyde:\n9-Phenylacridine is the parent base of chrysaniline or 3,6-diamino-9-phenylacridine, which is the chief constituent of the dyestuff phosphine (not to be confused with phosphine gas), a byproduct in the manufacture of rosaniline. Chrysaniline forms red-coloured salts, which dye silk and wool in a fine yellow; and the solutions of the salts are characterized by their fine yellowish-green fluorescence. Chrysaniline was synthesized by O. Fischer and G. Koerner by condensing \"o\"-nitrobenzaldehyde with aniline, the resulting \"o\"-nitro-\"p\"-diaminotriphenylmethane being reduced to the corresponding \"o\"-amino compound, which on oxidation yields chrysaniline.\nBenzoflavin, an isomer of chrysaniline, is also a dyestuff, and has been prepared by K. Oehler from \"m\"-phenylenediamine and benzaldehyde. These substances condense to form tetraaminotriphenylmethane, which, on heating with acids, loses ammonia and yields 3,6-diamino-9,10-dihydrophenylacridine, from which benzoflavin is obtained by oxidation. It is a yellow powder, soluble in hot water.\nMolecular biology.\nAcridine is known to induce small insertions or deletions in nucleotide sequences, resulting in frameshift mutations. This compound was useful to identify the triplet nature of the genetic codes.\nStructure.\nAs established by X-ray crystallography, acridine has been obtained in eight polymorphs. All feature very similar planar molecules with nearly identical bond lengths and bond distances.\nSafety.\nAcridine is a skin irritant. Its LD50 (rats, oral) is 2,000\u00a0mg/kg and 500\u00a0mg/kg (mice, oral).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by Astoria to the north; the East River to the west; Sunnyside to the east; and Newtown Creek, which separates Queens from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to the south. Its name refers to its location on the western tip of Long Island.\nIncorporated as a city in 1870, Long Island City was originally the seat of government of the Town of Newtown, before becoming part of the City of Greater New York in 1898. In the early 21st century, Long Island City became known for its rapid and ongoing residential growth and gentrification, its waterfront parks, and its thriving arts community. The area has a high concentration of art galleries, art institutions, and studio space. Long Island City is the eastern terminus of the Queensboro Bridge, the only non-tolled automotive route connecting Queens and Manhattan. Northeast of the bridge are the Queensbridge Houses, a development of the New York City Housing Authority and the largest public housing complex in the Western Hemisphere.\nLong Island City is part of Queens Community District 1 to the north and Queens Community District 2 to the south. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 108th Precinct. Politically, Long Island City is represented by the New York City Council's 26th District.\nHistory.\nAs independent city.\nLong Island City was incorporated as a city on May 4, 1870, from the merging of the village of Astoria and the hamlets of Ravenswood, Hunters Point, Blissville, Sunnyside, Dutch Kills, Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in the Town of Newtown. At the time of its incorporation, Long Island City had between 12,000 and 15,000 residents. Its charter provided for an elected mayor and a ten-member Board of Aldermen with two representing each of the city's five wards. City ordinances could be passed by a majority vote of the Board of Aldermen and the mayor's signature.\nLong Island City held its first election on July 5, 1870. Residents elected A.D. Ditmars the first mayor; Ditmars ran as both a Democrat and a Republican. The first elected Board of Aldermen was H. Rudolph and Patrick Lonirgan (Ward 1); Francis McNena and William E. Bragaw (Ward 2); George Hunter and Mr. Williams (Third Ward); James R. Bennett and John Wegart (Ward Four); and E.M. Hartshort and William Carlin (Fifth Ward). The mayor and the aldermen were inaugurated on July 18, 1870.\nThe Common Council of Long Island City in 1873 adopted the coat of arms as \"emblematical of the varied interest represented by Long Island City.\" It was designed by George H. Williams, of Ravenswood. The overall composition was inspired by New York City's coat of arms. The shield is rich in historic allusion, including Native American, Dutch, and English symbols.\nIn the 1880s, Mayor De Bevoise nearly bankrupted the Long Island City government by embezzlement, of which he was convicted. Many dissatisfied residents of Astoria circulated a petition to ask the New York State Legislature to allow it to secede from Long Island City and reincorporate as the Village of Astoria, as it existed prior to the incorporation of Long Island City, in 1884. The petition was ultimately dropped by the citizens.\nLong Island City continued to exist as an incorporated city until 1898, when the city, the rest of the Town of Newtown (today known as Elmhurst, Queens) and other Towns in Queens were consolidated into New York City. The last mayor of Long Island City was an Irish-American named Patrick Jerome \"Battle-Axe\" Gleason.\nAfter incorporation into New York City.\nThe city surrendered its independence in 1898 to become part of the City of Greater New York. However, Long Island City survives as ZIP Code 11101 and ZIP Code prefix 111 (with its own main post office) and was formerly a sectional center facility (SCF). The Greater Astoria Historical Society, a nonprofit cultural and historical organization documenting the Long Island City area's history, has operated since 1985.\nThrough the 1930s, three subway tunnels, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and the Queensboro Bridge were built to connect the neighborhood to Manhattan. By the 1970s, the factories in Long Island City were being abandoned.\nIn the 1990s, Queens West on the west side of Long Island City was developed to revitalize along the East River, with plans to bring in as many as 16,000 new residents in a total of 19 new buildings.\nIn 2001, the neighborhood was rezoned from an industrial neighborhood to a residential neighborhood, and the area underwent gentrification, with developments such as Hunter's Point South being built in the area. Since then, there has been substantial commercial and residential growth in Long Island City, with 41 new residential apartment buildings being built just between 2010 and 2017. A resident of nearby Woodside proposed establishing a Japantown in Long Island City in 2006, though this did not occur. By the mid-2010s, Long Island City was one of New York City's fastest-growing neighborhoods.\nHistoric landmarks.\nIn addition to the Hunters Point Historic District and Queensboro Bridge, the 45th Road \u2013 Court House Square Station (Dual System IRT), Long Island City Courthouse Complex, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. New York City designated landmarks include the Pepsi-Cola sign along the East River; the Fire Engine Company 258, Hook and Ladder Company 115 firehouse; the Long Island City Courthouse; the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company building; and the Chase Manhattan Bank Building.\nDemographics.\nBased on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of the combined Queensbridge-Ravenswood-Long Island City neighborhood was 20,030, a decrease of 1,074 (5.1%) from the 21,104 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 14.7% (2,946) White, 25.9% (5,183) African American, 0.3% (62) Native American, 15.5% (3,096) Asian, 0.0% (6) Pacific Islander, 1.2% (248) from other races, and 1.9% (385) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 40.5% (8,104) of the population.\nLong Island City is split between Queens Community Board 1 to the north of Queens Plaza and Queens Community Board 2 south of Queens Plaza. The entirety of Queens Community Board 1, which comprises northern Long Island City and Astoria, had 199,969 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.4 years. The entirety of Queens Community Board 2, which comprises southern Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, had 135,972 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.4 years. Both figures are higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. In both community boards, most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth.\nAs of 2017, the median household income was $66,382 in Community Board 1 and $67,359 in Community Board 2. In 2018, an estimated 18% of Community Board 1 and 20% of Community Board 2 residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. The unemployment rate was 8% in Community Board 1 and 5% in Community Board 2, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 47% in Community Board 1 and 51% in Community Board 2, slightly lower than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018[ [update]], northern LIC is considered to be gentrifying, while southern LIC is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.\nAccording to the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, the southern portion of Long Island City south of the Queensboro Bridge had an approximate average equal population of White and Asian residents with each their populations being between 10,000 and 19,999 residents, while the Hispanic and Black populations each were under 5,000 residents.

The new Asian residents are mainly Chinese, Bengalis, Koreans, and Japanese, and the neighborhood had at least 15 Asian-owned businesses in the neighborhood. Unlike the largely working-class Asian immigrant populations in southern Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, the growing Asian population in Long Island City tends to be second- or third-generation Americans and are largely middle or upper class. Exceptionally however, the growing Asian population in NYCHA's Queensbridge Houses section of Long Island City at 11% are mostly from immigrant working-class backgrounds and largely have limited English skills, which has presented issues when residents are unable to find interpreters to communicate with NYCHA. New York City Council member Julie Won, who represents the neighborhood, has spoken about the need for outreach to the area's Asian residents and businesses.\nCommerce and economy.\nDevelopments and buildings.\nLong Island City was once home to many factories and bakeries, some of which are finding new uses. The former Silvercup bakery is now home to Silvercup Studios, which has produced notable works such as NBC's \"30 Rock\" and HBO's \"Sex and the City\" and \"The Sopranos\". The Silvercup sign is visible from the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Astoria Line trains going into and out of Queensboro Plaza ( 7 , &lt;7&gt;\u200b\u200b, N and \u200b W trains). The former Sunshine Bakery is now one of the buildings which houses LaGuardia Community College.

The former factory built in 1919 now houses the Jim Henson Company, Society Awards, and a commercial rooftop farm run by Brooklyn Grange.\nHigh-rise housing is being built on a former Pepsi-Cola site on the East River. From June 2002 to September 2004, the former Swingline Staplers plant was the temporary headquarters of the Museum of Modern Art. Other former factories in Long Island City include Fisher Electronics, Marantz and Chiclets Gum. Long Island City's turn-of-the-century district of residential towers, called Queens West, is located along the East River, just north of the LIRR's Long Island City Station. Redevelopment in Queens West reflects the intent to have the area as a major residential area in New York City, with its high-rise residences very close to public transportation, making it convenient for commuters to travel to Manhattan by ferry or subway. The first tower, the 42-floor Citylights, opened in 1998 with an elementary school at the base. Others have been completed since then and more are being planned or under construction.\nLong Island City contains several of the tallest buildings in Queens. The One Court Square, formerly the Citicorp Building, was built in 1990 in Courthouse Square; it is currently the fourth tallest building in Queens and the fifth-tallest on Long Island, and was Queens' tallest building until 2019. The tallest building in the borough and second tallest on Long Island, the Orchard residential tower, was architecturally topped-out in July 2024. Yet another skyscraper, the tower named Sven, completed construction at Queens Plaza and became the third tallest building in the borough.\nThe Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing complex, comprises over 3,000 units, making it the largest such complex in North America.\nSince 2005, part of the neighborhood has been maintained by the LIC Partnership as part of the Long Island City Business Improvement District. Initially, the business improvement district comprised 84 properties on either side of Queens Plaza. The BID was expanded in 2017 to cover several other major roads in Long Island City. The LIC Partnership requested in 2022 that the BID's size and budget be doubled, and the BID was again expanded in 2024.\nCompanies.\nEagle Electric, now known as Cooper Wiring Devices, was one of the last major factories in the area, before it moved to China; Plant No. 7, which was the largest of their factories and housed their corporate offices, is being converted to residential luxury lofts.\nLong Island City is currently home to the largest fortune cookie factory in the United States, owned by Wonton Foods and producing four million fortune cookies a day. Lucky numbers included on fortunes in the company's cookies led to 110 people across the United States winning $100,000 each in a May 2005 drawing for Powerball.\nThe Brooks Brothers tie manufacturing factory, which employs 122 people and produces more than 1.5\u00a0million ties per year, has operated in Long Island City since 1999.\nOther companies headquartered in Long Island City include independent film studio Troma and Standard Motor Products.\nIn spring 2010, JetBlue Airways announced it was moving its headquarters from Forest Hills to Long Island City, also incorporating the jobs from its Darien, Connecticut, office. The airline, which operates its largest hub at JFK Airport, also operates from LaGuardia Airport, and made the Brewster Building in Queens Plaza its home. The airline moved there around mid-2012.\nIn November 2018, news media claimed that Amazon.com was in final talks with the government of New York State to construct one of two campuses for its proposed Amazon HQ2 at Queens West in Long Island City. The other campus would be located at National Landing in Crystal City, Virginia. Both campuses would have 25,000 workers. The selection was confirmed by Amazon on November 13, 2018. On February 14, 2019, Amazon announced it was pulling out, citing unexpected opposition from local lawmakers and unions.\nSubsections.\nIn 1870, the villages of Astoria, Ravenswood, Hunters Point, Dutch Kills, Middletown, Sunnyside, Blissville, and Bowery Bay were incorporated into Long Island City.\nDutch Kills.\nDutch Kills was a hamlet, named for its navigable tributary of Newtown Creek, that occupied what today is Queens Plaza. Dutch Kills was an important road hub during the American Revolutionary War, and the site of a British Army garrison from 1776 to 1783. The area supported farms during the 19th century. The tributary of the same name connected to Sunswick Creek at its north end, which facilitated commerce in the region. The canalization of Newtown Creek and the Kills at the end of the 19th century intensified industrial development of the area, which prospered until the middle of the 20th century. The neighborhood is currently undergoing a massive rezoning of mixed residential and commercial properties.\nBlissville.\nBlissville, which has the ZIP Code 11101, is a neighborhood within Long Island City, located at and bordered by Calvary Cemetery to the east; the Long Island Expressway to the north; Newtown Creek to the south; and Dutch Kills, a tributary of Newtown Creek, to the west. Blissville was named after Neziah Bliss, who owned most of the land in the 1830s and 1840s. Bliss built the first version of what was known for many years as the Blissville Bridge, a drawbridge over Newtown Creek, connecting Greenpoint, Brooklyn and Blissville; it was replaced in the 20th century by the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge, also called the J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge, located slightly upstream. Blissville existed as a small village until 1870 when it was incorporated into Long Island City. Historically an industrial neighborhood, it has Triangle 54, a small park with a monument at 54th Avenue and 48th Street.\nHunters Point.\nHunters Point is located on the south side of Long Island City, along Newtown Creek.

His short reign occurred during a period of partisan strife in the Catholic Church, amid the violence and disorder in central Italy. His pontificate ended when he was deposed and confined to a monastery.\nFamily and early career.\nLittle is known of Romanus's background. He was born in Gallese, near Civita Castellana. His father was called Constantine. According to Anura Gurug\u00e9, Romanus was supposedly the nephew of Pope Marinus I, who had also come from Gallese. Romanus was installed as the cardinal priest of San Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, in 867.\nPapacy.\nIn January 897, Pope Stephen VI held what is known as the Cadaver Synod. He had the body of Pope Formosus, the rival of his ally, Lambert of Spoleto, exhumed and tried for \"perjury, violating the canons prohibiting the translation of bishops, and coveting the papacy.\" After finding him guilty, the synod annulled all of Formosus' acts and ordinations. Formosus' body was reburied in a common grave, and then thrown in the river Tiber. Supporters of Formosus rebelled, and seven months after the synod, Stephen VI was deposed, and died soon after in prison.\nRomanus was elected to succeed Stephen VI in August 897. He was generally considered to be pro-Formosan, and annulled all the acts and decrees of his predecessor. This was criticised by the 15th-century historian Bartolomeo Platina, who wrote that \"these popelings studied nothing else but to extinguish the memory and honour of their predecessors\". During his short pontificate, he granted the pallium to Abbot Vitalis of Farfa, appointed him as the patriarch of Grado, and bestowed a privilege upon the See of Grado. Romanus also confirmed the possessions of the bishops of Girona and Elna of their sees. His short rule was regarded as a virtuous one by contemporary historian Flodoard.\nDeath and aftermath.\nRomanus' reign as pope ended in November 897, when it is said that \"he was made a monk\", a term used when a pope is deposed and often confined to a monastery. It is unknown whether he was deposed by supporters of his predecessor, Stephen VI, or by pro-Formosan supporters, who wanted to replace him with a pope who would more actively vindicate Formosus. Romanus' date of death is unknown.\nThe power struggle between supporters of Formosus and those of Stephen continued for over ten years; Romanus was succeeded by Theodore II, who was only pope for twenty days, during which time he had Formosus' body reburied, and held a synod annulling the Cadaver Synod. This was reaffirmed by John IX who held synods reaffirming that of Theodore II, and he further banned the trial of people after their death. In turn, Sergius III later annulled the synods of Theodore II and John IX, and reinstated the validity of the Cadaver Synod.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59276", "revid": "25713734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59276", "title": "Mbira", "text": "African musical instrument of the lamellophone family\nMbira ( ; ) (also known as kalimba and zanza) are a family of musical instruments, traditional to the Shona people of Zimbabwe. They consist of a wooden board (often fitted with a resonator) with attached staggered metal tines, played by holding the instrument in the hands and plucking the tines with the thumbs (at minimum), the right forefinger (most mbira), and sometimes the left forefinger. Musicologists classify it as a lamellaphone, part of the plucked idiophone family of musical instruments. In Eastern and Southern Africa, there are many kinds of mbira, often accompanied by the hosho, a percussion instrument. It is often an important instrument played at religious ceremonies, weddings, and other social gatherings. The \"Art of crafting and playing Mbira/Sansi, the finger-plucking traditional musical instrument in Malawi and Zimbabwe\" was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020.\nA Western interpretation of the instrument, the kalimba, was commercially produced and exported by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey in the late 1950s, popularising similar instruments outside of Africa. Tracey's design was modelled after the mbira nyunga nyunga and named kalimba after an ancient predecessor of the mbira family of instruments. The kalimba is basically a westernised younger version of mbira. It was popularized in the 1960s and early 1970s largely due to the successes of such musicians as Maurice White of the band Earth, Wind and Fire and Thomas Mapfumo in the 1970s. These musicians included mbira on stage accompanying modern rock instruments such as electric guitar and bass, drum kit, and horns. \nTheir arrangements included numerous songs directly drawn from traditional mbira repertoire. Other notable influencers bringing mbira music out of Africa are: Dumisani Maraire, who brought marimba and karimba music to the American Pacific Northwest; Ephat Mujuru, who was one of the pioneer teachers of mbira dzavadzimu in the United States; and the writings and recordings of Zimbabwean musicians made by Paul Berliner.\nJoseph H. Howard and Babatunde Olatunji have both suggested that mbira (and other metal lamellaphones) are thoroughly African, being found only in areas populated by Africans or their descendants. Similar instruments were reported to be used in Okpuje, Nsukka area of the south eastern part of Nigeria in the early 1900s.\nHistory.\nVarious kinds of plucked idiophones and lamellaphones have existed in Africa for thousands of years. The tines were originally made of bamboo but over the years metal keys have been developed. These types of instrument appear to have been invented twice in Africa: a wood or bamboo-tined instrument appeared on the west coast of Africa about 3,000 years ago, and metal-tined lamellophones appeared in the Zambezi River valley around 1,300 years ago. Metal-tined instruments traveled all across the continent, becoming popular among the Shona of Zimbabwe (from which the word mbira comes) and other indigenous groups in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The mbira was differentiated in its physical form and social uses as it spread. Kalimba-like instruments came to exist from the northern reaches of North Africa to the southern extent of the Kalahari Desert, and from the east coast to the west coast, though many or most groups of people in Africa did not possess mbiras. There were thousands of different tunings, different note layouts, and different instrument designs, but there is a hypothetical tuning and note layout of the original metal-tined instrument from 1,300 years ago, referred to as the 'kalimba core'.\nIn the mid 1950s mbira instruments were the basis for the development of the \"kalimba\", a westernised version designed and marketed by the ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey, leading to a great expansion of its distribution outside Africa.\nAcoustics.\nLamellophones are instruments which have little tines, or \"lamellae\", which are played by plucking. Unlike stringed instruments or air-column instruments like flutes, the overtones of a plucked lamella are inharmonic, giving the mbira a characteristic sound. The inharmonic overtones are strongest in the attack and die out rather quickly, leaving an almost pure tone. When a tine is plucked, the adjacent tines also create secondary vibrations that increase the harmonic complexity of an individual note.\nRhythm.\nMbira music, like much of the sub-Saharan African music traditions is based on cross-rhythm. An example from the kutsinhira part of the traditional mbira dzavadzimu piece \"Nhema Musasa\" is given by David Pe\u00f1alosa, who observes that the left hand plays the ostinato \"bass line,\" while the right hand plays the upper melody. The composite melody is an embellishment of the 3:2 cross-rhythm (also known as a hemiola).\nTuning.\nIt is common on African mbira and other lamellophones to have the lowest notes in the centre with higher notes to the far left and the far right\u2014this is an ergonomic nicety, in that the thumb can pivot such that all the tines are easy to reach. However, traditional African tunings use notes that do not lie on the grid of the Western tempered scale, and traditional mbira note layouts are often idiosyncratic, sometimes with adjacent tines making part of a scale, but then an odd note thrown in that defies the pattern.\nHistorically, mbira tunings have not mapped exactly onto Western scales; it is not unusual for a seven-note sequence on a mbira to be \"stretched\" over a greater range of frequencies than a Western octave and for the intervals between notes to be different from those in a Western scale. Tunings have often been idiosyncratic with variations over time and from one player to another. A mbira key produces a rich complex of overtones that varies from one instrument to another depending on its maker's intentions and accidents of fabrication, such that some instruments simply sound better when some notes of a familiar tuning are pushed. With the increased popularity of the mbira dzavadzimu in North America, Europe, and Japan in recent decades, Zimbabwean mbira makers have tended to tune their instruments more uniformly for export, but much variation is still found among mbira in their homeland.\nTunings vary from family to family, referring to relative interval relationships and not to absolute pitches. The most common tuning played throughout Zimbabwe and among non-Zimbabwean mbira players worldwide is Nyamaropa, similar to the western Mixolydian mode. Names may also vary between different families; Garikayi Tirikoti has developed a \"mbira orchestra\" that has seven different tunings, each starting on a different interval of the same seven-note scale, where it is possible to play all instruments in a single performance. The seven tunings that Garikayi uses are: Bangidza, Nyabango, Nhemamusasa, Chakwi, Taireva, Mahororo, and Mavembe (all of which are also names of traditional songs save for Mavembe and Nyabango). The closest to what is commonly named \"Nyamaropa\" is his \"Nhemamusasa\" tuning.\nSpecific tunings.\nCommon names for tunings are:\nVariants.\nMbira dzavadzimu.\nIn Shona music, the mbira dzavadzimu (\"voice of the ancestors\", or \"\"mbira of the ancestral spirits\", national instrument of Zimbabwe) is a musical instrument that has been played by the Shona people of Zimbabwe for thousands of years. The \"mbira dzavadzimu\" is frequently played at religious ceremonies and social gatherings called \"mapira\" (sing. \"bira\"). The \"mbira dzavadzimu\" can be used to play over one hundred songs, such as \"Kariga mombe\".\nA typical \"mbira dzavadzimu\" consists of between 22 and 28 keys constructed from hot- or cold-forged metal affixed to a hardwood soundboard (\"gwariva\") in three different registers\u2014two on the left, one on the right.\nWhile playing, the little finger of the right hand is placed through a hole in the bottom right corner of the soundboard, with the little finger entering from the front of sound board, and the ring finger and middle finger reaching around the back to stabilise the instrument. This leaves the thumb and index finger of the right hand open to stroke the keys in the right register from above (thumb) and below (index finger). The fingers of the left hand stabilise the left side of the instrument, with most fingers reaching slightly behind the instrument. Both registers on the left side of the instrument are played with the left thumb. Some mbira possess an extra key in the upper left register which is hit from below by the left index finger.\nBottle caps, shells, or other objects (\"machachara\"\") are often affixed to the soundboard to create a buzzing sound when the instrument is played. In a traditional setting, this sound is considered extremely important, as it is believed to attract ancestral spirits.\nDuring a public performance, an \"mbira dzavadzimu\" is frequently placed in a \"deze\" (calabash resonator) to amplify its sound.\nThe \"mbira dza vadzimu\" is very significant in Shona religion and culture, considered a sacred instrument by the Shona people. It is usually played to facilitate communication with ancestral spirits, bringing the spirit of the dead back on its homestead. Within the Shona tradition, the mbira may be played with paired performers in which the \"kushaura\", the caller, leads the performed piece as the \"kutsinhira\", the responder, \"interlocks\" a subsequent part. The ritual is known as the \"Bira.\" During these all-night ceremonies, people call upon the spirits to answer questions. The variations of notes in an \"Mbira\" piece aid the participants in going into trance, which in Shona culture aids the spirits in taking over the participant's body.\nAlbert Chimedza, director of the Mbira Centre in Harare, has estimated that \"there are at most ten thousand people in the world who play mbira.\"\nMbira Nyunga Nyunga.\nThe nyunga nyunga which normally has 15 keys, originated from Manicaland where it traditionally played the entertainment role during social gatherings and commemorations. Jeke (Jack) Tapera introduced the mbira nyunga nyunga in the 1960s from Tete province of Mozambique to Kwanongoma College of African music (now United College of Music) in Bulawayo. Two keys were then added to make fifteen (Chirimumimba, 2007), in two rows. The mbira nyunga nyunga is similar in construction to the mbira dzavadzimu, but has no hole in the soundboard. Key pitch radiates out from the center, rather than from left to right.\nZimbabwe's Dumisani Maraire originated mbira nyunga nyunga number notation. The upper row keys (from left) are keys 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 while the bottom row keys are notated as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Maraire brought awareness of this instrument to the United States when he came to the University of Washington as a visiting artist from 1968 to 1972.\nRecently a Midlands State University (Gweru, Zimbabwe) lecturer in the department of music and musicology has suggested a letter notation; the upper keys as (from first left upper key) E, D, C, F, C, D, and E and the lower or bottom keys as (from the first lower key) A, G, F, A, F, C, D, and E. But the Maraire number notation has remained the internationally accepted system (Chirimumimba, 2007).\nDutch composer Maarten Regtien (1963) uses a Mbira Nyunga Nyunga in the electronic composition http:// (2014), creating soundscapes and using western composition techniques like the canon, impossible to play on a mbira.\nNjari mbira.\nNjari mbira has 30 to 32 keys and was also originated from Zimbabwe particularly Masvingo and Makonde.\nNhare.\nThe nhare has 23 to 24 keys and was originated from Zimbabwe. In the Zimbabwean tradition, nhare was used for rituals of communicating with Musikavanhu or Nyadenga (God).\nMbira matepe.\nMbira matepe which has 26 keys originated from along the borders of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.\nOutside Africa.\nIn the diaspora.\nThe first documentation of Kalimbas in Brazil dates back to 1723 where they are referred to as marimbas (not to be confused with marimbas). They seem to have faded into obscurity as they didn't make it to the present day, although \"modern\" Kalimbas now exist in Brazil.\nIn Cuba African lamellophones along with the Caj\u00f3n influenced the origins of the marimbula, whose history is poorly documented but is suspected to have originated in eastern Cuba.\nHugh Tracey.\nThe Hugh Tracey kalimbas are tuned diatonically in the key of G. The arrangement of the notes on the Hugh Tracey kalimba borrows from the typical scheme with the lowest notes in the center and the upper notes on the left and the right, with the notes in the ascending scale alternating strictly right-left and going outwards towards the two sides.\nThe diatonic western kalimba tuning which Tracey used was practical for a worldwide instrument\u2014with hundreds of African kalimba tunings, the chosen Western standard would maximise the number of people who would immediately connect with the kalimba. The practicality of this note arrangement, with notes going up the scale in a right-left-right-left progression, is that modal 1-3-5 or 1-3-5-7 chords are made by playing adjacent tines. If chords are played in the lower octave, the same notes will appear on the opposite side of the kalimba in the upper octave, which makes it very easy to simultaneously play a melody in the upper octave and an accompanying harmony in the lower octave. So, the arrangement of notes on the Hugh Tracey kalimba (and on virtually any kalimba that copies the instrument) makes certain complex musical operations very simple.\nAlternative tunings are possible, as the tines of most kalimbas are easily pushed in and out to sharpen or flatten their pitch. Some alternative tunings simply change the key of the kalimba, without changing the note layout scheme. C major is a popular tuning, sold by multiple manufacturers. Other alternative tunings move the kalimba to non-modal scales (such as Middle-Eastern scales). Each note of the kalimba can be tuned independently (unlike a guitar), so any scale, western or non-western, is possible, and traditional African scales are still accessible to this modern African instrument. Composer Georg Hajdu has tuned the Hugh Tracey alto kalimba to the chromatic steps of the Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale in a piece called \"Just Her \u2013 Jester \u2013 Gesture\". The Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale subdivides the just twelfth into 13 steps.\nRelated instruments.\nInstruments related to or inspired by the mbira include:\nIn popular culture.\nDespite its Botswanan setting, the 1980 movie \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\" features a character playing the mbira.\nIn the 2010 video game \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\", one of main antagonists of the game is named Krazy Kalimba. Being a member of the musical instrument-themed Tiki Tak Tribe, his design features a \"crown\" evoking the keys of a kalimba, and he plays kalimba music as part of his hypnotic chant used to make various animals do his bidding.\nOn May 21, 2020, as part of Zimbabwe Culture Week, Google honoured the mbira with a doodle which included a button allowing users to hear and play the instrument virtually. The doodle also featured the animated story of a young girl who learns to play the mbira, later inspiring a new generation of mbira players after becoming an established artiste herself as an adult.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nArchived Link - https://, \"A community of mbira players, researchers, makers &amp; lovers, for the enhancement of the Mbira, music &amp; fashion.

They are the highest mountains in the Carpathians. The Tatras are distinct from the Low Tatras (), a separate Slovak mountain range further south.\nThe Tatra Mountains occupy an area of , of which about (77.7%) lie within Slovakia and about (22.3%) within Poland. The highest peak, called Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt, at , is located north of Poprad, entirely in Slovakia. The highest point in Poland, Rysy, at , is located southeast of Zakopane, on the border with Slovakia.\nThe Tatras' length, measured from the eastern foothills of the \"Kobyl\u00ed vrch\" () to the southwestern foot of \"Ostr\u00fd vrch\" (1128 m), in a straight line, is (or according to some), and strictly along the main ridge, . The range is only wide. The main ridge of the Tatras runs from the village of Huty at the western end to the village of \u017ddiar at the eastern end.\nThe Tatras are now protected by law by the establishment of the Tatra National Park, Slovakia and the Tatra National Park, Poland, which are jointly entered in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves.\nIn 1992, UNESCO jointly designated the Polish and Slovak parks a transboundary biosphere reserve in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, under its Man and the Biosphere Programme.\nEtymology.\nThe first written record of the name is from 999, when the Bohemian Duke Boleslaus II, on his deathbed, recalled when the Duchy of Bohemia extended to the \"Tritri montes\". Another mention is in the 1086 document from Henry IV, wherein he referred to the Diocese of Prague with \"Tritri\" mountains. Still another is in 1125, where the Kosmas chronicles (\"Chronica Boemorum)\" mention the name \"Tatri\".\nIn 1790 Belsazar Hacquet wrote that Slavs call these mountains \"Tatari or Tatri\" because there used to be Tatar hordes roaming the area.\nMachek in 1931 favored the theory of the Polish linguist Rozwadowski with a syllabic \"r\" like in the words \"chrt\" (Czech hound), \"smrt\" (Czech death)\".\" In Czech this syllabic is sometimes with vowels \"i\", \"e\" or \"u\" for example \"\u010drn\u00fd\" \u2013 \"\u010dern\u00fd\", so the Czech reconstruction from Tritri/Tritry would be \"Trtry.\" In Polish, the term \"Tatry\" is firstly mentioned in 1255. Syllabic \"r\" often has vowels on both sides in Polish, so in the case of \"Tarty\", we can reconstruct the name to \"Tartry\", where the vowel \"a\" originated before the syllabic \"r\", which dissimilated. This theory is supported by Hungarian forms \"Turtur\", \"Turtul\", and \"Tortol\" from the 12th to 14th centuries. It is unclear what form the Slovak term took before the 17th century when the first references to \"Tatry\" appear, probably as a loan word from Polish that later found its way into Czech and Hungarian. The term \"Tatra\" also appears as a general term in Slovak for barren or stony land, and also in Ukraine for small stones in a river. Machek stresses that the name has no Slavic origin and mentions Rozwadowski's theory of an Illyrian origin because of a connection with a Herzegovian highland called \"Tatra\", thus taken from local inhabitants. The name is also close to the Ukrainian word for gravel, \"toltry\".\nOverview.\nThe Tatras are a mountain range of a corrugated nature, originating from the Alpine orogeny, and therefore characterized by a relatively young-looking lie of the land, quite similar to the landscape of the Alps, although significantly smaller. It is the highest mountain range within the Carpathians.\nIt consists of the internal mountain chains of:\nThe overall nature of the Tatras, together with their easy accessibility, makes them a favorite with tourists and researchers. Therefore, these mountains are a popular winter sports area, with resorts such as Poprad and the town Vysok\u00e9 Tatry (The Town of High Tatras) in Slovakia created in 1999, including former separate resorts: \u0160trbsk\u00e9 Pleso, Star\u00fd Smokovec, and Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica or Zakopane, called also \"winter capital of Poland\". The High Tatras, with their 24 (or 25) peaks exceeding 2,500 m above sea level, together with the Southern Carpathians, represent the only form of alpine landscape in the entire length of arc of the Carpathians.\nOwnership and border disputes.\nBy the end of the First Polish Republic, the border with the Kingdom of Hungary in the Tatras was not exactly defined. The Tatras became an unoccupied borderland. On 20 November 1770, under the guise of protection against the epidemic of plague in the Podolia, an Austrian army entered into Polish land and formed a cordon sanitaire, seizing S\u0105decczyzna, Spi\u0161 and Podhale. Two years later, the First Partition of Poland allocated the lands to Austria. In 1824, Zakopane region and the area around Morskie Oko were purchased from the authorities of the Austrian Empire by a Hungarian, Emanuel Homolacs. When Austria-Hungary was formed in 1867, the Tatra Mountains became a natural border between the two states of the dual monarchy, but the border itself has not been exactly determined. In 1889, a Polish Count W\u0142adys\u0142aw Zamoyski purchased at auction the Zakopane region along with the area around Morskie Oko. Due to numerous disputes over land ownership in the late 19th century, attempts were made at the delimitation of the border. They were fruitless until 1897, and the case went to an international court, which determined on 13 September 1902 the exact course of the Austro-Hungarian border in the disputed area.\nA new round of border disputes between Poland and Czechoslovakia started immediately after the end of the First World War, when these two countries were established. Among other claims, Poland claimed ownership of a large part of the Spi\u0161 region. This claim also included additional parts of the Tatra Mountains. After several years of border conflicts, the first treaty (facilitated by the League of Nations) was signed in 1925, with Poland receiving a small northernmost part of the Spi\u0161 region, immediately outside (to the north-east of) the Tatra Mountains, thus not changing the border in the mountains themselves. During the Second World War there were multiple attempts by both sides of the conflict to occupy more land, but the final treaty signed in 1958 (valid until the present day) preserved the border line agreed in 1925.\nBorders and hiking.\nWith the collapse of the Austrian Empire in 1918 and the creation of Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Tatra Mountains started to be divided by the international border. This brought considerable difficulties to hikers, as it was illegal to cross the border without passing through an official border checkpoint, and for many decades, there were no checkpoints for hikers anywhere on the border ridge. The nearest road border crossings were Tatransk\u00e1 Javorina - \u0141ysa Polana and Podsp\u00e1dy - Jurg\u00f3w in the east, and Such\u00e1 Hora - Chochol\u00f3w in the west. Indeed, those who did cross elsewhere were frequently fined or even detained by the border police of both countries. On the other hand, the permeable border in the Tatra Mountains was also heavily used for cross-border smuggling of goods such as alcohol, tobacco, coffee, etc. between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Only in 1999, more than 80 years after the dissolution of the Austrian Empire, the governments of Poland and Slovakia signed an agreement designating several unstaffed border crossings (with only irregular spot checks by border police) for hikers and cyclists on the 444\u00a0km-long Slovak-Polish border. One of these border crossings was created in the Tatra Mountains themselves, on the summit of the Rysy peak. However, there were still many other peaks and passes where hiking trails ran across the border, but where crossing remained illegal. This situation finally improved in 2007, with both countries accessing the Schengen Area. Since then, it has been legal to cross the border at any point (i.e., no further official checkpoints were designated). Rules of the national parks on both sides of the border still apply, and they restrict movement to official hiking trails and (especially on the Slovak side) mandate extensive seasonal closures to protect wildlife.\nClimate.\nThe Tatras lie in the temperate zone of Central Europe. They are an important barrier to the movements of air masses. Their mountainous topography causes one of the most diverse climates in that region.\nPrecipitation.\nThe highest precipitation figures are recorded on the northern slopes. In June and July, monthly precipitation reaches around . Precipitation occurs from 215 to 228 days a year. Thunderstorms occur 36 days a year on average.\nSnow cover.\nMaximum snow cover on the summit amounts to:\nPeaks are sometimes covered with snow or ice throughout the year. Avalanches are frequent.\nTemperature.\nExtreme temperatures range from in the winter to in warmer months. Temperatures also vary depending on the altitude and sun exposure of a given slope. Temperatures below last for 192 days on the summits.\nWinds.\nThe average wind speed on the summits is 6\u00a0m/s (13.4\u00a0mi/hr).\nOn 19 November 2004, large parts of the forests in the southern Slovak part of the High Tatras were damaged by a strong wind storm. Three million cubic metres (1,864 square miles) of trees were uprooted, two people died, and several villages were totally cut off. Further damage was done by a subsequent forest fire, and it will take many years until the local ecology is fully recovered.\nFlora.\nThe Tatra Mountains have a diverse variety of plant life. Many of the plant species are also found in the Alps. They are home to more than 1,000 species of vascular plants, about 450 mosses, 200 liverworts, 700 lichens, 900 fungi, and 70 slime moulds. There are five climatic-vegetation belts in the Tatras.\nThe distribution of plants depends on altitude:\nFauna.\nThe Tatra Mountains are home to many species of animals: 54 tardigrades, 22 turbellarians, 100 rotifers, 22 copepods, 162 spiders, 81 molluscs, 43 mammals, 200 birds, 7 amphibians, and 2 reptiles.\nThe most notable mammals are the Tatra chamois, Alpine marmot, Tatra marmot, snow vole, brown bear, wolf, Eurasian lynx, red deer, roe deer, and wild boar. Notable fish include the brown trout and alpine bullhead.\nThe endemic arthropod species include a caddis fly, the spider \"Xysticus alpicola\" and a springtail.\nTourism.\nThere are records of tourist visits to the Tatras as early as 1565.\nIn 1683, an anonymous author published a book of adventures and excursions in the Tatras titled \"Ungarischer Oder Dacianischer Simplicissimus, Vorstellend Seinen wunderlichen Lebens-Lauff, und sonderliche Begebenheiten gethaner Raisen, Nebenst Wahrhafter Beschreibung dess vormals im Nor gestandenen und offters verunruhigten Urgerland\", which translates roughly to \"Hungarian or Dacian Simplicissimus, presenting his strange life and the peculiar events of his adventures, together with a true description of the ancient lands that once stood in the north and were often troubled\". The author was later discovered to be Daniel Speer of Wroc\u0142aw, who lived in the sub-Tatra region for about six years.\nA popular tourist destination in Poland is Zakopane but the developed tourist base also includes Ko\u015bcielisko, Poronin, Bia\u0142y Dunajec, Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska, Bia\u0142ka Tatrza\u0144ska, Murzasichle, Ma\u0142e Ciche, Z\u0105b, Jurg\u00f3w, Brzegi.\nIn Slovakia, the most important tourist base is the city Vysok\u00e9 Tatry, consisting of three parts: \u0160trbsk\u00e9 Pleso, Star\u00fd Smokovec, and Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica.\nThe Polish \"national mountain\" (featured prominently in myths and folklore) is Giewont, while the Slovak one is Kriv\u00e1\u0148.\nTrails.\nOrla Per\u0107 is considered the most difficult and dangerous mountain trail in the Tatras, a suitable destination only for experienced tourists who don't have acrophobia, because there are strong exposures there. It lies exclusively within the Polish part of the Tatras, was conceived in 1901 by Franciszek Nowicki, a Polish poet and mountain guide, and was built between 1903 and 1906. Over 100 individuals have died on the route since it was established. The path is marked with red signs. The death of Polish philosopher Bronis\u0142aw Bandrowski is often used by guides as a cautionary tale for tourists. He committed suicide after he was trapped for days on a rocky ledge in the Granaty massif.\nThe highest point in the Tatra Mountains that can be freely accessed by a labeled trail is Rysy.\nMost of the peaks in the Western Tatras (on both sides of the border), including the main ridge, are freely accessible by hiking trails. In the Slovak part of the Eastern Tatras, only seven peaks (out of 48 with prominence of at least 100 m) are accessible by hiking trails (\"Rysy\", \"Svinica/\u015awinica\", \"Slavkovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt\", \"Kriv\u00e1\u0148\", \"K\u00f4provsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt\", \"V\u00fdchodn\u00e1 Vysok\u00e1\", and \"Jah\u0148ac\u00ed \u0161t\u00edt\"). Two of these (\"Rysy\" and \"Svinica/\u015awinica\") are located on the border with Poland and accessible from the Polish side. The rest of the peaks on the Slovak side (including the highest one, Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt) can only be accessed when accompanied by a certified mountain guide. Members of UIAA mountain clubs can climb them without a certified guide.\nIn the Slovak part, most of the hiking trails in the Tatras are closed from 1 November to 31 May. Only trails from settlements up to the mountain huts are open. In Poland, the trails are open year-round.\nHuman engagement.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the mountains were used for sheep grazing and mining. Many trees were cut down to make way for humans. Although these activities were stopped, the impact is still visible. Moreover, pollution from the industrialized regions of Krak\u00f3w in Poland or Ostrava in the Czech Republic, as well as casual tourism, causes substantial damage. Volunteers, however, initiate litter removal events frequently, on both sides of the border.\nThe Slovak Tatra National Park (\"Tatransk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00fd park\"; TANAP) was founded in 1949 (), and the contiguous Polish Tatra National Park (\"Tatrza\u0144ski Park Narodowy\") in 1954 (). The two parks were added jointly to the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve list in 1993.\nIn 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature threatened to cancel the Slovak TANAP's status of a national park because of the large investments (mainly in skiing infrastructure) in the park, which seriously interfere with the landscape and nature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59298", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59298", "title": "Pope Gregory XVI", "text": "Head of the Catholic Church from 1831 to 1846\nPope Gregory XVI (; ; born Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari; 18 September 1765 \u2013 1 June 1846) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 2 February 1831 to his death in June 1846. He had adopted the name Mauro upon entering the religious order of the Camaldolese. He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name \"Gregory\", the last to govern the Papal States for the whole duration of his pontificate, and the most recent not to have been a bishop when elected.\nReactionary in tendency, Gregory XVI opposed democratic and modernising reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeing them as fronts for liberalism and laicism. Against these trends, he sought to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy, a position known as ultramontanism. In the encyclical \"Mirari vos\", he pronounced it \"false and absurd, or rather mad, that we must secure and guarantee to each one liberty of conscience\". He encouraged missionary activity abroad and condemned the slave trade, which at the time of his pontificate was increasingly suppressed.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBartolomeo Alberto Cappellari was born at Belluno in the Republic of Venice, on 18 September 1765, as the last of five children, to a local Italian lower noble family, notable since the 16th century, aggregated to the local Nobility Council in 1670 and traditionally linked to liberal professions but not to the consecrated life. He was baptized at the parish of Bolzano Bellunese by his uncle Antonio Capellari. His parents were from a small village named Pesariis, in Friuli. His father, Giovanni Battista Capellari, was a notary. His mother, Giulia Cesa was a daughter of a notary. At the age of eighteen, Bartolomeo Cappellari joined the order of the Camaldolese (part of the Benedictine monastic family) and entered the Monastery of San Michele in Murano, near Venice. He was ordained a priest in 1787. As a Camaldolese monk, Cappellari rapidly gained distinction for his theological and linguistic skills, and was assigned to teach philosophy and theology at San Michele in 1787, at the age of 22.\nIn 1790, at the age of 25, he was appointed \"censor librorum\" for his Order, as well as for the Holy Office at Venice. He went to Rome in 1795 and in 1799 published a polemic against the Italian Jansenists titled \"II Trionfo della Santa Sede\" (\"The Triumph of the Holy See\"), which passed through various editions in Italy and was translated into several European languages. In 1800, he became a member of the Academy of the Catholic Religion, founded by Pope Pius VII (1800\u20131823), to which he contributed memoirs on theological and philosophical questions. In 1805, at the age of 40, he was appointed abbot of the Monastery of San Gregorio on Rome's Caelian Hill.\nWhen the army of the French Emperor Napoleon took Rome and arrested and deported Pius VII to France in 1809, Cappellari fled to Murano, where he taught in the Monastery of St. Michele of his Order, where he had first become a monk. From there he and a group of monks moved their little college to Padua in 1814. After Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna re-established the sovereignty of the Papal States over central Italy and Cappellari was called back to Rome to assume the post of vicar general of the Camaldolese Order. He was then appointed as Counsellor to the Inquisition, and later promoted to be Consultor (29 February 1820) and then, on 1 October 1826, Prefect of the Congregation of \"Propaganda Fide\" (\"Propagation of the Faith\"), which dealt with all missionary work outside of the Spanish Empire, including missions to the non-Catholic states in Europe. Twice he was offered a bishopric and twice he refused.\nCardinal.\nOn 21 March 1825, Cappellari was created cardinal (published 13 March 1826) by Pope Leo XII, and shortly afterwards he was asked to negotiate a concordat to safeguard the rights of Catholics in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, a diplomatic task which he completed successfully. He also negotiated a peace on behalf of Armenian Catholics with the Ottoman Empire. He publicly condemned the Polish revolutionaries, who he thought were seeking to undermine Russian Tsar Nicholas I's efforts to support the Catholic royalist cause in France by forcing him to divert his troops to suppress the uprising in Poland.\nCappellari had never travelled outside Italy and was most familiar with Venice and Rome. He spoke Italian and Latin fluently, but no other European languages, and did not understand European politics. However, he was proficient in Armenian, and Haruti'iwn Awgerian (Pascal Aucher)'s 1827 Venice edition of works attributed to Severian of Gabala and translated into Armenian was dedicated to him.\nPontificate.\nPapal election.\nOn 2 February 1831, after a fifty-day conclave, Cappellari was unexpectedly chosen to succeed Pope Pius VIII (1829\u201330). His election was influenced by the fact that the cardinal considered the most \"papabile\", Giacomo Giustiniani, was vetoed by King Ferdinand VII of Spain. There then arose a deadlock between the other two major candidates, Emmanuele de Gregorio and Bartolomeo Pacca. What finally drove the cardinals to make a decision was a message from the government of Parma notifying them that revolt was about to break out in the northern Papal States. To resolve the impasse, the cardinals turned to Cappellari, but it took eighty-three ballots for the canonically required two-thirds majority to be reached.\nAt the time of election, Cardinal Cappellari was not yet a bishop; he is the most recent man to be elected pope prior to his episcopal consecration. He was consecrated as bishop by Bartolomeo Pacca, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri and dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, with Pietro Francesco Galleffi, Cardinal Bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina and sub-dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, and Tommasso Arezzo, Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, acting as co-consecrators.\nThe choice of Gregory XVI as his regnal name was influenced by the fact that he had been abbot of the Monastery of San Gregorio on the Coelian Hill for more than twenty years, and in honour of Gregory XV, the founder of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. The Monastery of San Gregorio was the same abbey from which Pope Gregory I had dispatched missionaries to England in 596.\nActions.\nThe revolution of 1830, which overthrew the House of Bourbon, had just inflicted a severe blow on the Catholic royalist party in France. Almost the first act of the new French government was to seize Ancona, thus throwing Italy, and particularly the Papal States, into a state of confusion and political upheaval. Gregory issued a proclamation on 9 February 1831, one week after his election, expressing good will towards his subjects. In the course of the struggle that ensued, the Pope found it necessary more than once to call in Austrian troops to fight the red-shirted republicans engaged in a guerrilla campaign. The conservative administration of the Papal States postponed their promised reforms after a series of bombings and assassination attempts. The replacement of Tommaso Bernetti by Luigi Lambruschini as Cardinal Secretary of State in 1836 did nothing to appease the situation.\nIn the northern territories, the leaders of the revolt were middle-class gentry opposed to the general inefficiency of the government.\nGovernance of the papal states.\nGregory XVI and Cardinal Lambruschini opposed basic technological innovations such as gas lighting and railways, believing that they would promote commerce and increase the power of the bourgeoisie, leading to demands for liberal reforms which would undermine the monarchical power of the Pope over central Italy. Gregory XVI in fact banned railways in the Papal States, calling them \"chemins d'enfer\" (\"road to hell\", a play on the French for railroad, \"chemin de fer\", literally \"iron road\").\nThe insurrections at Viterbo in 1836, in various parts of the Legations in 1840, at Ravenna in 1843 and at Rimini in 1845, were followed by wholesale executions and draconian sentences of hard labour and exile, but they did not bring the unrest within the Papal States under the control of the authorities. Gregory XVI made great expenditures for defensive, architectural and engineering works, having a monument to Pope Leo XII built by Giuseppe Fabris in 1837. He also lavished patronage on such scholars as Angelo Mai, Giuseppe Mezzofanti, and Gaetano Moroni. This largesse, however, significantly weakened the finances of the Papal States.\nOther activities.\nEncyclicals.\nOther important encyclicals issued by Pope Gregory XVI were \"Sollicitudo ecclesiarum\", which stated that in the event of a change of government, the church would negotiate with the new government for placement of bishops and vacant dioceses (issued 1831); \"Mirari Vos\", on liberalism and religious indifferentism (issued on 15 August 1832); \"Quo graviora\", on the Pragmatic Constitution in the Rhineland (issued on 4 October 1833); \"Singulari Nos\", on the ideas of Hugues F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais (issued on 25 June 1834), and \"Commissum divinitus\" (17 May 1835) on church and state.\nApostolic letters.\n\"In supremo apostolatus\", an apostolic letter or papal bull, was issued by Pope Gregory XVI regarding the institution of slavery. Issued on 3 December 1839, as a result of a broad consultation among the College of Cardinals, the bull resoundingly denounced both the slave trade and the continuance of the institution of slavery.\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nGregory XVI canonized Veronica Giuliani, an Italian mystic, during his papacy. During his reign, five saints were canonized (notably Alphonsus Liguori) and thirty-three Servants of God were declared Blessed (including the Augustinian Simon of Cascia). In addition, many new religious orders were founded or supported and the devotion of the faithful to the Blessed Virgin Mary increased, both in private and public life.\nConsistories.\nThe pope created 75 cardinals in 24 consistories, in which the pope elevated 35 cardinals \"\", including his future successor Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, who would become Pope Pius IX. The pope also created six additional cardinals , though the pope died before these names could be revealed, therefore cancelling their appointments to the cardinalate.\nIn 1836, the pope wanted to nominate Charles Joseph Beno\u00eet Mercy d'Argenteau to the College of Cardinals, but the archbishop refused the nomination because he did not wish to leave his family and home for a possible position in the Roman Curia. Gregory XVI nominated four cardinals on 21 April 1845 and one on 24 November 1845; Gregory XVI also named another cardinal in the 12 July 1841 consistory, never revealing his name. According to Philippe Boutry, Alerame Maria Pallavicini (the Master of the Sacred Palace) was the cardinal announced on 24 November 1845; however, Pope Pius IX refused to publish his name upon his ascension to the papacy less than a year later.\nDeath and burial.\nOn 20 May 1846, he felt himself failing in health. A few days later, he was taken ill with facial erysipelas. At first, the attack was not thought to be very serious, but on 31 May, his strength suddenly failed, and it was seen that the end was near.\nGregory XVI died at 9:15\u00a0am on 1 June 1846 at age 80. That morning, he received the Extreme Unction from the sub-sacristan Agostino Proja. After his funeral, he was buried in Saint Peter's Basilica.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59308", "revid": "38664462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59308", "title": "Potomac River", "text": "River in the Mid-Atlantic United States\nThe Potomac River () is in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and flows from the Potomac Highlands in West Virginia to Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. It is long, with a drainage area of , and is the fourth-largest river along the East Coast of the United States. More than 6 million people live within its watershed.\nThe river forms part of the borders between Maryland and Washington, D.C., on the left descending bank, and West Virginia and Virginia on the right descending bank. Except for a small portion of its headwaters in West Virginia, the North Branch Potomac River is considered part of Maryland to the low-water mark on the opposite bank. The South Branch Potomac River lies completely within the state of West Virginia except for its headwaters, which lie in Virginia. All navigable parts of the river were designated as a National Recreation Trail in 2006, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated an portion of the river in Charles County, Maryland, as the Mallows Bay\u2013Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary in 2019.\nThe river has significant historical and political significance, as the nation's capital of Washington, D.C. is located on its banks, as is Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. During the American Civil War, the river became the boundary between the Union and the Confederacy, and the Union's largest army, the Army of the Potomac, was named after the river.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCourse.\nThe Potomac River runs from Fairfax Stone Historical Monument State Park in West Virginia on the Allegheny Plateau to Point Lookout, Maryland, and drains . The length of the river from the junction of its North and South Branches to Point Lookout is .\nThe river has two sources. The source of the North Branch is at the Fairfax Stone located at the junction of Grant, Tucker, and Preston counties in West Virginia. The source of the South Branch is located near Hightown in northern Highland County, Virginia. The river's two branches converge just east of Green Spring in Hampshire County, West Virginia, to form the Potomac. As it flows from its headwaters down to the Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac traverses five geological provinces: the Appalachian Plateau, the Ridge and Valley, the Blue Ridge, the Piedmont Plateau, and the Atlantic coastal plain.\nOnce the Potomac drops from the Piedmont to the Coastal Plain at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line at Little Falls, tides further influence the river as it passes through Washington, D.C., and beyond. Salinity in the Potomac River Estuary increases thereafter with distance downstream. The estuary also widens, reaching 11 statute miles (17\u00a0km) wide at its mouth, between Point Lookout, Maryland, and Smith Point, Virginia, before flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNorth Branch Potomac River.\nThe source of the North Branch Potomac River is at the Fairfax Stone located at the junction of Grant, Tucker and Preston counties in West Virginia. From the Fairfax Stone, the North Branch Potomac River flows to the man-made Jennings Randolph Lake, an impoundment designed for flood control and emergency water supply. Below the dam, the North Branch cuts a serpentine path through the eastern Allegheny Mountains. First, it flows northeast by the communities of Bloomington, Luke, and Westernport in Maryland and then on by Keyser, West Virginia to Cumberland, Maryland. At Cumberland, the river turns southeast. downstream from its source, the North Branch is joined by the South Branch between Green Spring and South Branch Depot, West Virginia from whence it flows past Hancock, Maryland and turns southeast once more on its way toward Washington, D.C., and the Chesapeake Bay.\nSouth Branch Potomac River.\nThe South Branch's source is northwest of Hightown along U.S. Route 250 on the eastern side of Lantz Mountain (3,934\u00a0ft) in Highland County, Virginia. From Hightown, the South Branch is a small meandering stream that flows northeast along Blue Grass Valley Road through the communities of New Hampden and Blue Grass. At Forks of Waters, the South Branch joins with Strait Creek and flows north across the Virginia/West Virginia border into Pendleton County.\nThe river then travels on a northeastern course along the western side of Jack Mountain (4,045\u00a0ft), followed by Sandy Ridge (2,297\u00a0ft) along U.S. Route 220. North of the confluence of the South Branch with Smith Creek, the river flows along Town Mountain (2,848\u00a0ft) around Franklin at the junction of U.S. Route 220 and U.S. Route 33. After Franklin, the South Branch continues north through the Monongahela National Forest to Upper Tract where it joins with three sizeable streams: Reeds Creek, Mill Run, and Deer Run.\nBetween Big Mountain (2,582\u00a0ft) and Cave Mountain (2,821\u00a0ft), the South Branch bends around the Eagle Rock (1,483\u00a0ft) outcrop and continues its flow northward into Grant County. Into Grant, the South Branch follows the western side of Cave Mountain through the long Smoke Hole Canyon, until its confluence with the North Fork at Cabins, where it flows east to Petersburg. At Petersburg, the South Branch Valley Railroad begins, which parallels the river until its mouth at Green Spring.\nIn its eastern course from Petersburg into Hardy County, the South Branch becomes more navigable allowing for canoes and smaller river vessels. The river splits and forms a series of large islands while it heads northeast to Moorefield. At Moorefield, the South Branch is joined by the South Fork South Branch Potomac River and runs north to Old Fields where it is fed by Anderson Run and Stony Run.\nAt McNeill, the South Branch flows into the Trough where it is bound to its west by Mill Creek Mountain (2,119\u00a0ft) and to its east by Sawmill Ridge (1,644\u00a0ft). This area is the habitat to bald eagles. The Trough passes into Hampshire County and ends at its confluence with Sawmill Run south of Glebe and Sector.\nThe South Branch continues north parallel to South Branch River Road (County Route 8) toward Romney with a number of historic plantation farms adjoining it. En route to Romney, the river is fed by Buffalo Run, Mill Run, McDowell Run, and Mill Creek at Vanderlip. The South Branch is traversed by the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) and joined by Sulphur Spring Run where it forms Valley View Island to the west of town.\nFlowing north of Romney, the river still follows the eastern side of Mill Creek Mountain until it creates a horseshoe bend at Wappocomo's Hanging Rocks around the George W. Washington plantation, Ridgedale. To the west of Three Churches on the western side of South Branch Mountain, , the South Branch creates a series of bends and flows to the northeast by Springfield through Blue's Ford. After two additional horseshoe bends (meanders), the South Branch flows under the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline between Green Spring and South Branch Depot, and joins the North Branch to form the Potomac.\nUpper Potomac River.\nThis stretch encompasses the section of the Potomac River from the confluence of its North and South Branches through Opequon Creek near Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Along the way the following tributaries drain into the Potomac: North Branch Potomac River, South Branch Potomac River, Town Creek, Little Cacapon River, Sideling Hill Creek, Cacapon River, Sir Johns Run, Warm Spring Run, Tonoloway Creek, Fifteenmile Creek, Sleepy Creek, Cherry Run, Back Creek, Conococheague Creek, and Opequon Creek.\nLower Potomac River.\nThis section covers the Potomac from just above Harpers Ferry in West Virginia down to Little Falls, Maryland on the border between Maryland and Washington, DC. Along the way the following tributaries drain into the Potomac: Antietam Creek, Shenandoah River, Catoctin Creek (Virginia), Catoctin Creek (Maryland), Tuscarora Creek, Monocacy River, Little Monocacy River, Broad Run, Goose Creek, Broad Run, Horsepen Branch, Little Seneca Creek, Tenmile Creek, Great Seneca Creek, Old Sugarland Run, Muddy Branch, Nichols Run, Watts Branch, Limekiln Branch, Carroll Branch, Pond Run, Clarks Branch, Mine Run Branch, Difficult Run, Bullneck Run, Rock Run, Scott Run, Dead Run, Turkey Run, Cabin John Creek, Minnehaha Branch, and Little Falls Branch.\nTidal Potomac River.\nThe Tidal Potomac River lies below the Fall Line. This 108-mile (174-km) stretch encompasses the Potomac from a short distance below the Washington, DC - Montgomery County line, just downstream of the Little Falls of the Potomac River, to the Chesapeake Bay.\nAlong the way the following tributaries drain into the Potomac: Pimmit Run, Gulf Branch, Donaldson Run, Windy Run, Spout Run, Maddox Branch, Foundry Branch, Rock Creek, Rocky Run, Tiber Creek, Roaches Run, Washington Channel, Anacostia River, Four Mile Run, Oxon Creek, Hunting Creek, Broad Creek, Henson Creek, Swan Creek, Piscataway Creek, Little Hunting Creek, Dogue Creek, Accotink Creek, Pohick Creek, Pomonkey Creek, Occoquan River, Neabsco Creek, Powell's Creek, Mattawoman Creek, Chicamuxen Creek, Quantico Creek, Little Creek, Chopawamsic Creek, Tank Creek, Aquia Creek, Potomac Creek, Nanjemoy Creek, Chotank Creek, Port Tobacco River, Popes Creek, Gambo Creek, Clifton Creek, Piccowaxen Creek, Upper Machodoc Creek, Wicomico River, Cobb Island, Monroe Creek, Mattox Creek, Popes Creek, Breton Bay, Leonardtown, St. Marys River, Yeocomico River, Coan River, and Hull Creek.\nHistory.\nNatural history.\nThe river itself is at least 3.5 million years old, likely extending back ten to twenty million years before the present when the Atlantic Ocean lowered and exposed coastal sediments along the fall line. This included the area at Great Falls, which eroded into its present form during recent glaciation periods.\nThe stream gradient of the entire river is 0.14%, a drop of 930 m over 652\u00a0km.\nHuman history.\nThe Potomac River has long been inhabited by Native Americans, including being the periphery of the Delaware Adena culture. Precontact, the region was governed by theAlgonquian Piscataway confederacy and their allies as warfare in the region increased. This led to the formation of a more complex political system led by the Tayac with countless Werowances governing local affairs. Their confederacy fractured precontact into smaller werowancies and alliances as power shifted south to the Powhatan confederacy.\n\"Potomac\" is a European spelling of \"Patawomeck\", the Algonquian name of a Native American village on its southern bank. Native Americans had different names for different parts of the river, calling the river above Great Falls \"Cohongarooton\", meaning \"honking geese\" and \"Patawomke\" below the Falls, meaning \"river of swans\". In 1608, Captain John Smith explored the river now known as the Potomac and made drawings of his observations which were later compiled into a map and published in London in 1612. This detail from that map shows his rendition of the river that the local tribes had told him was called the \"Patawomeck\". The spelling of the name has taken many forms over the years from \"Patawomeck\" (as on Captain John Smith's map) to \"Patomake\", \"Patowmack\", and numerous other variations in the 18th century and now \"Potomac\". The river's name was officially decided upon as \"Potomac\" by the Board on Geographic Names in 1931.\nThe similarity of the name to the Ancient Greek word for river, \"potamos\", has been noted for more than two centuries but it appears to be due to chance.\nThe Potomac River brings together a variety of cultures throughout the watershed from the coal miners of upstream West Virginia to the urban residents of the nation's capital and, along the lower Potomac, the watermen of Virginia's Northern Neck.\nBeing situated in an area rich in American history and American heritage has led to the Potomac being nicknamed \"the Nation's River\". George Washington, the first President of the United States, was born in, surveyed, and spent most of his life within, the Potomac basin. There is an apocryphal legend that Washington threw a silver dollar all the way across the river as a youth (even though the first silver dollar wasn't minted until five years before Washington's death). All of Washington, D.C., the nation's capital city, also lies within the watershed. The First United States Congress by act of July 16, 1790 stated that the nation's capital was to be located on the river. The 1859 siege of Harper's Ferry at the river's confluence with the Shenandoah was a precursor to numerous epic battles of the American Civil War in and around the Potomac and its tributaries, such as the 1861 Battle of Ball's Bluff and the 1862 Battle of Shepherdstown.\nGeneral Robert E. Lee crossed the river, thereby invading the North and threatening Washington, D.C., twice in campaigns climaxing in the battles of Antietam (September 17, 1862) and Gettysburg (July 1\u20133, 1863). Confederate General Jubal Early crossed the river in July 1864 on his attempted raid on the nation's capital. The river not only divided the Union from the Confederacy, but also gave name to the Union's largest army, the Army of the Potomac.\nThe Patowmack Canal was intended by George Washington to connect the Tidewater region near Georgetown with Cumberland, Maryland. Started in 1785 on the Virginia side of the river, it was not completed until 1802. Financial troubles led to the closure of the canal in 1830. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal operated along the banks of the Potomac in Maryland from 1831 to 1924 and also connected Cumberland to Washington, D.C. This allowed freight to be transported around the rapids known as the Great Falls of the Potomac River, as well as many other, smaller rapids.\nWashington, D.C. began using the Potomac as its principal source of drinking water with the opening of the Washington Aqueduct in 1864, using a water intake constructed at Great Falls.\nHydrology.\nWater supply and water quality.\nAn average of approximately of water is withdrawn daily from the Potomac in the Washington area for water supply, providing about 78 percent of the region's total water usage, this amount includes approximately 80 percent of the drinking water consumed by the region's estimated 6.1 million residents.\nAs a result of damaging floods in 1936 and 1937, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed the Potomac River basin reservoir projects, a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river and to provide a more reliable water supply. One dam was to be built at Little Falls, just north of Washington, backing its pool up to Great Falls. Just above Great Falls, the much larger Seneca Dam was proposed whose reservoir would extend to Harpers Ferry. Several other dams were proposed for the Potomac and its tributaries.\nWhen detailed studies were issued by the Corps in the 1950s, they met sustained opposition, led by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, resulting in the plans' abandonment. The only dam project that did get built was Jennings Randolph Lake on the North Branch.\nThe Corps built a supplementary water intake for the Washington Aqueduct at Little Falls in 1959.\nIn 1940 Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of an interstate compact to coordinate water quality management among states in the Potomac basin. Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia agreed to establish the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin. The compact was amended in 1970 to include coordination of water supply issues and land use issues related to water quality.\nBeginning in the 19th century, with increasing mining and agriculture upstream and urban sewage and runoff downstream, the water quality of the Potomac River deteriorated. This created conditions of severe eutrophication. It is said that President Abraham Lincoln used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the river's stench. In the 1960s, with dense green algal blooms covering the river's surface, President Lyndon Johnson declared the river \"a national disgrace\" and set in motion a long-term effort to reduce pollution from sewage and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river. One of the significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, which serves Washington and several surrounding communities. Enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act led to construction or expansion of additional sewage treatment plants in the Potomac watershed. Controls on phosphorus, one of the principal contributors to eutrophication, were implemented in the 1980s, through sewage plant upgrades and restrictions on phosphorus in detergents.\nBy the end of the 20th century, notable success had been achieved, as massive algal blooms vanished and recreational fishing and boating rebounded. Still, the aquatic habitat of the Potomac River and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication, heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic chemicals, over-fishing, alien species, and pathogens associated with fecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases. In 2005 two federal agencies, the US Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service, began to identify fish in the Potomac and tributaries that exhibited \"intersex\" characteristics, as a result of endocrine disruption caused by some form of pollution.\nOn November 13, 2007, the Potomac Conservancy, an environmental group, issued the river a grade of \"D-plus\", citing high levels of pollution and the reports of \"intersex\" fish. Since then, the river has improved with a reduction in nutrient runoff, return of fish populations, and land protection along the river. As a result, the group has issued a grade of \"B\" since 2018. In March 2019, the Potomac Riverkeeper Network launched a laboratory boat dubbed the \"Sea Dog\", which will be monitoring water quality in the Potomac and providing reports to the public on a weekly basis; in that same month, the catching near Fletcher's Boat House of a Striped Bass estimated to weigh was seen as a further indicator of the continuing improvement in the health of the river.\nDischarge.\nThe average daily flow during the water years 1931\u20132018 was \u00a0/s. The highest average daily flow ever recorded on the Potomac at Little Falls, Maryland (near Washington, D.C.), was in March 1936 when it reached \u00a0/s. The lowest average daily flow ever recorded at the same location was \u00a0/s in September 1966 The highest crest of the Potomac ever registered at Little Falls was 28.10\u00a0ft, on March 19, 1936;\nhowever, the most damaging flood to affect Washington, DC and its metropolitan area was that of October 1942.\nLegal issues.\nFor 400 years Maryland and Virginia have disputed control of the Potomac and its North Branch since both states' original colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers. In its first state constitution adopted in 1776, Virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it, an act disputed by Maryland. Both states acceded to the 1785 Mount Vernon Compact and the 1877 Black-Jenkins Award which granted Maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low-water mark on the Virginia side while permitting Virginia full riparian rights short of obstructing navigation.\nFrom 1957 to 1996, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) routinely issued permits applied for by Virginia entities concerning the use of the Potomac. However, in 1996 the MDE denied a permit submitted by the Fairfax County Water Authority to build a water intake offshore, citing potential harm to Maryland's interests by an increase in Virginia sprawl caused by the project. After years of failed appeals within the Maryland government's appeal processes, in 2000 Virginia took the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states. Maryland claimed Virginia lost its riparian rights by acquiescing to MDE's permit process for 63 years (MDE began its permit process in 1933). A Special Master appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of Virginia, citing the language in the 1785 Compact and the 1877 Award. On December 9, 2003, the Court agreed in a 7\u20132 decision.\nThe original charters are silent as to which branch from the upper Potomac serves as the boundary, but this was settled by the 1785 Compact. When West Virginia seceded from Virginia in 1863, the question of West Virginia's succession in title to the lands between the branches of the river was raised, as well as title to the river itself. Claims by Maryland to West Virginia land north of the South Branch (all of Mineral and Grant Counties and parts of Hampshire, Hardy, Tucker and Pendleton Counties) and by West Virginia to the Potomac's high-water mark were rejected by the Supreme Court in two separate decisions in 1910.\nFauna.\nFish.\nA variety of fish inhabit the Potomac, including bass, muskellunge, pike, walleye. The northern snakehead, an invasive species resembling the native bowfin, lamprey, and American eel, was first seen in 2004. Many species of sunfish are also present in the Potomac and its headwaters. Although rare, bull sharks can be found.\nAfter having been depressed for many decades, the river's population of American shad is currently re-bounding as a result of the ICPRB's successful \"American Shad Restoration Project\" that was begun in 1995. In addition to stocking the river with more than 22 million shad fry, the Project supervised the construction of a fishway that was built to facilitate the passage of adults around the Little Falls Dam on the way to their traditional spawning grounds upstream.\nMammals.\nEarly European colonists who settled along the Potomac found a diversity of large and small mammals living in the dense forests nearby. Bison, elk, wolves (both gray and red) and cougars were still present at that time, but had been hunted to extirpation by the middle of the 19th century. Among the denizens of the Potomac's banks, beavers and otters met a similar fate, while small populations of American mink and American martens survived into the 20th century in some secluded areas.\nThere is no record of early settlers having observed marine mammals in the Potomac, but several sightings of Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphins (\"Tursiops truncatus\") were reported during the 19th century. In July 1844, a pod of 14 adults and young was followed up the river by men in boats as high as the Aqueduct Bridge (approximately the same location occupied by Key Bridge today).\nSince 2015, perhaps as a result of warmer temperatures, rising water levels in the Chesapeake Bay and improving water quality in the Potomac, unprecedented numbers of Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphins have been observed in the river. According to Dr. Janet Mann of Georgetown University's http://, more than 500 individual members of the species have been identified in the Potomac during this period.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. Two smaller islands lie just off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The island's anthem is \"La Balanguera\".\nAlong with other Balearic Islands, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera, Mallorca is a highly popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year between 2012 and 2017.\nEtymology.\nThe name originates from Classical Latin \"insula maior\", meaning \"larger island\". In Medieval Latin, this evolved into \"Maiorca\", referring to \"the larger one\" in contrast with \"Menorca\", \"the smaller one\". The term \"Maiorca\" was later modified by central Catalan scribes through a process of hypercorrection, resulting in the form \"Mallorca\", which eventually became the standard spelling.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric settlements.\nThe Balearic Islands were first colonised by humans during the 3rd millennium BC, around 2500\u20132300 BC from the Iberian Peninsula or southern France, by people associated with the Bell Beaker culture. The arrival of humans resulted in the rapid extinction of the three species of terrestrial mammals native to Mallorca, the dwarf goat-antelope \"Myotragus balearicus\", the giant dormouse \"Hypnomys morpheus,\" and the shrew \"Nesiotites hidalgo\", all three of which had been continuously present on Mallorca for over 5 million years. The island's prehistoric settlements are called \"talaiots\" or \"talayots\". The people of the islands raised Bronze Age megaliths as part of their Talaiotic culture. A non-exhaustive list of settlements is the following:\nPhoenicians, Romans, and Late Antiquity.\nThe Phoenicians, a seafaring people from the Levant, arrived around the eighth century BC and established numerous colonies. The island eventually came under the control of Carthage in North Africa, which had become the principal Phoenician city. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all of its overseas possessions and the Romans took over.\nThe island was occupied by the Romans in 123\u00a0BC under Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus. It flourished under Roman rule, during which time the towns of Pollentia (Alc\u00fadia), and Palmaria (Palma) were founded. In addition, the northern town of Bocchoris, dating back to pre-Roman times, was a federated city to Rome. The local economy was largely driven by olive cultivation, viticulture, and salt mining. Mallorcan soldiers were valued within the Roman legions for their skill with the sling (Balearic slingers).\nIn 427, Gunderic and the Vandals captured the island. Geiseric, son of Godigisel, governed Mallorca and used it as his base to loot and plunder settlements around the Mediterranean until Roman rule was restored in 465.\nMiddle Ages.\nLate Antiquity and Early Middle Ages.\nIn 534, Mallorca was recaptured from the Vandals by the Eastern Roman Empire, led by Apollinarius. Under Roman rule, Christianity thrived and numerous churches were built.\nFrom 707, the island was increasingly attacked by Muslim raiders from North Africa. Recurrent invasions led the islanders to ask Charlemagne for help.\nIslamic Mallorca.\nIn 902, Issam al-Khawlani(es)(ca) () conquered the Balearic Islands, and they became part of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The town of Palma was reshaped and expanded, and became known as Medina Mayurqa. Later on, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba at its height, the Muslims improved agriculture with irrigation and developed local industries.\nThe caliphate was dismembered in 1015. Mallorca came under rule by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia, and from 1087 to 1114, was an independent Taifa. During that period, the island was visited by Ibn Hazm. However, an expedition of Pisans and Catalans in 1114\u201315, led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, overran the island, laying siege to Palma for eight months. After the city fell, the invaders retreated due to problems in their own lands. They were replaced by the Almoravides from North Africa, who ruled until 1176. The Almoravides were replaced by the Almohad dynasty until 1229. Abu Yahya was the last Moorish leader of Mallorca.\nMedieval Mallorca.\nIn the ensuing confusion and unrest, King James\u00a0I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, launched an invasion which landed at Santa Pon\u00e7a, Mallorca, on 8\u20139 September 1229 with Catalan forces consisting of 15,000 men and 1,500 horses. His forces entered the city of Medina Mayurqa on 31 December 1229. In 1230, he annexed the island to his Crown of Aragon under the name \"Regnum Maioricae\".\nModern era.\nFrom 1479, the Crown of Aragon was in dynastic union with that of Castile. The Barbary corsairs of North Africa often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the people built coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. In 1570, King Philip II of Spain and his advisors were considering complete evacuation of the Balearic islands.\nIn the early 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession resulted in the replacement of that dynastic union with a unified Spanish monarchy under the rule of the new Bourbon Dynasty. The last episode of the War of Spanish Succession was the conquest of the island of Mallorca. It took place on 2 July 1715 when the island capitulated to the arrival of a Bourbon fleet. In 1716, the Nueva Planta decrees made Mallorca part of the Spanish province of Baleares, roughly the same to present-day Illes Balears province and autonomous community.\n20th century and today.\nA Nationalist stronghold at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was subjected to an amphibious landing, on 16 August 1936, aimed at driving the Nationalists from Mallorca and reclaiming the island for the Republic. Although the Republicans heavily outnumbered their opponents and managed to push inland, superior Nationalist air power, provided mainly by Fascist Italy as part of the Italian occupation of Majorca, forced the Republicans to retreat and to leave the island completely by 12 September. Those events became known as the Battle of Majorca.\nSince the 1950s, the advent of mass tourism has transformed the island into a destination for foreign visitors and attracted many service workers from mainland Spain. The boom in tourism caused Palma to grow significantly.\nIn the 21st century, urban redevelopment, under the so\u2011called \"Pla Mirall\" (English \"Mirror Plan\"), attracted groups of immigrant workers from outside the European Union, especially from Africa and South America.\nArchaeology.\nIn September 2019, A 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical decline. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.\nPalma.\nThe capital of Mallorca, Palma, was founded as a Roman camp called Palmaria upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement. The turbulent history of the city had it subject to several Vandal sackings during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was later reconquered by the Byzantines, established by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa), and finally occupied by James I of Aragon. In 1983, Palma became the capital of the autonomous region of the Balearic Islands. Palma has a famous tourist attraction, the cathedral, Catedral-Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda de Mallorca, standing in the heart of the City looking out over the sea.\nClimate.\nMallorca has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"), with mild and relatively wet winters and hot, bright, dry summers. Precipitation in the Serra de Tramuntana is markedly higher. Summers are hot in the plains, and winters are mild, getting colder and wetter in the Tramuntana range, where brief episodes of snow during the winter are not unusual, especially in the Puig Major. The two wettest months in Mallorca are October and November. Storms and heavy rain are not uncommon during the autumn.\nGeography.\nGeology.\nMallorca and the other Balearic Islands are geologically an extension of the fold mountains of the Betic Cordillera of Andalusia. They consist primarily of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea during the Mesozoic era. These marine deposits have given rise to calcareous rocks which are often fossiliferous. The folding of the Betic Cordillera and Mallorcan ranges resulted from subduction of the African Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate with eventual collision. Tectonic movements led to different elevation and lowering zones in the late Tertiary, which is why the connection to the mainland has been severed at the current sea level.\nThe limestones, which predominate throughout Mallorca, are readily water-soluble, and have given rise to extensive areas of karst. In addition to limestone, dolomitic rocks are mainly present in the mountainous regions of Mallorca; the Serra de Tramuntana and the Serres de Llevant. The Serres de Llevant also contain marl, the more rapid erosion of which has resulted in the lower elevations of the island's southeastern mountains. Marl is limestone with a high proportion of clay minerals. The eroded material was washed into the sea or deposited in the interior of the island of the Pla de Mallorca, bright marls in the north-east of the island and ferrous clays in the middle of Mallorca, which gives the soil its characteristic reddish colour.\nMountains of Mallorca.\nMallorca features a landscape characterised by a series of mountain ranges. The highest peak, Puig Major, stands at approximately 1,445 meters (4,741 feet) above sea level. Other notable peaks include Puig de Massanella, Puig Tomir, Puig de l'Ofre, and Puig des Teix, all exceeding 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) in elevation. These mountains are part of the Serra de Tramuntana range with numerous peaks over 1,000 meters, offering opportunities for hiking and exploration with views of the Mediterranean. While not towering in comparison to some mountain ranges globally, the Mallorcan mountains provide visitors with diverse outdoor experiences and panoramic views of the island's rugged terrain and coastline.\nRegions.\nMallorca is the largest island of Spain by area and second most populated (after Tenerife in the Canary Islands).\nMallorca has two mountainous regions, the Serra de Tramuntana and Serres de Llevant. Both are about in length and occupy the northwestern and eastern parts of the island respectively.\nThe highest peak in Mallorca is Puig Major, at , in the Serra de Tramuntana. As this is a military zone, the neighbouring peak at Puig de Massanella is the highest accessible peak at . The northeast coast comprises two bays: the Badia de Pollen\u00e7a and the larger Badia d'Alc\u00fadia.\nThe northern coast is rugged and has many cliffs. The central zone, extending from Palma, is a generally flat, fertile plain known as \"Es Pla\". The island has a variety of caves both above and below the sea \u2013 two of the caves, the above sea level Coves dels Hams and the Coves del Drach, also contain underground lakes and are open to tours. Both are located near the eastern coastal town of Porto Cristo. Small uninhabited islands lie off the southern and western coasts; the Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Mallorca (in the municipality of Palma), while Dragonara is administratively included in the municipality of Andratx. Other notable areas include the Alfabia Mountains, Es Cornadors and Cap de Formentor. The Cap de Formentor is one of the places where the tourists can enjoy the pleasure of its beach which is golden and very thin.\nWorld Heritage Site.\nThe Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\nMunicipalities.\nThe island (including the small offshore islands of Cabrera and Dragonera) is administratively divided into 53 municipalities. The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the \"Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica\", Spain) are:\nPopulation.\nMallorca is the most populous island in the Balearic Islands and the second most populous island in Spain, after Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, being also the fourth most populous island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It had a Census population of 920,605 inhabitants at the start of 2021, and an official estimate of 940,332 at the start of 2023.\nEconomy.\nSince the 1950s, Mallorca has become a major tourist destination, and the tourism business has become the main source of revenue for the island.\nThe island's popularity as a tourist destination has steadily grown since the 1950s, with many artists and academics choosing to visit and live on the island. The number of visitors to Mallorca continued to increase with holiday makers in the 1970s approaching 3\u00a0million a year. In 2010 over 6 million visitors came to Mallorca. In 2013, Mallorca was visited by nearly 9.5 million tourists, and the Balearic Islands as a whole reached 13\u00a0million tourists. In 2017, ten million tourists visited the island. The rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to some locals protesting the effects of mass tourism on the island.\nMallorca has been jokingly referred to as the 17th Federal State of Germany, due to the high number of German tourists, although people from the island reject this label and deem it \"an insult\".\nDue to a high number of expats choosing to settle down in the area, Mallorca has recently also become a business hub economy of its own, due to a high number of particularly foreign enterprises choosing to either relocate, or expand, to the island.\nAttempts to build illegally caused a scandal in 2006 in Port Andratx that the newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\" named \"caso Andratx\". A main reason for illegal building permits, corruption and black market construction is that communities have few ways to finance themselves other than through permits. The former mayor was incarcerated in 2009 after being prosecuted for taking bribes to permit illegal house building.\nTop 10 arrivals by nationality.\nData from Institute of Statistics of Balearic Islands\nPolitics and government.\nRegional government.\nThe Balearic Islands, of which Mallorca forms part, are one of the autonomous communities of Spain. As a whole, they are currently governed by the People's Party of the Balearic Islands (PP), with Marga Prohens as their President.\nInsular government.\nThe specific government institution for the island is the Insular Council of Mallorca commonly known as \"Council of Mallorca\", created in 1978.\nIt is responsible for culture, roads, railways (see Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca) and municipal administration. As of September 2023, Lloren\u00e7 Galm\u00e9s (PP) serves as president of the Insular Council.\nResults of the elections to the Council of Mallorca.\nElections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituency of Mallorca. Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Council.\nCulture.\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria.\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria () was a pioneer of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title \"Count of Neuendorf\". He later settled in Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of hiking routes are named after him.\nLudwig Salvator loved the island of Mallorca. He became fluent in Catalan, carried out research into the island's flora and fauna, history, and culture to produce his main work, \"Die Balearen\", a comprehensive collection of books about the Balearic Islands, consisting of 7 volumes. It took him 22 years to complete.\nNowadays, several streets or buildings on the island are named after him (i.e., \"Arxiduc Llu\u00eds Salvador\").\nChopin in Mallorca.\nThe Polish composer and pianist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, together with French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), resided in Valldemossa in the winter of 1838\u201339. Apparently, Chopin's health had already deteriorated and his doctor recommended that he go to the Balearic Islands to recuperate, where he still spent a rather miserable winter.\nNonetheless, his time in Mallorca was a productive period for Chopin. He managed to finish the Preludes, Op. 28, that he started writing in 1835. He was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.\nLiterature.\nFrench writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in \"A Winter in Majorca\", published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works. While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo started writing the novel \"El oro de Mallorca\", and wrote several poems, such as \"La isla de oro\".\nThe poet Miquel Costa i Llobera wrote in 1875 his famous ode, the Pine of Formentor, as well as other poems concerning old Mallorcan traditions and fantasies. Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Mallorca.\nAgatha Christie visited the island in the early 20th century and stayed in Palma and Port de Pollen\u00e7a. She would later write the book \"Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories\", a collection of short stories, of which the first one takes place in Port de Pollen\u00e7a, starring Parker Pyne.\nJorge Luis Borges visited Mallorca twice, accompanied by his family. He published his poems \"La estrella\" (1920) and \"Catedral\" (1921) in the regional magazine \"Baleares\". The latter poem shows his admiration for the monumental Cathedral of Palma.\nNobel Prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela came to Mallorca in 1954, visiting Pollen\u00e7a, and then moving to Palma, where he settled permanently. In 1956, Cela founded the magazine \"Papeles de Son Armadans\". He is also credited as founder of Alfaguara.\nThe English writer and poet Robert Graves moved to Mallorca with his family in 1946. The house is now a museum. He died in 1985 and was buried in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel \"This Perfect Day\" in Mallorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.\nMusic and dance.\nThe Ball dels Cossiers is the island's traditional dance. It is believed to have been imported from Catalonia in the 13th or 14th century, after the Aragonese conquest of the island under King Jaime I. In the dance, three pairs of dancers, who are typically male, defend a \"Lady,\" who is played by a man or a woman, from a demon or devil. Another Mallorcan dance is Correfoc, an elaborate festival of dance and pyrotechnics that is also of Catalan origin. The island's folk music strongly resembles that of Catalonia, and is centered around traditional instruments like the xeremies (bagpipe) and guitarra de canya (a reed or bone xylophone-like instrument suspended from the neck). While folk music is still played and enjoyed by many on the island, a number of other musical traditions have become popular in Mallorca in the 21st century, including electronic dance music, classical music, and jazz, all of which have annual festivals on the island.\nArt.\nJoan Mir\u00f3, a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, had close ties to the island throughout his life. He married Pilar Juncosa in Palma in 1929 and settled permanently in Mallorca in 1954. The Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca has a collection of his works. Es Baluard in Palma is a museum of modern and contemporary art which exhibits the work of Balearic artists and artists related to the Balearic Islands.\nFilm.\nThe Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival is the fastest growing Mediterranean film festival and has taken place annually every November since 2011, attracting filmmakers, producers, and directors globally. It is hosted at the Teatro Principal in Palma de Mallorca.\nMallorcan cartographic school.\nMallorca has a long history of seafaring. The Majorcan cartographic school or the \"Catalan school\" refers to a collection of cartographers, cosmographers, and navigational instrument makers who flourished in Mallorca and partly in mainland Catalonia in the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. Mallorcan cosmographers and cartographers developed breakthroughs in cartographic techniques, namely the \"normal portolan chart\", which was fine-tuned for navigational use and the plotting by compass of navigational routes, prerequisites for the discovery of the New World.\nCuisine.\nIn 2005, there were over 2,400 restaurants on the island of Mallorca according to the Mallorcan Tourist Board, ranging from small bars to full restaurants. Olives and almonds are typical of the Mallorcan diet. Among the foods that are typical from Mallorca are \"sobrassada\", \"arr\u00f2s brut\" (saffron rice cooked with chicken, pork and vegetables), and the sweet pastry \"ensa\u00efmada\". Also Pa amb oli is a popular dish.\nHerbs de Majorca is a herbal liqueur.\nLanguage.\nThe two official languages of Mallorca are Catalan and Spanish, a dialect of the former being the indigenous language of Mallorca. The local dialect of Catalan spoken in the island is \"Mallorqu\u00ed\", with slightly different variants in most villages. Education is bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, with some teaching of English.\nIn 2012, the then-governing People's Party announced its intention to end preferential treatment for Catalan in the island's schools to bring parity to the two languages of the island. It was said that this could lead Mallorcan Catalan to become extinct in the fairly near future, as it was being used in a situation of diglossia in favour of the Spanish language. However, following a May 2015 election that swept a pro-Catalan party into power, this policy was dropped.\nTransportation.\nA trackless train is in operation in several tourist areas.\nAir transport.\nAir travel to and from the island is served by Palma de Mallorca Airport. In 2024, the airport handled 33.3 million passengers, making it the third busiest airport in Spain, after Madrid\u2013Barajas and Barcelona\u2013El Prat; and the fourteenth in Europe.\nWater transport.\nThere are approximately 79 ferries between Mallorca and other destinations every week, most of them to mainland Spain.\nCycling.\nOne of Europe's most popular cycling destinations, https:// such as the popular 24\u00a0km cycle track (segregated cycle lane) which runs between Porto Cristo and Cala Bona via Sa Coma and Cala Millor are must rides.\nRenowned Mallorcans.\nSome of the earliest famous Mallorcans lived on the island before its reconquest from the Moors. Famous Mallorcans include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59314", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59314", "title": "Lake Chad", "text": "Lake in Central Africa\nLake Chad (, Kanuri: \"S\u00e1d\u01dd\", ) is an endorheic freshwater lake located at the junction of four countries: Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, in western and central Africa respectively, with a catchment area in excess of . It is an important wetland ecosystem in West-Central Africa. The lakeside is rich in reeds and swamps, and the plain along the lake is fertile, making it an important irrigated agricultural area. The lake is rich in aquatic resources and is one of the important freshwater fish producing areas in Africa.\nLake Chad is divided into deeper southern parts and shallower northern parts. The water source of the lake mainly comes from rivers such as the Chari River that enter the lake. The water level varies greatly seasonally, and the area of the lake also changes dramatically. During the African humid period, the lake's area reached . Due to the increasingly arid climate, the lake surface gradually shrank. In the 19th century, it still had an area of . However, due to climate change and human water diversion, it has shrunk significantly since the mid-1970s, and its area has fluctuated between .\nPrehistory and history.\nThe Chad Basin was formed by the depression of the African Shield. The floor of the basin is made of Precambrian bedrock covered by more than of sedimentary deposits. For most of the Quaternary, the basin had abundant water sources. Towards the end of this period the climate became drier. Around 20,000\u201340,000 years ago, eolianite sand dunes began to form in the north of the basin. The area of Lake Chad experienced four heydays between 39,000 BC and 300 BC, leaving thick diatomaceous earth and lacustrine deposits in the strata. This has been called Mega-Chad. The maximum depth of Mega-Chad exceeded and it covered an area of approximately , it flowed into Benue River through the Mayo K\u00e9bbi, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean through the Niger River.\nThe vast waters formed during the African humid period provided conditions for the emergence of lakeside fishermen's settlements, and the Nilo-Saharan ethnic group also migrated to Lake Chad during this period. Agriculture also emerged in the Sahel region at this time. By 1800 BC, a pottery culture known as Gajiganna had emerged, initially as pastoralists, but, starting around 1500 BC, living in settled hamlets at the side of the lake. The archaeological discovery revealed wild grasses, mostly of the tribe Paniceae, and wild rice together with the earliest domesticated Pearl millet in the Lake Chad region, dating to 1200\u20131000 cal BC. One of the oldest domesticated Pearl millet in West Africa was found in the Chad Basin, charred together with wild grasses, and their era can be traced back to 800\u20131000 cal BC.\nPermanent villages were established to the south of the lake by 500 BC, and major archaeological discoveries include the Sao civilization. According to the records of Claudius Ptolemy in the mid-2nd century AD, the Romans of the 1st century AD had already come into contact with Lake Chad through their connections with Tunisia, Tripolitania, and Fezzan. By the 5th century AD camels were being used for trans-Saharan trade via the Fezzan, or to the east via Darfur. After the Arabs conquered North Africa during the 7th and 8th centuries, the Chad Basin became increasingly linked to the Muslim countries.\nTrade and improved agricultural techniques enabled more sophisticated societies. Around 900 AD, the Kanem people who spoke the Kanuri language unified numerous nomadic tribes and established the Kanem Empire in the northeast of Lake Chad. At the beginning of the founding of the country, the Kanem people continued to live a nomadic life until the 11th century, when they were Islamized and settled in Njimi. Through trans-Saharan trade, the power of the Kanem Empire reached its peak in the 13th century, but as the empire declined in the 14th century, its southwestern vassal state of Bornu began to rise, causing the power center of the empire to shift to Bornu around 1400. In the second half of the 16th century, the Bornu Empire began importing firearms from North Africa, consolidating its military hegemony. The Bornu Empire declined in the 18th century, and later lost its western region to the Sokoto Caliphate during the early 19th century. It was later colonised by European powers in the 20th century.\nFollowing the growing interest in Africa among European academic and business communities, the Lake Chad area was extensively described by Europeans in the 19th century. Three scientific expeditions were conducted between 1898 and 1909. During the Berlin Conference in 1884\u20131885, Africa was divided between the European colonial powers. By the second decade of the 20th century, Lake Chad had been colonized and occupied by Britain, France, and Germany, defining boundaries that are largely intact with the present post-colonial states. At the beginning of independence, the countries surrounding Lake Chad not only had a poor economic foundation, but also had more complex ethnic, religious, and political conflicts. Nigeria and Niger, which had just gained independence, experienced continuous coups, while Chad also experienced ongoing civil war. The inability of countries along the lake to consider the protection of Lake Chad has led to a series of environmental problems.\nGeography.\nThe Chad Basin includes Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. It is an extensional fault depression type rift basin, which can be divided into four secondary structural units: southern depression, northern depression, central uplift, and eastern slope. The southern depression of the basin is characterized by an asymmetric fault depression composite rift with steep slopes in the east and gentle slopes in the west on the profile, and is distributed in an NNW direction on the plane. There are two large basin\u2010bounding normal faults developed on both sides of the basin, with a graben style fault and depression in the middle. The east and west sides are outward dipping low angle gentle slope areas. The eastern boundary fault is steep with a dip angle of about 55\u00b0, while the western fault has a dip angle of about 45\u00b0. The overall thickness of the inner layer in the slope area is relatively thin. In the central area of the basin, the thickness of the sedimentary strata is large, and the thickness of the sedimentary center zone reaches over . The northern part of the basin appears steep in the west and gentle in the east on the profile. Five fault structural zones parallel to the basin\u2010bounding faults have developed from west to east.\nLake Chad is divided into north and south parts by a shallow sill called the Great Barrier, with the bottom of the northern basin at an altitude of and the bottom of the southern basin at . When the water level in the south exceeds above sea level, it will flow into the north. In the south, there is continuous open water at the mouth of the Chari River, and the western part of the water is covered by reed swamps, and the sand dunes that are not completely submerged in the eastern waters form an archipelago. The average depth of the southern lake basin is between , that of the northern lake basin is between 0 and , and that of the eastern archipelago is between 0 and .\nThe climate of the Lake Chad region is strongly influenced by continental and maritime air masses. The maritime air mass moves northward during the summer, producing seasonal precipitation. In late summer, continental air mass dominate again. The average annual precipitation in the Lake Chad area is , with an average annual precipitation of on the south bank and about on the north bank. The highest temperature in the rainy season is , and the highest temperature rises to more than when October and November enter the dry season. The temperature difference between day and night is almost twice that of the rainy season, and the lowest nighttime temperature sometimes drops to in December and January. April is usually the hottest month of the year, with temperatures occasionally reaching , the lowest water levels appear in June to July, and the highest water levels in November to December, with surface water temperatures ranging from .\nHydrology.\nThe Chad Basin covers an area of about , and is injected by the Chari, Logone, and Yobe Rivers. The water supply of the lake is seasonal. Most of the precipitation comes from the Adamawa Plateau in the south of the basin, which is transported to the lake basin through the Chari River and the Logone River. The two contribute 95% of the total inflow of Lake Chad, while the Yobe River only contributes less than 2.5%. The lake seeps through the underground to the lowest point of the Chad Basin, the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression, approximately northeast of Lake Chad, with the deepest point reaching an elevation of only above sea level. This takes away most of the salinity and maintains the low salinity of Lake Chad. The southwestern waters of Lake Chad being freshwater, and the water in the northeast is only slightly salty.\nThe water volume of most large lakes in Africa depends on rainfall and evaporation, which means that temperature and precipitation are crucial for regulating the water balance of these bodies of water, and any fluctuations can cause significant changes in their water level and area. Lake Chad is a shallow inland lake, and the rainfall in the Chad basin is very sensitive to small changes in atmospheric circulation, so the surface area of Lake Chad is greatly affected by climate change. Dry climate due to vegetation loss from overgrazing and deforestation and large-scale irrigation projects that diverted water from the rivers that feed the lake are the main reasons for the shrinkage of Lake Chad. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation have affected precipitation in the Sahel region. From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, the lake water level decreased by compared to the average level from 1900 to 2010.\nIn 1870, the area of Lake Chad was about . The lake was able to flow out of the Bahr el-Ghazal during the rainy season. At the turn of the 20th century the area of Lake Chad shrank briefly, and reached a new high in the middle of the 20th century and overflowed from the Bahr el-Ghazal again. A major drought started in the Sahel region in the late 1960s and caused severe damage in 1972 and 1984. It was thought to be related to vegetation loss, global warming, and sea surface temperature anomalies. During this period, Lake Chad shrunk considerably and fluctuated in the range of thereafter.\nFrom June 1966 to January 1973, the area of Lake Chad shrank from , further shrunk to in 1975, and only in February 1994. Since then, the area of Lake Chad has entered a relatively stable stage with a slight increase. From 1995 to 1998, it fluctuated within the range of . The area once reached in 2000, and the average area of surface water from 2013 to 2016 was about , with the largest area being in July 2015.\nEcology.\nPart of the Chad Basin is located within the Chad Basin National Park in Nigeria, and the country and Cameroon have established the Lake Chad Ramsar Wetland with a total area of .\nPlantlife.\nThe wetland plants in the south mainly include cyperus papyrus, etc. Reeds mainly grow in the north where the salinity is high, and the floating plant pistia sometimes covers large areas of open water. Plants such as hyparrhenia rufa grow on the shores of lakes with long floods in the south. The area of permanent vegetation has increased from about in 2000 to about in 2020 as water levels have dropped and temperatures have increased. The surrounding dense woodland has been converted to open forest with acacias, baobabs, palms and Indian jujube.\nBirds.\nThe lake has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It is permanently or seasonally inhabited by hundreds of species of birds such as northern shoveler, Egyptian goose and marabou stork. It is an important wintering ground for European anatidae and wading birds. There are raptors such as steppe eagle and booted eagle on the lakeshore, and more than one million ruff can be observed on the lake at one time.\nMammals.\nThe once common large mammals include red-fronted gazelle, dama gazelle, patas monkey, striped hyena, cheetah and caracal, while African elephant, otter, hippopotamus, sitatunga and kob are distributed in the wetlands. At present, most of the large mammals have been hunted to extinction, replaced by a large number of cattle.\nFish.\nThe entire Chad Basin has 179 species of fish, of which 127 are the same as the Niger River Basin, 85 are the same as the Nile River Basin, 47 are the same as the Congo River Basin, and 84 fish species are distributed in the lake. This makes it a rich fishing ground for communities across Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. The seasonal influx of floods combined with seasonal increases in air temperature leads to decreased salinity, increased turbidity, and increased trophic levels, which catalyzed a surge in the number of phytoplankton and zooplankton, allowing large fish to migrate seasonally within the watershed to feed and breed in the fertile floodplain when floods arrive.\nHuman activities.\nThere are more than 30 million residents in the Chad Lake Basin. There are more than 70 ethnic groups around the lake, most of whom are distributed on the south bank, where the population density exceeds . They rely on the water source of Chad Lake for irrigation, breeding, animal husbandry and drinking. Local self-sufficient crops include sorghum, maize, finger millet, beans, and vegetables. Gourd is widely planted for making utensils. The collection of forest products such as gum arabic, honey, beeswax, and firewood is of great significance in the region. However, the reduction in forest area has had a negative impact on the production of these products, and the explosive growth of cattle herds has exacerbated this impact. Cattle are the most important livestock raised, as well as poultry, goats, sheep, camels, horses, and donkeys. The animal husbandry was severely affected by the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s.\nFishing has traditionally been the most important economic activity for the people of the lake area, which almost ceased during drought periods and only resumed in the mid-1990s. Most fishing products are dried, pickled, or smoked. The natron produced in the depression on the northeast bank of the lake has long been of significant economic significance. Traditionally, it has been excavated in blocks and transported across the lake to enter the Nigerian market. Since the drought in the 1970s, the soil that can be planted without irrigation and fertilization has been exposed at the bottom of the lake, and it has been reclaimed as a polder for planting maize, cowpea, rice, sorghum and other crops. Farmers have shifted from planting mainly dry crops, such as wheat, to rice with high water demand, resulting in more serious soil salinization and water eutrophication. The adverse effects of reduced water sources on fishing, farming, and herding outweigh the benefits of new land from the receding waters. The surrounding residents who used to rely on lake water were forced to relocate, causing the economy of the lake area to continuously shrink.\nSince 1970, five countries in the southern part of the basin have constructed numerous water conservancy projects in the upper reaches of the Chari River, Logone River, and Yobe River to intercept river water, resulting in a sharp decrease in the amount of water entering the lake. The average annual inflow of the Chari River and the Logone River from 1970 to 1990 was only 55% of that from 1950 to 1970. Since the 1980s, one-third of the water in the Chari River and the Logone River has been diverted and intercepted by the Central African Republic located upstream for agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. The dams built on the upper reaches of the rivers entering the lake changed the time and scope of seasonal floods and disrupted the migration of fish, resulting in a sharp reduction in the populations of \"Alestes baremoze\" and Nile perch, the main catches of Lake Chad, and a significant reduction in the catch. At the same time, the conflicts between countries and ethnic groups competing for water and land are also escalating. The four countries along the lake are all facing the problem of extreme poverty, and due to the difficulty in meeting their livelihoods, some local residents have been involved in drug and arms trade. This has been exacerbated by the activity of Boko Haram, an insurgency that has displaced millions of people and disrupted development through the region.\nCameroon, Niger, Nigeria, and Chad established the Lake Chad Basin Commission on 22 May 1964. The Central African Republic joined in 1996, and Libya joined in 2008. The headquarters of the committee is located in N'Djamena, Chad. The commission's tasks include managing Lake Chad and its water resources, protecting the ecosystem, and promoting regional integration, peace, security, and development in the Lake Chad region. The surrounding countries' water replenishment plan for Lake Chad includes the construction of a canal to transport of water from the Congo River Basin to the Chari River Basin every year, and use a series of dams along the route to generate electricity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located high in the east Pyrenees, between France and Spain. It is also the name of the Andorran parish that surrounds the capital.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the city had a population of 24,042, and the urban area, which includes Escaldes\u2013Engordany plus satellite villages, has over 40,000 inhabitants.\nThe principal industry is tourism, and the country also earns foreign income from being a tax haven. It is at an elevation of , and is the highest capital city in Europe. The city shares a border with Spain.\nName.\n\"Andorra la Vella\" means \"the city of Andorra\", to distinguish it from the Principality of Andorra as a whole. Although in Catalan the word (like French ) is derived from the Latin word which means \"old\", the \"Vella\" here (like French and Catalan ) is derived from the Latin word , meaning \"city\".\nHistory.\nThe site of Andorra la Vella has been settled since prior to the Christian era\u2014notably by the Andosin tribe from the late Neolithic. The state is one of the \"Marca Hispanica\" created and protected by Charlemagne in the eighth century as a buffer from the Moorish settlers in the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe settlement of Andorra la Vella has been the principal city of Andorra since 1278 when the French and the Episcopal co-princes agreed to joint suzerainty. Andorra la Vella's old town\u2014the \"Barri Antic\"\u2014includes streets and buildings dating from this time. Its most notable building is the \"Casa de la Vall\"\u2014constructed in the early sixteenth century\u2014which has been the state's parliamentary house since 1702. Andorra la Vella was, during this period, the capital of a largely isolated and feudal state, which retained its independence due to this principle of co-sovereignty.\nWell into the twentieth century, the area around Andorra la Vella remained largely forgotten. After political turmoil in the 1930s and an attempted coup by Boris Skossyreff, an informal democracy developed.\nIn 1993, the country's first constitution formalised this parliamentary democracy with executive, legislative, and judicial branches located in Andorra la Vella.\nDuring this period, Andorra also developed as a tax haven, resulting in the construction of modern banking offices in Andorra La Vella. The city also developed its skiing facilities, to the extent that Andorra la Vella was Andorra's applicant city for the XXI Olympic Winter Games, the 2010 Winter Olympics. However, Andorra la Vella was not selected by the IOC as a candidate city, following the evaluation report of an IOC commission. It also hosted both the 1991 and 2005 Games of the Small States of Europe.\nGeography.\nAndorra la Vella is located in the south west of Andorra, at , at the confluence of two mountain streams, the Valira del Nord (Northern Valira) and the Valira de l'Orient (Eastern Valira), which join to form the Gran Valira. It adjoins the urban area of Escaldes\u2013Engordany. The city is at above sea level.\nClimate.\nAndorra la Vella has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), with warm days and cool nights in summer, and chilly to cold, snowy winters. The average annual precipitation is . Temperatures in the city are lowered by the altitude (1,075 metres) compared with lowland areas.\nSubdivisions.\nThe parish of Andorra la Vella is divided into the villages of Andorra la Vella itself, La Margineda and Santa Coloma.\nLandmarks.\nThe city's old town is characterized by old stone streets and houses. The central \"Esgl\u00e9sia de Sant Esteve\" (Saint Stephen) church is part of the area that guidebooks often label as a picturesque part of the city. This was built in a Romanesque style in the eleventh century. As mentioned earlier, the old town also includes the country's historic parliament building. Probably the oldest building in the city is another church, dating from the ninth century, the Church of Santa Coloma d'Andorra.\nDemographics.\nNative Andorrans account for only a third (33.3%) of the population, with the plurality being Spaniards (43%), and notable minorities of Portuguese (11%) and Frenchmen (7%). Most of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics. There is a high life expectancy of over 80 years.\nCulture.\nThe city is the country's cultural centre, with the Government Exhibition Hall acting as a main theatre and museum. The piazza outside the parliament building is also the location of a number of events, and the town hosts a music festival every winter.\nLanguages.\nCatalan is the official language, although Spanish, Portuguese and French are also spoken.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nAndorra la Vella is the country's commercial centre. In the country as a whole, 80% of the GDP is derived from the 10\u00a0million tourists who visit annually. The city is also the centre for the many banks and businesses that thrive from its tax haven status. The state is not a member of the European Union, but has a customs arrangement with the EU, and uses the euro.\nTransportation.\nAndorra la Vella has direct access to air transportation with commercial helicopter flights from Andorra la Vella Heliport, located in the city centre. Andorra\u2013La Seu d'Urgell Airport is located south of the city; it is actually located in Spain and since July 2015 operates domestic routes to various airports across that country. Nearby airports located in Spain and France provide access to international flights with the nearest airports being Perpignan (156\u00a0km away) and Lleida (160\u00a0km away). The largest nearby airports are Toulouse (\"Tolosa\"), Girona and Barcelona.\nAndorra la Vella does not have a train station, although there are bus shuttle services linking the city to train stations at L'Hospitalet-pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre (France) and Lleida in Spain. There are also shuttle buses from Barcelona, Girona and Reus' airports to Andorra la Vella.\nEducation.\nSchooling.\nAndorra la Vella has 11 schools available (10 public and 1 private), with the French system most deeply layered. The multisystem choice allows families to choose between Catalan-based, Spanish-based and French-based public schooling. Andorra la Vella has a complete educational pipeline, from early childhood to secondary, all available within the parish. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain.\nHigher Education.\nAndorra la Vella does not host higher education itself. The Universitat d'Andorra (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra, situated in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria (~7\u202fkm away).\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nAndorra la Vella is twinned with the following cities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnion of Ibero-American Capital Cities.\nAndorra la Vella has been part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 2008, establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They come in four main pairs of shapes, as given in the box to the right, which also gives their names, that vary between British and American English. \"Brackets\", without further qualification, are in British English the (...) marks and in American English the [...] marks.\nOther symbols are repurposed as brackets in specialist contexts, such as those used by linguists.\nBrackets are typically deployed in symmetric pairs, and an individual bracket may be identified as a \"left\" or \"right\" bracket or, alternatively, an \"opening bracket\" or \"closing bracket\", respectively, depending on the directionality of the context.\nIn casual writing and in technical fields such as computing or linguistic analysis of grammar, brackets nest, with segments of bracketed material containing embedded within them other further bracketed sub-segments. The number of opening brackets matches the number of closing brackets in such cases.\nVarious forms of brackets are used in mathematics, with specific mathematical meanings, often for denoting specific mathematical functions and subformulas.\nHistory.\nAngle brackets or \u27e8\u00a0\u27e9 were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written English. Erasmus coined the term to refer to the round brackets or () recalling the shape of the crescent moon ().\nMost typewriters only had the left and right parentheses. Square brackets appeared with some teleprinters.\nBraces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the IBM 7030 Stretch.\nIn 1961, ASCII contained parentheses, square, and curly brackets, and also less-than and greater-than signs that could be used as angle brackets.\nTypography.\nIn English, typographers mostly prefer not to set brackets in italics, even when the enclosed text is italic. However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually also set in italics.\nParentheses or round brackets.\n \nThe marks ( and ) are \"parentheses\" (singular \"parenthesis\" ) in American English, and either \"round brackets\" or simply \"brackets\" in British English. \nIn formal writing, \"parentheses\" is also used in British English.\nUses of ( ).\nParentheses contain adjunctive material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a gloss) or is aside from the main point.\nA comma before or after the material can also be used, though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result. A dash before and after the material is also sometimes used.\nParentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as \"Senator John McCain (R\u00a0-\u00a0Arizona) spoke at length\". They can also indicate shorthand for \"either singular or plural\" for nouns, e.g. \"the claim(s)\". It can also be used for gender-neutral language, especially in languages with grammatical gender, e.g. \"(s)he agreed with his/her physician\" (the slash in the second instance, as one alternative is replacing the other, not adding to it).\nParenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author William Faulkner (see \"Absalom, Absalom!\" and ) as well as poet E. E. Cummings.\nParentheses have historically been used where the em dash is currently used in alternatives, such as \"parenthesis)(parentheses\". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of \"Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage\".\nParentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).\nLanguage.\nA parenthesis in rhetoric and linguistics refers to the entire bracketed text, not just to the enclosing marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be described as \"a parenthesis\"). Taking as an example the sentence \"Mrs. Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady.\", the explanatory phrase between the parentheses is itself called a parenthesis. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the bracketed phrase is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesised sentences removed. The term refers to the syntax rather than the enclosure method: the same clause in the form \"Mrs. Pennyfarthing\u00a0\u2013 What? Yes, that was her name!\u00a0\u2013 was my landlady\" is also a parenthesis. (In non-specialist usage, the term \"parenthetical phrase\" is more widely understood.)\nIn phonetics, parentheses are used for indistinguishable or unidentified utterances. They are also seen for silent articulation (mouthing), where the expected phonetic transcription is derived from lip-reading, and with periods to indicate silent pauses, for example or .\nIn some languages, such as the Nicodemus orthography for Coeur d\u2019Alene, parentheses are used as phonemic symbols instead of punctuation.\nEnumerations.\nAn unpaired right parenthesis is often used as part of a label in an ordered list, such as this one:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\na) educational testing,\nb) technical writing and diagrams,\nc) market research, and\nd) elections.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAccounting.\nTraditionally in accounting, contra amounts are placed in parentheses. A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have parentheses and vice versa.\nParentheses in mathematics.\nParentheses are used in mathematical notation to indicate grouping, often inducing a different order of operations. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, 4 \u00d7 3 + 2 equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, 4 \u00d7 (3 + 2) equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nParentheses in programming languages.\nParentheses are included in the syntaxes of many programming languages. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the method/function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in LISP, parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language. They are also often used for scoping functions and operators and for arrays. In syntax diagrams they are used for grouping, such as in extended Backus\u2013Naur form.\nIn Mathematica and the Wolfram language, parentheses are used to indicate grouping\u00a0\u2013 for example, with pure anonymous functions.\nTaxonomy.\nIf it is desired to include the subgenus when giving the scientific name of an animal species or subspecies, the subgenus's name is provided in parentheses between the genus name and the specific epithet. For instance, \"Polyphylla\" (\"Xerasiobia\") \"alba\" is a way to cite the species \"Polyphylla alba\" while also mentioning that it is in the subgenus \"Xerasiobia\". There is also a convention of citing a subgenus by enclosing it in parentheses after its genus, e.g., \"Polyphylla\" (\"Xerasiobia\") is a way to refer to the subgenus \"Xerasiobia\" within the genus \"Polyphylla\". Parentheses are similarly used to cite a subgenus with the name of a prokaryotic species, although the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) requires the use of the abbreviation \"subgen\". as well, e.g., \"Acetobacter\" (subgen. \"Gluconoacetobacter\") \"liquefaciens\".\nChemistry.\nParentheses are used in chemistry to denote a repeated substructure within a molecule, e.g. HC(CH3)3 (isobutane) or, similarly, to indicate the stoichiometry of ionic compounds with such substructures: e.g. Ca(NO3)2 (calcium nitrate).\nThis is a notation that was pioneered by Berzelius, who wanted chemical formulae to more resemble algebraic notation, with brackets enclosing groups that could be multiplied (e.g. in 3(AlO2 + 2SO3) the 3 multiplies everything within the parentheses).\nIn chemical nomenclature, parentheses are used to distinguish structural features and multipliers for clarity, for example in the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate).\nSquare brackets.\n[ and ] are \"square brackets\" in both British and American English, but are also more simply \"brackets\" in the latter.\nAn older name for these brackets is \"crotchets\".\nUses of [ ].\nSquare brackets are often used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a [word or] passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations. In transcribed interviews, sounds, responses and reactions that are not words but that can be described are set off in square brackets \u2014 \"... [laughs] ...\".\nWhen quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in square brackets within the quotation to show that the quotation is not exactly as given, or to add an annotation. For example: \"The Plaintiff asserted his cause is just, stating,\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[m]y causes is [\"sic\"] just.\nIn the original quoted sentence, the word \"my\" was capitalised: it has been modified in the quotation given and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error (is/are), the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with \"[\"sic\"]\" (Latin for 'thus').\nA bracketed ellipsis, [...], is often used to indicate omitted material: \"I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]\"\nBracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate where the original has been modified for clarity: \"I appreciate it [the honor], but I must refuse\", and \"the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt\". Or one can quote the original statement \"I hate to do laundry\" with a (sometimes grammatical) modification inserted: He \"hate[s] to do laundry\".\nAdditionally, a small letter can be replaced by a capital one, when the beginning of the original printed text is being quoted in another piece of text or when the original text has been omitted for succinctness\u2014 for example, when referring to a verbose original: \"To the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all, they have, as the saying goes, done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination\", can be quoted succinctly as: \"[P]olicymakers [...] have made use of economic analysis [...] the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.\" When nested parentheses are needed, brackets are sometimes used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair. When deeper levels of nesting are needed, convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level.\nAlternatively, empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material, usually single letter only. The original, \"Reading is also a process and it also changes you.\" can be rewritten in a quote as: It has been suggested that reading can \"also change[] you\".\nIn translated works, brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity.\nFor example: \"He is trained in the way of the open hand [karate].\"\nStyle and usage guides originating in the news industry of the twentieth century, such as the \"AP Stylebook\", recommend against the use of square brackets because \"They cannot be transmitted over news wires.\" However, this guidance has little relevance outside of the technological constraints of the industry and era.\nIn linguistics, phonetic transcriptions are generally enclosed within square brackets, whereas phonemic transcriptions typically use paired slashes, according to International Phonetic Alphabet rules. Pipes (|\u00a0|) are often used to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation. Other conventions are double slashes (\u2afd\u00a0\u2afd), double pipes (\u2016\u00a0\u2016) and curly brackets ({\u00a0}).\nIn lexicography, square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the etymology of the word the entry defines.\nProofreading.\nBrackets (called \"move-left symbols\" or \"move right symbols\") are added to the sides of text in proofreading to indicate changes in indentation:\nSquare brackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalising a document.\nLaw.\nSquare brackets are used in some countries in the citation of law reports to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Chronicle Pub. Co. v Superior Court\" (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, [7 Cal.Rptr. 109]\nIn some other countries (such as England and Wales), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"National Coal Board v England\" [1954] AC 403\nThis case is in the 1954 volume of the Appeal Cases reports, although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier. Compare with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(1954) 98 Sol Jo 176\nThis citation reports a decision from 1954, in volume 98 of the \"Solicitors Journal\" which may be published in 1955 or later.\nThey often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain case law decisions.\nSquare brackets in mathematics.\nBrackets are used in mathematics in a variety of notations, including standard notations for commutators, the floor function, the Lie bracket, equivalence classes, the Iverson bracket, and matrices.\nSquare brackets may be used exclusively or in combination with parentheses to represent intervals as \"interval notation\". For example, [0,5] represents the set of real numbers from 0 to 5 inclusive. Both parentheses and brackets are used to denote a \"half-open\" interval; [5,\u200912) would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth, but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation [5,\u200912[ is also used. The endpoint adjoining the square bracket is known as \"closed\", whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as \"open\".\nIn group theory and ring theory, brackets denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator is commonly defined as . In ring theory, the commutator is defined as .\nChemistry.\nSquare brackets can also be used in chemistry to represent the concentration of a chemical substance in solution and to denote charge a Lewis structure of an ion (particularly distributed charge in a complex ion), repeating chemical units (particularly in polymers) and transition state structures, among other uses.\nSquare brackets in programming languages.\nBrackets are used in many computer programming languages, primarily for array indexing. But they are also used to denote general tuples, sets and other structures, just as in mathematics. There may be several other uses as well, depending on the language at hand. In syntax diagrams they are used for optional portions, such as in extended Backus\u2013Naur form.\nDouble brackets \u27e6 \u27e7.\nDouble brackets (or white square brackets or Scott brackets (named after Dana Scott)), \u27e6\u00a0\u27e7, are used to indicate the \"semantic evaluation function\" in formal semantics for natural language and denotational semantics for programming languages. In the Wolfram Language, double brackets, either as iterated single brackets (&amp;lsqb;&amp;lsqb;) or ligatures (\u301a) are used for list indexing.\nThe brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its \"denotation\" or semantic value. In mathematics, double brackets may also be used to denote intervals of integers or, less often, the floor function. In papyrology, following the Leiden Conventions, they are used to enclose text that has been deleted in antiquity.\nLenticular brackets\u3010\u3011.\nSome East Asian languages use lenticular brackets \u3010 \u3011, a combination of square brackets and round brackets. In Chinese, they are called \u65b9\u982d\u62ec\u865f () and in Japanese, (). They are used in titles and headings in both Chinese and Japanese. On the Internet, they are used to emphasise a text. In Japanese, they are most frequently seen in dictionaries for quoting Chinese characters and Sino-Japanese loanwords.\nFloor \u230a \u230b and ceiling \u2308 \u2309 corner brackets.\nThe floor corner brackets \u230a \u230b and ceiling corner brackets \u2308 \u2309 are used to denote the integer floor and ceiling functions in mathematics.\nQuine corners \u231c\u231d and half brackets \u2e24 \u2e25 or \u2e22 \u2e23.\nThe Quine corners \u231c and \u231d have at least two uses in mathematical logic: either as quasi-quotation, a generalisation of quotation marks, or to denote the G\u00f6del number of the enclosed expression.\nHalf brackets are used in English to mark added text, such as in translations: \"Bill saw \u2e24her\u2e25\".\nIn editions of papyrological texts, half brackets, \u2e24 and \u2e25 or \u2e22 and \u2e23, enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage, but can be restored by virtue of another source, such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus. For example, Callimachus \"Iambus\" 1.2 reads: \". A hole in the papyrus has obliterated \", but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem. Second intermittent sources can be between \u2e22 and \u2e23. Quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets.\nBrackets with quills \u2045 \u2046.\nKnown as \"spike parentheses\" (), and are used in Swedish bilingual dictionaries to enclose supplemental constructions.\nCurly brackets.\n&amp;lbrace; and &amp;rbrace; are \"curly brackets\" or \"braces\" in both American and British English.\nUses of { }.\nCurly brackets are used by text editors to mark editorial insertions or interpolations.\nBraces used to be used to connect multiple lines of poetry, such as triplets in a poem of rhyming couplets, although this usage had gone out of fashion by the 19th century.\nAnother older use in prose was to eliminate duplication in lists and tables.\nTwo examples here from Charles Hutton's 19th century table of weights and measures in his \"A Course of Mathematics\":\nAs an extension to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), braces are used for prosodic notation.\nMusic.\nIn music, they are known as \"accolades\" or \"braces\", and connect two or more lines (staves) of music that are played simultaneously.\nChemistry.\nThe use of braces in chemistry is an old notation that has long since been superseded by subscripted numbers.\nThe chemical formula for water, H2O, was represented as formula_1.\nCurly brackets in programming languages.\nIn many programming languages, curly brackets enclose groups of statements and create a local scope. Such languages (C, C#, C++ and many others) are therefore called curly bracket languages. They are also used to define structures and enumerated type in these languages.\nIn various Unix shells, they enclose a group of strings that are used in a process known as \"brace expansion\", where each successive string in the group is interpolated at that point in the command line to generate the command-line's final form.\nThe mechanism originated in the C shell and the string generation mechanism is a simple interpolation that can occur anywhere in a command line and takes no account of existing filenames.\nIn syntax diagrams they are used for repetition, such as in extended Backus\u2013Naur form.\nIn the Z formal specification language, braces define a set.\nCurly brackets in mathematics.\nIn mathematics they delimit sets, in what is called \"set notation\".\nBraces enclose either a literal list of set elements, or a rule that defines the set elements.\nFor example:\nThey are often also used to denote the Poisson bracket between two quantities.\nIn ring theory, braces denote the anticommutator where is defined as .\nAngle brackets.\nThe symbols \u2329 and \u232a are \"angle brackets\" in both American and British English. In (largely archaic) computer slang, they were sometimes known as \"brokets\". They are also sometimes called \"chevrons\", but chevrons normally only point upwards or downwards.\nThe ASCII characters less-than sign and greater-than sign &lt; and &gt; are widely substituted for angle brackets. In many cases, only these substituted characters are accepted by computer programs, and the Unicode angle brackets are not recognised (for instance, in HTML tags). The characters for \"single\" guillemets (European-style single quotation marks, \u2039 and \u203a) are also occasionally used to indicate angle brackets, and normal guillemets (European-style double quotation marks, \u00ab and \u00bb) used when \"nested\" (ie, double) angle brackets are needed.\nThe angle brackets and are for mathematical use and Western languages, whereas and are double width forms for East Asian languages. The angle bracket symbols at U+2329 and U+232A are deprecated in favour of the U+3008 and U+3009 East Asian angle brackets. Unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in Western texts, because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300n and thus likely to render as double-width symbols.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShape.\nAngle brackets are larger than 'less-than' and 'greater-than' signs, which in turn are larger than guillemets.\nUses of \u27e8 \u27e9.\nAngle brackets are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken, such as:\n\u27e8What an unusual flower!\u27e9\nIn textual criticism, and hence in many editions of pre-modern works, chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost; the editor will often insert their own reconstruction where possible within them.\nIn linguistics, angle brackets identify graphemes (e.g., letters of an alphabet) or orthography, as in \"The English word is spelled \u27e8cat\u27e9.\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn epigraphy, they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the Latin script.\nIn East Asian punctuation, angle brackets are used as quotation marks. Angle bracket symbols are part of standard Chinese, Japanese, Korean punctuation, where they generally enclose the titles of books, as: \u3008 \ufe19 \u3009 or \u300a \ufe19 \u300b for traditional vertical printing \u2014 written in vertical lines \u2014 and as \u3008 ... \u3009 or \u300a ... \u300b for horizontal printing \u2014 in horizontal.\nAngle brackets in mathematics.\nAngle brackets (or 'chevrons') are used in group theory to write group presentations, and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements. In set theory, chevrons or parentheses are used to denote ordered pairs and other tuples, whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets.\nPhysics and mechanics.\nIn physical sciences and statistical mechanics, angle brackets are used to denote an average (\"expected value\") over time or over another continuous parameter. For example:\nformula_2\nIn mathematical physics, especially quantum mechanics, it is common to write the inner product between elements as , as a short version of , or , where \"\u00d4\" is an operator. This is known as \"Dirac notation\" or \"bra\u2013ket notation\", to note vectors from the dual spaces of the Bra\u00a0\u27e8\u27e9. But there are other notations used.\nIn continuum mechanics, chevrons may be used as Macaulay brackets.\nAngle brackets in programming languages.\nIn C++ angle brackets (actually less-than and greater-than) are used to surround arguments to templates. They are also used to surround the names of header files; this usage was inherited from and is also found in C.\nIn the Z formal specification language, angle brackets define a sequence.\nIn HTML, angle brackets (actually 'greater than' and 'less than' symbols) are used to bracket meta text. For example codice_1 denotes that the following text should be displayed as bold. Pairs of meta text tags are required \u2013 much as brackets themselves are usually in pairs. The end of the bold text segment would be indicated by codice_1. This use is sometimes extended as an informal mechanism for communicating mood or tone in digital formats such as messaging, for example adding \"&lt;sighs&gt;\" at the end of a sentence.\nUnicode.\nRepresentations of various kinds of brackets in Unicode and their respective HTML entities, that are not in the infoboxes in preceding sections, are given below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59347", "revid": "388090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59347", "title": "Hyphen", "text": "Punctuation mark used to join words\nThe hyphen \u2010 is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. The use of hyphens is called hyphenation.\nThe hyphen is sometimes confused with dashes (en dash \u2013, em dash \u2014 and others), which are wider, or with the minus sign \u2212, which is also wider and usually drawn a little higher to match the crossbar in the plus sign +.\nAs an orthographic concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In character encoding for use with computers, it is represented in Unicode by any of several characters. These include the dual-use hyphen-minus, the soft hyphen, the nonbreaking hyphen, and an unambiguous form known familiarly as the \"Unicode hyphen\", shown at the top of the infobox on this page. The character most often used to represent a hyphen (and the one produced by the key on a keyboard) is called the \"hyphen-minus\" in the Unicode specification because it is also used as a minus sign. The name derives from its name in the original ASCII standard, where it was called \"hyphen(minus)\".\nEtymology.\nThe word is derived from Ancient Greek (), contracted from (), \"in one\" (literally \"under one\"). An () was an undertie-like \u203f sign written below two adjacent letters to indicate that they belong to the same word when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity, before word spacing was practiced.\nHistory.\nThe first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of Dionysius Thrax. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low tie mark between the two words. In Greek these marks were known as \"enotikon\", officially romanized as a hyphen.\nWith the introduction of letter spacing in the Middle Ages, the hyphen, still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.\nThe modern format of the hyphen originated with Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, c.\u20091455 with the publication of his 42-line Bible. His tools did not allow for a sublinear hyphen, and he thus moved it to the middle of the line. Examination of an original copy on vellum (Hubay index #35) in the U. S. Library of Congress shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words composed of individual movable type to be secured within a rigid, nonprinting frame. To ensure each line fit the frame uniformly, Gutenberg addressed differences in line length by inserting a hyphen at the end of a line at the right-hand margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His double hyphen, \u2e17, appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.\nUse in English.\nThe English language does not have definitive hyphenation rules, though various style guides provide detailed usage recommendations and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or \"hanging\" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., \"nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers\"). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.\nThe use of the hyphen in English compound nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" removed the hyphens from 16,000\u00a0entries, such as \"fig-leaf\" (now \"fig leaf\"), \"pot-belly\" (now \"pot belly\"), and \"pigeon-hole\" (now \"pigeonhole\"). The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g., \"toolbar\", \"hyperlink\", and \"pastebin\").\nDespite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in columns with narrow line lengths, as when used with newspapers).\nSeparating.\nJustification and line-wrapping.\nWhen flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word into two so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables (syllabification) and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins (justification) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of rivers. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the column (called the \"line length\" in typography) is very narrow. For example:\nRules (or guidelines) for correct hyphenation vary between languages, and may be complex, and they can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices. Hyphenation algorithms, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts.\nIt may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition), not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and soft hyphens having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" and the \"Chambers Dictionary\" use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans\u2013English dictionary uses the opposite convention. The \"Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition)\" suggested repeating an integral hyphen at the start of the following line.\nPrefixes and suffixes.\nPrefixes (such as \"de-\", \"pre-\", \"re-\", and \"non-\") and suffixes (such as \"-less\", \"-like\", \"-ness\", and \"-hood\") are sometimes hyphenated, especially when the unhyphenated spelling resembles another word or when the affixation is deemed misinterpretable, ambiguous, or somehow \"odd-looking\" (for example, having two consecutive monographs that look like the digraphs of English, like e+a, e+e, or e+i). However, the unhyphenated style, which is also called \"closed up\" or \"solid\", is usually preferred, particularly when the derivative has been relatively familiarized or popularized through extensive use in various contexts. As a rule of thumb, affixes are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen would hurt clarity.\nThe hyphen may be used between vowel letters (e.g., \"ee\", \"ea\", \"ei\") to indicate that they do not form a digraph. Some words have both hyphenated and unhyphenated variants: \"de-escalate/deescalate\", \"co-operation/cooperation\", \"re-examine/reexamine\", \"de-emphasize/deemphasize\", and so on. Words often lose their hyphen as they become more common, such as \"email\" instead of \"e-mail\". When there are tripled letters, the hyphenated variant of these words is often more common (as in \"shell-like\" instead of \"shelllike\").\nClosed-up style is avoided in some cases: possible homographs, such as \"recreation\" (fun or sport) versus \"re-creation\" (the act of creating again), \"retreat\" (turn back) versus \"re-treat\" (give therapy again), and \"un-ionized\" (not in ion form) versus \"unionized\" (organized into trade unions); combinations with proper nouns or adjectives (\"un-American\", \"de-Stalinisation\"); acronyms (\"anti-TNF antibody\", \"non-SI units\"); or numbers (\"pre-1949 diplomacy\", \"pre-1492 cartography\"). Although \"proto-oncogene\" is still hyphenated by both \"Dorland's\" and \"Merriam-Webster's Medical\", the solid (that is, unhyphenated) styling (\"protooncogene\") is a common variant, particularly among oncologists and geneticists.\nA diaeresis may also be used in a like fashion, either to separate and mark off monographs (as in \"co\u00f6peration\") or to signalize a vocalic terminal e (for example, \"Bront\u00eb\"). This use of the diaeresis peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was never applied extensively across the language: only a handful of diaereses, including \"co\u00f6peration\" and \"Bront\u00eb\", are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; thus \"re\u00ebxamine\", \"re\u00efterate\", \"de\u00ebmphasize\", etc. are seldom encountered. In borrowings from Modern French, whose orthography utilizes the diaeresis as a means to differentiate graphemes, various English dictionaries list the dieresis as optional (as in \"naive\" and \"na\u00efve\") despite the juxtaposition of a and i.\nSyllabification and spelling.\nHyphens are occasionally used to denote syllabification, as in \"syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion\". Various British and North American dictionaries use an interpunct (sometimes called a \"middle dot\" or \"hyphenation point\"), for this purpose, as in \"syl\u00b7la\u00b7bi\u00b7fi\u00b7ca\u00b7tion\". This practice allows the hyphen to be reserved exclusively for instances where a true hyphen is intended\u00a0\u2013 for example, \"self-con\u00b7scious\", \"un\u00b7self-con\u00b7scious\", and \"long-stand\u00b7ing\". Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate the spelling of a word, as in \"W-O-R-D\" to represent \"word\".\nIn nineteenth-century American literature, hyphens were also used irregularly to divide syllables in words from indigenous North American languages, without regard for etymology or pronunciation, such as \"Shuh-shuh-gah\" (from Ojibwe \"zhashagi\", \"blue heron\") in \"The Song of Hiawatha\". This usage is now rare and deprecated, except in some place names such as Ah-gwah-ching.\nJoining.\nCompound modifiers.\nCompound modifiers are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an adverb\u2013adjective combination appears \"before\" a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in \"American-football player\" or \"little-celebrated paintings\". Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a \"player of American football\" or an \"American player of football\" and whether the writer means paintings that are \"little celebrated\" or \"celebrated paintings\" that are little. Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in \"ice-cream-flavored candy\", and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (\"spine-tinglingly frightening\"). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, some style guides prefer the construction \"high school students\", to \"high-school students\". Although the expression is technically ambiguous (\"students of a high school\"/\"school students who are high\"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun\u2013noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: \"grade point average\" and \"department store manager\".\nWhen a compound modifier \"follows\" the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, \"that gentleman is well respected\", not \"that gentleman is well-respected\"; or \"a patient-centered approach was used\" but \"the approach was patient centered.\" But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, \"A cost-effective method was used\" and \"The method was cost-effective\" (\"cost-effective\" is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries). When one of the parts of the modifier is a proper noun or a proper adjective, there is no hyphen (e.g., \"a South American actor\").\nWhen the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in \"-ly\" (e.g., \"a poorly written novel\"), various style guides advise no hyphen. However, some do allow for this use. For example, \"The Economist Style Guide\" advises: \"Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions... Less common adverbs, including all those that end \"-ly\", are less likely to need hyphens.\" In the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb\u2013adjective modifiers with the adverb ending in \"-ly\" (e.g., \"a craftily-constructed chair\"). However, this has become rare. For example, \"wholly owned subsidiary\" and \"quickly moving vehicle\" are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: \"quickly\" cannot modify \"vehicle\".\nHowever, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide. For example, the phrase \"more-important reasons\" (\"reasons that are more important\") is distinguished from \"more important reasons\" (\"additional important reasons\"), where \"more\" is an adjective. Similarly, \"more-beautiful scenery\" (with a mass-noun) is distinct from \"more beautiful scenery\". (In contrast, the hyphen in \"a more-important reason\" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words\u2014such as \"well\", \"ill\", \"little\", and \"much\"\u2014attract special attention in this category. The hyphen in \"well-[past_participled] noun\", such as in \"well-differentiated cells\", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because \"early\" has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with \"advanced-stage disease\" and \"adult-onset disease\", like the parallelism of \"early-stage disease\" and \"early-onset disease\". Similarly, the hyphen in \"little-celebrated paintings\" clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.\nHyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun), although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus \"28-year-old woman\" and \"twenty-eight-year-old woman\" or \"32-foot wingspan\" and \"thirty-two-foot wingspan\", but \"the woman is 28 years old\" and \"a wingspan of 32 feet\". However, with symbols for SI units (such as \"m\" or \"kg\")\u2014in contrast to the \"names\" of these units (such as \"metre\" or \"kilogram\")\u2014the numerical value is always separated from it with a space: \"a 25\u00a0kg sphere\". When the unit names are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: \"a 25-kilogram sphere\", \"a roll of 35-millimetre film\".\nIn spelled-out fractions, hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus \"two-thirds majority\" and \"one-eighth portion\" but \"I drank two thirds of the bottle\" or \"I kept three quarters of it for myself\". However, at least one major style guide hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).\nIn English, an en dash, \u2013, sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, \"San Francisco\u2013area residents\", \"hormone receptor\u2013positive cells\", \"cell cycle\u2013related factors\", and \"public-school\u2013private-school rivalries\"). A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (\"hormone-receptor-positive cells\", \"cell-cycle-related factors\"). (For other aspects of en dash\u2013versus\u2013hyphen use, see \"Dash \u00a7 En dash\".)\nObject\u2013verbal-noun compounds.\nWhen an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as \"egg-beater\" (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, \"egg-beater, egg beater,\" and \"eggbeater\" are all common.\nAn example of an ambiguous phrase appears in \"they stood near a group of alien lovers\", which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; \"they stood near a group of alien-lovers\" clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as \"alien\" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase \"a hungry pizza-lover\", the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as \"pizza\" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.\nSimilarly, \"a man-eating shark\" is nearly the opposite of \"a man eating shark\"; the first refers to a shark that eats people, and the second to a man who eats shark meat. \"A government-monitoring program\" is a program that monitors the government, whereas \"a government monitoring program\" is a government program that monitors something else.\nPersonal names.\nSome married couples compose a new surname (sometimes referred to as a double-barrelled name) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname.\nWith already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Sam Taylor-Johnson. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a descendant of Louis Leml\u00e9 Dreyfus whose son was L\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus.\nHyphens are often used in romanization of Korean names, such as Ban Ki-moon and Cho Jung-ho.\nOther compounds.\nConnecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in \"lily-of-the-valley\", \"cock-a-hoop\", \"clever-clever\", \"tittle-tattle\" and \"orang-utan\". Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, \"orang-utan\" is also written as \"orangutan\" or \"orang utan\", and \"lily-of-the-valley\" may be hyphenated or not.\nSuspended hyphens.\nA suspended hyphen (also called a suspensive hyphen or hanging hyphen, or less commonly a dangling or floating hyphen) may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words that are connected by \"and\", \"or\", or \"to\". For example, \"short-term and long-term plans\" may be written as \"short- and long-term plans.\" This usage is now common and specifically recommended in some style guides. Suspended hyphens are also used, though less commonly, when the base word comes first, such as in \"investor-owned and -operated\". Uses such as \"applied and sociolinguistics\" (instead of \"applied linguistics and sociolinguistics\") are frowned upon; the Indiana University style guide uses this example and says \"Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open\" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words). This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, \"preoperative and postoperative\" becomes \"pre- and postoperative\" (not \"pre- and post-operative\") when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.\nOther uses.\nA hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see \u00a7 Usage in date notation), telephone numbers or sports scores.\nIt can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an en dash (see ).\nIt is sometimes used to hide letters in words (filleting for redaction or censoring), as in \"G-d\", although an en dash can be used as well (\"G\u2013d\").\nIt is often used in reduplication.\nDue to their similar appearances, hyphens are sometimes mistakenly used where an en dash or em dash would be more appropriate.\nVaried meanings.\nSome stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens to mark attributive phrases:\nUse in computing.\nHyphen-minuses.\nIn the ASCII character encoding, the hyphen (or minus) is character 4510. As Unicode is identical to ASCII (the 1967 version) for all encodings up to 12710, the number 4510 (2D16) is also assigned to this character in Unicode, where it is denoted as . Unicode has, in addition, other encodings for minus and hyphen characters: and , respectively. The unambiguous at U+2010 is generally inconvenient to enter on most keyboards and the glyphs for this hyphen and the hyphen-minus are identical in most fonts (Lucida Sans Unicode is one of the few exceptions). Consequently, use of the hyphen-minus as the hyphen character is very common. Even the Unicode Standard regularly uses the hyphen-minus rather than the U+2010 hyphen.\nThe hyphen-minus has limited use in indicating subtraction; for example, compare 4+3\u22122=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus)\u200a\u2014\u200ain most typefaces, the glyph for hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character is typically designed so that it does. Nevertheless, in many spreadsheet and programming applications the hyphen-minus must be typed to indicate subtraction, as use of the Unicode minus sign will not be recognised.\nThe hyphen-minus is often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the latter characters are unavailable (such as type-written or ASCII-only text), where they take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Consequently, some writers use two or three hyphen-minuses ( or ) to represent an em dash. In the TeX typesetting languages, a single hyphen-minus (codice_1) renders a hyphen, a single hyphen-minus in math mode (codice_2) renders a minus sign, two hyphen-minuses (codice_3) renders an en dash, and three hyphen-minuses (codice_4) renders an em dash.\nThe hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying command-line options. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the getopt function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters, , to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with pipelining in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized in lieu of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a standard stream, instead of a file, is to be worked with.\nSoft and hard hyphens.\nAlthough software (hyphenation algorithms) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is \"allowed\" but not \"forced\". That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.\nSoft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation \"may\" occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.\nIn contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a \"hard hyphen\". This can be a Unicode hyphen, a hyphen-minus, or a nonbreaking hyphen (see below). Confusingly, the term is sometimes limited to nonbreaking hyphens.\nNonbreaking hyphens.\nThe word segmentation rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a word boundary and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. This is not always desirable, it could lead to ambiguity (e.g. \"retreat\" and \"re\u2011treat\" would be indistinguishable with a line break after \"re\"), it can split off an ending as in \"\"n\"\u2011th\" (though \"n\"th or \"\"n\"th\" could be used), and it is inappropriate in some languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in Irish or Romanian would be undesirable). The non-breaking hyphen, nonbreaking hyphen, or no-break hyphen looks identical to the regular hyphen, but word processors do not break words at it. The nonbreaking space exists for similar reasons.\n\"Unicode hyphen\".\nBecause the conventional \"hyphen-minus\" mark on keyboards is ambiguous (it can be interpreted\u00a0\u2013 sometimes unexpectedly\u00a0\u2013 as a hyphen or a minus, depending on context), in addition the Unicode consortium allocated codepoints for an unambiguous minus and an unambiguous hyphen. The Unicode hyphen () is seldom used. Even the Unicode Standard uses U+002D instead of U+2010 in its text. \nUse in date notation.\nUse of hyphens to delineate the parts of a written date (rather than the slashes used conventionally in Anglophone countries) is specified in the international standard ISO 8601. Thus, for example, 1789-07-14 is the standard way of writing the date of Bastille Day. This standard has been transposed as European Standard EN 28601 and has been incorporated into various national typographic style guides (e.g., DIN 5008 in Germany). Now all official European Union (and many member state) documents use this style. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.\nThis method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer file systems make the use of slashes in file names difficult or impossible. MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows use to introduce and separate switches to shell commands, and on both Windows and Unix-like systems slashes in a filename introduce subdirectories which may not be desirable. Besides encouraging use of dashes, the Y-M-D order and zero-padding of numbers less than 10 are also copied from ISO 8601 to make the filenames sort by date order.\nUnicode.\nUnicode has multiple hyphen characters:\nAnd in non-Latin scripts:\nUnicode distinguishes the hyphen from the general interpunct. The characters below do not have the Unicode property of \"Hyphen\" despite their names:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(also known as interrogation point, query, or eroteme in journalism) is a punctuation mark that indicates a question or interrogative clause or phrase in many languages.\nHistory.\nThe history of the question mark is contested. One popular theory posits that the shape of the symbol is inspired by the crook in a cat's tail, often attributed to the ancient Egyptians. However, Egyptian hieroglyphics did not use punctuation marks. \nIn the fifth century, Syriac Bible manuscripts used question markers, according to a 2011 theory by manuscript specialist Chip Coakley: he believes the \"zagwa elaya\" (\"upper pair\"), a vertical double dot over a word at the start of a sentence, indicates that the sentence is a question.\nFrom around 783, in Godescalc Evangelistary, a mark described as \"a lightning flash, striking from right to left\" is attested. This mark is later called a . According to some paleographers, it may have indicated intonation, perhaps associated with early musical notation like neumes. Another theory, is that the \"lightning flash\" was originally a tilde or titlo, as in \u00b7~, one of many wavy or more or less slanted marks used in medieval texts for denoting things such as abbreviations, which would later become various diacritics or ligatures. The creation of the \"punctus interrogativus\" has also been attributed to Alcuin of York, an advisor to Charlemagne.\nFrom the 10th century, the pitch-defining element (if it ever existed) seems to have been gradually forgotten, so that the \"lightning flash\" sign (with the stroke sometimes slightly curved) is often seen indifferently at the end of clauses, whether they embody a question or not.\nIn the early 13th century, when the growth of communities of scholars (universities) in Paris and other major cities led to an expansion and streamlining of the book-production trade, punctuation was rationalized by assigning the \"lightning flash\" specifically to interrogatives; by this time, the stroke was more sharply curved and can easily be recognized as the modern question mark (see, for example, \"De Aetna\" (1496) printed by Aldo Manuzio in Venice).\nIn 1598, the English term \"point of interrogation\" is attested in an Italian\u2013English dictionary by John Florio.\nIn the 1850s, the term \"question mark\" is attested:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The mark which you are to notice in this lesson is of this shape ? You see it is made by placing a little crooked mark over a period... The name of this mark is the \"Question Mark\", because it is always put after a question. Sometimes it is called by a longer and harder name. The long and hard name is the \"Interrogation Point\".\nScope.\nIn English, the question mark typically occurs at the end of a sentence, where it replaces the full stop (period). However, the question mark may also occur at the end of a clause or phrase, where it replaces the comma &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;:\n\"Is it good in form? style? meaning?\"\nor:\n\"Showing off for him, for all of them, not out of hubris\u2014hubris? him? what did he have to be hubrid about?\u2014but from mood and nervousness.\"\n\u2014 Stanley Elkin.\nThis is quite common in Spanish, where the use of bracketing question marks explicitly indicates the scope of interrogation.\n ('In case you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?')\nA question mark may also appear immediately after questionable data, such as dates:\n\"Genghis Khan (1162?\u20131227)\"\nIn other languages and scripts.\nOpening and closing question marks in Spanish.\nIn Spanish, since the second edition of the of the in 1754, interrogatives require both opening \u00bf and closing ? question marks. An interrogative sentence, clause, or phrase begins with an inverted question mark \u00bf and ends with the question mark ?, as in:\n \u2013 'She asks me, \"What time is it?\"'\nQuestion marks must always be matched, but to mark uncertainty rather than actual interrogation omitting the opening one is allowed, although discouraged:\n is preferred in Spanish over \nThe omission of the opening mark is common in informal writing, but is considered an error. The one exception is when the question mark is matched with an exclamation mark, as in:\n \u2013 'Who do you think you are?!'\n(The order may also be reversed, opening with a question mark and closing with an exclamation mark.) Nonetheless, even here the recommends matching punctuation:\nThe opening question mark in Unicode is .\nSolomon Islands Pidgin.\nIn Solomon Islands Pidgin, the question can be between question marks since, in yes/no questions, the intonation can be the only difference.\n ('Solomon Islands is a great country, isn't it?')\nArmenian question mark.\nIn Armenian, the question mark is a diacritic that takes the form of an open circle and is placed over the stressed vowel of the question word. It is defined in Unicode at .\nGreek question mark.\nThe Greek question mark () looks like ;. It appeared around the same time as the Latin one, in the 8th century. It was adopted by Church Slavonic and eventually settled on a form essentially similar to the Latin semicolon. In Unicode, it is separately encoded as , but the similarity is so great that the code point is normalised to , making the marks identical in practice.\nMirrored question mark in right-to-left scripts.\nIn Arabic and other languages that use Arabic script such as Persian, Urdu and Uyghur (Arabic form), which are written from right to left, the question mark is mirrored right-to-left from the Latin question mark. In Unicode, two encodings are available: and . Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to font or text directionality issues.\nThe Arabic question mark is also used in some other right-to-left scripts: Dhivehi, N'Ko, Syriac, and Adlam. Adlam also has : , 'No?'.\nHebrew script is also written right-to-left, but it uses a question mark that appears on the page in the same orientation as the left-to-right question mark (e.g. ).\nFullwidth question mark in East Asian languages.\nThe question mark is also used in modern writing in Chinese and, to a lesser extent, Japanese. Usually, it is written as fullwidth form in Chinese and Japanese, in Unicode: . Fullwidth form is always preferred in official usage. In Korean, however, halfwidth is used.\nJapanese has an interrogative particle, \u304b (ka), which functions grammatically like a question mark. Therefore, the question mark is not historically used in Japanese, and is still not officially sanctioned for use in government publications or school textbooks, but its popularity has been gradually increasing among younger people. Where official usage is , some people would now informally write to express \"It may be over\"; the question mark here adds a nuance of uncertainty to the sentence rather than turning it into a question.\nChinese also has a spoken indicator of questions, which is \u5417 (ma). However, the question mark should always be used after when asking questions.\nIn other scripts.\nSome other scripts have a specific question mark:\nStylistic variants.\nFrench orthography specifies a narrow non-breaking space before the question mark. (e.g., \"\"); in English orthography, no space appears in front of the question mark (e.g. \"What would you like to drink?\").\nTypological variants of \"?\".\nThe rhetorical question mark or percontation point (see Irony punctuation) was invented by Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used at the end of a rhetorical question; however, it became obsolete in the 17th century. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. This character can be represented using .\nBracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example Oh, really(?), in informal contexts such as closed captioning.\nThe question mark can also be used as a meta-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: (?). The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper truth (real meaning).\nIn typography, some other variants and combinations are available: \"\u2047,\" \"\u2048,\" and \"\u2049,\" are usually used for chess annotation symbols; the interrobang, \"\u203d,\" is used to combine the functions of the question mark and the exclamation mark, superposing these two marks.\nUnicode makes available these variants:\nComputing.\nIn computing, the question mark character is represented by ASCII code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point . The full-width (double-byte) equivalent (\uff1f), is located at code-point .\nThe inverted question mark (\u00bf) corresponds to Unicode code-point \nIn shell and scripting languages, the question mark is often utilized as a wildcard character: a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a string. In particular, filename globbing uses \"?\" as a substitute for any one character, as opposed to the asterisk, \"*\", which matches zero or more characters in a string.\nThe question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the International Phonetic Alphabet, such as SAMPA, in place of the glottal stop symbol, , (which resembles \"?\" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point .\nIn computer programming, the symbol \"?\" has a special meaning in many programming languages. \nIn many Web browsers and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target character set. In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark &lt;samp&gt;?&lt;/samp&gt;, inverted question mark &lt;samp&gt;\u00bf&lt;/samp&gt;, or the Unicode replacement character, usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: . This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as Microsoft Office's \"smart quotes\".\nThe generic URL syntax allows for a query string to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, codice_1, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, codice_32, as seen in this URL:\ncodice_33\nHere, a script on the page &lt;samp&gt;search.php&lt;/samp&gt; on the server &lt;samp&gt;www.example.com&lt;/samp&gt; is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs &lt;samp&gt;query=&lt;/samp&gt;testing and &lt;samp&gt;database=&lt;/samp&gt;English.\nGames.\nIn algebraic chess notation, some chess punctuation conventions include: \"?\" denotes a bad move, \"??\" a blunder, \"?!\" a dubious move, and \"!?\" an interesting move.\nIn Scrabble, a question mark indicates a blank tile.\nLinguistics.\nIn most areas of linguistics, but especially in syntax, a question mark in front of a word, phrase or sentence indicates that the form in question is strongly dispreferred, \"questionable\" or \"strange\", but not outright ungrammatical. (The asterisk is used to indicate outright ungrammaticality.)\nOther sources go further and use several symbols (e.g. the question mark and the asterisk plus or the degree symbol ) to indicate gradations or a continuum of acceptability.\nYet others use double question marks to indicate a degree of strangeness between those indicated by a single question mark and that indicated by the combination of question mark and asterisk.\nMathematics and formal logic.\nIn mathematics, \"?\" commonly denotes Minkowski's question mark function.\nIn linear logic, the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.\nWhen placed above the relational symbol in an equation or inequality, a question-mark annotation means that the stated relation is \"questioned\". This can be used to ask whether the relation might be true or to point out the relation's possible invalidity.\nMedicine.\nA question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible diagnosis. It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left lower abdominal pain, a differential diagnosis might include \"?diverticulitis\" (read as \"query diverticulitis\").\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59349", "revid": "50501847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59349", "title": "Quotation marks in English", "text": "Usage of punctuation\nIn English writing, quotation marks or inverted commas, also known informally as quotes, talking marks, speech marks, quote marks, quotemarks or speechmarks, are punctuation marks placed on either side of a word or phrase in order to identify it as a quotation, direct speech or a literal title or name. Quotation marks may be used to indicate that the meaning of the word or phrase they surround should be taken to be different from (or, at least, a modification of) that typically associated with it, and are often used in this way to express irony (for example, in the sentence 'The lunch lady plopped a glob of \"food\" onto my tray.' the quotation marks around the word \"food\" show it is being called that ironically). They are also sometimes used to emphasise a word or phrase, although this is usually considered incorrect. \nQuotation marks are written as a pair of opening and closing marks in either of two styles: single (\u2018...\u2019) or double (\u201c...\u201d). Opening and closing quotation marks may be identical in form (called neutral, vertical, straight, typewriter, or \"dumb\" quotation marks), or may be distinctly left-handed and right-handed (typographic or, colloquially, curly quotation marks); &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Typographic quotation marks are usually used in manuscript and typeset text. Because typewriter and computer keyboards lack keys to directly enter typographic quotation marks, much of typed writing has neutral quotation marks. Some computer software has the feature often called \"smart quotes\" which can, sometimes imperfectly, convert neutral quotation marks to typographic ones.\nThe typographic closing double quotation mark and the neutral double quotation mark are similar to\u00a0\u2013 and sometimes stand in for\u00a0\u2013 the ditto mark and the double prime symbol. Likewise, the typographic opening single quotation mark is sometimes used to represent the \u02bbokina while either the typographic closing single quotation mark or the neutral single quotation mark may represent the prime symbol. Characters with different meanings are typically given different visual appearance in typefaces that recognize these distinctions, and they each have different Unicode code points. Despite being semantically different, the typographic closing single quotation mark and the typographic apostrophe have the same visual appearance and code point (U+2019), as do the neutral single quote and typewriter apostrophe (U+0027). (Despite the different code points, the curved and straight versions are sometimes considered multiple glyphs of the same character.)\nHistory.\nIn the first centuries of typesetting, quotations were distinguished merely by indicating the speaker, and this can still be seen in some editions of the Christian Bible. During the Renaissance, quotations were distinguished by setting in a typeface contrasting with the main body text (often italic type vs roman). Long quotations were also set this way, at full size and full measure.\nQuotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century, and were used copiously by some printers by the seventeenth. In some Baroque and Romantic-period books, they would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation. When this practice was abandoned, the empty margin remained, leaving the modern form of indented block quotation.\nIn Early Modern English, quotation marks were used to denote pithy comments. They were used to quote direct speech as early as the late sixteenth century, and this practice became more common over time.\nUsage.\nQuotations and speech.\nSingle or double quotation marks denote either speech or a quotation. Double quotes are preferred in the United States and Canada. In Australia, double quotes are preferred for indicating speech, except in the government and corporate sectors, where the preference is for single quotes. Single quotes are more usual in the United Kingdom, Ireland and South Africa, though double quotes are also common there, especially in . In New Zealand, both styles are used.\nA publisher's or author's style may take precedence over regional general preferences. The important idea is that the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;'Good morning, Frank,' said Hal.\n\"Good morning, Frank,\" said Hal.&lt;/poem&gt;\nFor speech within speech, the other style is used as inner quotation marks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;'Hal said, \"Good morning, Dave,\"' recalled Frank.\n\"Hal said, 'Good morning, Dave,'\" recalled Frank.&lt;/poem&gt;\nSometimes quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation. In these cases, questions arise about the form (and names) of the quotation marks to be used. The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms, thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIf such a passage is further quoted in another publication, then all of their forms have to be shifted up by one level.\nIn many cases, quotations that span multiple paragraphs are set as block quotations, and thus do not require quotation marks. However, quotation marks are used for multiple-paragraph quotations in some cases, especially in narratives, where the convention in English is to give opening quotation marks to the first and each subsequent paragraph, using closing quotation marks only for the final paragraph of the quotation, as in the following example from \"Pride and Prejudice\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The letter was to this effect:\n\"My dear Lizzy,\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\n\"Yours, etc.\"\nWhen quoted text is interrupted, such as with the phrase \"he said\", a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption, and an opening quotation mark after. Commas are also often used before and after the interruption, more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"Everything\", said Hal, \"is going extremely well.\"\nQuotation marks are not used for indirect speech. This is because indirect speech can be a paraphrase; it is not a direct quote, and in the course of any composition, it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is just giving content, which may be paraphrased, and which could be open to interpretation.\nFor example, if Hal says: \"All systems are functional\", then, in indirect speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Incorrect\": Hal said that \"everything was going extremely well\".\n\"Correct\": Hal said that everything was going extremely well.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIrony.\nAnother common use of quotation marks is to indicate or call attention to ironic, dubious, or non-standard words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nHe shared his \"wisdom\" with me.\nThe lunch lady plopped a glob of \"food\" onto my tray.\nHe complained about too many \"gummint\" regulations.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nQuotes indicating verbal irony, or other special use, are sometimes called scare quotes. They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes, or indicated in speech with a tone change or by replacement with \"supposed[ly]\" or \"so-called\".\nSignalling unusual usage.\nQuotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realises that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Crystals somehow \"know\" which shape to grow into.\nIn addition to conveying a neutral attitude and to call attention to a neologism, or slang, or special terminology (also known as jargon), quoting can also indicate words or phrases that are \"descriptive\" but unusual, colloquial, folksy, startling, humorous, metaphoric, or contain a pun: Dawkins's concept of a meme could be described as an \"evolving idea\".\nPeople also use quotation marks in this way to distance the writer from the terminology in question so as not to be associated with it, for example to indicate that a quoted word is not official terminology, or that a quoted phrase presupposes things that the author does not necessarily agree with; or to indicate special terminology that should be identified for accuracy's sake as someone else's terminology, as when a term (particularly a controversial term) pre-dates the writer or represents the views of someone else, perhaps without judgement (contrast this neutrally distancing quoting to the negative use of scare quotes).\n\"The Chicago Manual of Style\", 17th edition (2017), acknowledges this type of use but, in section 7.57, cautions against its overuse: \"Quotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard (or slang), ironic, or other special sense ... [T]hey imply 'This is not my term,' or 'This is not how the term is usually applied.' Like any such device, scare quotes lose their force and irritate readers if overused.\"\nUse\u2013mention distinction.\nEither quotation marks or italic type can emphasise that an instance of a word refers to the word itself rather than its associated concept.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nCheese is derived from milk. (concept)\n\"Cheese\" is derived from a word in Old English. (word)\nCheese has calcium, protein, and phosphorus. (concept)\n\"Cheese\" has three \"E\"s. (word)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn linguistics.\nPrecise writing about language often uses italics for the word itself and single quotation marks for a gloss, with the two not separated by a comma or other punctuation, and with strictly logical quotation around the gloss\u00a0\u2013 extraneous terminal punctuation \"outside\" the quotation marks \u2013 even in North American publications, which might otherwise prefer them inside:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Latin \"ovis\" 'sheep', \"canis\" 'dog', and \"equus\" 'horse' are nouns.\nTitles of artistic works.\nQuotation marks, rather than italics, are generally used for the titles of shorter works. Whether these are single or double depends on the context; however, many styles, especially for poetry, prefer the use of single quotation marks.\nAs a rule, the title of a whole publication is italicised (or, in typewritten text, underlined), whereas the titles of minor works within or a subset of the larger publication (such as poems, short stories, named chapters, journal papers, newspaper articles, TV show episodes, video game levels, editorial sections of websites, etc.) are written with quotation marks.\nNicknames and false titles.\nQuotation marks can also set off a nickname embedded in an actual name, or a false or ironic title embedded in an actual title; for example, Nat \"King\" Cole, Frank \"Chairman of the Board\" Sinatra, or Simone Rizzo \"Sam the Plumber\" DeCavalcante.\nNonstandard usage.\nQuotes are sometimes used for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics, most commonly on signs or placards. This usage can be confused with ironic or altered-usage quotation, sometimes with unintended humor. For example, \"For sale: \"fresh\" fish, \"fresh\" oysters\", could be construed to imply that \"fresh\" is not used with its everyday meaning, or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh. As another example, \"Cashiers' desks open until noon for your \"convenience\"\" could be interpreted to mean that the convenience was for the bank employees, not the customers.\nOrder of punctuation.\nWith regard to quotation marks adjacent to periods and commas, there are two styles of punctuation in widespread use. These two styles are most commonly referred to as \"American\" and \"British\", or sometimes \"typesetters' quotation\" and \"logical quotation\". Both systems have the same rules regarding question marks, exclamation points, colons, and semicolons. However, they differ in the treatment of periods and commas.\nIn all major forms of English, question marks, exclamation marks, semicolons, and any other punctuation (with the possible exceptions of periods and commas, as explained in the sections below) are placed inside or outside the closing quotation mark depending on whether they are part of the quoted material.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nDid he say, \"Good morning, Dave\"?\nNo, he said, \"Where are you, Dave?\"\nThere are three major definitions of the word \"gender\": vernacular, sociological, and linguistic.\nType \"C:\" at the DOS prompt to switch from a floppy disk to a hard drive.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA convention is the use of square brackets to indicate content between the quotation marks that has been modified from, or was not present in, the original material.\nBritish style.\nThe prevailing style in the United Kingdom\u00a0\u2013 called \"British style\", \"logical quotation\", and \"logical punctuation\"\u00a0\u2013 is to include within quotation marks only those punctuation marks that appeared in the \"original\" quoted material and in which the punctuation mark fits with the sense of the quotation, but otherwise to place punctuation outside the closing quotation marks. Fowler's \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" provides an early example of the rule: \"All signs of punctuation used with words in quotation marks must be placed \"according to the sense\".\"\nWhen dealing with words-as-words, short-form works and sentence fragments, this style places periods and commas outside the quotation marks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Carefree\", in general, means \"free from care or anxiety\".\nThe title of the song was \"Gloria\", which many already knew.\nShe said she felt \"free from care and anxiety\".\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWhen dealing with direct speech, according to the British style guide \"Butcher's Copy-editing\", if a quotation is broken by words of the main sentence, and then resumed, the punctuation before the break should follow the closing quote unless it forms part of the quotation. An exception may be made when writing fiction, where the first comma may be placed before the first closing quote. In non-fiction, some British publishers may permit placing punctuation that is not part of the person's speech inside the quotation marks but prefer that it be placed outside. Periods and commas that are part of the person's speech are permitted inside the quotation marks regardless of whether the material is fiction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\"Today,\" said Cinderella, \"I feel free from care and anxiety.\" (fiction)\n\"Today\", said the Prime Minister, \"I feel free from care and anxiety.\" (preferred in non-fiction)\n\"Today I feel happy,\" said the woman, \"carefree, and well.\" (regardless)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Hart's Rules\" and the \"Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors\" call the British style \"new\" quoting. It is also similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch and German). A few US professional societies whose professions frequently employ various non-word characters, such as chemistry and computer programming, use the British form in their style guides (see \"ACS Style Guide\").\nAccording to the \"Jargon File\" from 1983, American hackers (members of a subculture of enthusiastic programmers) switched to what they later discovered to be the British quotation system because placing a period inside a quotation mark can change the meaning of data strings that are meant to be typed character-for-character.\nSome American style guides specific to certain specialties also prefer the British style. For example, the journal \"Language\" of the Linguistic Society of America requires that the closing quotation mark precede the period or comma unless that period or comma is \"a necessary part of the quoted matter\". The websites Wikipedia and Pitchfork use logical punctuation.\nAmerican style.\nIn the United States, the prevailing style is called \"American style\", whereby commas and periods are almost always placed inside closing quotation marks. This is done because it results in closer spacing and what is judged to be a cleaner appearance. The American style is used by most newspapers, publishing houses, and style guides in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada as well.\nWhen dealing with words-as-words, short-form works, and sentence fragments, standard American style places periods and commas inside the quotation marks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Carefree,\" in general, means \"free from care or anxiety.\"\nThe title of the song was \"Gloria,\" which many already knew.\nShe said she felt \"free from care and anxiety.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis style also places periods and commas inside the quotation marks when dealing with direct speech, regardless of whether the work is fiction or non-fiction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Today,\" said Cinderella, \"I feel free from care and anxiety.\" (fiction)\n\"Today,\" said the Prime Minister, \"I feel free from care and anxiety.\" (non-fiction)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nNevertheless, many American style guides explicitly permit periods and commas outside the quotation marks when the presence of the punctuation mark inside the quotation marks leads to ambiguity, such as when describing keyboard input, as in the following example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;In the programming language Pascal, the statement \"codice_1\", including the period, signifies the end of a program.\nThe American style is recommended by the Modern Language Association's \"MLA Style Manual\", the American Psychological Association's \"APA Publication Manual\", the University of Chicago's \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", the American Institute of Physics's \"AIP Style Manual\", the American Medical Association's \"AMA Manual of Style\", the American Political Science Association's \"APSA Style Manual\", the Associated Press' \"The AP Guide to Punctuation\", and the Canadian Public Works' \"The Canadian Style\". This style is also used in some British news and fiction.\nEnding the sentence.\nIn both major styles, regardless of placement, only one end mark (?, !, or .) can end a sentence. Only the period, however, \"may not\" end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the enclosing sentence, except for literal text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Hello, world,\" she said. (both styles)\nShe said, \"Hello, world.\" (both styles)\n\"Hello, world!\" she exclaimed. (both styles)\n\"Is anybody out there?\" she asked into the void. (both styles)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWith narration of direct speech, both styles retain punctuation inside the quotation marks, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by attributive matter, also known as a speech tag or annunciatory clause. Americans tend to apply quotations when signifying doubt of veracity (sarcastically or seriously), to imply another meaning to a word or to imply a cynical take on a paraphrased quotation, without punctuation at all.\nTypographical considerations.\nPrimary quotations versus secondary quotations.\n\"Primary quotations\" are orthographically distinguished from \"secondary quotations\" that may be nested within a primary quotation. British English often uses single quotation marks to identify the outermost text of a primary quotation versus double quotation marks for inner, nested quotations. By contrast, American English typically uses double quotation marks to identify the outermost text of a primary quotation versus single quotation marks for inner, nested quotations.\nBritish usage does vary, with some authoritative sources such as \"The Economist\" and \"The Times\" recommending the same usage as in the US, whereas other authoritative sources, such as \"The King's English\", \"Fowler's\", and \"New Hart's Rules\", recommend single quotation marks. In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use often depends on the individual publication's house style.\nSpacing.\nIn English, when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text, a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol, such as an em dash, requires that there be no space. When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text, a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence, such as a colon or closing punctuation. (These exceptions are ignored by some Asian computer systems that systematically display quotation marks with the included spacing, as this spacing is part of the fixed-width characters.)\nThere is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word, or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word. When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility may suggest that a thin space (codice_2) or larger non-breaking space (codice_3) be inserted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nSo Dave actually said, \"He said, 'Good morning'\u2009\"? (thin-space)\nYes, he did say, \"He said, 'Good morning.'\u00a0\" (non-breaking space)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis is not common practice in mainstream publishing, which will generally use more precise kerning. It is more common in online writing, although using CSS to create the spacing by kerning is more semantically appropriate in Web typography than inserting extraneous spacing characters.\nNon-language-related usage.\nStraight quotation marks (or italicised straight quotation marks) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime, e.g. when signifying feet and inches or arcminutes and arcseconds. For instance, 5\u00a0feet and 6\u00a0inches is often written 5'\u00a06\"; and 40\u00a0degrees, 20\u00a0arcminutes, and 50 arcseconds is written 40\u00b0\u00a020'\u00a050\". When available, however, primes should be used instead (e.g. 5\u2032\u00a06\u2033, and 40\u00b0\u00a020\u2032\u00a050\u2033). Prime and double prime are not present in most code pages, including ASCII and Latin-1, but are present in Unicode, as characters and . The HTML character entity references are and , respectively.\nDouble quotation marks, or pairs of single ones, also represent the ditto mark.\nStraight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters, collectively known as string literals. In some languages (e.g. Pascal) only one type is allowed, in some (e.g. C and its derivatives) both are used with different meanings and in others (e.g. Python) both are used interchangeably. In some languages, if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string, the quotation marks are doubled. For example, to represent the string &lt;samp style=\"padding-left:0.4em; padding-right:0.4em; color:var( --color-subtle, #666666); \" &gt;eat 'hot' dogs&lt;/samp&gt; in Pascal one uses codice_4. Other languages use an escape character, often the backslash, as in codice_5.\nIn the TeX typesetting program, left double quotes are produced by typing two back-ticks () and right double quotes by typing two apostrophes (). This is a continuation of a typewriter tradition of using ticks for opening quotation marks; see .\nTyping quotation marks on a computer keyboard.\nStandard English computer keyboard layouts inherited the single and double straight quotation marks from the typewriter (the single quotation mark also doubling as an apostrophe), and they do not include individual keys for left-handed and right-handed typographic quotation marks. In character encoding terms, these characters are labeled \"unidirectional\". However, most computer text-editing programs provide a \"smart quotes\" feature to automatically convert straight quotation marks into bidirectional punctuation, though sometimes imperfectly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Generally, this smart quote feature is enabled by default, and it can be turned off in an \"options\" or \"preferences\" dialog. Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts. One can skirt these limitations, however, by using the HTML character codes or entities or the other key combinations in the following table. In Windows, AutoHotkey scripts can be used to assign simpler key combinations to opening and closing quotation marks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSmart quotes.\nTo make typographic quotation marks easier to enter, publishing software often automatically converts typewriter quotation marks (and apostrophes) to typographic form during text entry (with or without the user being aware of it). Out-of-the-box behavior on macOS and iOS is to make this conversion. These are known as \"smart quotes\" (). Straight quotation marks are also retronymically called \"dumb quotes\" ().\nThe method for producing smart quotes may be based solely on the character preceding the mark. If it is a space or another of a set of hard-coded characters or if the mark begins a line, the mark will be rendered as an opening quote; if not, it will be rendered as a closing quote or apostrophe. This method can cause errors, especially for contractions that start with an apostrophe or text with nested quotations:\nIn Windows, if it is necessary to follow a space with a closing quotation mark when Smart Quotes is in effect, it is usually sufficient to input the character using the Alt code shown above rather than typing or .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59351", "revid": "37346358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59351", "title": "Semicolon", "text": "Punctuation mark (;)\nThe semicolon ; (or semi-colon) is a symbol commonly used as orthographic punctuation. In the English language, a semicolon is most commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought, such as when restating the preceding idea with a different expression. When a semicolon joins two or more ideas in one sentence, those ideas are then given equal rank. Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate items in a list, particularly when the elements of the list themselves have embedded commas.\nThe semicolon is one of the least understood of the standard marks, and is not frequently used by many English speakers.\nIn the QWERTY keyboard layout, the semicolon resides in the unshifted homerow beneath the little finger of the right hand. It has become widely used in programming languages as a statement separator or terminator.\nHistory.\nIn 1496, the semicolon ; is attested in Pietro Bembo's book \"De Aetna\" printed by Aldo Manuzio. The punctuation also appears in later writings of Bembo. Moreover, it is used in 1507 by Bartolomeo Sanvito, who was close to Manuzio's circle.49\nIn 1561, Manuzio's grandson, also called Aldo Manuzio, explains the semicolon's use with several examples in \"Orthographiae ratio\". In particular, Manuzio motivates the need for punctuation (\"interpung\u014d\") to divide (\"distingu\u014d\") sentences and thereby make them understandable. The comma, semicolon, colon, and period are seen as steps, ascending from low to high; the semicolon thereby being an intermediate value between the comma , and colon :. Here are four examples used in the book to illustrate this:49\n\"Publica, privata; sacra, profana; tua, aliena.\"\nPublic, private; sacred, profane; thine, another's.\n\"Ratio docet, si adversa fortuna sit, nimium dolendum non esse; si secunda, moderate laetandum.\"\nReason teaches, if fortune is adverse, not to complain too much; if favorable, to rejoice in moderation.\n\"Tu, quid divitiae valeant, libenter spectas; quid virtus, non item.\"\nYou, what riches are worth, gladly consider; what virtue (is worth), not so much.\n\"Etsi ea perturbatio est omnium rerum, ut suae quemque fortunae maxime paeniteat; nemoque sit, quin ubivis, quam ibi, ubi est, esse malit: tamen mihi dubium non est, quin hoc tempore bono viro, Romae esse, miserrimum sit.\"\nAlthough it is a universal confusion of affairs(,) such that everyone regrets their own fate above all others; and there is no one, who would not rather anywhere else in the world, than there, where he is, prefer to be: yet I have no doubt, at the present time for an honest man, to be in Rome, is the worst form of misery.\nAround 1580, Henry Denham starts using the semicolon \"with propriety\" for English texts, and more widespread usage picks up in the next decades.52\nAround 1640, in Ben Jonson's book \"The English Grammar\", the character ; is described as \"somewhat a longer breath\" compared to the comma. The aim of the breathing, according to Jonson, is to aid understanding.\nIn 1644, in Richard Hodges' \"The English Primrose\", it is written:\nAt a comma, stop a little;\nAt a semi-colon, somewhat more;\nAt a colon, a little more than the former;\nAt a period, make a full stop;\nIn 1762, in Robert Lowth's \"A Short Introduction to English Grammar\", a parallel is drawn between punctuation marks and rest in music:\nThe Period is a pause in quantity or duration double of the Colon; the Colon is double of the Semicolon; and the Semicolon is double of the Comma. So that they are in the same proportion to one another as the Sembrief, the Minim, the Crotchet, and the Quaver, in Music.\nIn 1798, in Lindley Murray's \"English Grammar\", the semicolon is introduced as follows:\nThe Semicolon is used for dividing a compound sentence into two or more parts, not so closely connected as those which are separated by a comma, nor yet so little dependent on each other, as those which are distinguished by a colon.\nThe semicolon is sometimes used, when the preceding member of the sentence does not of itself give a complete sense, but depends on the following clause; and sometimes when the sense of that member would be complete without the concluding one; as in the following instances.\nNatural languages.\nEnglish.\nAlthough terminal marks (i.e. full stops, exclamation marks, and question marks) indicate the end of a sentence, the comma, semicolon, and colon are normally inside sentences, making them secondary boundary marks. In modern English orthography, the semicolon falls between terminal marks and the comma; its strength is equal to that of the colon.\nThe most common use of the semicolon is to join two independent clauses without using a conjunction such as the word \"and\". Semicolons are followed by a lower case letter, unless that letter would ordinarily be capitalised mid-sentence (e.g., the word \"I\", acronyms/initialisms, or proper nouns). In older English printed texts, colons and semicolons are offset from the preceding word by a non-breaking space, a convention still current in modern continental French texts. Ideally, the space is less wide than the inter-word spaces. Some guides recommend separation by a hair space. Modern style guides recommend no space before them and one space after. They also typically recommend placing semicolons outside ending quotation marks, although this was not always the case. For example, the first edition of \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" (1906) recommended placing the semicolon inside ending quotation marks.\nUses of the semicolon in English include:\nIn a list or sequence, if even one item needs its own internal comma, use of the semicolon as the separator throughout that list is justified, as shown by this example from the California Penal Code:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A crime or public offense is an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it, and to which is annexed, upon conviction, either of the following punishments:\nArabic.\nIn Arabic, the semicolon is called \"fasila manq\u016bta\" () which means literally \"a dotted comma\", and is written inverted \u061b. In Arabic, the semicolon has several uses:\nGreek and Church Slavonic.\nIn Greek and Church Slavonic, the Greek question mark (\u037e) looks exactly like a Latin semicolon. To indicate a long pause or to separate sections that already contain commas (the semicolon's purposes in English), Greek uses, but extremely rarely, the 'upper dot' (), \u0387, which looks very similar to the Latin interpunct.\nFor example:\nFrench.\nIn French, a semicolon (\"point-virgule\", literally \"dot-comma\") is a separation between two full sentences, used where neither a colon nor a comma would be appropriate. The phrase following a semicolon has to be an independent clause, related to the previous one but not explaining it. (When the second clause explains the first one, French consistently uses a colon.)\nThe dash character is used in French writing too, but not as widely as the semicolon. Usage of these devices (semicolon and dash) varies from author to author.\nLiterature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJust as there are writers who worship the semicolon, there are other high stylists who dismiss it \u2014 who label it, if you please, middle-class.\n Lynne Truss, \"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\"\nSome authors have avoided and rejected the use of the semicolon throughout their works. Lynne Truss stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Samuel Beckett spliced his way merrily through such novels as \"Molloy\" and \"Malone Dies\", thumbing his nose at the semicolon all the way. James Joyce preferred the colon, as he thought it was more authentically classical. P. G. Wodehouse did an effortlessly marvelous job without it, George Orwell tried to avoid the semicolon completely in \"Coming Up for Air\" (1939), Martin Amis included just one semicolon in \"Money\" (1984), and Umberto Eco was congratulated by an academic reader for using zero semicolons in \"The Name of the Rose\" (1983).\nIn response to Truss, Ben Macintyre, a columnist in \"The Times\", wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Americans have long regarded the semi-colon with suspicion, as a genteel, self-conscious, neither-one-thing-nor-the other sort of punctuation mark, with neither the butchness of a full colon nor the flighty promiscuity of the comma. Hemingway, Chandler, and Stephen King wouldn't be seen dead in a ditch with a semi-colon (though Truman Capote might). Real men, goes the unwritten rule of American punctuation, don't use semi-colons.\nSemicolon use in British fiction has declined by 25% from 1991 to 2021.\nCharacter encoding.\nIn Unicode, the semicolon is encoded at which is the same value it also had in ASCII and ISO 8859-1.\nUnicode contains encoding for several other semicolon or semicolon-like characters:\nComputing.\nProgramming.\nIn computer programming, the semicolon is often used to separate multiple statements (for example, in Perl, Pascal, and SQL; see Pascal: Semicolons as statement separators). In other languages, semicolons are called \"terminator\"s and are required after every statement (such as in PL/I, Java, and the C family). Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s. An influential and frequently cited study in this debate was , which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator: \"The most important [result] was that having a semicolon as a statement terminator was better than having a semicolon as a statement separator.\" The study has been criticized as flawed by proponents of semicolon as a separator, due to participants being familiar with a semicolon-as-terminator language and unrealistically strict grammar. Nevertheless, the debate ended in favor of semicolon as terminator. Therefore, semicolon provides structure to the programming language.\nSemicolons are optional in a number of languages, including BCPL, Python, R, Eiffel, and Go, meaning that they are part of the formal grammar for the language but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g., by end of line that ends a statement, as in Go and R). As languages can be designed without them, semicolons are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some.\nThe use of semicolons in control-flow structures and blocks of code is varied\u00a0\u2013 semicolons are generally omitted after a closing brace, but included for a single statement branch of a control structure (the \"then\" clause), except in Pascal, where a semicolon terminates the entire if-then-else clause (to avoid dangling else) and thus is not allowed between a \"then\" and the corresponding \"else\", as this causes unnesting.\nThis use originates with ALGOL 60 and falls between the comma ,\u00a0\u2013 used as a list separator\u00a0\u2013 and the period/full stop .\u00a0\u2013 used to mark the end of the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the comma operator that separates expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period as the end of the program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in Erlang (1986), where commas separate expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.\nIn some cases the distinction between a separator and a terminator is strong, such as early versions of Pascal, where a final semicolon yields a syntax error. In other cases a final semicolon is treated either as optional syntax or as being followed by a null statement, which is either ignored or treated as a NOP (no operation or null command); compare trailing commas in lists. In some cases a blank statement is allowed, allowing a sequence of semicolons or the use of a semicolon by itself as the body of a control-flow structure. For example, a blank statement (a semicolon by itself) stands for a NOP in C/C++, which is useful in busy waiting synchronization loops.\nAPL uses semicolons to separate declarations of local variables61 and to separate axes when indexing multidimensional arrays, for example, codice_1.\nOther languages (for instance, some assembly languages and LISP dialects, CONFIG.SYS and INI files) use semicolons to mark the beginning of comments.\nConventionally, in many languages, each statement is written on a separate line, but this is not typically a requirement of the language. In the above examples, two statements are placed on the same line; this is legal, because the semicolon separates the two statements. Thus programming languages like Java, the C family, JavaScript etc. use semicolons to obtain a proper structure in the respective languages.\nData.\nThe semicolon is often used to separate elements of a string of text. For example, multiple e-mail addresses in the \"To\" field in some e-mail clients have to be delimited by a semicolon.\nIn Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet applications, the semicolon is used as a list separator, especially in cases where the decimal separator is a comma, such as codice_2, instead of codice_3. It's also used as an function argument separator, when localization using comma as the decimal separator is used; for example: codice_4 in the Czech localization of Excel is equivalent of codice_5 in the US English variant.\nIn Lua, semicolons or commas can be used to separate table elements.\nIn MATLAB and GNU Octave, the semicolon can be used as a row separator when defining a vector or matrix (whereas a comma separates the columns within a row of a vector or matrix) or to execute a command silently, without displaying the resulting output value in the console.\nIn HTML, a semicolon is used to terminate a character entity reference, either named or numeric. The declarations of a style attribute in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are separated and terminated with semicolons.\nThe file system of RSX-11 and OpenVMS, Files-11, uses semicolons to indicate a file's version number. The semicolon is permitted in long filenames in the Microsoft Windows file systems NTFS and VFAT, but not in its short names.\nIn some delimiter-separated values file formats, the semicolon is used as the separator character, as an alternative to comma-separated values.\nMathematics.\nIn mathematical derivations, a semicolon is used to separate expressions in a sequence, similar to its use in spoken English, and may be considered either punctuation for the mathematical expressions, or as punctuation for the words spoken when reading the expressions. For example, completing the square:\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nformula_4\nIn the argument list of a mathematical function formula_5 a semicolon may be used to separate variables from fixed parameters.\nIn differential geometry and tensor analysis, a semicolon preceding an index is used to indicate the covariant derivative of a function with respect to the coordinate associated with that index.\nIn the calculus of relations, the semicolon is used in infix notation for the composition of relations: formula_6\nIn piecewise functions, a semicolon or comma may follow the subfunction or subdomain; the formula_7 or formula_8 can be omitted, in which case it seems replaced by the semicolon or comma.\nThe ; \"Humphrey point\" is sometimes used as the \"decimal point\" in duodecimal numbers: 54;612 equals 64.510.\nOther uses.\nThe semicolon is commonly used as part of emoticons in order to indicate winking or crying, as in codice_6 and codice_7.\nProject Semicolon is the name of an anti-suicide initiative (since the semicolon continues a sentence rather than ending it) which has led to the punctuation mark becoming a highly symbolic and popular tattoo (most commonly done on the wrist). While some consider this to be faith-based, the movement is in general faith-neutral and inclusive of all people.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "59352", "revid": "49679309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59352", "title": "Slash (punctuation)", "text": "Slanting line punctuation mark (/)\nThe slash is a slanting line punctuation mark /. It is also known as a stroke, a solidus, a forward slash and several other historical or technical names. Once used as the equivalent of the modern period and comma, the slash is now used to represent division and fractions, as a date separator, in between multiple alternative or related terms, and to indicate abbreviation.\nHistory.\nSlashes may be found in early writing as a variant form of dashes, vertical strokes, etc. The present use of a slash distinguished from such other marks derives from the medieval European virgule (, which was used as a full stop (also known as a period), scratch comma, and caesura mark. (The first sense was eventually lost to the low dot and the other two developed separately into the comma , and caesura mark ||) Its use as a comma became especially widespread in France, where it was also used to mark the continuation of a word onto the next line of a page, a sense later taken on by the hyphen -. The Fraktur script used throughout Central Europe in the early modern period used a single slash as a scratch comma and a double slash // as a dash. The double slash developed into the double oblique hyphen \u2e17 and double hyphen \u2e40 before being usually simplified into various single dashes.\nIn the 18th century, the mark was generally known in English as the \"oblique\". but particularly the less vertical fraction slash. The variant \"oblique stroke\" was increasingly shortened to \"stroke\", which became the common British name for the character, although printers and publishing professionals often instead referred to it as an \"oblique\". In the 19th and early 20th century, it was also widely known as the \"shilling mark\" or \"solidus\", from its use as a notation or abbreviation for the shilling. The name \"slash\" is a recent development, not appearing in Webster's Dictionary until the Third Edition (1961) but has gained wide currency through its use in computing, a context where it is sometimes used in British English in preference to \"stroke\". Clarifying terms such as \"forward slash\" were coined because MS-DOS and Windows use the backslash extensively.\nUsage.\nDisjunction and conjunction.\nConnecting alternatives.\nThe slash is commonly used in many languages as a shorter substitute for the conjunction \"or\", typically with the sense of exclusive or (e.g., Y/N permits yes or no but not both). Its use in this sense is somewhat informal, although it is used in philology to note variants (e.g., \"virgula/uirgula\") and etymologies (e.g., F. /LL. /L. /PIE. ).\nSuch slashes may be used to avoid taking a position in naming disputes. One example is the Assyrian naming dispute, which prompted the US and Swedish censuses to use the respective official designations \"Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac\" and \"Assyrier/Syrianer\" for the ethnic group.\nIn particular, since the late 20th century, the slash is used to permit more gender-neutral language in place of the traditional masculine or plural gender neutrals. In the case of English, this is usually restricted to degendered pronouns such as \"he/she\" or \"s/he\". Most other Indo-European languages include more far-reaching use of grammatical gender. In these, the separate gendered desinences (grammatical suffices) of the words may be given divided by slashes or set off with parentheses. For example, in Spanish, is a son and a is a daughter; some proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of , or when writing for a general audience or addressing a listener of unknown gender. Less commonly, at sign \u27e8@\u27e9 is used instead: . Similarly, in German and some Scandinavian and Baltic languages, refers to any secretary and to an explicitly female secretary; some advocates of gender neutrality support forms such as for general use. This does not always work smoothly, however: problems arise in the case of words like ('doctor') where the explicitly female form is umlauted and words like ('Chinese person') where the explicitly female form loses the terminal \"-e\". \nAlthough not as common as brackets, slashes can also be used for words the author do not know is plural or singular such as \"child/ren\", \"is/are\", \"book/s\", \"answer/s\" or \"fix/es\".\nConnecting non-contrasting items.\nThe slash is also used as a shorter substitute for the conjunction \"and\" or inclusive or (i.e., A or B or both), typically in situations where it fills the role of a hyphen or en dash. For example, the \"Hemingway/Faulkner generation\" might be used to discuss the era of the Lost Generation inclusive of the people around and affected by both Hemingway and Faulkner. This use is sometimes proscribed, as by \"New Hart's Rules\", the style guide for the Oxford University Press.\nPresenting routes.\nThe slash, as a form of inclusive or, is also used to punctuate the stages of a route (e.g., Shanghai/Nanjing/Wuhan/Chongqing as stops on a tour of the Yangtze).\nIntroducing topic shifts.\nThe word \"slash\" is also developing as a way to introduce topic shifts or follow-up statements. \"Slash\" can introduce a follow-up statement, such as, \"I really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street. Slash can we go there tomorrow?\" It can also indicate a shift to an unrelated topic, as in \"JUST SAW ALEX! Slash I just chubbed on oatmeal raisin cookies at north quad and i miss you.\" The new usage of \"slash\" appears most frequently in spoken conversation, though it can also appear in writing.\nIn speech.\nSometimes the word \"slash\" is used in speech as a conjunction to represent the written role of the character (as if a written slash were being read aloud from text), e.g. \"bee slash mosquito protection\" for a beekeeper's net hood, and \"There's a little bit of nectar slash honey over here, but really it's not a lot.\" (said by a beekeeper examining in a beehive), and \"\"Gastornis\" slash \"Diatryma\"\" for two supposed genera of prehistoric birds which are now thought to be one genus.\nMathematics.\nFractions.\nThe slash is used between two numbers to indicate a fraction or ratio. Such formatting developed as a way to write the horizontal fraction bar on a single line of text. It is first attested in England and Mexico in the 18th century. This notation is known as an online, solidus, or shilling fraction. Nowadays fractions, unlike inline division, are often given using smaller numbers, superscript, and subscript (e.g., 23/43). This notation is responsible for the current form of the percent %, permille \u2030, and permyriad \u2031 signs, developed from the horizontal form which represented an early modern corruption of an Italian abbreviation of \"per cento\".\nThis notation can also be used when the concept of fractions is extended from numbers to arbitrary rings by the method of localization of a ring.\nDivision.\nThe division slash \u2215 is used between two numbers to indicate division. This use developed from the fraction slash in the late 18th or early 19th century. The formatting was advocated by De Morgan in the mid-19th century., who wrote:\nThe occurrence of fractions, such as , , in the verbal part of mathematical works is a source of considerable loss of room, and creates an inelegant and even confused appearance in the printed page. It is very desirable, in every point of view, except the strictly mathematical one, that some method of representation should be adopted which does not require a larger space than is usual between two successive lines. At the same time, it is by no means of very great importance that the verbal part should entirely coincide with the mathematical part in notation, so long as the latter remains to preserve the usual conventions. The symbol \u00f7 has been disused for a sufficient reason, namely, the number of times which the pen must be taken off to form it. This has been, and we imagine always will be, the cause either of abandonment or abbreviation. The question is, whether a new and easy notation could not be substituted; and it is desirable that it should be derived from analogy, such as (accidentally, we believe) does exist in &gt;, =, and &lt;. If we look at \u00d7 and +, and observe that the first is made by turning the second through half a right angle, denoting multiplication, which is primarily an extension of addition in like manner as division is an extension of subtraction, we may thus invent the symbol / or \\ to denote division, which is also the symbol of subtraction turned through half a right angle. If a/b were used to denote a divided by b, and (a+b)/(c+d) to denote a + b divided by c + d, all necessity for increased spacing would be avoided; but this alteration should not be introduced into completely mathematical expressions, though it would be convenient in particular cases.\nQuotient of set.\nA \"quotient of a set\" is informally a new set obtained by identifying some elements of the original set. This is denoted as a fraction formula_1 (sometimes even as a built fraction), where the numerator formula_2 is the original set (often equipped with some algebraic structure). What is appropriate as denominator depends on the context.\nIn the most general case, the denominator is an equivalence relation formula_3 on the original set formula_2, and elements are to be identified in the quotient formula_5 if they are equivalent according to formula_3; this is technically achieved by making formula_5 the set of all equivalence classes of formula_3.\nIn group theory, the slash is used to mark quotient groups. The general form is formula_9, where formula_10 is the original group and formula_11 is the normal subgroup; this is read \"formula_10 mod formula_11\", where \"mod\" is short for \"modulo\". Formally this is a special case of quotient by an equivalence relation, where formula_14 iff formula_15 for some formula_16. Since many algebraic structures (rings, vector spaces, etc.) in particular are groups, the same style of quotients extend also to these, although the denominator may need to satisfy additional closure properties for the quotient to preserve the full algebraic structure of the original (e.g. for the quotient of a ring to be a ring, the denominator must be an ideal).\nWhen the original set is the set of integers formula_17, the denominator may alternatively be just an integer: formula_18. This is an alternative notation for the set formula_19 of integers modulo \"n\" (needed because formula_19 is also notation for the very different ring of \"n\"-adic integers). formula_18 is an abbreviation of formula_22 or formula_23, which both are ways of writing the set in question as a quotient of groups.\nCombining slash.\nSlashes may also be used as a combining character in mathematical formulae. The most important use of this is that combining a slash with a relation negates it, producing e.g. 'not equal' formula_24 as negation of formula_25 or 'not in' formula_26 as negation of formula_27; these slashed relation symbols are always implicitly defined in terms of the non-slashed base symbol. The graphical form of the negation slash is mostly the same as for a division slash, except in some cases where that would look odd; the negation formula_28 of formula_29 (divides) and negation formula_30 of formula_3 (various meanings) customarily both have their negations slashes less steep and in particular shorter than the usual one.\nThe Feynman slash notation is an unrelated use of combining slashes, mostly seen in quantum field theory. This kind of combining slash takes a vector base symbol and converts it to a matrix quantity. Technically this notation is a shorthand for contracting the vector with the Dirac gamma matrices, so formula_32; what one gains is not only a more compact formula, but also not having to allocate a letter as the contracted index.\nComputing.\nThe slash, sometimes distinguished as \"forward slash\", is used in computing in a number of ways, primarily as a separator among levels in a given hierarchy, for example in the path of a filesystem.\nFile paths.\nThe slash is used as the path component separator in many computer operating systems (e.g., Unix's pictures/image.png). In Unix and Unix-like systems, such as macOS and Linux, the slash is also used for the volume root directory (e.g., the initial slash in /usr/john/pictures). Confusion of the slash with the backslash \u27e8\\\u27e9 largely arises from the use of the latter as the path component separator in the widely used MS-DOS and Windows systems.\nNetworking.\nThe slash is used in a similar fashion in internet URLs (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)). Often this portion of such URLs corresponds with files on a Unix server with the same name, and this is where this convention for internet URLs comes from.\nThe slash in an IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.0/29) indicates the prefix size in CIDR notation. The number of addresses of a subnet may be calculated as 2address size \u2212 prefix size, in which the address size is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4. For example, in IPv4, the prefix size/29 gives: 232\u201329 = 23 = 8 addresses.\nProgramming.\nThe slash is used as a division operator in most programming languages while APL uses it for reduction (fold) and compression (filter). The double slash is used by Rexx as a modulo operator, and Python (starting in version 2.2) uses a double slash for division which rounds (using floor) to an integer. In Raku the double slash is used as a \"defined-or\" alternative to ||. A dot and slash \u27e8./\u27e9 is used in MATLAB and GNU Octave to indicate an element-by-element division of matrices.\nComments that begin with /* (a slash and an asterisk) and end with */ were introduced in PL/I and subsequently adopted by SAS, C, Rexx, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and C#. A double slash // is also used by C99, C++, C#, PHP, Java, Swift, Pascal and JavaScript to start a single line comment.\nIn SGML and derived languages such as HTML and XML, a slash is used in closing tags. For example, in HTML, &lt;b&gt; begins a section of bold text and &lt;/b&gt; closes it. In XHTML, slashes are also necessary for \"self-closing\" elements such as the newline command where HTML has simply .\nIn a style originating in the Digital Equipment Corporation line of operating systems (OS/8, RT-11, TOPS-10, et cetera), Windows, DOS, some CP/M programs, OpenVMS, and OS/2 all use the slash to indicate command-line options. For example, the command dir/w is understood as using the command dir (\"directory\") with the \"wide\" option. No space is required between the command and the switch; this was the reason for the choice to use backslashes as the path separator since one would otherwise be unable to run a program in a different directory.\nSlashes are used as the standard delimiters for regular expressions, although other characters can be used instead.\nIBM JCL uses a double slash to start each line in a batch job stream except for /* and /&amp;.\nPrograms.\nIRC and many in-game chat clients use the slash to mark commands, such as joining and leaving a chat room or sending private messages. For example, in IRC, /join #services is a command to join the channel \"services\" and /me is a command to format the following message as though it were an action instead of a spoken message. In \"Minecraft\"'s chat function, the slash is used for executing console and plugin commands. In \"Second Life\"'s chat function, the slash is used to select the \"communications channel\", allowing users to direct commands to virtual objects \"listening\" on different channels. For example, if a virtual house's lights were set to use channel 42, the command \"/42 on\" would turn them on. In Discord, slash commands are used to send special messages and execute commands, like sending a shrug emoji (\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) or a table flip emoji ((\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b), or changing one's nickname using \"/nick\". Slash commands can also be used to use Discord bots.\nThe Gedcom standard for exchanging computerized genealogical data uses slashes to delimit surnames; an example would be Bill /Smith/ Jr. Slashes around surnames are also used in Personal Ancestral File.\nElectronics.\nA leading slash is one of several common conventions for indicating an active-low digital signal, which performs the named function when at a low voltage level. For example, dynamic random-access memory has active-low Chip Select, Row Address Strobe and Column Address Strobe signals, commonly written /CS, /RAS, and /CAS. This extends to signals which select between two options, such as \"R/W\", which indicates that the function is \"read\" when high and \"write\" when low. (Sometimes written as for greater clarity.\nCurrency.\nThe slash (as the \"shilling mark\" or \"solidus\") was an abbreviation for the shilling, a former coin of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Before the decimalisation of currency in Britain, its currency abbreviations (collectively \u00a3sd) represented their Latin names, derived from a medieval French modification of the late Roman libra, solidus, and denarius. Thus, one penny less than two pounds was written \u00a31 19s 11d or \u00a31 19\u017f 11d. During the period when English orthography included the long s, \u017f or \"\", (abbreviating \"shilling\") the \u017f came to be written as a single slash. The d. might be omitted, and \"2\u017f6\" (\"two shillings and sixpence\") became simplified as 2/6. Amounts in full pounds, shillings and pence could be written in many different ways, for example: \u00a31 9s 6d, \u00a31.9.6, \u00a31-9-6, and even \u00a31/9/6d (with a slash used \"also\" to separate pounds and shillings). The same style was also used under the British Raj and early independent India for the predecimalization rupee/anna/pie system.\nIn five East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and the \"de facto\" country of Somaliland), where the national currencies are denominated in shillings, the decimal separator is a slash mark (e.g., 2/). Where the minor unit is zero, an equals sign is used (e.g., 5/=).\nDates.\nSlashes are a common calendar date separator used across many countries and by some standards such as the Common Log Format used by web servers. Depending on context, it may be in the form Day/Month/Year, Month/Day/Year, or Year/Month/Day. If only two elements are present, they typically denote a day and month in some order. For example, 9/11 is a common American way of writing the date 11 September; Britons write this as 11/9. Owing to the ambiguity across cultures, the practice of using only two elements to denote a date is sometimes proscribed.\nBecause of the world's many varying conventional date and time formats, ISO 8601 advocates the use of a Year-Month-Day system separated by hyphens (e.g., Victory in Europe Day occurred on 1945-05-08). In the ISO 8601 system, slashes represent date ranges: \"1939/1945\" represents what is more commonly written in Anglophone countries as \"1939\u20131945\". The autumn term of a northern-hemisphere school year might be marked \"2010-09-01/12-22\".\nIn English, a range marked by a slash often has a separate meaning from one marked by a dash or hyphen. \"24/25 December\" would mark the time shared by both days (i.e., the night from Christmas Eve to Christmas morning) rather than the time made up by both days together, which would be written \"24\u201325 December\". Similarly, a historical reference to \"1066/67\" might imply an event occurred during the winter of late 1066 and early 1067, whereas a reference to 1066\u201367 would cover the entirety of both years. The usage was particularly common in British English during World War II, where such slash dates were used for night-bombing air raids. It is also used by some police forces in the United States.\nNumbering.\nThe slash is used in numbering to note totals. For example, \"page 17/35\" indicates that the relevant passage is on the 17th page of a 35-page document. Similarly, the marking \"#333/500\" on a product indicates it is the 333rd out of 500 identical products or out of a batch of 500 such products. For scores on schoolwork, in games, and so on, \"85/100\" indicates 85 points were attained out of a possible 100.\nSlashes are also sometimes used to mark ranges in numbers that already include hyphens or dashes. One example is the ISO treatment of dating. Another is the US Air Force's treatment of aircraft serial numbers, which are normally written to note the fiscal year and aircraft number. For example, \"85-1000\" notes the thousandth aircraft ordered in fiscal year 1985. To indicate the next fifty subsequent aircraft, a slash is used in place of a hyphen or dash: \"85-1001/1050\".\nLinguistic transcription.\nA pair of slashes (as \"slants\") are used in the transcription of speech to enclose pronunciations (i.e., phonetic transcriptions). For example, the IPA transcription of the English pronunciation of \"solidus\" is written . Properly, slashes mark broad or phonemic transcriptions, whereas narrow, allophonic transcriptions are enclosed by square brackets. For example, the word \"little\" may be broadly rendered as but a careful transcription of the velarization of the second L would be written .\nIn sociolinguistics, a double or triple slash may also be used in the transcription of a traditional sociolinguistic interview or in other type of linguistic elicitation to represent simultaneous speech, interruptions, and certain types of speech disfluencies.\nSingle and double slashes are often used as typographic substitutes for the click letters \u01c0, \u01c1.\nA diaphonemic transcription may be marked in several ways, e.g. with a pair of slash marks ().\nPoetry.\nThe slash is used in various scansion notations for representing the metrical pattern of a line of verse, typically to indicate a stressed syllable.\nLine breaks.\nThe slash (as a \"virgule\") offset by spaces to either side is used to mark line breaks when transcribing text from a multi-line format into a single-line one. It is particularly common in quoting poetry, song lyrics, and dramatic scripts, formats where omitting the line breaks risks losing meaningful context. For example, here is a part of Hamlet's soliloquy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIf someone wanted to quote the above soliloquy in a prose paragraph, it is standard to mark the line breaks as follows: \"To be, or not to be, that is the question: / Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune, / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, / And by opposing end them...\" Less often, virgules are used in marking paragraph breaks when quoting a prose passage. Some style guides, such as \"New Hart's\", prefer to use a pipe | in place of the slash to mark these line and paragraph breaks.\nThe virgule may be thinner than a standard slash when typeset. In computing contexts, it may be necessary to use a non-breaking space before the virgule to prevent it from being widowed on the next line.\nAbbreviation.\nThe slash has become standard in several abbreviations. Generally, it is used to mark two-letter initialisms such as A/C (short for \"air conditioner\"), w/o (\"without\"), b/w (\"black and white\" or, less often, \"between\"), w/e (\"whatever\" or, less often, \"weekend\" or \"week ending\"), i/o (\"input/output\"), r/w (\"read/write\"), and n/a (\"not applicable\" or, in aviation, \"not authorized\"). Other initialisms employing the slash include w/ (\"with\") and w/r/t (\"with regard to\"). Such slashed abbreviations are somewhat more common in British English and were more common around the Second World War (as with \"S/E\" to mean \"single-engined\"). The abbreviation 24/7 (denoting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) describes a business that is always open or unceasing activity.\nThe slash in derived units such as m/s (meters per second) is not an abbreviation slash, but a straight division. It is however in that position read as 'per' rather than e.g. 'over', which can be seen as analogous to units whose symbols are pure abbreviations such as mph (miles per hour), although in abbreviations 'per' is 'p' or dropped entirely (psi, pounds per square inch) rather than a slash.\nIn the US government, the names of offices within various departments are abbreviated using slashes, starting with the larger office and following with its subdivisions. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation is formally abbreviated FAA/AST.\nProofreading.\nThe slash or vertical bar (as a \"separatrix\") is used in proofreading to mark the end of margin notes or to separate margin notes from one another. The slash is also sometimes used in various proofreading initialisms, such as l/c and u/c for changes to lower and upper case, respectively.\nBusiness correspondence.\nIn formal business correspondence, when a letter is typed by someone other than the person responsible for its contents, it is standard to add a suffix with the initials of the author (in upper-case), and typist (in lower-case) after the signature block, separated by a slash. For example, a letter typed by D.E. at the direction of A.B.C. would include the line \"ABC/de\".\nFiction.\nThe slash is used in fan fiction to mark the romantic pairing a piece will focus upon (e.g., a K/S denoted a \"Star Trek\" story would focus on a sexual relationship between Kirk and Spock), a usage which developed in the 1970s from the earlier friendship pairings marked by ampersands (e.g., K&amp;S). The genre as a whole is now known as slash fiction. Because it is more generally associated with homosexual male relationships, lesbian slash fiction is sometimes distinguished as femslash. In situations where other pairings occur, the genres may be distinguished as m/m, f/f, and so on.\nLibraries.\nThe slash is used under the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules to separate the title of a work from its statement of responsibility (i.e., the listing of its author, director, etc.). Like a line break, this slash is surrounded by a single space on either side. For example:\nThe format is used in both card catalogs and online records.\nAddresses.\nThe slash is sometimes used as an abbreviation for building numbers. For example, in some contexts, 8/A Evergreen Gardens specifies Apartment 8 in Building A of the residential complex Evergreen Gardens. In the United States, however, such an address refers to the first division of Apartment 8 and is simply a variant of Apartment 8A or 8-A. Similarly in the United Kingdom, an address such as 12/2 Anywhere Road means flat (or apartment) 2 in the building numbered 12 on Anywhere Road.\nThe slash is also used in the United States in the postal abbreviation for \"care of.\" For example, Judy Smith c/o Bob Smith could be used when Bob Smith is receiving mail on Judy's behalf. Typically, this would be used in a situation where someone is either out of town, in an institution or hotel, or temporarily staying at another's address.\nIn Spanish address writings, \"c/\" is used as the abbreviation of \"calle\" (or \"carrer\" in Catalan) meaning \"street\".\nMusic.\nSlashes are used in musical notation as an alternative to writing out specific notes where it is easier to read than traditional notation or where the player can improvise. They are commonly used to indicate chords either in place of or in combination with traditional notation, notably in the form of slash chords. For drummers, they find use as an indication to continue with a previously indicated style.\nSports.\nA slash is used to mark a spare (knocking down all ten pins in two throws) when scoring ten-pin and duckpin bowling.\nText messaging.\nIn online messaging, a slash might be used to imitate the formatting of a chat command (e.g., writing \"/fliptable\" as though there were such a command) or the closing tags of languages such as HTML (e.g., writing \"/endrant\" to end a diatribe or \"/s\" to mark the preceding text as sarcastic). A pair of slashes is sometimes used as a way to mark italic text, where no special formatting is available (e.g., /italics/).\nBefore an e-signature.\nIn legal writing, especially in a pleading, attorneys often sign their name with an \"s\" that is either enclosed by two slashes or followed by a single slash and preceding the attorney's name. An example would be the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;/s/ Bob Smith&lt;br&gt;Attorney for Plaintiff\nAs a letter.\nThe Iraqw language of Tanzania uses the slash as a letter, representing the voiced pharyngeal fricative, as in /ameeni, \"woman\".\nSpacing.\nThere are usually no spaces either before or after a slash. According to \"\", a slash is usually written without spacing on either side when it connects single words, letters or symbols. Exceptions are in representing the start of a new line when quoting verse, or a new paragraph when quoting prose. \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" also allows spaces when either of the separated items is a compound that itself includes a space: \"Our New Zealand / Western Australia trip\". (Compare use of an en dash used to separate such compounds.) \"The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing\" prescribes: \"No space before or after an oblique when used between individual words, letters or symbols; one space before and after the oblique when used between longer groups which contain internal spacing\", giving the examples \"n/a\" and \"Language and Society / \"Langue et soci\u00e9t\u00e9\"\".\nAccording to \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", when typesetting a URL or computer path, line breaks should occur before a slash but not in the text between two slashes.\nUnicode.\nAs a very common character, the slash (as \"slant\") was originally encoded in ASCII with the decimal code 47 or 0x2F. The same value was used in Unicode, which calls it \"solidus\" and also adds some more characters:\nFRACTION SLASH is supposed to reformat the preceding and succeeding digits as numerator and denominator glyphs (e.g., display of \"1, FRACTION SLASH, 2\" as \"\u00bd\", and similarly \"123, FRACTION SLASH, 456\" as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;123\u2044456). This is supported by an increasing number of environments and computer fonts. Because support is not yet universal (this browser, for instance, renders \"123\u2044456\"), some authors still use Unicode subscripts and superscripts to compose fractions, and many computer fonts design these characters for this purpose. In addition, precomposed fractions of the multiples less than 1 of 1/n for 2 \u2264 n \u2264 6 and n = 8 (e.g. \u2154 and \u215d, as well as \u2150, \u2151, and \u2152, are found in the Unicode Number Forms or Latin-1 Supplement blocks.\nAlternative names.\nThe slash may also be read out as \"and\", \"or\", \"and/or\", \"to\", or \"cum\" in some compounds separated by a slash; \"over\" or \"out of\" in fractions, division, and numbering; and \"per\" or \"a(n)\" in derived units (as km/h) and prices (as $~/kg), where the division slash stands for \"each\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungus in the plant's rhizosphere, the plant root system and its surroundings. Mycorrhizae play important roles in plant nutrition, soil biology, and soil chemistry.\nIn a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. The association is normally mutualistic. In particular species, or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may have a parasitic association with host plants.\nDefinition.\nA mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a green plant and a fungus. The plant makes organic molecules by photosynthesis and supplies them to the fungus in the form of sugars or lipids, while the fungus supplies the plant with water and mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or zinc, taken from the soil. Mycorrhizas are located in the roots of vascular plants, but mycorrhiza-like associations also occur in bryophytes and there is fossil evidence that early land plants that lacked roots formed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Most plant species form mycorrhizal associations, though some families like Brassicaceae and Chenopodiaceae cannot. Different forms for the association are detailed in the next section. The most common is the arbuscular type that is present in 70% of plant species, including many crop plants such as cereals and legumes.\nEvolution.\nEmergence alongside terrestrial plants.\nFossil and genetic evidence indicate that mycorrhizae emerged as early as 450-500 million years ago, potentially between fungus-like protists and algae. Arbuscular mycorrhizal relationships appeared earliest, coinciding with the terrestrialization of plants. Genetic evidence indicates that all land plants share a single common ancestor, which appears to have quickly adopted mycorrhizal symbiosis, and research suggests that proto-mycorrhizal fungi were a key factor enabling plant terrestrialization. There is a strong consensus among paleomycologists that mycorrhizal fungi served as a primitive root system for early terrestrial plants. This is because, prior to plant colonization of land, soils were nutrient sparse and plants had yet to develop root systems. Without complex root systems, early terrestrial plants would have been incapable of absorbing recalcitrant ions from mineral substrates, such as phosphate, a key nutrient for plant growth.\nFossil record and genomic analysis.\nFossils of Glomeromycotan spores and hyphae date to 460 million years ago, but the fossils were not associated with plants. The earliest terrestrial communities were similar to modern biocrusts. Lichen-like associations between fungi and cyanobacteria were an important part of these communities. The first land plants were similar to mosses, with simple vascular systems and no leaves or roots.\nThe earliest direct fossil evidence of early mycorrhizal symbiosis is found in the 407 million year old Rhynie chert, which contains an assemblage of \"exceptionally preserved\" fossil plants colonized by multiple para-mycorrhizal fungi. The Rhynie chert fossils show Glomeromycotan and Mucoromycotan fungi engaged in mycorrhiza-like associations with cells of the plants \"Aglaophyton major\" and \"Horneophyton lignieri\". The fossils suggest a mutualistic association between the plants and the colonizing fungi, because distinctive nutrient exchange structures (arbuscules and hyphal coils, in Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina respectively) are preserved and the colonized cells appear to have been alive at the time of infection by the fungus.\nThese early associations are referred to as mycorrhiza-like or para-mycorrhizal because mycorrhiza are defined by the fungal colonization of plant roots, and early plants did not have any roots. The earliest fossils of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in plant roots originate from 315-303 million years ago, and show fungi belonging to Glomeromycotina in the root systems of a giant lycophyte, Lepidodendron, and an early relative of the conifers, Cordaites. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were found in 240 million year old fossils of \"Antarcticycas schopfii\".\nEctomycorrhizae developed substantially later, during the Jurassic period, while most other modern forms of mycorrhizal symbiosis, including orchid and ericoid mycorrhizae, date to the period of angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous period. Ectomycorrhizae appear in the fossil record 48.7 million years ago, in the Eocene, with a fossil of ectomycorrhizal fungi colonizing \"Pinus\" roots. However, it is believed that the first ectomycorrhizal relationships evolved in the stem group Pinaceae around the radiation of the Pinaceae crown group in the mid Jurassic, 175 million or so years ago.\nFossils preservation of Ericoid mycorrhizae and orchid mycorrhizae is lacking. Calibrated molecular phylogeny is used to estimate when these mycorrhizal types originated. The origins of orchid mycorrhizae are unclear, though orchids themselves are thought to have originated in the Cretaceous period. Ericoid mycorrhizae are estimated to have the most recent evolutionary origins of mycorrhizal types, evolving around 118 million years ago from free-living saprotrophic ancestors. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi evolved from multiple lineages of fungi, primarily ascomycetes from the Leotiomycetes, as well as basidiomycetes from the family Serendipitaceae.\nOrigins in plants.\nIn plants, the genes for forming mycorrhizal symbiosis are highly conserved and originate from a common ancestor, meaning that the ability to form mycorrhizae is ancestral to all land plants. Non-mycorrhizal plant lineages, such as the Brassicaceae, lost the ability to form mycorrhizae at some point in their evolution. The earliest mycorrhizae were arbuscular mycorrhizae, and other forms, such as ectomycorrhizae and orchid mycorrhizae, evolved when plant hosts switched from symbiosis with Glomeromycotina to symbiosis with different fungal lineages.\nThere is genetic evidence that the symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is derived from mycorrhizal symbiosis. The modern distribution of mycorrhizal fungi appears to reflect an increasing complexity and competition in root morphology associated with the dominance of angiosperms in the Cenozoic Era, characterized by complex ecological dynamics between species.\nOrigins in fungi.\nIn fungi, mycorrhizal symbiosis had multiple independent origins among different lineages of fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form their own monophyletic phylum, whereas other mycorrhizal fungi convergently evolved similar lifestyles.\nArbuscular mycorrhizae.\nThe phylum Glomeromycota, which forms the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, is the oldest mycorrhizal lineage. The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis evolved only once in fungi; all arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi belong to Glomeromycota and share a common ancestor. 244 species have been identified based on differences in the appearance of their spores, but genetic studies suggest that 300-1600 species may exist in Glomeromycota. All members of Glomeromycota are obligate biotrophs, entirely dependent upon their plant hosts for survival. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are considered to be generalists, with minimal host plant specificity. AM symbiosis has been observed in almost every seed plant taxonomic division, or around 67% of species. Arbuscular mycorrhizae take on most angiosperms, some gymnosperms, pteridophytes, and nonvascular plants as plant hosts. Arbuscular mycorrhizae have been observed in the seedling stage of otherwise ectomycorrhizal partners, suggesting that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be able to infect almost any land plant given proper circumstances.\nOther forms of mycorrhizal symbiosis, such as ectomycorrhizae, orchid mycorrhizae, and ericoid mycorrhizae, emerged multiple times in different lineages of fungi through convergent evolution. Unlike arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, some of these fungi are only facultatively symbiotic, and can live by themselves without a plant host under some conditions.\nEctomycorrhizae.\nEctomycorrhizal fungi evolved from free-living saprotrophs, mostly in Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, and some became dependent on plant hosts when they lost genes necessary for decaying lignin and other plant materials. There are 20,000 to 25,000 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, but only 6,000 to 7,000 plant species that form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. In angiosperms, it is believed that ectomycorrhizal partnerships have developed independently at least 18 times, and in fungi, around 80 times. The main evolutionary driver for ectomycorrhizae is switching of nutritional modes from saprotrophs. Phylogenomic analysis of various ectomycorrhizal fungal genomes has confirmed the convergent evolution of ectomycorrhizal fungi from white and brown-rot fungi, as well as from soil saprotrophs. Some lineages of ectomycorrhizae have likely evolved from endophytic ancestors, fungi that live within plants without damaging them. Some ectomycorrhizal fungi have gone through apparent evolutionary reversal back into saprotrophic ecology. This is possible because some lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi retain enzymes for breaking down lignin.\nOrchid mycorrhizae.\nOrchid mycorrhizal fungi, which mostly originate from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are less understood. Some fungi that participate in orchid mycorrhizal symbiosis can also form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with other plants, or live independently of a plant host. Some orchid mycorrhizal fungi can also live as plant pathogens.\nEricoid mycorrhizae.\nEricoid mycorrhizal associations have the most recent origins and the lowest species richness among both plant and fungal partners. This specialization suggests that ericoid mycorrhizal partners evolved in parallel with one another in response to environmental change, rather than through reciprocal species-to-species level selection. Ericoid mycorrhizal relationships are found in extremely nutrient poor soils in the northern and southern hemispheres. These environments of low mineral nutrient availability have led to native plants developing sclerophylly, where plants become high in lignin and low in phosphorus and nitrogen. As a result, decaying plant matter in these areas has an abnormally high carbon to nitrogen ratio, making it resistant to microbial decay. Ericoid mycorrhizae have apparently evolved to conserve minerals in nutrient deficient sclerophyllous litter by directly cycling these nutrients throughout the mycorrhiza system. Ericoid mycorrhizae also retain saprotrophic abilities, allowing them to extract nitrogen and phosphorus from unmineralized organic material, and resist negative outcomes from high concentrations of toxic cations in the acidic soil environment.\nTypes.\nThe mycorrhizal lifestyle has independently convergently evolved multiple times in the history of Earth. There are multiple ways to categorize mycorrhizal symbiosis. The largest division is between \"ectomycorrhizas\" and \"endomycorrhizas\". The two types are differentiated by the fact that the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane.\nSimilar symbiotic relationships.\nSome forms of plant-fungal symbiosis are similar to mycorrhizae, but considered distinct. One example is fungal endophytes. Endophytes are defined as organisms that can live within plant cells without causing harm to the plant. They are distinguishable from mycorrhizal fungi by the absence of nutrient-transferring structures for bringing in nutrients from outside the plant. Some lineages of mycorrhizal fungi may have evolved from endophytes into mycorrhizal fungi, and some fungi can live as mycorrhizae or as endophytes.\nEctomycorrhiza.\nEctomycorrhizae are distinct in that they do not penetrate into plant cells, but instead form a structure called a Hartig net that penetrates between cells. Ectomycorrhizas consist of a hyphal sheath, or mantle, covering the root tip and the Hartig net of hyphae surrounding the plant cells within the root cortex. In some cases the hyphae may also penetrate the plant cells, in which case the mycorrhiza is called an endomycorrhiza. Outside the root, ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium forms an extensive network within the soil and leaf litter. Other forms of mycorrhizae, including arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas, are considered endomycorrhizae.\nEctomycorrhizas, or EcM, are symbiotic associations between the roots of around 10% of plant families, mostly woody plants including the birch, dipterocarp, eucalyptus, oak, pine, and rose families, orchids, and fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota. Ectomycorrhizae associate with relatively few plant species, only about 2% of plant species on Earth, but the species they associate with are mostly trees and woody plants that are highly dominant in their ecosystems, meaning plants in ectomycorrhizal relationships make up a large proportion of plant biomass. Some EcM fungi, such as many \"Leccinum\" and \"Suillus\", are symbiotic with only one particular genus of plant, while other fungi, such as the \"Amanita\", are generalists that form mycorrhizas with many different plants. An individual tree may have 15 or more different fungal EcM partners at one time. While the diversity of plants involved in EcM is low, the diversity of fungi involved in EcM is high. Thousands of ectomycorrhizal fungal species exist, hosted in over 200 genera. A recent study has conservatively estimated global ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness at approximately 7750 species, although, on the basis of estimates of knowns and unknowns in macromycete diversity, a final estimate of ECM species richness would probably be between 20,000 and 25,000. Ectomycorrhizal fungi evolved independently from saprotrophic ancestors many times in the group's history.\nNutrients can be shown to move between different plants through the fungal network. Carbon has been shown to move from paper birch seedlings into adjacent Douglas-fir seedlings, although not conclusively through a common mycorrhizal network, thereby promoting succession in ecosystems. The ectomycorrhizal fungus \"Laccaria bicolor\" has been found to lure and kill springtails to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, Eastern White Pine inoculated with \"L. bicolor\" was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails. When compared with non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.\nThe first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete \"L. bicolor\", was published in 2008. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication. \"L. bicolor\" is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast, \"L. bicolor\" possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. Since then, the genomes of many other ectomycorrhizal fungal species have been sequenced further expanding the study of gene families and evolution in these organisms.\nArbutoid mycorrhiza.\nThis type of mycorrhiza involves plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally and in terms of the fungi involved. It differs from ectomycorrhiza in that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an \"ectendomycorrhiza\".\nArbuscular mycorrhiza.\nArbuscular mycorrhizas, (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas), have hyphae that penetrate plant cells, producing branching, tree-like structures called arbuscules within the plant cells for nutrient exchange. Often, balloon-like storage structures, termed vesicles, are also produced. In this interaction, fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. the interior of the cell), but invaginate the cell membrane, creating a so-called peri-arbuscular membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the host cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are obligate biotrophs, meaning that they depend upon the plant host for both growth and reproduction; they have lost the ability to sustain themselves by decomposing dead plant material. Twenty percent of the photosynthetic products made by the plant host are consumed by the fungi, the transfer of carbon from the terrestrial host plant is then exchanged by equal amounts of phosphate from the fungi to the plant host.\nContrasting with the pattern seen in ectomycorrhizae, the species diversity of AMFs is very low, but the diversity of plant hosts is very high; an estimated 78% of all plant species associate with AMFs. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are formed only by fungi in the division Glomeromycota. Fossil evidence and DNA sequence analysis suggest that this mutualism appeared 400-460 million years ago, when the first plants were colonizing land. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in 85% of all plant families, and occur in many crop species. The hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce the glycoprotein glomalin, which may be one of the major stores of carbon in the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have (possibly) been asexual for many millions of years and, unusually, individuals can contain many genetically different nuclei (a phenomenon called heterokaryosis).\nMucoromycotina fine root endophytes.\nMycorrhizal fungi belonging to Mucoromycotina, known as \"fine root endophytes\" (MFREs), were mistakenly identified as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi until recently. While similar to AMF, MFREs are from subphylum Mucoromycotina instead of Glomeromycotina. Their morphology when colonizing a plant root is very similar to AMF, but they form fine textured hyphae. Effects of MFREs may have been mistakenly attributed to AMFs due to confusion between the two, complicated by the fact that AMFs and MFREs often colonize the same hosts simultaneously. Unlike AMFs, they appear capable of surviving without a host. This group of mycorrhizal fungi is little understood, but appears to prefer wet, acidic soils and forms symbiotic relationships with liverworts, hornworts, lycophytes, and angiosperms.\nEricoid mycorrhiza.\nEricoid mycorrhizae, or ErMs, involve only plants in Ericales and are the most recently evolved of the major mycorrhizal relationships. Plants that form ericoid mycorrhizae are mostly woody understory shrubs; hosts include blueberries, bilberries, cranberries, mountain laurels, rhododendrons, heather, neinei, and giant grass tree. ErMs are most common in boreal forests, but are found in two-thirds of all forests on Earth. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi belong to several different lineages of fungi. Some species can live as endophytes entirely within plant cells even within plants outside the Ericales, or live independently as saprotrophs that decompose dead organic matter. This ability to switch between multiple lifestyle types makes ericoid mycorrhizal fungi very adaptable.\nPlants that participate in these symbioses have specialized roots with no root hairs, which are covered with a layer of epidermal cells that the fungus penetrates into and completely occupies. The fungi have a simple intraradical (growth in cells) phase, consisting of dense coils of hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don't extend very far into the surrounding soil. They might form sporocarps (probably in the form of small cups), but their reproductive biology is poorly understood.\nPlants participating in ericoid mycorrhizal symbioses are found in acidic, nutrient-poor conditions. Whereas AMFs have lost their saprotrophic capabilities, and EcM fungi have significant variation in their ability to produce enzymes needed for a saprotrophic lifestyle, fungi involved in ErMs have fully retained the ability to decompose plant material for sustenance. Some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have actually expanded their repertoire of enzymes for breaking down organic matter. They can extract nitrogen from cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, and chitin. This would increase the benefit they can provide to their plant symbiotic partners.\nOrchid mycorrhiza.\nAll orchids are myco-heterotrophic at some stage during their lifecycle, meaning that they can survive only if they form orchid mycorrhizae. Orchid seeds are so small that they contain no nutrition to sustain the germinating seedling, and instead must gain the energy to grow from their fungal symbiont. The OM relationship is asymmetric; the plant seems to benefit more than the fungus, and some orchids are entirely mycoheterotrophic, lacking chlorophyll for photosynthesis. It is actually unknown whether fully autotrophic orchids that do not receive some of their carbon from fungi exist or not. Like fungi that form ErMs, OM fungi can sometimes live as endophytes or as independent saprotrophs. In the OM symbiosis, hyphae penetrate into the root cells and form pelotons (coils) for nutrient exchange.\nMonotropoid mycorrhiza.\nThis type of mycorrhiza occurs in the subfamily Monotropoideae of the Ericaceae, as well as several genera in the Orchidaceae. These plants are heterotrophic or mixotrophic and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, parasitic type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.\nFunction.\nMycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The Orchidaceae are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.\nRecent research into ectomycorrhizal plants in boreal forests has indicated that mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship that may be more complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. They go on to explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines. It has also been suggested that evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships can explain much more variation in the strength of mycorrhizal mutualisms than ecological factors.\nFormation.\nTo successfully engage in mutualistic symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi and any of the thousands of microbes that colonize plants, plants must discriminate between mutualists and pathogens, allowing the mutualists to colonize while activating an immune response towards the pathogens. Plant genomes code for potentially hundreds of receptors for detecting chemical signals from other organisms. Plants dynamically adjust their symbiotic and immune responses, changing their interactions with their symbionts in response to feedbacks detected by the plant. In plants, the mycorrhizal symbiosis is regulated by the common symbiosis signaling pathway (CSSP), a set of genes involved in initiating and maintaining colonization by endosymbiotic fungi and other endosymbionts such as Rhizobia in legumes. The CSSP has origins predating the colonization of land by plants, demonstrating that the co-evolution of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is over 500 million years old. In arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the presence of strigolactones, a plant hormone, secreted from roots induces fungal spores in the soil to germinate, stimulates their metabolism, growth and branching, and prompts the fungi to release chemical signals the plant can detect. Once the plant and fungus recognize one another as suitable symbionts, the plant activates the common symbiotic signaling pathway, which causes changes in the root tissues that enable the fungus to colonize.\nExperiments with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have identified numerous chemical compounds to be involved in the \"chemical dialog\" that occurs between the prospective symbionts before symbiosis is begun. In plants, almost all plant hormones play a role in initiating or regulating AMF symbiosis, and other chemical compounds are also suspected to have a signaling function. While the signals emitted by the fungi are less understood, it has been shown that chitinaceous molecules known as Myc factors are essential for the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizae. Signals from plants are detected by LysM-containing receptor-like kinases, or LysM-RLKs. AMF genomes also code for potentially hundreds of effector proteins, of which only a few have a proven effect on mycorrhizal symbiosis, but many others likely have a function in communication with plant hosts as well.\nMany factors are involved in the initiation of mycorrhizal symbiosis, but particularly influential is the plant's need for phosphorus. Experiments involving rice plants with a mutation disabling their ability to detect P starvation show that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi detection, recruitment and colonization is prompted when the plant detects that it is starved of phosphorus. Nitrogen starvation also plays a role in initiating AMF symbiosis.\nMechanisms.\nThe mechanisms by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi differs from that of plants. For example, they may secrete organic acids that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.\nSugar-water/mineral exchange.\nThe mycorrhizal mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium's higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant root hairs, and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants' roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.\nUnaided plant roots may be unable to take up nutrients that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus, many plants are able to obtain phosphate without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. \"Inga alley cropping\", an agroforestry technique proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the root system of species of \"Inga\" to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.\nIn some more complex relationships, mycorrhizal fungi do not just collect immobilised soil nutrients, but connect individual plants together by mycorrhizal networks that transport water, carbon, and other nutrients directly from plant to plant through underground hyphal networks.\n\"Suillus tomentosus\", a basidiomycete fungus, produces specialized structures known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae with its plant host lodgepole pine (\"Pinus contorta\" var. \"latifolia\"). These structures have been shown to host nitrogen fixing bacteria which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.\nDisease, drought and salinity resistance and its correlation to mycorrhizae.\nMycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens. These associations have been found to assist in plant defense both above and belowground. Mycorrhizas have been found to excrete enzymes that are toxic to soil borne organisms such as nematodes. More recent studies have shown that mycorrhizal associations result in a priming effect of plants that essentially acts as a primary immune response. When this association is formed a defense response is activated similarly to the response that occurs when the plant is under attack. As a result of this inoculation, defense responses are stronger in plants with mycorrhizal associations.\nEcosystem services provided by mycorrhizal fungi may depend on the soil microbiome. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi was significantly correlated with soil physical variable, but only with water level and not with aggregate stability and can lead also to more resistant to the effects of drought. Moreover, the significance of mycorrhizal fungi also includes alleviation of salt stress and its beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. Although salinity can negatively affect mycorrhizal fungi, many reports show improved growth and performance of mycorrhizal plants under salt stress conditions.\nResistance to insects.\nPlants connected by mycorrhizal fungi in mycorrhizal networks can use these underground connections to communicate warning signals. For example, when a host plant is attacked by an aphid, the plant signals surrounding connected plants of its condition. Both the host plant and those connected to it release volatile organic compounds that repel aphids and attract parasitoid wasps, predators of aphids. This assists the mycorrhizal fungi by conserving its food supply.\nColonization of barren soil.\nPlants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients. The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in early succession or on degraded landscapes. The introduction of alien mycorrhizal plants to nutrient-deficient ecosystems puts indigenous non-mycorrhizal plants at a competitive disadvantage. This aptitude to colonize barren soil is defined by the category Oligotroph.\nResistance to toxicity.\nFungi have a protective role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and contaminated soils. Pine trees inoculated with \"Pisolithus tinctorius\" planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth. One study discovered the existence of \"Suillus luteus\" strains with varying tolerance of zinc. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of \"Suillus bovinus\" conferred resistance to plants of \"Pinus sylvestris\". This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.\nOccurrence of mycorrhizal associations.\nMycorrhizas are present in 92% of plant families studied (80% of species), with arbuscular mycorrhizas being the ancestral and predominant form, and the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the plant kingdom. The structure of arbuscular mycorrhizas has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record, with both the development of ectomycorrhizas and the loss of mycorrhizas, evolving convergently on multiple occasions.\nAssociations of fungi with the roots of plants have been known since at least the mid-19th century. However, early observers simply recorded the fact without investigating the relationships between the two organisms. This symbiosis was studied and described by Franciszek Kamie\u0144ski in 1879\u20131882.\nClimate change.\nCO2 released by human activities is causing climate change and possible damage to mycorrhizae, but the direct effect of an increase in the gas should be to benefit plants and mycorrhizae. In Arctic regions, nitrogen and water are harder for plants to obtain, making mycorrhizae crucial to plant growth. Since mycorrhizae tend to do better in cooler temperatures, warming could be detrimental to them. Gases such as SO2, NOx, and O3 produced by human activity may harm mycorrhizae, causing reduction in \"propagules, the colonization of roots, degradation in connections between trees, reduction in the mycorrhizal incidence in trees, and reduction in the enzyme activity of ectomycorrhizal roots.\"\nA company in Israel, Groundwork BioAg, has discovered a method of using mycorrhizal fungi to increase agricultural crops while sequestering greenhouse gases and eliminating CO2 from the atmosphere.\nConservation and mapping.\nIn 2021, the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks was launched. SPUN is a science-based initiative to map and protect the mycorrhizal networks regulating Earth's climate and ecosystems. Its stated goals are mapping, protecting, and harnessing mycorrhizal fungi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He wrote several mystery novels under pen names, including Ellery Queen.\nVance won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984, and he was a Guest of Honor at the 1992 World Science Fiction Convention in Orlando, Florida. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 15th Grand Master in 1997, and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.\nHis most notable awards included Hugo Awards in 1963 for \"The Dragon Masters\", in 1967 for \"The Last Castle\", and in 2010 for his memoir \"This Is Me, Jack Vance!\"; the Nebula Award in 1966, also for \"The Last Castle\"; the Jupiter Award in 1975 and the World Fantasy Award in 1990 for \"Lyonesse: Madouc\", and the Edgar Award in 1961 for the best first mystery novel for \"The Man in the Cage\".\nHis first publications were stories in science fiction magazines. As he became well known, he published novellas and novels, many of which were translated into French, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Italian and German. An Integral Edition of all Vance's works was published in 44 volumes and in 2010 a six-volume \"The Complete Jack Vance\" was released. A 2009 profile in \"The New York Times Magazine\" described Vance as \"one of American literature's most distinctive and undervalued voices\". He died at his home in Oakland, California, on May 26, 2013, aged 96.\nBiography.\nVance's great-grandfather is believed to have arrived in California from Michigan a decade before the Gold Rush and married a San Francisco woman. Early family records were apparently destroyed in the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Vance's maternal grandfather, L. M. (Ludwig Mathias) Hoefler, was a successful lawyer in San Francisco.\nVance grew up in the family's large house in San Francisco on Filbert Street. When Vance's father left the family to live on his ranch in Mexico, the family's house in San Francisco was rented out to the father's sister. With the separation of his parents, and the loss of use of the San Francisco house, Vance's mother moved him and his siblings to their maternal grandfather's California ranch near Oakley in the delta of the Sacramento River. This setting formed Vance's love of the outdoors, and allowed him time to indulge his passion as an avid reader of his mother's large book collection, which included Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 \"Tarzan of the Apes\" and his Barsoom novels and Jules Verne's \"The Mysterious Island\". When Vance explored the nearby town, he started reading pulp fiction magazines at the local drugstore.\nWith the death of his grandfather, who had supported the family, which coincided with the economic challenges of the Great Depression, the Vance family\u2019s fortune dwindled, and Vance was forced to leave junior college and work to support himself, assisting his mother when able. Vance plied many trades for short stretches: as a bellhop (a \"miserable year\"), in a cannery, and on a gold dredge. Vance described this era as a time of personal change: \u201cOver a span of four or five years, I developed from an impractical little intellectual into a rather reckless young man, competent at many skills and crafts, and determined to try every phase of life.\u201d\nHe subsequently entered the University of California, Berkeley, and over the next six years studied mining engineering, physics, journalism, and English. Vance wrote one of his first science fiction stories for an English class assignment: his professor commented in a scornful tone, \"We also have a piece of science fiction\"\u2014Vance's first negative review.\nHe worked as an electrician in the naval shipyards at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for \"56\u00a2 an hour,\" and worked for a time as part of a degaussing crew. The attack on Pearl Harbor took place about a month after he quit.\nVance graduated in 1942. Weak eyesight prevented military service. He found a job as a rigger at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, and enrolled in an Army Intelligence program to learn Japanese, but washed out. In 1943, he memorized an eye chart and became an able seaman in the Merchant Marine. In later years, boating remained his favorite recreation; boats and voyages are a frequent motif in his work. He worked as a seaman, a rigger, a surveyor, a ceramicist, and a carpenter before he established himself fully as a writer, which did not occur until the 1970s.\nFrom his youth, Vance had been fascinated by Dixieland and traditional jazz. He was an amateur of the cornet and ukulele, often accompanying himself with a kazoo, and was a competent harmonica player. His first published writings were jazz reviews for \"The Daily Californian\" (his college paper), and music is an element in many of his works.\nIn 1946, Vance met and married Norma Genevieve Ingold (died March 25, 2008), another Cal student. Vance continued to live in Oakland, in a house he built and extended with his family over the years, including a hand-carved wooden ceiling from Kashmir. The Vances traveled extensively, including on one around-the-world voyage, and often spent several months at a time living in places like Ireland, Tahiti, South Africa, Positano (in Italy) and on a houseboat on Lake Nagin in Kashmir.\nVance began trying to become a professional writer in the late 1940s, as part of the San Francisco Renaissance, a movement of experimentation in literature and the arts. His first lucrative sale was one of the early Magnus Ridolph stories to Twentieth Century Fox, who also hired him as a screenwriter for the \"Captain Video\" television series. The proceeds supported the Vances for a year's travel in Europe. There are various references to the Bay Area Bohemian life in his work. In the 1950s, Vance started a pottery and ceramics hobby, buying a kiln; this interest was an influence on his story \"The Potters of Firsk\u201d (1950).\nScience fiction authors Frank Herbert and Poul Anderson were among Vance's closest friends. In the early 1950s, when Frank Herbert was a reporter, he interviewed Vance, and the men became friends. They moved to Mexico with their families to establish a \"writer's colony\" at Lake Chapala, near Guadalajara. In 1962, Vance, Herbert, and Anderson jointly built a houseboat which they sailed in the Sacramento Delta. Vance's interest in houseboats led him to depict them in \"The Moon Moth\" (1961), \"The Palace of Love\" (1967), and \"\" (1978).\nIn the early 1980s, Vance became increasingly interested in sailing, and he started building a 36-foot trimaran. Later, he owned \"Venture\" (a 17-foot cutter-rigged boat), \"Columbia\" (a 35-foot ketch-rigged boat), and finally \"Hinano\" (a 45-foot boat). While Vance derived pleasure from his sailing hobby, his increasingly poor eyesight and the high costs of outfitting, berthing, and maintaining the vessel led him to sell \"Hinano\". Vance's failing eyesight also led him to cease his amateur jazz hobby.\nAlthough legally blind since the 1980s, Vance continued to write with the aid of BigEd software, written especially for him by Kim Kokkonen. His final novel was \"Lurulu\". Although Vance had stated \"Lurulu\" would be his final book, he subsequently completed an autobiography, which was published in July 2009.\nDeath.\nVance died on the morning of May 26, 2013, at the age of 96 in his home in the Oakland Hills. Vance's son John Holbrook Vance II described the cause as the complications of old age, saying \"everything just finally caught up with him\". Tributes to Vance were given by various authors, including George R. R. Martin, Michael Moorcock, Neil Gaiman, and Elizabeth Bear. Steven Gould, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, described Vance as \"one of the greatest science fiction and fantasy writers of the 20th century\". A memorial site set up by his family to post tributes received hundreds of messages in the days following his death.\nWork.\nVance made his debut in print with \"The World-Thinker\", a 16-page story published by Sam Merwin in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", Summer 1945. His lifetime output totals more than 60 books\u2014perhaps almost 90. His work has been published in three categories: science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Among Vance's earliest published work was a set of fantasy stories written while he served in the merchant marine during the war. They appeared in 1950, several years after Vance had started publishing science fiction in the pulp magazines, under the title \"The Dying Earth\".\nVance wrote many science fiction short stories in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were published in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, \"The Telephone was Ringing in the Dark\", published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Some of these are not mysteries, such as \"Bird Isle\", and many fit uneasily in the category. These stories are set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea.\nMany themes important to his more famous science fiction novels appeared first in the mysteries. The most obvious is the \"book of dreams\", which appears in \"Bad Ronald\" and \"The View from Chickweed's Window\", prior to being featured in \"The Book of Dreams\". The revenge theme is also more prominent in certain mysteries than in the science fiction (\"The View from Chickweed's Window\" in particular). \"Bad Ronald\" was adapted to a TV film of the same name aired on ABC in 1974, as well as a French production (\"M\u00e9chant gar\u00e7on\") in 1992; this and \"Man in the Cage\" are the only works by Vance to be made into film to date.\nCertain of the science fiction stories are also mysteries, penned using his full name John Holbrook Vance, three under the house pseudonym Ellery Queen, and one each using the pseudonyms Alan Wade, Peter Held, John van See, and Jay Kavanse. Some editions of his published works give his year of birth as 1920. In addition to the comic Magnus Ridolph stories, two major stories feature the effectuator Miro Hetzel, a futuristic detective, and \"Araminta Station\" is largely concerned with solving various murders. Vance returned to the \"dying Earth\" setting (a far distant future in which the sun is slowly going out, and magic and technology coexist) to write the picaresque adventures of the ne'er-do-well scoundrel Cugel the Clever, and those of the magician Rhialto the Marvellous. These books were written in 1963, 1978 and 1981. His other major fantasy work, \"Lyonesse\" (a trilogy comprising \"Suldrun's Garden\", \"The Green Pearl\", and \"Madouc\"), was completed in 1989 and set on a mythological archipelago off the coast of France in the early Middle Ages.\nVance's stories written for pulps in the 1940s and 1950s covered many science fiction themes, with a tendency to emphasize mysterious and biological themes (ESP, genetics, brain parasites, body switching, other dimensions, cultures) rather than technical ones. Robots, for example, are almost entirely absent, though the short story \"The Uninhibited Robot\" features a computer gone awry. Many of the early stories are comic. By the 1960s, Vance had developed a futuristic setting that he came to call the Gaean Reach, a fictional region of space settled by humans. Thereafter, all his science fiction was, more or less explicitly, set therein. The Gaean Reach per se is loose and expanding, old Earth (Gaia) being the center. Each planet has its own history, state of development and culture. Within the Reach conditions tend to be peaceable and commerce tends to dominate. At the edges of the Reach, out in the lawless Beyond, conditions are usually much less secure.\nVance influenced many writers in the genre. Most notably, Michael Shea wrote a sequel to \"Eyes of the Overworld\", featuring Cugel the Clever, before Vance did one himself (called \"Cugel's Saga\"). Vance gave permission, and the book by Shea went into print before Vance's. Shea's book, \"A Quest for Simbilis\", is entirely in keeping with the vision of Vance. Cugel is a complete rogue, who is nevertheless worthy of sympathy in always failing to achieve his goals.\nLiterary influences.\nWhen asked about literary influences, Vance most often cited Jeffery Farnol, a writer of adventure books, whose style of \"high\" language he mentions (the Farnol title \"Guyfford of Weare\" being a typical instance); P. G. Wodehouse, an influence apparent in Vance's taste for overbearing aunts; and L. Frank Baum, whose fantasy elements were directly borrowed by Vance (see \"The Emerald City of Oz\"). In the introduction to Dowling and Strahan's \"The Jack Vance Treasury\", Vance mentions that his childhood reading including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Verne, Robert W. Chambers, science fiction published by Edward Stratemeyer, the magazines \"Weird Tales\" and \"Amazing Stories\", and Lord Dunsany. According to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance's earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of James Branch Cabell. Fantasy historian Lin Carter notes several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance's work, and suggests that the early \"pseudo-Cabell\" experiments bore fruit in \"The Dying Earth\" (1950). Science fiction critic Don Herron cites Clark Ashton Smith as an influence on Vance's style and characters' names.\nCharacteristics and commentary.\nVance's science fiction runs the gamut from stories written for pulps in the 1940s to multi-volume tales set in the space age. Scott Bradfield states that Vance \"wrote about incomprehensibly far-off futures that weren\u2019t driven by the splashy intergalactic military conflicts of his Golden Age predecessors, such as E.E. Doc Smith or Robert A. Heinlein. Instead, Vance\u2019s futures are marked by rich, panoramic socioeconomic systems.\" While Vance's stories have a wide variety of temporal settings, a majority of them belong to a period long after humanity has colonized other stars, culminating in the development of a fictional region of interstellar space called the Gaean Reach. In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has an aura of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class.\nVance's stories are seldom concerned directly with war and the conflicts are rarely direct. If there are battles, such as in the slave revolt against the nobility at the end of \"The Last Castle\", they are depicted in an abbreviated length, as Vance is more interested in the social and political context than the clashing of swords. Sometimes at the edges of the Reach or in the lawless areas of Beyond, a planet is menaced or craftily exploited. Some more extensive battles are described in \"The Dragon Masters\", \"The Miracle Workers\", and the \"Lyonesse Trilogy\", in which medieval-style combat abounds. His characters usually become inadvertently enmeshed in low-intensity conflicts between alien cultures; this is the case in \"Emphyrio\", the Tschai series, the Durdane series, and the comic stories in \"Galactic Effectuator\", featuring Miro Hetzel. Personal, cultural, social, or political conflicts are the central concerns. This is most particularly the case in the Cadwal series, though it is equally characteristic of the three Alastor books, \"\", and, one way or another, in most of his science fiction novels.\nAnother way in which Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most speculative fiction writers is the extensive details ranging from the culture of language to food, music, and rituals. In \"The Languages of Pao\", after a planet with a passive, lazy and backwards culture is invaded and occupied, the planet's leader orders three new languages developed, to make his people more aggressive, industrious and inventive. In the short story \"The Moon Moth\", natives must master a number of musical instruments in order to communicate with each other. Spoken words are modulated to acquire different meanings, or may be said to be given full meaning (respect, derision or sarcasm), by means of the musical sounds. These details paint a far more detailed and complex picture of life and cultures in his books.\nThe \"Joe Bain\" stories (\"The Fox Valley Murders\", \"The Pleasant Grove Murders\", and an unfinished outline published by the VIE) are set in an imaginary northern California county; these are the nearest to the classical mystery form, with a rural policeman as protagonist. \"Bird Isle\", by contrast, is not a mystery at all, but a Wodehousian idyll (also set near San Francisco), while \"The Flesh Mask\" or \"Strange People\u00a0...\" emphasize psychological drama. The theme of both \"The House on Lily Street\" and \"Bad Ronald\" is solipsistic megalomania, taken up again in the Demon Princes cycle of science fiction novels.\nThree books published under the house name Ellery Queen were written to editorial requirements and heavily revised by the publisher. (Volume 45 of The Vance Integral Edition contains the original text for the three Ellery Queen novels. Vance previously refused to acknowledge them for their degree of rewriting.) Four others reflect Vance's world travels: \"Strange People, Queer Notions\" based on his stay in Positano, Italy; \"The Man in the Cage\", based on a trip to Morocco; \"The Dark Ocean\", set on a merchant marine vessel; and \"The Deadly Isles\", based on a stay in Tahiti.\nThe mystery novels reveal much about Vance's evolution as a science fiction and fantasy writer. He stopped working in the mystery genre in the early 1970s, except for science-fiction mysteries; see below. \"Bad Ronald\" is especially noteworthy for its portrayal of a trial-run for Howard Alan Treesong of \"The Book of Dreams\". The Edgar-Award-winning \"The Man in the Cage\" is a thriller set in North Africa at around the period of the French-Algerian war. \"A Room to Die In\" is a classic 'locked-room' murder mystery featuring a strong-willed young woman as the amateur detective. \"Bird Isle\", a mystery set at a hotel on an island off the California coast, reflects Vance's taste for farce.\nVance's two rural Northern California mysteries featuring Sheriff Joe Bain were well received by the critics. \"The New York Times\" said of \"The Fox Valley Murders\": \"Mr. Vance has created the county with the same detailed and loving care with which, in the science fiction he writes as Jack Vance, he can create a believable alien planet.\" Dorothy B. Hughes, in \"The Los Angeles Times\", wrote that it was \"fat with character and scene\". As for the second Bain novel, \"The New York Times\" said: \"I like regionalism in American detective stories, and I enjoy reading about the problems of a rural county sheriff ... and I bless John Holbrook Vance for the best job of satisfying these tastes with his wonderful tales of Sheriff Joe Bain\u00a0...\".\nVance has also written mysteries set in his science fiction universes. An early 1950s short story series features Magnus Ridolph, an interstellar adventurer and amateur detective who is elderly and not prone to knocking anyone down, and whose exploits appear to have been inspired, in part, by those of Jack London's South Seas adventurer, Captain David Grief. The \"Galactic Effectuator\" novelettes feature Miro Hetzel, a figure who resembles Ridolph in his blending of detecting and troubleshooting (the \"effectuating\" indicated by the title). A number of the other science fiction novels include mystery, spy thriller, or crime-novel elements: \"The Houses of Iszm\", \"Son of the Tree\", the Alastor books \"Trullion\" and \"Marune\", the Cadwal series, and large parts of the Demon Princes series.\nAccording to writer Michael Chabon, \"Jack Vance is the most painful case of all the writers I love who I feel don\u2019t get the credit they deserve. If \u2018The Last Castle\u2019 or \u2018The Dragon Masters\u2019 had the name Italo Calvino on it, or just a foreign name, it would be received as a profound meditation, but because he's Jack Vance and published in Amazing Whatever, there's this insurmountable barrier.\"\nVance fans developed a website called Totality (pharesm.org), which enables users to do electronic searches of the Vance Integral Edition texts.\nPublication.\nFor most of his career, Vance's work suffered the vicissitudes common to most writers in his chosen field: ephemeral publication of stories in magazine form, short-lived softcover editions, in which stories sometimes were insensitively edited beyond his control. As he became more widely recognized, conditions improved, and his works became internationally renowned among aficionados. Much of his work has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Esperanto, French, Spanish, Russian, and Italian. Beginning in the 1960s, Jack Vance's work has also been extensively translated into German. In the large German-language market, his books continue to be widely read.\nVance was an original member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. Its purpose was to promote the sword and sorcery subgenre (such as Dying Earth stories by Vance), and some new works were published in \"Flashing Swords!\" anthologies edited by Carter, in both mass-market paperback and Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club editions.\nIn 1976, the fantasy/sf small press Underwood-Miller released their first publication, the first hardcover edition of \"The Dying Earth\" in a high-quality limited edition of just over 1000 copies. Other titles in the \"Dying Earth\" cycle also received hardcover treatment from Underwood-Miller shortly thereafter, such as \"The Eyes of the Overworld\" and \"Cugel's Saga\". After these first publications and until the mid-1990s, Underwood-Miller published many of Vance's works, including his mystery fiction, often in limited editions featuring dustjacket artwork by leading fantasy artists. The entire Jack Vance output from Underwood-Miller comes close to a complete collection of Vance's previously published works, many of which had not seen hardcover publication. Also, many of these editions are described as \"the author's preferred text\", meaning that they have not been drastically edited. In the mid-1990s, Tim Underwood and Charles Miller parted company. However, they have continued to publish Vance titles individually, including such works as \"Emphyrio\" and \"To Live Forever\" by Miller, and a reprint edition of \"The Eyes of the Overworld\" by Underwood. Because of the low print-run on many of these titles, often they could only be found in science fiction bookstores at the time of their release.\nThe Vance Integral Edition.\nAn Integral Edition of all Vance's works was published in a limited edition of 44 hardback volumes. A special 45th volume contains the three novels Vance wrote as Ellery Queen. This edition was created from 1999 to 2006 by 300 volunteers working via the internet, under the aegis of the author.\nIn 2010, Afton House Books presented \"The Complete Jack Vance\" in six large volumes using texts prepared by the Vance Integral Edition. Volume six has a table of contents for the volumes; otherwise there is no exegesis. Issues of the project's magazine \"Cosmopolis\" describe the production process (of interest to anyone wishing accurate transcription of scanned text) and the detection of some surprising errors such as the scanning of \"and\" being recognised as \"arid\" (\"Cosmopolis 17\", page 8) yet resulting in a sentence that is both grammatically acceptable and plausible in context: \"It was hot, arid dusty.\" Similarly, there is no bibliography of where the stories have previously been published. Cover art may be found via or at geofftaylor-artist.com and many other places.\nIn 2012, Spatterlight Press started offering DRM-free e-books editions of many of the works of Jack Vance, based on the source texts collected by the Integral Edition project. It is the intent of Spatterlight Press to publish the complete Integral Edition in e-book form, and also as print-on-demand paperbacks. Gollancz uses the VIE texts in their \"SF Gateway\" editions starting in 2012.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A co-creator of the \"Godzilla\" and \"Ultraman\" franchises, he is considered one of the most important and influential figures in the history of cinema. Tsuburaya is known as the having pioneered Japan's special effects industry and introduced several technological developments in film productions. In a career spanning five decades, Tsuburaya worked on approximately 250 films\u2014including globally renowned features directed by Ishir\u014d Honda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and Akira Kurosawa\u2014and earned six Japan Technical Awards.\nFollowing a brief stint as an inventor, Tsuburaya was employed by Japanese cinema pioneer Yoshir\u014d Edamasa in 1919 and began his career working as an assistant cinematographer on Edamasa's \"A Tune of Pity\". Thereafter, he worked as an assistant cinematographer on several films, including Teinosuke Kinugasa's \"A Page of Madness\" (1926). At the age of thirty-two, Tsuburaya watched \"King Kong\", which greatly influenced him to work in special effects. Tsuburaya completed the first iron shooting crane in October 1934, and an adaptation of the crane is still in use across the globe today. After filming his directorial debut on the cruiser \"Asama\" in the Pacific Ocean, he worked on \"Princess Kaguya\" (1935), one of Japan's first major films to incorporate special effects. His first majorly successful film in effects, \"The Daughter of the Samurai\" (1937), remarkably featured the first full-scale rear projection.\nIn 1937, Tsuburaya was employed by Toho and established the company's effects department. Tsuburaya directed the effects for \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" in 1942, which became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release. His elaborate effects were believed to be behind the film's major success, and he won an award for his work from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. In 1948, however, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. Thus, he founded Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory with his eldest son Hajime and worked without credit at major Japanese studios outside Toho, creating effects for films such as Daiei's \"The Invisible Man Appears\" (1949), widely regarded as the first Japanese science fiction film.\nIn 1950, Tsuburaya returned to Toho alongside his effects crew from Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. At age fifty-three, he gained international recognition and won his first Japan Technical Award for Special Skill for directing the effects in Ishir\u014d Honda's \"kaiju\" film \"Godzilla\" (1954). He served as the effects director for Toho's string of financially successful \"tokusatsu\" films that followed, including, \"Rodan\" (1956), \"The Mysterians\" (1957), \"The Three Treasures\" (1959), \"Mothra\", \"The Last War\" (both 1961), and \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" (1962). In April 1963, Tsuburaya founded Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions; his company would go onto produce the television shows \"Ultra Q\", \"Ultraman\" (both 1966), \"Ultraseven\" (1967\u20131968), and \"Mighty Jack\" (1968). \"Ultra Q\" and \"Ultraman\" were extremely successful upon their 1966 broadcast, with \"Ultra Q\" making him a household name in Japan and gaining him more attention from the media who dubbed him the \"God of \"Tokusatsu\"\". While he spent his late years working on several Toho films and operating his company, Tsuburaya's health began to decline, and he died in 1970.\nBiography.\nChildhood to war years: 1901\u20131945.\nChildhood and youth (1901\u20131919).\nEiji Tsuburaya was born on July 7, 1901, at a merchant house called \u014ctsukaya in Sukagawa, Iwase, Fukushima Prefecture, where his family ran a malted rice business. He was the first son of Isamu Shiraishi and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. When Tsuburaya was three years old, his mother Sei died of illness at the age of nineteen, shortly after giving birth to her second son. Bereaved by Sei's death, Shiraishi divorced her posthumously and left the family, leaving Tsuburaya in the care of his grandmother Natsu. Through Natsu, Tsuburaya was related to the Edo period painter A\u014dd\u014d Denzen, who brought copper printing and Western painting to Japan, from whom Tsuburaya considered to have inherited his manual dexterity. His uncle Ichir\u014d, who was Sei's younger brother, was five years older than him and acted like an elder brother to him. Thus, Tsuburaya began to use the nickname Eiji (\"ji\" indicating second-born) instead of Eiichi (\"ichi\" indicating first-born).\nIn 1908, he started attending the Dai'ichi Jinjo Koto Elementary School in Sukagawa, and it was soon realized that he had a talent for drawing. During his boyhood, Tsuburaya became interested in flying because of the recent success of Japanese aviators; he soon started building model airplanes as a hobby, an interest he would pursue throughout his entire life.\nIn 1913, Tsuburaya saw his first film, which featured footage of a volcanic eruption on Sakurajima; in the process, he was more fascinated by the projector than the movie itself. In 1958, Tsuburaya told \"Kinema Junpo\" that because he was extremely fascinated by the projector, he purchased a \"toy movie viewer\" and created his own film strips by \"carefully cutting rolled paper, then making sprocket holes, and drawing stick figures [on the paper], frame by frame.\" Because of his craftwork at a young age, he became a provincial celebrity and was interviewed by the \"Fukushima Minyu Shimbun\".\nIn 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated from junior high school, and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon Flying School at Haneda. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya switched to the Tokyo Kanda Electrical Engineering School (now Tokyo Denki University). While at the school, he started working as an inventor at the toy company Utsumi, and devised inventions including the first battery-powered phone capable of making calls, an automatic speed photo box, an \"automatic skate\" and the toy phone. The latter two earned him a patent fee of \u00a5.\nEarly career and marriage (1919\u20131934).\nDuring a \"hanami\" party held at a tea house in the spring of 1919, Tsuburaya met Yoshir\u014d Edamasa, a pioneer of Japanese cinema. Edamasa asked Tsuburaya if he was interested in movies or photography; after he explained to Edamasa that he was interested in motion pictures, Tsuburaya accepted the director's offer to become an employee at his company, the Natural Color Motion Pictures Company (dubbed \"Tenkatsu\"). Therefore, Tsuburaya began working in the film industry at the age of eighteen, as Edamasa's camera assistant, contributing to films such as \"A Tune of Pity\" (1919) and \"Tombs of the Island\" (1920); reportedly, he also served as a screenwriter during this period. Despite Tenkatsu becoming part of the Kokatsu Company and Edamasa leaving his job in March 1920, Tsuburaya kept working at the studio until he was ordered to serve the Imperial Japanese Army between 1921 and December 1922.\nAfter leaving the army in 1923, Tsuburaya moved back to his family's house in Sukagawa. However, he suddenly departed just a few months later, in order to pursue a more established career within the filmmaking industry. In the morning of his departure from home, he left a note: \"I won't return home until I succeed in the motion picture business, even if I die trying.\" The next year, he worked as the cinematographer on the film \"The Hunchback of Enmei'in Temple\". Tsuburaya joined Shochiku in 1925 and would have his breakthrough as the cameraman and assistant director on Teinosuke Kinugasa's \"A Page of Madness\" (released the following year). In 1927, he shot Minoru Inuzuka's \"jidaigeki\" films \"Children's Swordplay\" and \"Melee\", both starring Kazuo Hasegawa and Tsuyako Okajima, as well as Toko Yamazaki's \"The Bat Copybook\", \"Mad Blade Under the Moon\", and \"Record of the Tragic Swords of the Tenpo Era\". Because of the financial success of these films, Tsuburaya started being regarded as one of Kyoto's leading cinematographers.\nIn 1928, while working on eleven films at Shochiku, Tsuburaya began creating and utilizing new camera operating techniques, including double-exposure and slow-motion camerawork. The next year, Tsuburaya constructed his own smaller version of D. W. Griffith's 140-foot tall shooting crane: having invented it without the benefit of using blueprints or manuals, the wooden crane allowed Tsuburaya to improve camera movement and was able to be used in and outside the studio. The creation proved to be a success, although it did not guarantee total safety: one day, while Tsuburaya and an assistant were preparing the crane in order to film a scene, the structure collapsed, sending him plummeting to the ground of the studio. A witness of the incident, named Masano Araki, was one of the first people to run to his aid: she visited Tsuburaya daily while he was hospitalized, and the pair formed a relationship shortly thereafter. On February 27, 1930, Tsuburaya married the decade-younger Araki. Their first child, Hajime, was born on April 23, 1931.\nIn May 1932, Tsuburaya, Akira Mimura, Hiroshi Sakai, Kohei Sugiyama, Masao Tamai, and Tadayuki Yokota established the Japan Cameraman Association, which later coalesced with other companies to become the Nippon Cinematographers Club (now known as the Japanese Society of Cinematographers). Shortly after that, the association would start to hold award ceremonies. In November of that same year, Tsuburaya quit Shochiku and joined Nikkatsu Futosou Studios. Around the same time, he began using the professional name \"Eiji Tsuburaya\".\nIn 1933, Tsuburaya saw the American film \"King Kong\", which inspired him to work on movies featuring special effects. In 1962, Tsuburaya told the \"Mainichi Shimbun\" that he attempted to convince Nikkatsu to \"import this technical know-how, but they had little interest in it because, at the time, I was seen as merely a cameraman who worked on Kazuo Hasegawa's historical dramas\". He managed to acquire a 35mm print of \"King Kong\" and started to study the film's special effects frame-by-frame, without the advantage of documents explaining how they were produced: he would later write an analysis of the film's effects for the magazine \"Photo Times\" in October 1933. In the same year, Masano gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Miyako. However, the child would die of unknown causes in 1935.\nIn December 1933, Nikkatsu granted Tsuburaya permission to use and study new screen projection technology for the company's \"jidaigeki\" films. However, while the studio agreed with his decision to project these films cast into a location use using location plates, not all of his technological developments were met with approval. While he was filming the final scenes for \"Asataro Descends Mt. Akagi\" in February 1934, Tsuburaya fell out with Nikkatsu's CEO, who had no acquaintance with what Tsuburaya was creating and assumed that he was wasting the company's money. After the argument, Tsuburaya resigned from his job at Nikkatsu.\nJ.O. Studios, directorial works, and Toho (1934\u20131940).\nShortly after leaving Nikkatsu, he accepted an offer from Kyoto entrepreneur Yoshio Osawa to work at his company, J.O. Talkies, and research optical printing and screen projection. In October 1934, Tsuburaya and his colleagues completed the first iron shooting crane model and used it to shoot Atsuo Tomioka's \"The Chorus of a Million\". In contrast to his previous prototype, the crane was installed on a truck that operated on tracks, which made it able to change the camera's position in a matter of seconds. In December of that year, Osawa renamed the studio J.O. Studios and designated Tsuburaya as its chief cinematographer.\nFrom February to August 1935, he traveled to Hawaii, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand on the cruiser \"Asama\" in order to shoot his directorial debut, \"Three Thousand Miles Across the Equator\", a feature-length propaganda documentary film. During the expedition, his second son, Noboru, was born on May 10, 1935.\nUpon returning from the voyage, Tsuburaya began work on \"Princess Kaguya\", an adaptation of the 10th-century Japanese literary tale \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". He did not only serve as the film's cinematographer, but was also in charge of special effects for the first time. For the film, he worked with animator Kenz\u014d Masaoka to create miniatures, puppets, a composite of Kaguya emerging from a cut bamboo plant, and a sequence in which a ship encounters a storm. While the original print of the film is considered to be lost, a shortened version, screened in England in 1936, was discovered by a researcher at the British Film Institute in May 2015: this version was released in Japan on September 4 and 5, 2021, as part of an event celebrating Tsuburaya's 120th birthday.\nIn March of the next year, Tsuburaya's directorial debut, the theatrical play \"Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village\", was released: it was an adventure film concerning a condemned romance and featuring political tones. \"Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village\" was the second film to ever star popular geisha singer Ichimaru, while also featuring actor Kenji Susukida. Soon after its completion, Tsuburaya began working on Arnold Fanck's \"The Daughter of the Samurai\" (released in 1937). \"The Daughter of the Samurai\" was the first German-Japanese co-production, and is considered to be Tsuburaya's first major success as a special effects director, since it featured the first full-scale rear projection. The German staff were allegedly impressed by his elaborate miniature work on the project.\nIn September 1936, Ichiz\u014d Kobayashi merged the film studios P.C.L. Studios and P.C.L. Film Company with J.O. Studios to create the film and theatre production company Toho. Film producer Iwao Mori was appointed as production manager at Toho: having become aware of the importance of special effects during a tour in Hollywood, in 1937 Mori hired Tsuburaya at the company's studio in Tokyo, establishing the special effects department on November 27, 1937, and treating him as the section's manager. Shortly after, Tsuburaya received a research budget and began studying optical printers to create Japan's first version of the device, which he designed. Among Tsuburaya's first film assignments at Toho were \"The Abe Clan\", a \"jidaigeki\" film directed by Hisatora Kumagai, and the unreleased propaganda musical \"The Song of Major Nango\" (both 1938). The latter film was directed and shot by Tsuburaya, and he completed it on September 6 of that year.\nIn 1939, he was ordered to join the Kumagaya Aviation Academy of the Imperial Army Corps, where he was entrusted to shoot flight-training films. After impressing his superiors with his aerial photography, Tsuburaya was given more assignments and a master's certificate during his almost three years at the academy. In November 1939, while Tsuburaya was still at the flight school and undertaking assignments at Toho, he was appointed head of Toho's Special Arts Department. A month after that, he was commissioned to shoot a science film for Toho's then-recently assembled educational section. Under governance demands, Toho was mandated to maintain the creation of propaganda films. Accordingly, in May 1940, Tsuburaya began directing the documentary \"The Imperial Way of Japan\" for Toho Education Films' branch, the Toho National Policy Film Association. He was given his first ever credits for special effects for his work on Sotoji Kimura's \"Navy Bomber Squadron\", which featured a bombing scene with a miniature airplane. \"Navy Bomber Squadron\" was believed to be lost for over sixty years, until an unfinished copy of the film was discovered and screened in 2006.\nIn September 1940, Yutaka Abe's \"The Burning Sky\", was released to Japanese cinemas. Tsuburaya was in charge of effects for the film and received his first accolade from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. His next undertaking, \"Son Gok\u016b\", was released on November 6, 1940. During an interview for the August 1960 issue of \"American Cinematographer\", he broke down the creative process behind \"Son Gok\u016b\", saying: \"I was called upon to create and photograph a monkey-like monster which was supposed to fly through the air\", adding: \"I managed the job with some success and this assignment set the pattern for my future work.\"\nWar years (1941\u20131945).\nOn December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service suddenly attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor: consequently, the Imperial Japanese Government tasked Toho to produce a propaganda film that would influence the nation to believe they would win the Pacific War. The resulting film, Kajir\u014d Yamamoto's war epic \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" (1942), became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release in December 1942 and won \"Kinema Junpo\"'s Best Film Award. Tsuburaya directed its effects, which he created with the assistance of navy-provided photographs of the Pearl Harbor attack: in the process, he also worked with future \"Godzilla\" collaborates Akira Watanabe and Teiz\u014d Toshimitsu for the first time in his career. His work on the film was supposedly one of the main reasons behind its major success and gained him the Technical Research Award from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. The film depicted the attack so realistically that footage from it was later featured in documentaries on the Pearl Harbor attack.\nAround the same time as \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" was in production, Toho's effects department was filming Japan's first puppet film, \"Ramayana\". The film's screenplay\u2014based on the Sanskrit epic of the same name\u2014had been written by future \"Moonlight Mask\" creator K\u014dhan Kawauchi in 1941, under Tsuburaya's supervision.\nTsuburaya's next four major productions were all war films: Masahiro Makino's \"The Opium War\", Tadashi Imai's \"Watchtower Suicide Squad\", Kunio Watanabe's \"Decisive Battle in the Skies\" and Kajir\u014d Yamamoto's follow-up to \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\", \"General Kato's Falcon Fighters\" (all produced in 1943). For \"The Opium War\", Tsuburaya and his team created miniature navy battle sequences and animation synthesis in urban landscapes. During the production of \"General Kato's Falcon Fighters\" (released in 1944), Tsuburaya had his first meeting with future collaborator and filmmaker Ishir\u014d Honda. After watching \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\", Honda became interested in special effects and believed Tsuburaya's work in \"General Kato's Falcon Fighters\" was inferior in scope, but the art and gunpowder technology had enhanced. Additionally, Tsuburaya expressed dissatisfaction with the size of the shooting stage, the art materials, the method of performance, etc.\nShortly before Toho distributed \"General Kato's Falcon Fighters\" in cinemas, Masano and Tsuburaya's third son and last child, Akira, was born on February 12, 1944. Akira was the first of the couple's sons to be baptized, since Masano had been converted to Catholicism by her younger sister. Masano persisted in introducing her children to the Catholic faith and ultimately converted her husband.\nIn 1944, Tsuburaya met future \"Godzilla\" producer Tomoyuki Tanaka during the production of the Mikio Naruse-directed war film \"Until the Day of Victory\", which was Tanaka's debut as a film producer. Tanaka stated that he did not develop a serious connection with Tsuburaya during the film's production. The following year, the special effects director collaborated with Tanaka for the second time on Kiyoshi Saeki's \"Three People of the North\".\nOn March 10, 1945, Tsuburaya and his family sought refuge for two hours in their residence's bomb shelter during the Tokyo air raids. During the two-hour-long attacks, he told his children fairy tales to keep them quiet. Later that year, Tsuburaya made the effects in Torajir\u014d Sait\u014d's \"Five Men from Tokyo\", for which he was credited as \"Eiichi Tsuburaya\". \"Five Men from Tokyo\" is a comedy film concerning five men who struggle to make a living after returning to Tokyo and remaining unemployed due to the Tokyo air raids on March 10, 1945, at the end of World War II.\nOccupation years to \"Ch\u016bshingura\": 1946\u20131962.\nEarly postwar work (1946\u20131954).\nEven though Toho was unaffected by the Tokyo bombings, as the company was located in Seijo, the amount of film productions was reduced due to the Occupation of Japan. Because of this, the company produced only eighteen films in 1946, with Tsuburaya working on eight of them. During the same year, Tsuburaya became head of the special effects production department at Toho and established its cinematography, compositing, art, and development units. Since he and his effects unit at the company had a minor slate of films to work on, they also began testing matte painting and optical printing.\nToho was on the verge of disbandment due to the three major labor disputes that occurred at the studio during the late 1940s. According to Akira Tsuburaya, his father had to sneak around the Japanese police and U.S. tanks deployed during these strikes and disputes in order to get to work. To repel the police, the labor strikers erected a barricade, using a large fan, made by the special effects department of the company, which was equipped with the Zero fighter engine that Tsuburaya had used during the war. These events led to the creation of Shintoho; Tsuburaya would create the effects for the studio's first film, \"A Thousand and One Nights with Toho\" (1947).\nIn late March 1948, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. The U.S. occupation officials reportedly expelled him assuming he had access to classified documents when creating the comprehensive miniatures featured in \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\", which led them to inaccurately conclude that he was a spy. Consequently, Toho disbanded their special effects division and Tsuburaya, together with his son Hajime, founded the independent special effects company Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory, an unofficial juridical entity. Henceforth, he worked at major film studios outside Toho without on-screen credit.\nIn 1949, five major Daiei Film productions featuring effects directed by Tsuburaya were released to Japanese theaters: Japanese horror filmmaker Bin Kato's \"The White Haired Fiend\", Keigo Kimura's \"Flowers of Raccoon Palace\", Kiyohiko Ushihara's \"The Rainbow Man\", Akira Nobuchi's \"The Ghost Train\", and Nobuo Adachi's \"The Invisible Man Appears\". This last movie was the first successful Japanese science fiction film, as well as the country's first adaption of H. G. Wells' novel \"The Invisible Man\". Created by studying the eponymous 1933 film adaptation of Wells' novel, Daiei had intended this film to be Tsuburaya's full-scale post-war recovery, featuring special effects superior in quality to those in Universal Pictures' \"The Invisible Man\" film series. Tsuburaya, however, was disappointed with his lack of competence on the project and gave up his ambition to become a Daiei employee after \"The Invisible Man Appears\" was finished.\nIn 1950, Tsuburaya relocated some equipment and employees at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory to Toho's headquarters; his independent company was merely the size of six \"tatami\" mats inside Toho Studios. In the same year, he continued to direct special effects for films from other companies, including Toyoko Eiga's anti-war film \"Listen to the Voices of the Sea\". While slowly rebuilding the company's Special Arts Department, he filmed all of the title cards, trailers, and the logo for Toho's films from 1950 to 1954. The first production featuring major contributions by Tsuburaya upon his return to Toho was reportedly a 1950 film directed by Hiroshi Inagaki and based on the life of Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojir\u014d. During this period, Tsuburaya also worked on Toho films such as Senkichi Taniguchi's anti-war film \"Escape at Dawn\" (1950), directed the effects for Taniguchi's \"Beyond Love and Hate\", staged miniature ships to depict a battle in Hiroshi Inagaki's \"Pirate Ship\", and directed the effects for Kenji Mizoguchi's \"The Lady of Musashino\".\nIn February 1952, Tsuburaya's exile from public office was officially lifted. That same month, Ishir\u014d Honda's second feature film, \"The Skin of the South\", was released to Japanese theaters. Tsuburaya directed the film's effects for the typhoon and landslide scenes, which was his first experience acting as the effects director on a film by the future \"Godzilla\" director. Tsuburaya collaborated with Honda and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka on \"The Man Who Came to Port\" later that year: this marked the first time the trio, who are considered the creators of \"Godzilla\", ever collaborated with one another.\nDuring World War II, Toho had begun researching 3D films and completed a 3D film process known as \"Tovision\". While the project had been abandoned, it was later revived when the 3D film \"Bwana Devil\" (1952) became a box office hit in the United States. Hence, the company produced its first 3D film, future \"Godzilla\" co-writer Takeo Murata's \"The Sunday That Jumped Out\" (1953). It features cinematography by Tsuburaya, who shot the short film by using an interlocking camera. After the completion of \"The Sunday That Jumped Out\", Murata discussed creating a \"kaiju\" film about a giant whale attacking Tokyo, which Tsuburaya devised the previous year. Tsuburaya, therefore, resubmitted the conception of this production to producer Iwao Mori. Although this project never materialized, elements of it were included in early drafts of \"Godzilla\" the following year.\nTsuburaya's next project, the war epic \"Eagle of the Pacific\" (1953), was his first significant partnership with Ishir\u014d Honda. As the film featured many effects sequences from \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\", Tsuburaya used only a small crew to shoot its new effects. Upon its release, the film reportedly became Toho's first post-war production to gross over \u00a5 ($). The ensuing year, he and Honda collaborated on another war film, \"Farewell Rabaul\", released to Japanese theaters in February 1954, to moderate box office success. His effects for this assignment were more advanced than the ones used for \"Eagle of the Pacific\", since they featured many more of his technological approaches and syntheses. Because of the success of \"Eagle of the Pacific\" and \"Farewell Rabaul\", Tomoyuki Tanaka believed Tsuburaya should make more \"tokusatsu\" films with Honda. Tsuburaya's next film would become Japan's first global hit and gain him international attention.\nInternational recognition (1954\u20131959).\nAfter failing to renegotiate with the Indonesian government for the production of \"In the Shadow of Glory\", producer Tomoyuki Tanaka began to consider creating a giant monster (or \"kaiju\") film, inspired by Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9's \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953) and the \"Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru\" incident. He believed that it would have considerable potential, due to the financial success of previous monster films and the impact of news generating nuclear fears. As a result, he wrote an outline for the project and pitched it to Iwao Mori. Following Tsuburaya's agreement to create its effects, Mori approved the production, eventually titled \"Godzilla\", in mid-April 1954; filmmaker Ishir\u014d Honda soon took over the directing duties. During preproduction, Tsuburaya considered using stop motion to depict the titular monster but, as stated by special effects crew member Fumio Nakadai, had to employ the \"costume method\" because he \"finally decided it wouldn't work\". This technique is now known as \"suitmation\".\nTsuburaya's special effects department filmed \"Godzilla\" in 71 days from August to late October 1954, on a budget of \u00a5. He and his crew worked relentlessly, regularly starting at 9:00 a.m., preparing at 5:00 p.m., and finishing the shoot at 4 or 5 a.m. in the following morning. Upon its nationwide release on November 3, Tsuburaya's effects received critical acclaim and the film became a box office hit. As a result, \"Godzilla\" established Toho as the most successful effects company in the world, and Tsuburaya obtained his first Japan Technical Award for his efforts.\nInstantly after completing \"Godzilla\" in October, Tsuburaya began working on another Toho-produced science fiction film, \"The Invisible Avenger\", which was released to Japanese theaters in December 1954, under the title \"Invisible Man\". This \"tokusatsu\" production was directed by Motoyoshi Oda and featured special effects and photography by Tsuburaya. For the movie, he inherited and expanded the technology used in his first film to feature an invisible character, \"The Invisible Man Appears\" (1949). Tsuburaya instructed his crew to portray the title character's invisibility in various ways throughout the film, including optical synthesis, and suggested that the character would disguise his invisibility powers by dressing up as a clown.\nDue to the enormous box-office success of \"Godzilla\", Toho quickly gathered the majority of the crew behind the film to create a smaller-budget sequel to the film, entitled \"Godzilla Raids Again\": Tsuburaya was officially given the title of special effects director for the first time, having always been credited under \"special technique\" beforehand. Shot in less than three months, the film was released in April 1955. Just a month later, Tsuburaya began directing the effects of \"Half Human\", his second \"kaiju\" film collaboration with director Ishir\u014d Honda. Among his efforts on this film, the effects director notably created stop-motion animation, rear-screen miniature, and miniature avalanche sequences.\nIn April 1956, \"Godzilla\" became the first Japanese film to be widely distributed throughout the United States and was later released worldwide, leading Tsuburaya to gain international recognition. However, for its American release, the movie was re-entitled as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\", heavily re-edited, and integrated with new footage featuring Canadian actor Raymond Burr.\nTsuburaya's next major undertaking, \"The Legend of the White Serpent\", a Hong Kong-Japanese film adaptation of a novel by Fusao Hayashi based on the Chinese legend of the White Snake, was Toho's first \"tokusatsu\" production to be completely filmed in technicolor (via Eastmancolor). In preparation for the film, which was produced on a then-record budget of \u00a5, Tsuburaya and his unit spent a month training with color process technology before shooting the effects. After working on \"The Legend of the White Serpent\", Tsuburaya made the renowned Toho logo, and his unit created the opening credits for most of the company's films. Between working on large-scale Toho films, he also created the effects for Nippon TV's series \"Ninja Arts of Sanada Castle\" and several theatrical productions for Tokyo Takarazuka Theater.\nToho's next assignment for Tsuburaya was \"Rodan\", the first \"kaiju\" film ever produced in color. About 60% of \"Rodan\"'s \u00a5 budget was spent on Tsuburaya's effects, which included optical animation, matte paintings, and extremely elaborate miniature sets created to be destroyed or flown over by its namesake monster (played by original \"Godzilla\" suit actor Haruo Nakajima). \"Rodan\" required a large number of model sets in a variety of sizes, including 1/10, 1/20, 1/25, and 1/30, to be developed and assembled by Tsuburaya's division. The film premiered in Japanese theaters in December 1956 and, upon its release in the United States the following year, earned more at the box office than any previous science fiction film.\n\"Throne of Blood\", an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" from renowned filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, was Tsuburaya's second film release of 1957. Kurosawa cut several scenes by Tsuburaya due to his displeasure with the amount of footage he made for \"Throne of Blood\". He next served as the special effects director for \"The Mysterians\", a science fiction epic directed by Ishir\u014d Honda. The first color CinemaScope film ever directed by the duo, \"The Mysterians\" is often called the \"definitive science fiction movie\". Tsuburaya won another Japan Technical Award for his widescreen effects in \"The Mysterians\".\nA new sub-genre for Toho was born with Tsuburaya's first movie of 1958, \"The H-Man\", which was the first entry in the \"Transforming Human Series\". He next directed the effects for Honda's \"Varan the Unbelievable\", a film about a giant monster awakened in the T\u014dhoku mountains that surfaces in Tokyo Bay. Initially planned as a made-for-television film, co-produced between Toho and the American company AB-PT Pictures, the production was plagued by numerous difficulties: AB-PT collapsed during production, leading Toho to alter the film's status to a theatrical feature. Tsuburaya's final film released in 1958 was Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\".\nTsuburaya began 1959 by working on the special effects for \"Mighty Atom\", a \"tokusatsu\" television series based on Osamu Tezuka's manga series \"Astro Boy\". Although neither he nor his company were credited in the show itself when it aired between March 7, 1959, and May 28, 1960, he supervised the miniature photography done by his staff at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. Around the same time, Tsuburaya also directed the special effects for a storm sequence featured in Honda's \"Inao: Story of an Iron Arm\", for which he also constructed the miniature for the title character's rowboat. Next, he worked on \"Monkey Sun\", co-written and directed by Kajir\u014d Yamamoto as an all-star remake of his 1940 film \"Son Gok\u016b\", a previous entry in the effects director's curriculum. Taking inspiration from watching soybean paste in the broth of his wife's miso soup, Tsuburaya created scenes with storm clouds, as well as smoke and ash erupting from three volcanoes. His effects for \"Monkey Sun\" were described by biographer August Ragone as \"comical and surreal\".\nAfter operating on the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater production \"The Story of Bali\", he directed the effects for Sh\u016be Matsubayashi's \"Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender\", his first war film in six years. In order to film submarine scenes for the film, a model seabed terrain was built in the first Toho miniature pool (dubbed the \"Small Pool\" after a bigger stage was completed). He also filmed his effects for a technicolor version of the film, but they were converted to black-and-white for the final version. In August 1959, Tsuburaya, together with his sons Hajime and Noboru, shot footage of two dragon puppets in Tsuburaya's laboratory at their house in Setagaya, Tokyo for a Hong Kong-based film company.\nTsuburaya's following significant production, director Hiroshi Inagaki's big-budget religious epic \"The Three Treasures\", was created as Toho's celebratory thousandth film. Based on legends featured in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", it stars Toshiro Mifune as Yamato Takeru and the \"kami\" Susanoo. The effects director and his crew shot several key sequences included in the film, such as a battle between Mifune's character Susanoo and the eight-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi and an eruption of Mount Fuji. On \"The Three Treasures\", Tsuburaya used for the first time the \"Toho Versatile Process\", an adaptation of Toho's optical printing process that he developed on a budget of \u00a5 for widescreen color films and revealed in May of the same year. The movie earned over \u00a5, against an initial \u00a5 budget, ranking as Toho's highest-grossing film of the year and their second-highest-grossing film altogether. He won the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill and was presented with the Special Achievement Award at Movie Day. While he was pleased with the success of \"The Three Treasures\", Tsuburaya became disappointed after seeing a picture of the heads of the Yamata no Orochi prop held up by piano wires in a newspaper article concerning its special effects. Accordingly, he declined an interview with the newspaper because he believed the photograph \"broke children's dreams\".\nWhen the Space Race erupted between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the late 1950s, Tsuburaya counseled Toho to produce a film about a lunar expedition. Therefore, his next film, \"Battle in Outer Space\", was a science fiction epic about a group of astronauts who battle extraterrestrials on the surface of the Moon. Tsuburaya reportedly paid homage to producer George Pal's \"Destination Moon\" (1950) in the film's Moon landing sequence; he would later meet Pal in Los Angeles in 1962. Since films featuring his contributions were attaining global popularity and praise for Japanese cinema, Hearst filmed Tsuburaya directing the effects for \"Battle in Outer Space\", and he later received the Special Award of Merit at the fourth Movie Day ceremony prior to its release.\nFrom \"The Secret of the Telegian\" to \"Ch\u016bshingura\" (1960\u20131962).\nA smaller-scale science fiction film, entitled \"The Secret of the Telegian\", which was Toho's second installment in the Transforming Human Series, marked Tsuburaya's first assignment of 1960. He then took on a project of a much larger extent, \"Storm Over the Pacific\", the first-ever war film in color. His department created notably large miniatures for the film, with a 13-meter long miniature being filmed by Tsuburaya on the Miura Coast. \"Storm Over the Pacific\" was also Toho's first film to require the use of the \"Big Pool\", which had been completed in February 1960. The pool would later be used in the production of every \"Godzilla\" film, before being demolished at the end of the filming process for \"\" (2004). \"Storm Over the Pacific\" obtained critical acclaim upon its release, with numerous of Tsuburaya's effects sequences being later featured in \"Midway\" (1976), a film by Jack Smight that was also about the Pacific War. Throughout the rest of 1960, Tsuburaya worked on other notable productions, such as the third film in the Transforming Human Series, \"The Human Vapor\"; he also oversaw the creation of an extremely detailed miniature of Osaka Castle and directed its destruction scene for Hiroshi Inagaki's \"jidaigeki\" film \"The Story of Osaka Castle\", and then directed the tsunami sequence in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's 1948 novel \"The Big Wave\".\nIn 1961, Tsuburaya directed the effects for \"Mothra\", another \"kaiju\" film created in collaboration with Ishir\u014d Honda. Allegedly inspired by his own dreams, Tsuburaya created the eponymous giant, moth-like \"kaiju\", which would go on to become one of the icons of Japanese fantasy cinema, alongside Godzilla and Rodan, and appear in numerous films thereafter. Though the overall budget for \"Mothra\" allowed the effects department to create the largest-scale miniature set ever constructed for a Toho production, Tsuburaya was displeased with some of the sequences shot for the film, including some composite cuts of the \"Shobijin\". Nonetheless, he decided to keep these scenes upon editing \"Mothra\" in post-production. The film was released on July 30, 1961, becoming a massive box office hit and, as stated by biographer August Ragone, an \"instant classic\" alongside Honda and Tsuburaya's earlier \"kaiju\" films \"Godzilla\" and \"Rodan\".\nAfter directing blue screen dream scenes with actor Toshiro Mifune for Hiroshi Inagaki's film \"The Youth and His Amulet\" (1961), Tsuburaya moved on to direct the effects for Sh\u016be Matsubayashi's \u00a5 epic \"tokusatsu\" film \"The Last War\", which emerged as a major hit upon its October 1961 release, with Tsuburaya's effects receiving critical acclaim. The effects director himself would later list \"The Last War\" as one of his \"masterpieces\". Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, assured from the box office success of \"Mothra\" and \"The Last War\", gave Honda and Tsuburaya their greatest budget yet and 300 days to shoot \"Gorath\", their next science fiction epic. Although \"Gorath\" is considered to feature some of Tsuburaya's best work as a special effects director, it was a box office failure when it was released in March 1962. On May 15, the director appeared on NK Educational TV's program \"Japanese Standards\"; in July, he finished directing the effects for \"The Story of Shim Cheong\", a South Korean-produced film that was never released in Japan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n My movie company came up with a very interesting script that combined \"King Kong\" and \"Godzilla\", so I couldn't help working on this production, instead of my new fantasy films. This script is very special to me; it struck a deep emotional chord, because it was seeing \"King Kong\" back in 1933 that sparked my interest in the world of special visual effects.\n\u2014Eiji Tsuburaya (1962)\nAfter filming \"Gorath\", Tsuburaya began planning to work on other projects, such as a new version of \"Princess Kaguya\". However, he postponed those as soon as he was given the opportunity to direct the special effects for Honda's crossover film \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\". The script's early drafts were sent back with notes from Toho asking for the monster antics to be as \"funny as possible\"; Tsuburaya embraced this approach, seeking to emotionally appeal to children and expand the genre's audience. Many of the sequences for the battle between the two monsters were purposefully filled with humorous details, but the approach was not favored by most of the effects crew, who \"couldn't believe\" some of the things Tsuburaya asked them to do, such as Kong and Godzilla volleying a giant boulder back and forth. For their portrayals, Tsuburaya gave Haruo Nakajima (playing Godzilla) and Shoichi Hirose (playing King Kong) freedom to choreograph their own moves. Tsuburaya directed sequences at a miniature outdoor set on the Miura Coast, which depicted the giant octopus's attack on the Faro Island village. During its original theatrical release in August 1962, \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" became the second-highest-grossing Japanese film in history and was watched by 11.2 million people, leading it to be regarded as the most-attended film in the \"Godzilla\" series.\nTsuburaya's final film release of 1962 was Inagaki's epic \"jidaigeki\" film \"\", for which he and his department made forced perspective stages and various optical effects. Produced by Toho\u2014like \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\"\u2014in celebration of their 30th anniversary, \"Ch\u016bshingura\" was the company's fourth highest-grossing film of the year, and their tenth-highest altogether.\nBirth of a company to last years: 1963\u20131970.\nBirth of a company and career expansion (1963\u20131964).\nThe first movie released in 1963 to feature Tsuburaya's contributions was another war film by Sh\u016be Matsubayashi, \"Attack Squadron!\", distributed in January of that year. Despite not being an epic film, unlike Toho's previous war movies, \"Attack Squadron!\" still featured several miniature Japanese and American aircraft, crafted by Tsuburaya's crew, with some of the models being controlled via radio control. The sole new miniature battleship built for the film was \"Yamato\", an enormous motorized model constructed at 1/15 scale and measuring 17.5 meters (or 57.5 feet).\nAfter visiting Hollywood in order to study the special effects work of major American studios, Tsuburaya founded his own independent company, Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions (later called simply Tsuburaya Productions), on April 12, 1963. It was initially handled entirely by his family: Tsuburaya was reported as its director general and president; his wife Masano was on the director's board; his second son Noboru was appointed as accountant. Hajime, Tsuburaya's eldest son, would soon join the company as well, leaving his award-winning directorial employment at the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Around August of the same year, photography assistant Kiyoshi Suzuki was hired alongside Koichi Takano, a former news cameraman for Kyodo Television. Takano was directly involved in Tsuburaya Productions' first-ever full-scale \"tokusatsu\" production, \"Alone Across the Pacific\" (1963), which required twenty-five effects sequences. Throughout the rest of the year, Tsuburaya worked both for his new company and Toho, where he was still at the helm of the effects department, despite having terminated his exclusive deal with the company.\nThe second film released in 1963 to feature his contributions was Li Han-hsiang's Hong Kong musical film \"The Love Eterne\". The effects director was tasked to stage the scene where an earthquake split the tomb of the character Liang Shanbo (played by Ivy Ling Po) in two and the protagonist (played by Betty Loh Ti) ascended into heaven. Cinematographer traveled to Japan in order to film Tsuburaya's effects at Shintoho's second studio. Thereafter, the special effects director moved on to the World War I adventure film \"The Siege of Fort Bismarck\". In his first partnership with director Kengo Furusawa, Tsuburaya's division developed several new models for the film, including large-scale miniatures, full-scale replications of early twentieth-century flying vehicles, and an enormous outdoor model set of Fort Bismarck. According to Ragone, Tsuburaya enjoyed working on this film, despite aiming to make his own tribute feature to Japanese aviation pioneers.\nShortly after completing \"The Siege of Fort Bismarck\" in April 1963, he began pre-production work on \"Matango\", another film created in cooperation with Ishir\u014d Honda, which was the final entry in the Transforming Human Series. In contrast with the majority of Toho's previous monster-themed films, the actors were capable of psychical interaction with the suit actors portraying the monsters on a sound stage. Sadao Iizuka said that Tsuburaya \"focused\" Toho to purchase the \"Optical Printer 1900 Series\" in order to facilitate the production of special effects, while noting that optical synthesis technology became popular following the film's release. A box office failure upon its Japanese release, \"Matango\" was not included in \"Kinema Junpo\"'s list of height-grossing films for the year, and has been considered as one of Honda and Tsuburaya's most obscure movies ever since, being deemed as a \"virtually unknown film\".\nTsuburaya soon moved on to film miniatures and produce optical animation (via his newly purchased Optical Printer 1900 Series) for \"The Lost World of Sinbad\". This film, directed by Senkichi Taniguchi from a screenplay by \"Mothra\" and \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" writer Shinichi Sekizawa, included an acclaimed choreographed chase sequence between a wizard and a witch, created via animation and matte photography, which gained Tsuburaya another Japan Technical Award for Special Skill.\nTsuburaya almost immediately started to work on another Honda-directed science fiction \"tokusatsu\" movie, \"Atragon\" (1963). Based on Shunr\u014d Oshikawa's novel \"The Undersea Warship\" and incorporated with Shigeru Komatsuzaki's novel \"Undersea Empire\", the film concerns a group of former colleagues, friends, and family that must convince the captain of the battleship \"Gotengo\", Hachiro Jinguji (played by Jun Tazaki), to use his battleship to save the world from the invading ancient undersea civilization of Mu, who are using their advanced technology and their guardian sea dragon, Manda, in an attempt to take over the surface world. Since Toho aimed to distribute the film in Japanese theaters on December 22 of that year, Tsuburaya was given roughly two months to shoot the effects sequences for \"Atragon\". As a result, in order to achieve the company's goal, he separated his special effects team into two units, assuring that it would allow him to complete the assignment as soon as possible. Although it was quickly converted and developed, the film is regarded as \"one of the cornerstones of Japanese cinema\" and is still often referenced in media.\nWhile working on \"Atragon\", Tsuburaya was also concluding model effects for the Hiroshi Inagaki-directed \"jidaigeki\" film, \"Whirlwind\" (1964). During this period of time, lack of sleep and workload-related stress were taking a toll on Tsuburaya's health, so much that he was often found sleeping in his chair during scene set-ups for his effects shoots.\nThe fourth installment in the \"Godzilla\" movie series, \"Mothra vs. Godzilla\" (1964), was Tsuburaya's next project. Often regarded as the best \"kaiju\" film to feature his works, it was produced in celebration of the tenth-anniversary of Toho's \"kaiju\" films and depicts the battle between Godzilla and the title character of the 1961 film \"Mothra\". Tsuburaya utilized his 1900 optical printer to remove damage in composite photographs for the picture and create Godzilla's atomic breath; he also went on location to shoot some composite plates of Nagoya Castle for the scene where Godzilla destroyed the building. Since \"Godzilla\" actor Haruo Nakajima could not destroy the castle's model entirely, as originally planned, Tsuburaya first attempted to salvage the shot by making Godzilla seem enraged by the castle's strong fortification, before eventually choosing to re-shoot the scene with a more fragile model. He also went on location to shoot a segment featuring the United States Navy discharging missiles at Godzilla: this scene was included in the movie's version for the U.S. market, whereas it was omitted from the original Japanese version. This was one of the rare occasions when a sequence featuring Godzilla was shot outside Toho Studios.\nJapanese-American coproductions and \"Ultra Q\" (1964\u20131965).\nIn the spring of 1964, Tsuburaya received a visit from frequent collaborator Ishir\u014d Honda on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai. The effects director was shooting a dogfight and plane crash sequence for Frank Sinatra's \"None but the Brave\" (released in 1965), the renowned singer and actor's sole directorial picture. As the first major Japanese-American co-production, the epic anti-war film revolved around a troop of American soldiers, stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during World War II, who are forced to collaborate with an opposition Japanese unit that has also been stranded on the same island. During Honda's visit, Tsuburaya told him he was working on his first television series for Tsuburaya Productions, then-titled \"Unbalance,\" but was struggling to find a lead actor for it. Honda convinced Kenji Sahara (who starred in \"None but the Brave\" and several Honda-Tsuburaya \"kaiju\" films) to play the team leader for the intended show, which would later become \"Ultra Q\" (1966). \"None but the Brave\" was later released in Japan by Toho on January 15, 1965, and was distributed by Warner Bros. in the U.S. the following month.\nIn January 1964, while in New York, Tsuburaya ordered Oxberry's 1200 optical printer, a model that at the time was owned by only one other studio in the entire world: Disney. Despite having to spend a then-record \u00a5 fee, Tsuburaya wanted to purchase the new printer for Tsuburaya Productions because it was one of the most adaptable post-production tools: moreover, he had used Oxberry's previous iteration of the device on films such as \"Matango\". He went on to operate this technology on \"Ultra Q\", Tsuburaya Productions' first television series, which was a combination of two of his previously discarded projects, tentatively titled \"Unbalance\" and \"WoO\". Principal photography on \"Ultra Q\" began on September 27, 1964, with the shooting of the episode \"Mammoth Flower\". Airing on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from January 2 to July 3, 1966, the series follows the adventures of a trio who investigates strange phenomena, ranging from supernatural threats to \"kaiju\", in the 20th century. Upon broadcast, around 30% of Japanese households with televisions watched the show, making Tsuburaya a household name and gaining him even more attention from the media, who dubbed him the \"God of \"Tokusatsu\"\".\nAfter directing the effects on Honda's \"kaiju\" film \"Dogora\" (released in August 1964), Tsuburaya renewed their collaboration for the \"kaiju\" film, \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\", making 1964 the only time two \"Godzilla\" movies were ever released in the same year (the first one being \"Mothra vs. Godzilla\"). Conceived as one of the features celebrating ten years of Toho's \"kaiju\" films, \"Ghidorah\" featured a dragon \"kaiju\" designed as an homage to Yamata no Orochi, King Ghidorah, who opposed Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra in the film. Tsuburaya and Toho executives decided to anthropomorphize the monsters for the film, despite Honda feeling \"uncomfortable\" with the decision and being reluctant to use The Peanuts (who previously played Mothra's fairies in the namesake film) as the interpreters for the \"kaiju\" in the summit scene. Released on December 20, 1964, \"Ghidorah\" was a massive box office hit, grossing \u00a5, relatively more than \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\", the series' previous record holder. King Ghidorah would go on to become a frequent antagonist of the \"Godzilla\" franchise.\nTsuburaya began 1965 by directing the effects for Seiji Maruyama's war film \"\". Tsuburaya spent two months filming the scene where the fleet circles Kiska Island in thick fog on an indoor stage set since the fog could not be controlled by the wind during open shooting. The sequence where the fleet slips through the rocks was realized by laying a rail at the bottom of the special effects pool and running the warship's miniature on it. The miniatures could not be very large for on-set shooting, and the water flow was pumped to adjust the proportions of the waves and wakes. A large outdoor pool is used in the scene of port entry and departure without fog. For his work on \"Kiska\", Tsuburaya won a Japan Technical Award for Special Skill at the 19th Japan Technical Awards.\nHis next production, \"Frankenstein vs. Baragon\" (1965), depicted Frankenstein's monster fighting a new subterranean \"kaiju\", named Baragon in Japan. Tsuburaya was reportedly enthusiastic about working on the film because the titular monsters were going to be smaller than normal, allowing his team to build larger model sets than the ones used in \"Godzilla\" movies: plus, an actor in make-up\u2014K\u014dji Furuhata\u2014would be involved to play Frankenstein, rather than leaving the role to a stuntman in a monster suit. In spite of featuring model sets among the biggest and most detailed models for a Honda-Tsuburaya collaboration, some critics have questioned several of Tsuburaya's ideas, including a puppet used to portray a horse, instead of an actual equine, for a sequence in which Baragon overruns a farmstead. According to Koichi Takano, Tsuburaya said that he used the puppet because it was \"more fun\". Tsuburaya also made a scene depicting the atomic bomb falling upon Hiroshima, which Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski called an \"impressionistic display of smoke and fire\".\nAfter post-production on the film was finalized for its Japanese release, held two days after the twentieth anniversary of the Hiroshima atomic bombing (August 8, 1965), American co-producer Henry G. Saperstein asked for Toho to film a new ending for the U.S. version: Tsuburaya and Honda, accordingly, re-assembled the cast and crew to shoot the new ending, although it was eventually left unused in both American and Japanese iterations of the motion picture. Still, the alternative ending was later screened at a fan convention in 1982, before featuring as a bonus scene on home video.\nFollowing \"Frankenstein vs. Baragon\", Tsuburaya quickly moved on to his next film, Kengo Furusawa's \"The Crazy Adventure\", produced in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Crazy Cats comedy group. Inspired by popular spy films of the time, Tsuburaya's department extensively used \"wire action\" in outdoor locations, while lead actor Hitoshi Ueki performed most of the movie's action sequences without any stunts. Tsuburaya also directed miniature effects sequences for the film. Released in Japan on October 31, 1965, \"The Crazy Adventure\" was another box office hit for Tsuburaya, earning even more than \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\".\nThen, Tsuburaya worked on Honda's \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" (1965), the sixth film in the \"Godzilla\" franchise and Sh\u014dwa period, as well as the second collaboration between Toho and UPA. A direct sequel to \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\", the movie focuses on two astronauts who land on a planet occupied by an alien race, known as the \"Xiliens\", as they ask humanity for assistance with Godzilla and Rodan in defeating the \"intruder\" King Ghidorah. After bringing the astronauts, scientist Sakurai, Godzilla, and Rodan to their planet, the aliens attempt to exploit Ghidorah, Godzilla, and Rodan to conquer the Earth by mind-controlling them. The last \"Godzilla\" film to feature the contributions of Tsuburaya's entire effects unit, \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" notably features Godzilla's renowned victory dance, which derived from the \"shie!\" dance featured in Fujio Akatsuka's comedy manga series \"Osomatsu-kun\" (1962\u20131969), a popular culture sensation at the time of the film's production. The dance was included in the film after a Toho employee suggested it to Tsuburaya, who was already supportive of anthropomorphizing monster characters with comical characteristics. For his work on \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\", the director obtained the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill the following year.\n\"Ultraman\" and beyond (1966\u20131967).\nAt the height of \"Ultra Q\"'s popularity, TBS aired \"The Father of \"Ultra Q\"\", an episode of their documentary series \"Modern Leaders\", on June 2, 1966. Throughout the episode, Tsuburaya was filmed at work and elsewhere, being even interviewed by individuals dressed in \"Ultra Q\" monster costumes: in this instance, he mentioned for the first time that he was working on a new show to follow \"Ultra Q\", which later turned out to be \"Ultraman\".\nTsuburaya had begun working on the new \"tokusatsu\" series in the autumn of the previous year: TBS executives wanted to produce a series as thriving as \"Ultra Q\" and wanted a full-color program that would \"take the monster line to the next level\". Tsuburaya and writer Tetsuo Kinj\u014d decided to take the barebones concept of \"Ultra Q\" about civilians and scientists haggling monsters: they came up with the idea of a group, tentatively named the \"Scientific Investigation Agency\" (SIA), formed to deal with \"kaiju\" and supernatural phenomena as the focus of the new show. The pair also agreed to add unused conceptions from \"Ultra Q\" and \"WoO\". Tsuburaya had spent significant amounts of studio money to build his models for the \"Godzilla\" films, so TBS aimed to monetize these miniatures and was looking for a task that could repurpose the sets and suits from the \"Godzilla\" franchise.\nDuring designing, Tsuburaya found the original versions of title character's design to be \"too alien and sinister\", and requested production designer Tohl Narita to keep drafting additional designs as teleplays were being written concurrently. Narita chose to root Ultraman's design in the Greek concept of \"cosmos\" (order and harmony), in contrast to his previous designs for \"Ultra Q\", which had been inspired by the concept of \"khaos\". Tsuburaya provided input on Narita's designs, with some being inspired by the art of Miyamoto Musashi. Ultraman's silver skin symbolized steel from an interstellar rocket, while the red lining represented the surface of Mars. As stated by biographer August Ragone, Ultraman became Tsuburaya's \"most popular and enduring creation\".\nThe filming sessions for \"Ultraman\" began in March 1966, and the crew was divided into three separate groups for its live-action and special effects. Tsuburaya Productions and TBS initially planned to start broadcasting the series on July 17, 1966, but the latter company chose to release it the week before. Tsuburaya supervised the production of every episode of the series and served as the \"de facto\" special effects director for episodes 18 and 19.\nAfter a few meetings between the two companies and sponsors, it was decided that a pilot episode, originally planned as the \"Ultraman Eve Festival\", would introduce the show's title character. The pilot episode was aired on July 10\u2014one of the dates that have been cited as Tsuburaya's birthday\u2014 of that same year, under the title \"The Birth of Ultraman: An Ultraman Premiere Celebration\". \"Ultraman\" became a larger hit than its predecessor, obtaining a 40% viewership. With monsters now available to watch at home weekly, children fewer asked their parents to take them to the theater: consequently, Tsuburaya Productions' triumph in television was diverting box-office money from Toho's \"kaiju\" films.\nAlso in 1966, Tsuburaya worked once again with Honda for the \"kaiju film The War of the Gargantuas\", produced in collaboration with Henry G. Saperstein, which centered on scientists investigating the appearance of two giant hairy humanoids who eventually fight each other in Tokyo. Initially drafted as a sequel to \"Frankenstein vs. Baragon\", the film went through several tentative titles during scripting, and the final film was referred to by film chronicler Stuart Galbraith IV as a \"quasi\u2013sequel\" to its predecessor. The film premiered in Japan in July 1966.\nAfter Tsuburaya's series \"Booska the Friendly Beast\" began airing on television in November 1966, he received his last credit as \"special effects director\" on a \"Godzilla\" film for \"Ebirah, Horror of the Deep\". However, his disciple Sadamasa Arikawa actually served as a \"de facto\" special effects director for this film, with Tsuburaya's credit being merely ceremonial. The following year, Tsuburaya directed the effects for \"King Kong Escapes\", a Japanese-American co-production created to celebrate Toho's thirty-fifth anniversary. In homage to the dinosaur fighting scene from \"King Kong\" (1933), the director introduced Gorosaurus, a dinosaurian \"kaiju\" that battles Kong on Mondo Island in the film. The ensuing 1967 release featuring Tsuburaya's contributions was \"Ultraseven\", the third entry in the \"Ultra\" series, which had been influenced by the British TV series \"Thunderbirds\". The series received a 33.7% rating upon beginning airing on October 7, 1967. Also in 1967, he was appointed \"special effects supervisor\" and handed over the position of special effects director for the \"Godzilla\" film series to Arikawa, starting with \"Son of Godzilla\".\nFinal works, last years, and death (1968\u20131970).\nIn 1967, Tsuburaya Productions' writing crew took elements from Shinichi Sekizawa's screenplay, \"The Flying Battleship\", and inserted concepts from it into a TV series, \"Mighty Jack,\" which was similar in concept to \"James Bond\" and \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\". Concerning a team of secret agents established by a prosperous industrialist to oppose the acts of a military organization, referred to as \"Q\", \"Mighty Jack\" was aimed at a more mature audience, in contrary to the \"Ultra\" series and \"Booska the Friendly Beast\". Due to pressure from Fuji TV, the series declined rapidly after the release of its first episode on April 6, 1968, as a consequence of its poor quality: many teleplays were filmed without revision, effects work frequently lacked time, and reshoots were often unattainable. Fuji TV considered the series as a commercial failure, due to its 8.3% audience rating, and they canceled it after Tsuburaya Productions had finished producing just 13 of the scheduled 26 episodes. A sequel to the series, titled \"Fight! Mighty Jack\", later began broadcasting in July 1968.\nWith budgets rising, less returning crew, and theatergoers being dragged away by television, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka chose to conclude the \"Godzilla\" series but offered one last film for the original staff. Honda's consequential \"kaiju\" epic, \"Destroy All Monsters\" (1968), featured effects directed by Sadamasa Arikawa, which Tsuburaya allegedly supervised. His next release of that year was another Seiji Maruyama's war epic, \"Admiral Yamamoto\", which starred Toshiro Mifune as Imperial Japanese Navy Marshal Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was previously the topic of Honda and Tsuburaya's \"Eagle of the Pacific\"). \"Destroy All Monsters\" was the twelfth-highest grossing domestic film of 1968, registering an approximately \u00a5-worth gain, while \"Admiral Yamamoto\" was the second-highest grosser, at roughly \u00a5. On September 15, 1968, the week after the final episode of \"Ultraseven\" was broadcast and just over a month after \"Admiral Yamamoto\" was distributed to Japanese theaters by Toho, the director's following project for Tsuburaya Productions, \"\", began airing on the TBS, where he served as the show's supervisor.\n\"Latitude Zero\", released by Toho in July 1969, was a Japanese-American collaboration produced by Toho and Don Sharp Productions. The production was reported to have had a budget of \u00a5 (equivalent to about $), but Tsuburaya's department had difficulty making realistic creatures for the picture after its American producer pulled out of the project. In comparison, retrospective writers have praised Tsuburaya's model work, especially his submarines, which Ryfle and Godziszewski noted resembled \"Thunderbirds\" machines in Gerry Anderson's show of the same name. Like Honda and Tsuburaya's previous effort, \"Latitude Zero\" only grossed \u00a5 ($), making it a box office failure.\nTsuburaya quickly moved on to his next project, \"Battle of the Japan Sea\", regarded as the third film in the \"Toho 8.15 series\" (following \"Japan's Longest Day\" and \"Admiral Yamamoto\"). Tsuburaya was provided with his largest budget ever for the Seiji Maruyama-directed war epic film about the Russo-Japanese War. Thus, 60 members of his department's artists created an estimated 107 ship miniatures for the film and constructed a 13-meter model replica of the Imperial Japanese Navy's battleship \"Mikasa,\" in contrast to the other 3-meter ships. Released in August 1969, \"Battle of the Japan Sea\" was the second highest Japanese grosser of 1969, earning \u00a5 against its \u00a5 budget. Deemed one of Tsuburaya's masterpieces, \"Battle of the Japan Sea\" was the last production he officially took part in as the special effects director. On the same month, Tsuburaya Productions' next series, \"Horror Theater Unbalance\" (aired in 1973), entered the production process: Tsuburaya was credited as its supervisor.\nTsuburaya and several of Toho's effects crew members spent the majority of 1969 working together to create \"Birth of the Japanese Islands\", an audiovisual exhibit simulating earthquakes and volcanoes, which was set to be part of Mitsubishi's pavilion at the Expo '70 in Suita, Osaka Prefecture. His commitment to the project prevented him from being involved in the production of \"All Monsters Attack\" (1969), and director Honda handled special effects instead of him for the first time. Nonetheless, the director stated that Tsuburaya was \"personally involved with the editing,\" adding: \"The film may have been generally put together [by others], but he definitely looked it over and instructed the staff to shorten certain scenes, and so on.\"\nIgnoring his doctor's recent advice to reduce his workload due to declining health, Tsuburaya started displaying symptoms of unstable angina, and he collapsed while visiting the Naruto whirlpools during the shooting sessions for the Expo '70 film presentation. He was subsequently sent to Mishuku Hospital in Meguro to continue his recovery, but refused to remain there, as he expected to complete \"Birth of the Japanese Islands\" on schedule: instead, he accepted an offer to recover and receive medical treatment at Ukiyama Villa on the Izu Peninsula in It\u014d, Shizuoka, where he was instructed to cancel any assignments. Concerned about Tsuburaya's future, his son Hajime quit his job at TBS and officially took over his father's position as the president of Tsuburaya Productions on November 30, 1969.\nIn December 1969, Tsuburaya completed filming the Expo '70 project and moved to his Ukiyama Villa with his wife Masano, where he persisted in writing his autobiography and the film outlines \"Japan Airplane Guy\" and \"Princess Kaguya\". While continuing to write the \"Japan Airplane Guy\" story treatment daily, he expressed his desire to work on more projects in the future and return to Tokyo on January 26, 1970. However, on January 25, 1970, at 10:15 P.M., Masano awoke and discovered that Tsuburaya had died while sleeping with her at the villa in It\u014d, Shizuoka: he was 68 years old. Japanese sources have cited the cause of his death as angina associated with an asthma attack.\nOn January 27, a mourning tradition took place at the Tsuburaya family's house. His funeral was held at the Seij\u014d Catholic Church on January 29, with his eldest son Hajime serving as the chief mourner. The following day, he was posthumously awarded the Honorary Chairman Award by the Japanese Society of Cinematographers and the Order of the Sacred Treasure by emperor Hirohito. A Catholic service was held at Toho Studios on February 2, with \"The Last War\" producer Sanezumi Fujimoto providing the services. Five hundred friends and colleagues attended the service, including actor Kazuo Hasegawa, \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" director Kajir\u014d Yamamoto, \"The Three Treasures\" director Hiroshi Inagaki, and \"A Thousand and One Nights with Toho\" director Kon Ichikawa. He was later entombed at the Catholic Cemetery in Fuch\u016b, Tokyo, Japan.\nFilmmaking.\nStyle, themes, and techniques.\nTsuburaya's career in film production evolved from small-scale \"jidaigeki\" films to financially successful war and science fiction epics. During his stint as a cinematographer in the early 20th century, Tsuburaya closely researched international cinema in order to incorporate some of the techniques and improve his innovative style; some of these films include: \"The Lost World\" (1925), \"Metropolis\" (1927), and \"King Kong\" (1933). Tsuburaya remarked that \"King Kong\" heavily influenced him to work in special effects. He decided to create special effects sequences in films by using miniature effects and synthesis technology involving layered film strips. Tsuburaya constantly converted new special effects techniques and tested them on a daily basis and became the founder and head of Japanese special effects (known as \"Tokusatsu\"), earning him the title \"Father of \"Tokusatsu\"\". Biographer August Ragone writes that his footage, which was always filmed live on a soundstage, in comparison to modern techniques such as computer-generated imagery, could be \"silly or deadly, beautiful or terrifying, but no matter how fanciful or fantastic, his visual effects seem to live and breathe with a life of their own.\"\nFor \"Godzilla\" (1954), Tsuburaya decided to create a new suit acting technique, later known as \"suitmation\", because the film's small budget and tight schedule restrained him from portraying Godzilla via stop motion (\u00e0 la \"King Kong\"). Film historian Steve Ryfle writes that, although suitmation was not as elaborate as the stop motion techniques by effects pioneers Willis H. O'Brien (creator of the effects in \"King Kong\") and Ray Harryhausen (creator of the effects in \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\"), it gave the special effects director a more effective approach to depict the destruction sequences that made Godzilla famous.\nTsuburaya's endeavors in films often depicted nuclear holocausts, world wars, monster invasions, and intergalactic conflicts. Despite his movies featuring these apocalyptic and mass destructive themes, he opposed including themes of graphic violence\u2014especially bleeding and slaughter\u2014in his \"kaiju\" films, believing it was inappropriate for the younger members of the audience. However, Toho executives (such as Iwao Mori) urged Tsuburaya to feature gore in his \"kaiju\" films during the late 1960s, due to the rise in popularity of juvenile-targeted television shows that featured an increase in violent content, with even Tsuburaya's own shows \"Ultraman\" and \"Ultraseven\" depicting heroes decapitating, slashing, chopping, or otherwise injuring their monster adversaries. According to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Teruyoshi Nakano, Tsuburaya told Toho executives: \"These movies are for kids. It's nonsense. Why do you enjoy showing them blood?\" Rather than have violent themes in his films, Tsuburaya continually employed lighthearted comedy and humanism in his \"tokusatsu\" work. As written by Ryfle, it is implied that this is due to him still being a \"child at heart\" and having a \"soft spot in his heart for children\" during his late life. In 1962, Tsuburaya explained: \"My heart and mind are as they were when I was a child. Then I loved to play with toys and to read stories of magic. I still do. My wish is only to make life happier and more beautiful for those who will go and see my films of fantasy.\" His compassion for children helped shape his legacy; notably, the \"Godzilla\" films produced after his death, featuring effects by Nakano, displayed large amounts of graphic violence.\nRelationship with cast and crew.\nAccording to Ishir\u014d Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, it was challenging to cooperate with Tsuburaya, especially for directors. Tsuburaya refused to surrender control of his sector to the mainstream director: he refused to allow directors to stare into the viewfinder in case they assessed elements like the set or camera position and opposed when his footage was re-edited. During the production of \"Godzilla\" (1954), however, Tsuburaya formed a bond with Honda, who had a completely different personality, being deemed as calm and courteous, rarely expressing his emotions towards others. Ryfle and Godziszewski stated that the two infrequently interacted outside Toho Studios and were not personal comrades, but nevertheless shared a \"\"tsu-ka\" relationship\". Honda's assistant director said that \"Other directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Jun Fukuda, and Sh\u016be Matsubayashi also worked with Mr. Tsuburaya, but they were all the 'me-first' type and they really didn't work well together. Directors tend to think they are number one, and the effects team should just follow behind. Mr. Tsuburaya didn't appreciate that. Honda-\"san\" and Mr. Tsuburaya got along so well because they were both very mature men.\"\nDespite often making unrelenting directions on his crew, Tsuburaya was admired by colleagues, many of whom were younger than him and called him an \"uncle\", mentor, or the \"Old Man\". Godzilla suit actor Haruo Nakajima remarked that although Tsuburaya was usually smiling and had a refreshing disposition onset, he was often angry with the staff. Special effects cinematographer Tomioka Mototaka claimed he was in a position to be scolded by Tsuburaya against cinematographer Sadamasa Arikawa; photography assistants Takao Tsurumi and Mitsuru Chokai testified that Tsuburaya did not get angry directly when young individuals in his unit failed, but scolded Arikawa and others, instead.\nOn the contrary, Tsuburaya was rarely infuriated by actors. In an interview regarding August Ragone's biography on Tsuburaya, Nakajima said he was a \"very reserved man on the set. Most of the direction he gave me for the performances was, 'I trust you to do it. Do what you feel is best, I'll leave it up to you.' And that's the way he was for most of the films we worked on together after \"Godzilla\".\" He added: \"After the wires broke on the Rodan suit, causing me to fall several meters onto the miniature set, he chided, 'It's good that you didn't die; because I need you to finish the film.'\" In an interview regarding \"Nezura 1964\" (2020), Ultraman suit actor Bin Furuya remarked that Tsuburaya was \"usually a normal kind person\" and always encouraged his actors to \"act as if they were in the kind of film that would give dreams to children\".\nProduction and editing.\nTsuburaya had several methods to shoot his films. During his stint as a cinematographer, he was the first to use crane shooting and key light prior to World War II. According to camera operator Mitsuo Miura, Tsuburaya also filmed \"pseudo nightscapes\" using beer bottle fragments as a filter, and his disciple Sadamasa Arikawa became the first photographer in Japan to shoot with color filters. During his late life, Tsuburaya explained to cinematographer Tomioka that he had always recognized how many frames could be taken with a hand-cranked camera, and he was able to turn it instinctively.\nHonda said that Tsuburaya's approach to film special effects was \"like a physics experiment, no different than trying to make new discoveries.\" Tsuburaya's lighting engineer Kaoru Sait\u014d remarked that his camera work in special effects only moved sideways or moves up and down with a crane once the main position is decided, and the camera itself does not approach forward. Sait\u014d also testified that he demanded the subject approach the camera and never shot the set from the other side of the camera.\nWhen he brainstormed ideas for a new film, Tsuburaya was known for his quiet but intense style. Nakano stated: \"I heard about this episode when Mr. Tsuburaya was returning home from work one day and he ran into this woman who kind of looked familiar to him. So he said, 'Hello, it's been a long time.' Do you know who that woman was? It was his wife! Mr. Tsuburaya was so deep into his own thoughts, he kind of lost himself sometimes.\"\nAccording to Arikawa, Tsuburaya also edited his own film work. Tsuburaya's assistant director, Masakatsu Asai, stated that he memorized the situation and storage location of the cuts he shot. Scripter Keiko Suzuki said Tsuburaya envisioned his own editing plan, and he often filmed scenes unscripted. Thus, for instance, scenes were altered from \"Battle 1\" to \"Aerial Battle 2\".\nLegacy.\nCultural impact.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEiji is a true inspiration, and a one of a kind innovator of special effects, the likes of which we'll probably never see again in cinema.\n \u2014\"Monsters\" (2010) and \"Godzilla\" (2014) director Gareth Edwards\nIn spite of his death, Tsuburaya's name and work remained prominent because his \"tokusatsu\" films and television shows generated a global fandom. A year after his death, Tsuburaya's intent to revitalize \"Ultraman\" was eventuated into \"Return of Ultraman\" (1971-1972), which launched a new string of the \"Ultra\" series throughout the rest of the decade. Despite having difficulty after their father's death, Hajime, Noboru, and Akira kept running Tsuburaya Productions and never gave up his legacy, even when Tsuburaya Productions only had just three employees before the home video revived the \"Ultraman\" series. In 1989, Noboru declared that Ultraman is his father's \"most important legacy\" even if Godzilla is Tsuburaya's most popular character overseas.\nContemporary writers have frequently stated that Tsuburaya is one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema, with biographer August Ragone claiming that Tsuburaya's cinematic importance is on par with Akira Kurosawa. \"The Independent\"'s Doug Bolton wrote that even \"people not familiar with Japanese science fiction will easily recognise [\"sic\"] the legacy of Tsuburaya's work\". \"The Tokusatsu Network\" said that Tsuburaya was \"possibly the most influential figure in the Japanese film industry\" and stated that his legacy \"lives on to this day through his creations and has had a large enough impact for him to be compared to Walt Disney.\"\nNumerous people in the entertainment industry have spoken of their appreciation for Tsuburaya's work or cited it as an inspiration on their own work, including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick, John Carpenter, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hideaki Anno, Will Smith, Chris Kirkpatrick, Guillermo del Toro, Shinji Higuchi, Shunji Iwai, Kazuo Miyagawa, and \"Attack on Titan\" creator Hajime Isayama. During the early 1970s, Lucas visited Toho when looking for a company to produce the special effects for \"Star Wars\" (1977) since Tsuburaya had established the company as a powerhouse for producing special effects. Spielberg stated that Tsuburaya's \"Godzilla\" was the \"most masterful of all the dinosaur movies, because it made you believe that it was really happening.\" His work has also been cited as the inspiration for the music video of Beastie Boys' song \"Intergalactic\", the series \"Power Rangers\" and the film \"Pacific Rim\", among other projects.\nTributes.\nTsuburaya had intended to work on Honda's \"Space Amoeba\" (1970), but he died shortly after filming began. While the film was completed in Tsuburaya's honor and was his last project to be involved in, Toho executives refused to grant him a dedication in its opening credits.\nA script for a project entitled \"Princess Kaguya\" was written by Tsuburaya shortly before he died in Izu. Motivated by his father's desire to work on another adaptation of the tale, Hajime Tsubruaya attempted to produce \"Princess Kaguya\" into a film for Tsuburaya Productions' 10th anniversary. In the preface of Hiroyasu Yamaura's script for the film, Hajime said he had taken \"great pains to incorporate the strengths of various folk tales and fairy tales into a work that children around the world would honestly enjoy\". Despite his tireless efforts, he died on the morning of February 9, 1973, before director Yoshiyuki Kuroda was scheduled to begin production that evening. Thus, production on the project was canceled. In 1987, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka turned Eiji Tsuburaya's lifelong ambition into a live-action movie titled \"Princess from the Moon\", which featured effects directed by Tsuburaya's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Teruyoshi Nakano.\nIn 2001, two toy companies distributed figures of Tsuburaya in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. In celebration of the 114th anniversary of his birth, Google artist Jennifer Hom and her colleagues made an animated doodle of his work in special effects on July 7, 2015. The doodle allowed users to create a scene from one of Tsuburaya's key monster movies and television shows.\nOn January 11, 2019, after construction over a period of five years, the Eiji Tsuburaya Museum opened in his hometown of Sukagawa, a tribute to his life and work in film and television. During the museum's opening ceremony, Mayor Katsuya Hashimoto stated that the museum is \"an archival center that will disseminate Japanese special effects to the world.\" Later that year, filmmaker Minoru Kawasaki began filming \"Monster Seafood Wars\", a \"kaiju\" film loosely based on his unmade film prior to production of \"Godzilla\" about a giant octopus that attacked Tokyo.\nIn commemoration of 120 years since his birth, the National Film Archive of Japan held a celebratory event in Sukagawa in cooperation with Tsuburaya Productions from August to November 2021. In September 2021, the first screening of \"Princess Kaguya\" since its original 1935 release was held at the event (However, it was in shortened form since the original print is still believed to be lost).\nOn July 10, 2022, a screening of \"Shin Ultraman\" (2022) was held at the City Cultural Center in Sukagawa as a tribute to Tsuburaya and his series \"Ultraman\" (1966-1967), on which the film was based. The screening was attended by an estimated 950 people, with \"Shin Ultraman\" director Shinji Higuchi and star Takumi Saitoh discussing the legacy of Tsuburaya's work afterward.\nFilmmaker and visual effects artist Takashi Yamazaki paid homage to Tsuburaya's work in his acclaimed 2023 film \"Godzilla Minus One\".\nPortrayals.\nMany actors have played Tsuburaya in television dramas and programs. For his portrayal in the 1989 television drama \"The Men Who Made Ultraman\", an unidentified renowned Toho actor who had been starring in many of the company's box office hits since before \"Godzilla\" (1954) was initially cast as Tsuburaya. However, the famed actor declined the offer, believing he lacked resemblance in appearance to Tsuburaya and therefore was replaced by actor K\u014d Nishimura. In 1993, filmmaker Seijun Suzuki played Tsuburaya in the television drama \"I Loved Ultraseven\". For \"The Pair of Ultraman\", a 2022 television documentary on the two screenwriters behind \"Ultraman\", he was portrayed by Toshiki Ayada.\nSelected filmography.\nBecause he worked on roughly 250 films over his five-decade career, the following is only a selection of significant productions, and a more comprehensive list, including most of the media that featured his contributions, is covered in a separate article.\nFilms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*\"A Page of Madness\" (1926)\nTelevision.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*\"Mighty Atom\" (1959\u20131960)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59363", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59363", "title": "Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor", "text": "British politician (1879\u20131964)\nNancy Witcher Astor, Viscountess Astor (19 May 1879 \u2013 2 May 1964) was an American-born British politician who was the first woman seated as a Member of Parliament (MP), serving from 1919 to 1945. Astor was born in Danville, Virginia, and raised in Greenwood, Virginia. Her first marriage, to socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, was unhappy and ended in divorce. She then moved to England and married American-born Englishman Waldorf Astor in 1906.\nAfter her second husband succeed to his father's peerage and entered the House of Lords, she entered politics as a member of the Unionist Party (now the Conservative Party) and, at the by-election caused by his elevation, won his former seat of Plymouth Sutton in 1919, becoming the first woman to sit as an MP in the House of Commons. During her time in Parliament, Astor was an advocate for temperance, welfare, education reform and women's rights. She was also an ardent anti-Catholic and anti-communist, and received criticism for her antisemitism and sympathetic view of Nazism.\nAstor served in Parliament until 1945 when she was persuaded to step down, as her outspokenness had made her a political liability in the final years of the Second World War. She retired from politics and largely withdrew from public life following the death of her husband. Astor died in 1964 at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire and was interred at her family estate at Cliveden.\nEarly life.\nNancy Witcher Langhorne was born at the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. She was the eighth of eleven children born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nancy Witcher Keene. Following the abolition of slavery, Chiswell struggled to make his operations profitable, and with the destruction of the war, the family lived in near-poverty for several years before Nancy was born. After her birth, her father gained a job as a tobacco auctioneer in Danville, the centre of bright leaf tobacco and a major marketing and processing centre.\nIn 1874, he won a construction contract with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, using former contacts from his service in the Civil War. By 1892, when Nancy was thirteen years old, her father had re-established his wealth and built a sizeable home. Chiswell Langhorne later moved his family to an estate, known as \"Mirador\", in Albemarle County, Virginia.\nNancy Langhorne had four sisters and three brothers who survived childhood. All of the sisters were known for their \"good looks\". Nancy and her sister Irene both attended St. Catherine's Episcopal School in Richmond, followed by a finishing school in New York City. There Nancy met her first husband, the socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, a first cousin of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who commanded the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit in the Union Army to be composed of African Americans. They married in New York City on 27 October 1897, when she was 18.\nThe marriage was unhappy. Shaw's friends said Nancy became puritanical and rigid after marriage. Her friends said that Shaw was an abusive alcoholic. During their four-year marriage, they had one son, Robert Gould Shaw III (Bobbie). Nancy left Shaw numerous times during their marriage, the first during their honeymoon. In 1903, Nancy's mother died; Nancy gained a divorce and moved back to \"Mirador\" to try to run her father's household but was unsuccessful.\nIn 1904, Nancy took a tour of England, taking with her her son Bobbie, of whom she had gained custody. She fell in love with the country. Since she had been so happy there, her father suggested she move to England. Seeing that she was reluctant, Nancy's father said it was also her mother's wish, and he suggested she take her younger sister Phyllis with her. Nancy and Phyllis moved together to England in 1905. Their older sister Irene had married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and became a model for his Gibson Girls.\nEngland.\nNancy Shaw was already known in English society as an interesting and witty American at a time when numerous wealthy young American women had married into the aristocracy. Her tendency to be saucy in conversation but religiously devout and almost prudish in behaviour confused many of the English men but pleased some of the older socialites. Nancy also began to show her skill at winning over critics. She was once asked by an English woman, \"Have you come to get our husbands?\" Her unexpected response, \"If you knew the trouble I had getting rid of mine...\", charmed her listeners and displayed the wit for which she became known.\nShe married an Englishman, albeit one born in the United States, Waldorf Astor. When he was twelve, his father, William Waldorf Astor had moved the family to England and raised his children in the English aristocratic style. The couple were well matched, as both were American expatriates with similar temperaments. They were of the same age and even born on the same day, 19 May 1879. Astor shared some of Nancy's moral attitudes and had a heart condition that may have contributed to his restraint. After the marriage, the Astors moved into Cliveden, a lavish estate in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames; it was a wedding gift from Astor's father. Nancy Astor developed as a prominent hostess for the social elite.\nThe Astors also bought a substantial London house, No. 4 St. James's Square, now the premises of the Naval &amp; Military Club. A blue plaque unveiled in 1987 commemorates Astor at St. James's Square. Through her many social connections, Lady Astor became involved in a political circle called Milner's Kindergarten. Considered liberal in their age, the group advocated unity and equality among English-speaking people and a continuance or expansion of the British Empire.\nReligious views.\nWith Milner's Kindergarten, Astor began her association with Philip Kerr. The friendship became important in her religious life; they met shortly after Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis regarding his once devout Catholicism. They were attracted to Christian Science, to which they both eventually converted. After converting, she began to proselytise for that faith and played a role in Kerr's conversion to it. She also tried to convert Hilaire Belloc's daughters to Christian Science, which led to a rift between them.\nDespite having Catholic friends including Belloc, Astor had religious views that included a strong vein of anti-Catholicism. She attempted to discourage the hiring of Jews or Catholics to senior positions at \"The Observer\", a newspaper owned by her husband. \nFirst campaign for Parliament.\nSeveral elements of Viscountess Astor's life influenced her first campaign, but she became a candidate after her husband succeeded to the peerage and House of Lords in 1919. He had enjoyed a promising political career for several years before World War I in the House of Commons; after his father's death, he succeeded to his father's peerage as the 2nd Viscount Astor. He automatically became a member of the House of Lords and consequently had to forfeit his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons. With this change, Lady Astor decided to contest the by-election for the vacant Parliamentary seat.\nAstor had not been connected with the women's suffrage movement in the British Isles. However, she was met as she arrived at Paddington station on the day after her election by a crowd of suffragettes, including unnamed women who had been imprisoned and on hunger strike. One said, \"This is the beginning of our era. I am glad to have suffered for this.\"\nViscountess Astor was not the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament. That was achieved by Constance Markievicz, who was the first woman MP elected to Westminster in 1918, but Lady Astor is sometimes erroneously referred to as the first woman MP, or the first woman elected to the UK Parliament, rather than the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament. Countess Markievicz had been in Holloway prison for Sinn F\u00e9in activities during her election, as she was an Irish Republican, she did not take her seat. Markievicz said Lady Astor was \"of the upper classes, out of touch\". \nAstor was hampered in the popular campaign for her published and at times vocal teetotalism and her ignorance of current political issues. Astor appealed to voters on the basis of her earlier work with the Canadian soldiers, allies of the British, charitable work during the war, her financial resources for the campaign and her ability to improvise. Her audiences appreciated her wit and ability to turn the tables on hecklers. Once a man asked her what the Astors had done for him and she responded with, \"Why, Charlie, you know,\" and later had a picture taken with him. This informal style baffled yet amused the British public. She rallied the supporters of the current government, moderated her Prohibition views, and used women's meetings to gain the support of female voters. A by-election was held on 28 November 1919, and she took up her seat in the House on 1 December as a Unionist (also known as \"Tory\") Member of Parliament.\nAstor was the first woman to be elected through what has been termed the \"halo effect\" of women taking over their husbands' parliamentary seats, a process which accounted for the election of ten woman MPs (nearly a third of the women elected to parliament) between the two world wars.\nEarly years in Parliament.\nAstor's Parliamentary career was the most public phase of her life. She gained attention as a woman and as someone who did not follow the rules, often attributed to her American upbringing. On her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realising that she was the person who was causing the commotion. She learned to dress more sedately and avoided the bars and smoking rooms frequented by the men.\nEarly in her first term, MP Horatio Bottomley wanted to dominate the \"soldier's friend\" issue and, believing her to be an obstacle, sought to ruin her political career. He capitalised on her opposition to divorce reform and her efforts to maintain wartime alcohol restrictions. Bottomley portrayed her as a hypocrite, as she was divorced. He said that the reform bill that she opposed would allow women to have the same kind of divorce she had in America. Bottomley was later imprisoned for fraud, which Astor used to her advantage in other campaigns.\nAstor made friends among women MPs, including members of the other parties. Margaret Wintringham was elected after Astor had been in office for two years. Astor befriended Ellen Wilkinson, a member of the Labour Party (and a former Communist). Astor later proposed creating a \"Women's Party\", but the female Labour MPs opposed that, as their party was then in office and had promised them positions. Over time, political differences separated the women MPs; by 1931 Astor became hostile to female Labour members such as Susan Lawrence.\nNancy Astor's accomplishments in the House of Commons were relatively minor. Despite defending her seat in five consecutive elections throughout the 1920\u2019s, she never held a position with much influence or any post of ministerial rank although her time in Commons saw four Conservative Prime Ministers in office. The Duchess of Atholl (elected to Parliament in 1923, four years after Lady Astor) rose to higher levels in the Conservative Party before Astor. Astor felt if she had more position in the party, she would be less free to criticise her party's government.\nDuring this period, Nancy Astor continued to be active outside government by supporting the development and expansion of nursery schools for children's education. She was introduced to the issue by socialist Margaret McMillan, who believed that her late sister helped guide her in life. Lady Astor was initially sceptical of that aspect, but the two women later became close. Astor used her wealth to aid their social efforts.\nAlthough active in charitable efforts, Astor became noted for a streak of cruelty. On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she expressed her pleasure. When people complained, she did not apologise but said, \"I'm a Virginian; we shoot to kill.\" Angus McDonnell, a Virginia friend, angered her by marrying without consulting her on his choice. She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he \"really must do better than that.\" During the course of her adult life, Astor alienated many with her sharp words as well.\nDuring the 1920s, Astor made several effective speeches in Parliament, and gained support for her Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Persons under 18) Bill (nicknamed \"Lady Astor's Bill\"), raising the legal age for consuming alcohol in a public house from 14 to 18. Her wealth and persona brought attention to women who were serving in government. She worked to recruit women into the civil service, the police force, education reform, and the House of Lords. She was well-liked in her constituency, as well as the United States during the 1920s, but her success is generally believed to have declined in the following decades.\nIn May 1922, Astor was guest of honour at a Pan-American conference held by the League of Women Voters in Baltimore, Maryland.\nAstor became the first President of the newly-formed Electrical Association For Women in 1924.\nShe chaired the first ever International Conference of Women In Science, Industry and Commerce, a three-day event held London in July 1925, organised by Caroline Haslett for the Women's Engineering Society in co-operation with other leading women's groups. Astor hosted a large gathering at her home in St James's to enable networking amongst the international delegates, and spoke strongly of her support of and the need for women to work in the fields of science, engineering and technology.\nShe was concerned about the treatment of juvenile victims of crime: \"The work of new MPs, such as Nancy Astor, led to a Departmental Committee on Sexual Offences Against Young People, which reported in 1925.\"\n1930s.\nThe 1930s were a decade of personal and professional difficulty for Lady Astor. In 1929, she won a narrow victory over the Labour candidate. In 1931, Bobby Shaw, her son from her first marriage, was arrested for homosexual offences. As her son had previously shown tendencies towards alcoholism and instability, Astor's friend Philip Kerr, now the 11th Marquess of Lothian, suggested the arrest might act as a catalyst for him to change his behaviour, but he was incorrect.\nAstor made a disastrous speech stating that alcohol use was the reason for England's national cricket team being defeated by the Australian national cricket team. Both the English and Australian teams objected to that statement. Astor remained oblivious to her growing unpopularity almost to the end of her career.\nAstor's friendship with George Bernard Shaw helped her through some of her problems although his own nonconformity caused friction between them. They held opposing political views and had very different temperaments. However, his own tendency to make controversial statements or put her into awkward situations proved to be a drawback for her political career.\nAfter Bobby Shaw was arrested, Gertrude Ely, a Pennsylvania Railroad heiress from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania offered to provide a guided tour to Moscow for Lady Astor and Bobby. Because of public comments by her and her son during this period, her political career suffered. Her son made many flattering statements about the Soviet Union, and Astor often disparaged it because she did not approve of Communism. In a meeting, she asked Joseph Stalin directly why he had slaughtered so many Russians, but many of her criticisms were translated as less challenging statements. Some of her conservative supporters feared she had \"gone soft\" on Communism; her question to Stalin may have been translated correctly only because he insisted of being told what she had said. The Conservatives felt that her son's praise of the Soviet Union served as a coup for its propaganda and so they were unhappy with her tour.\nAntisemitism, anti-Catholicism, and anticommunism.\nAstor was reportedly a supporter of the Nazis as a solution to what she saw as the \"world problems\" of Jews and communists. In 1938, she met Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who was a well-documented antisemite. She asked him not to take offence at her anti-Catholic views and wrote, \"I'm glad you are smart enough not to take my [views] personally\". She highlighted the fact that she had a number of Catholic friends. Astor and Kennedy's correspondence is reportedly filled with antisemitic language, and Edward J. Renehan Jr. wrote:\nAs fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these \"world problems\" (Nancy's phrase).\u00a0... Kennedy replied that he expected the \"Jew media\" in the United States to become a problem, that \"Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles\" were already making noises contrived to \"set a match to the fuse of the world\".\nAstor commented to Kennedy that Hitler would have to do worse than \"give a rough time... to the killers of Christ\" for Britain and America to risk \"Armageddon to save them. The wheel of history swings round as the Lord would have it. Who are we to stand in the way of the future?\" Astor made various other documented anti-Semitic comments, such as her complaint that the \"Observer\" newspaper, which was owned at the time by her husband, was \"full of homosexuals and Jews\", and her tense antisemitic exchange with MP Alan Graham in 1938, as described by Harold Nicolson:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the corridor a friend of mine named Alan Graham came up to Nancy and said, 'I do not think you behaved very well' [in a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee]. She turned upon him and said, 'Only a Jew like you would dare to be rude to me.' He replied, 'I should like very much to smack you in your face.' I think she is a little mad.\nDavid Feldman of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism has also related that whilst attending a dinner at the Savoy Hotel in 1934, Astor asked the League of Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees whether he believed \"that there must be something in the Jews themselves that had brought them persecution throughout the ages\". Dr Feldman acknowledged, however, that it was \"not an unusual view\" and explained it \"was a conventional idea in the UK at the time\". Some years later, during a visit to New York in 1947, she apparently \"clashed\" with reporters, renouncing her antisemitism, telling one that she was \"not anti-Jewish but gangsterism isn't going to solve the Palestine problem\".\nAstor was also deeply involved in the so-called Cliveden Set, a coterie of aristocrats that was described by one journalist as having subscribed to their own form of fascism. In that capacity, Astor was considered a \"legendary hostess\" for the group that in 1936 welcomed Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who communicated to Hitler regarding the likelihood of an agreement between Germany and England and singled out the \"Astorgruppe\" as one of the circles \"that want a fresh understanding with Germany and who hold that it would not basically be impossible to achieve\". The Sunday newspaper \"Reynolds News\", also reported, \"Cliveden has been the centre of friendship with German influence\". To that end, several of her friends and associates, especially the Marquess of Lothian, were involved in the policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany. Astor, however, was worried that the group might be viewed as a pro-German conspiracy, and her husband, William Waldorf Astor, wrote in a letter to the \"Times\", \"To link our weekends with any particular clique is as absurd as is the allegation that those of us who desire to establish better relations with Germany or Italy are pro-Nazis or pro-Fascists\". The Cliveden Set was also depicted by war agitators as the prime movers for peace.\nAt the request of her friend Felix Frankfurter, a future US Supreme Court justice who was Jewish, Astor intervened with the Nazis in Vienna and secured the release of Frankfurter's Jewish uncle, Solomon. Astor occasionally met with Nazi officials in keeping with Neville Chamberlain's policies, and she was known to distrust and to dislike British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden. She is alleged to have told one Nazi official that she supported German rearmament because the country was \"surrounded by Catholics\". She also told Ribbentrop, the German ambassador, who later became the foreign minister of Germany, that Hitler looked too much like Charlie Chaplin to be taken seriously. Those statements are the only documented incidents of her direct expressions to Nazis.\nAstor became increasingly harsh in her anti-Catholic and anti-communist sentiments. After the passage of the Munich Agreement, she said that if the Czech refugees fleeing Nazi oppression were communists, they should seek asylum with the Soviets, instead of the British. While supporters of appeasement felt that to be out of line, the Marquess of Lothian encouraged her comments.\nWorld War II.\nWhen World War II began, Astor admitted that she had made mistakes, and voted against Chamberlain, but left-wing hostility to her politics remained. In a 1939 speech, the Labour MP Stafford Cripps called her \"The Member for Berlin\".\nAstor's fear of Catholics increased and she made a speech saying that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the Foreign Office. Based on her opposition to Communists, she insulted Stalin's role (from 1941) as one of the Allied Powers during the war. Her speeches became rambling and incomprehensible; an opponent said that debating her had become \"like playing squash with a dish of scrambled eggs\". On one occasion she accosted a young American soldier outside the Houses of Parliament. \"Would you like to go in?\" she asked. The GI replied: \"You are the sort of woman my mother told me to avoid\".\nThe period from 1937 to the end of the war was personally difficult for Astor: in January of that year she lost her sister Phyllis, followed by her only surviving brother in 1938. In 1940, the Marquess of Lothian died. He had been her closest Christian Scientist friend even after her husband converted. George Bernard Shaw's wife died three years later. During the war, Astor's husband had a heart attack. After this, their marriage grew cold, likely due to her subsequent discomfort with his health problems. She ran a hospital for Canadian soldiers as she had during the First World War, but openly expressed a preference for the earlier soldiers.\nIt was generally believed that Lady Astor, during a World War II speech, referred to the men of the Eighth Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the \"D-Day Dodgers\", suggesting they were avoiding the \"real war\" in France and the future invasion. The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the popular German song \"Lili Marleen\", called \"The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers\". This song has also been attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade. However, there is no record that she actually said this, in or out of Parliament, and she denied ever saying it.\nWhen told she was one of the people listed to be arrested, imprisoned and face possible execution in \"The Black Book\" under a German invasion of Britain, Lady Astor commented: \"It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called 'Cliveden Set' was pro-Fascist.\"\nFinal years.\nLady Astor believed her party and her husband caused her retirement in 1945. As the Conservatives believed she had become a political liability in the final years of World War II, her husband said that if she stood for office again the family would not support her. She conceded but, according to contemporary reports, was both irritated and angry about her situation.\nLady Astor struggled in retirement, which put further strain on her marriage. In a speech commemorating her 25 years in parliament, she stated that her retirement was forced on her and that it should please the men of Britain. The couple began travelling separately and soon were living apart. Lord Astor also began moving towards left-wing politics in his last years, and that exacerbated their differences. However, the couple reconciled before his death on 30 September 1952.\nLady Astor's public image suffered, as her ethnic and religious views were increasingly out of touch with cultural changes in Britain. She expressed a growing paranoia regarding ethnic minorities. In one instance, she stated that the President of the United States had become too dependent on New York City. To her this city represented \"Jewish and foreign\" influences that she feared. During a US tour, she told a group of African-American students that they should aspire to be like the black servants she remembered from her youth. On a later trip, she told African-American church members that they should be grateful for slavery because it had allowed them to be introduced to Christianity. In Rhodesia she proudly told the white minority government leaders that she was the daughter of a slave owner.\nAfter 1956, Nancy Astor became increasingly isolated. In 1959, she was honoured by receiving the Freedom of City of Plymouth. By this time, she had lost all her sisters and brothers, her colleague \"Red Ellen\" Wilkinson died in 1947, George Bernard Shaw died in 1950, and she did not take well to widowhood. Her son Bobbie Shaw became increasingly combative and after her death he committed suicide. Her son, Jakie, married a prominent Catholic woman, which hurt his relationship with his mother. She and her other children became estranged. Gradually she began to accept Catholics as friends. However, she said that her final years were lonely.\nLady Astor died in 1964 at her daughter Nancy Astor's home at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Octagon Temple at Cliveden.\nAlleged quotations.\nShe was known for exchanges with Winston Churchill, though most of these are not well documented. Churchill told Lady Astor that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which she retorted, \"You're not handsome enough to have such fears.\"\nLady Astor is also said to have responded to a question from Churchill about what disguise he should wear to a masquerade ball by saying, \"Why don't you come sober, Prime Minister?\"\nAlthough variations of thee following anecdote vary, the story is often told of Winston Churchill's encounter with Lady Astor who, after failing to best him in an argument, broke off with the remark \"if you were my husband, I'd put poison in your tea.\" He retorted with \"Madame, if I were your husband, I'd drink it with pleasure.\"\nOn another occasion, Lady Astor allegedly came upon Churchill when he was intoxicated. (She disapproved of alcohol.) She said \"Winston, you're drunk!\" To which he replied \"And you are ugly. However, tomorrow I shall be sober\".\nLegacy.\nIn 1982 the BBC broadcast a nine-part television drama serial about her life, \"Nancy Astor\", which starred Lisa Harrow. A bronze statue of Lady Astor was installed in Plymouth, near her former family home, in 2019 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her election to Parliament.\nAstor's antisemitism has been widely documented and has been criticised in recent years, particularly in light of former Prime Minister Theresa May's 2019 unveiling of a statue in her honour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in attendance, and more recently after Labour MP Rachel Reeves commemorated Astor in a series of tweets. The then-leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, while opposed to her anti-Semitism, recognised she was the first woman MP to take up her place in Parliament and so praised installation of the statue, commenting \"I'm really pleased the statue is going up\".\nDuring the George Floyd protests in 2020, the word \"Nazi\" was spray-painted on its base. The statue was on a list published on a website called \"Topple the Racists\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
