It is closely related to Nogai, Kyrgyz and Karakalpak. It is the official language of Kazakhstan, and has official status in the Altai Republic of Russia. It is also a minority language in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China, and in the Bayan-\u00d6lgii Province of western Mongolia. The language is also spoken by many ethnic Kazakhs throughout the former Soviet Union (some 472,000 in Russia according to the 2010 Russian census), Germany, and Turkey.\nLike other Turkic languages, Kazakh is an agglutinative language and employs vowel harmony. Kazakh builds words by adding suffixes one after another to the word stem, with each suffix expressing only one unique meaning and following a fixed sequence. \"Ethnologue\" recognizes three mutually intelligible dialect groups: Northeastern Kazakh\u2014the most widely spoken variety, which also serves as the basis for the official language\u2014Southern Kazakh, and Western Kazakh. The language shares a degree of mutual intelligibility with the closely related Karakalpak language while its Western dialects maintain limited mutual intelligibility with the Altai languages.\nIn October 2017, Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev decreed that the writing system would change from using Cyrillic to Latin script by 2025. The proposed Latin alphabet has been revised several times and as of January 2021 is close to the inventory of the Turkish alphabet, though lacking the letters C and \u00c7 and having four additional letters: \u00c4, \u00d1, Q and \u016a (though other letters such as Y have different values in the two languages). It is scheduled to be phased in from 2023 to 2031. Over one million Kazakh speakers in Xinjiang use a modified version of the Perso-Arabic script for writing.\nGeographic distribution.\nSpeakers of Kazakh are spread over a vast territory from the Tian Shan to the western shore of the Caspian Sea. Kazakh is the official state language of Kazakhstan, with nearly 10 million speakers (based on information from the CIA World Factbook on population and proportion of Kazakh speakers).\nIn China, nearly two million ethnic Kazakhs and Kazakh speakers reside in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang.\nHistory.\nThe Kipchak branch of Turkic languages, which Kazakh is borne out of, was mainly solidified during the reign of the Golden Horde. The modern Kazakh language is said to have originated in approximately 1465 AD during the formation of the Kazakh Khanate. Modern Kazakh is likely a descendant of both Chagatay Turkic as spoken by the Timurids and Kipchak Turkic as spoken in the Golden Horde.\nKazakh uses a high volume of loanwords from Persian and Arabic due to the frequent historical interactions between Kazakhs and Iranian ethnic groups to the south. Additionally, Persian was a \"lingua franca\" in the Kazakh Khanate, which allowed Kazakhs to mix Persian words into their own spoken and written vernacular. Meanwhile, Arabic was used by Kazakhs in mosques and mausoleums, serving as a language exclusively for religious contexts, similar to how Latin served as a liturgical language in the Western European cultural sphere.\nThe Kazakhs used the Arabic script to write their language until approximately 1929. In the early 1900s, Kazakh activist Akhmet Baitursynuly reformed the Kazakh-Arabic alphabet, but his work was largely overshadowed by the Soviet presence in Central Asia. At that point, the new Soviet regime forced the Kazakhs to use a Latin script, and then a Cyrillic script in the 1940s. Today, Kazakhs use the Cyrillic and Latin scripts to write their language, although a presidential decree from 2017 ordered the transition from Cyrillic to Latin by 2031.\nAlthough not an endangered language, in 2024, Kazakh has been described as being placed in a somewhat vulnerable position by the Kazakhstani Minister of Science and Higher Education Sayasat Nurbek, within a category where the number of speakers is not increasing as rapidly as anticipated.\nPhonology and orthography.\nKazakh exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony, with some words of recent foreign origin (e.g., Russian, Persian, Arabic) as exceptions. There is also a system of rounding harmony which resembles that of Kyrgyz, but which does not apply as strongly and is not reflected in the orthography. This system only applies to the open vowels and not , and happens in the next syllables. Thus, (in the Latin script) 'star', 'today', and 'big' are actually pronounced as , , and , respectively.\nConsonants.\nThe following chart depicts the consonant inventory of standard Kazakh; many of the sounds, however, are allophones of other sounds or appear only in recent loanwords. The 18 consonant phonemes listed by Vajda are without parentheses\u2014since these are phonemes, their listed place and manner of articulation are very general, and will vary from what is shown. ( rarely appears in normal speech.) Kazakh has 19 native consonant phonemes; these are the stops , fricatives , nasals , liquids , and two glides . The sounds are found only in loanwords. is heard as an alveolo-palatal affricate in the Kazakh dialects of Uzbekistan and China. The sounds and may be analyzed as allophones of and in words with back vowels, but exceptions occur in loanwords.\nVowels.\nKazakh has a system of 12 phonemic vowels, 3 of which are diphthongs. The rounding contrast and generally only occur as phonemes in the first syllable of a word, but do occur later allophonically; see the section on harmony below for more information. Moreover, the sound has been included artificially due to the influence of Arabic, Persian and, later, Tatar languages during the Islamic period. It can be found in some native words, however.\nAccording to Vajda, the front/back quality of vowels is actually one of neutral versus retracted tongue root.\nPhonetic values are paired with the corresponding character in Kazakh's Cyrillic and Latin alphabets.\nVowel harmony.\nKazakh exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony (also called soft-hard harmony), and arguably weakened rounding harmony which is implied in the first syllable of the word. All vowels after the first rounded syllable are the subject to this harmony with the exception of , and in the following syllables, e.g., , . Notably, urban Kazakh speakers tend to violate rounding harmony, as well as pronouncing Russian borrowings against the rules.\nSyllable structure.\nKazakh's syllable structure is (C)V(C)(C). Syllables containing consonant clusters CC typically are combination of sonorant () and a stop (mainly ). Other types of syllables are also permitted due to recent loanwords, mainly from Russian.\nStress.\nMost words in Kazakh are stressed in the last syllable, except:\n'one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, ...'\n'to everyone, to no one'\nOrthography.\nNowadays, Kazakh is mostly written in the Cyrillic script, with an Arabic-based alphabet being used by minorities in China. Since 26 October 2017, via Presidential Decree 569, Kazakhstan will adopt the Latin script by 2025.\nSince the Cyrillic alphabet was originally designed for Slavic languages, it had to be modified to better fit the sounds of Turkic languages like Kazakh. Several new letters were added and some existing ones modified: \u04d9, \u0493, \u049b, \u04a3, \u04e9, \u04b1, \u04af, \u04bb, \u0456.\nThe Cyrillic letter \u0443 after a consonant represents a combination of sounds , , \u044b , with glide , e.g., , , , . The Cyrillic letter \u044e undergoes the same process but with at the beginning.\nThe letter \u0438 represents a combination of sounds (in front-vowel contexts) or (in back vowel contexts) with glide , e.g., , . In Russian loanwords, particularly in educated speech, it is often realized as (when stressed) or (when unstressed), e.g., .\nThe letter \u044f represents either or depending on vowel harmony.\nThe letter \u0449 represents , e.g. .\nMeanwhile, the letters \u0432, \u0451, \u0444, \u0445, \u04bb, \u0446, \u0447, \u044a, \u044c, \u044d are only used in loanwords\u2014mostly those of Russian origin, but sometimes of Persian and Arabic origin. They are often substituted in spoken Kazakh.\nThe table below compares the various scripts.\nGrammar.\nKazakh is generally verb-final, though various permutations on SOV (subject\u2013object\u2013verb) word order can be used, for example, due to topicalization. Inflectional and derivational morphology, both verbal and nominal, in Kazakh, exists almost exclusively in the form of agglutinative suffixes. Kazakh is a nominative-accusative, head-final, left-branching, dependent-marking language.\nNouns.\nKazakh has no noun class or gender system. Nouns are declined for number (singular or plural) and one of seven cases:\nThe suffix for case is placed after the suffix for number.\nPronouns.\nThere are eight personal pronouns in Kazakh:\nThe declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. Singular pronouns exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns do not. Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.\nIn addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.\nAdjectives.\nAdjectives in Kazakh are not declined for any grammatical category of the modified noun. Being a head-final language, adjectives are always placed before the noun that they modify. Kazakh has two varieties of adjectives:\nDegrees of comparison.\nComparative.\nThe comparative form can be created by appending the suffix or to an adjective.\nSuperlative.\nThe superlative form can be created by placing the morpheme before the adjective. The superlative form can also be expressed by reduplication.\nVerbs.\nKazakh may express different combinations of tense, aspect and mood through the use of various verbal morphology or through a system of auxiliary verbs, many of which might better be considered light verbs. The present tense is a prime example of this; progressive tense in Kazakh is formed with one of four possible auxiliaries. These auxiliaries 'sit', 'stand', 'go' and 'lie', encode various shades of meaning of how the action is carried out and also interact with the lexical semantics of the root verb: telic and non-telic actions, semelfactives, durative and non-durative, punctual, etc. There are selectional restrictions on auxiliaries: motion verbs, such as 'go' and 'come' may not combine with . Any verb, however, can combine with 'lie' to get a progressive tense meaning.\nWhile it is possible to think that different categories of aspect govern the choice of auxiliary, it is not so straightforward in Kazakh. Auxiliaries are internally sensitive to the lexical semantics of predicates, for example, verbs describing motion:\nIn addition to the complexities of the progressive tense, there are many auxiliary-converb pairs that encode a range of aspectual, modal, volitional, evidential and action- modificational meanings. For example, the pattern verb + , with the auxiliary verb 'see', indicates that the subject of the verb attempted or tried to do something (compare the Japanese construction).\nAnnotated text with gloss.\nFrom the first stanza and refrain of \"Men\u0131\u00f1 Qazaqstanym\" (\"My Kazakhstan\"), the national anthem of Kazakhstan:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the official and national language of Uzbekistan and formally succeeded Chagatai, an earlier Karluk language endonymically called or , as the literary language of Uzbekistan in the 1920s.\nAccording to the Joshua Project, Southern Uzbek and Standard Uzbek are spoken as a native language by more than 34 million people around the world, making Uzbek the second-most widely spoken Turkic language after Turkish. There are about 36 million Uzbeks around the world, and the reason why the number of speakers of the Uzbek language is greater than that of ethnic Uzbeks themselves is because many other ethnic groups such as Tajiks, Kazakhs, Russians who live in Uzbekistan speak Uzbek as their second language.\nThere are two major variants of the Uzbek language: Northern Uzbek, or simply \"Uzbek\", spoken in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and China; and Southern Uzbek, spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both Northern and Southern Uzbek are divided into many dialects. Uzbek and Uyghur are sister languages and they constitute the Karluk or \"Southeastern\" branch of Turkic.\nExternal influences on Uzbek include Arabic, Persian, and Russian. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel to under the influence of Persian. Unlike other Turkic languages, vowel harmony is almost completely lost in modern Standard Uzbek, though it is still observed to some degree in its dialects, as well as in Uyghur.\nDifferent dialects of Uzbek show varying degrees of influence from other languages such as Kipchak and Oghuz Turkic (for example, in grammar) as well as Persian (in phonology), which gives literary Uzbek the impression of being a mixed language.\nIn February 2021, the Uzbek government announced that Uzbekistan plans to fully transition the Uzbek language from the Cyrillic script to a Latin-based alphabet by 1 January 2023. Similar deadlines had been extended several times. As of 2024[ [update]], most institutions still use both alphabets.\nClassification.\nUzbek is the western member of the Karluk languages, a subgroup of Turkic; the eastern variant is Uyghur. Karluk is classified as a dialect continuum. Northern Uzbek was determined to be the most suitable variety to be understood by the most number of speakers of all Turkic languages despite it being heavily Persianized, excluding the Siberian Turkic languages. A high degree of mutual intelligibility found between certain specific Turkic languages has allowed Uzbek speakers to more easily comprehend various other distantly related languages.\nNumber of speakers.\nUzbek, being the most widely spoken indigenous language in Central Asia, is as well spoken by smaller ethnic groups in Uzbekistan and in neighbouring countries.\nThe language is spoken by other ethnic groups outside Uzbekistan. The popularity of Uzbek media, including Uzbekfilm and RizanovaUz, has spread among the post-Soviet states, particularly in Central Asia in recent years. Since Uzbek is the dominant language in the Osh Region of Kyrgyzstan (and mothertongue of the city Osh), like the rest of Eastern, Southern and South-Eastern Kyrgyzstan (Jalal-Abad Region), the ethnic Kyrgyzes are, too, exposed to Uzbek, and some speak it fluently. This is a common situation in the rest of Central Asian republics, including: the Turkistan region of Kazakhstan, northern Da\u015foguz Wela\u00fdat of Turkmenistan, Sughd region and other regions of Tajikistan. This puts the number of L2 speakers of Uzbek at a varying 1\u20135 million speakers.\nThe Uzbek language has a special status in countries that are common destination for immigration for Uzbekistani citizens. Other than Uzbekistan and other Central Asian Republics, the ethnic Uzbeks most commonly choose the Russian Federation in search of work. Most of them however, are seasonal workers, whose numbers vary greatly among residency within the Russian Federation. According to Russian government statistics, 4.5 million workers from Uzbekistan, 2.4 million from Tajikistan, and 920,000 from Kyrgyzstan were working in Russia in 2021, with around 5 million being ethnic Uzbeks.\nEstimates of the number of native speakers of Uzbek vary widely, from 35 up to 40 million. \"Ethnologue\" estimates put the number of native speakers at 33 million across all the recognized dialects. The Swedish national encyclopedia, , estimates the number of native speakers to be 38 million,\nand the \"CIA World Factbook\" estimates 30 million. Other sources estimate the number of speakers of Uzbek to be 34 million in Uzbekistan, 4.5 million in Afghanistan, 1,630,000 in Pakistan, 1,500,000 in Tajikistan, about 1 million in Kyrgyzstan, 600,000 in Kazakhstan, 600,000 in Turkmenistan, and 300,000 in Russia.\nThe Uzbek language is taught in more than fifty higher education institutions around the world.\nEtymology.\nHistorically, the language under the name \"Uzbek\" referred to a totally different language of Kipchak origin. The language was generally similar to the neighbouring Kazakh, more or less identical lexically, phonetically and grammatically. It was dissimilar to the area's indigenous and native language, known as \"Turki\", until it was changed to Chagatai by western scholars due to its origins from the Chagatai Khanate.\nThe ethnonym of the language itself now means \"a language spoken by the Uzbeks.\"\nHistory.\nTurkic speakers probably settled the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Zarafshon river basins from at least 600\u2013650 AD, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of the Eastern Iranian languages who previously inhabited Sogdia, Bactria and Khwarazm. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 9th\u201312th centuries, a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yagma, and other tribes.\nUzbek (along with Uyghur) can be considered the direct descendant of Chagatai, the language of great Turkic Central Asian literary development in the realm of Chagatai Khan, Timur (Tamerlane), and the Timurid dynasty (including the early Mughal rulers of the Mughal Empire). Chagatai contained large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords. By the 19th century, it was rarely used for literary composition and disappeared only in the early 20th century.\nMuhammad Shaybani (c.\u20091451 \u2013 2 December 1510), the first Khan of Bukhara, wrote poetry under the pseudonym \"Shibani\". A collection of Chagatai poems by Muhammad Shaybani is currently kept in the Topkap\u0131 Palace Museum manuscript collection in Istanbul. The manuscript of his philosophical and religious work, \"Bahr al-Khud\u0101\", written in 1508, is located in London.\nShaybani's nephew Ubaydullah Khan (1486\u20131540) skillfully recited the Quran and provided it with commentaries in Chagatai. Ubaydulla himself wrote poetry in Chagatai, Classical Persian, and Arabic under the literary pseudonym Ubaydiy.\nFor the Uzbek political elite of the 16th century, Chagatai was their native language. For example, the leader of the semi-nomadic Uzbeks, Sheibani Khan (1451\u20131510), wrote poems in Chagatai.\nThe poet Turdiy (17th century) in his poems called for the unification of the divided Uzbek tribes: \"Although our people are divided, but these are all Uzbeks of ninety-two tribes. We have different names \u2013 we all have the same blood. We are one people, and we should have one law. Floors, sleeves and collars \u2013 it's all \u2013 one robe, So the Uzbek people are united, may they be in peace.\"\nSufi Allayar (1633\u20131721) was an outstanding theologian and one of the Sufi leaders of the Khanate of Bukhara. He showed his level of knowledge by writing a book called \"Seb\u00e2t\u00fc'l-\u00c2ciz\u00een\". Sufi Allayar was often read and highly appreciated in Central Asia.\nThe term \"Uzbek\" as applied to language has meant different things at different times. \nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth century, Chagatai remained the main literary language in most of Central Asia, but it faced a phase of decay. Eventually, Chagatai was mostly referred to as the language of the Sarts, the settled Turkic-speaking populations of the Fergana Valley, although the definition of this term shifted through the decades. According to the Kazakh scholar Serali Lapin, who lived at the end of the 19th \u2013 beginning of the 20th century, \"there is no special Sart language different from Uzbek\". Russian researchers of the second half of the 19th century, like L. N. Sobolev, believed that \"Sart is not a special tribe, as many tried to prove. Sart is indifferently called both Uzbek and Tajik, who live in the city and are engaged in trade\".\nAs part of the preparation for the 1924 establishment of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, Chagatai was officially renamed \"Old Uzbek\", which Edward A. Allworth argued \"badly distorted the literary history of the region\" and was used to give authors such as Ali-Shir Nava'i an Uzbek identity.\nAfter the independence of Uzbekistan, the Uzbek government opted to reform Northern Uzbek by changing its alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin in an attempt to stimulate the growth of Uzbek in a new, independent state. However, the reform never went into full application, and As of 2024[ [update]] both alphabets are widely used, from daily uses to government publications and TV news. Uzbek language has not eclipsed Russian in the government sector since Russian is used widely in sciences, politics, and by the upper class of the country. However, the Uzbek internet, including Uzbek Wikipedia, is growing rapidly.\nWriting systems.\nUzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:\nDespite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic. The Arabic script is no longer used in Uzbekistan except symbolically in limited texts or for the academic studies of Chagatai (Old Uzbek).\nIn 2019, an updated version of the Uzbek Latin alphabet was revealed by the Uzbek government, with five letters being updated; it was proposed to represent the sounds \"ts\", \"sh\", \"ch\", \"o\u02bb\" and \"g\u02bb\" by the letters \"c\", \"\u015f\", \"\u00e7\", \"\u00f3\" and \"\u01f5\", respectively. This would have reversed a 1995 reform, and brought the orthography closer to that of Turkish and also of Turkmen, Karakalpak, Kazakh (2018 version) and Azerbaijani. In 2021, it was proposed to change \"sh\", \"ch\", \"o\u02bb\" and \"g\u02bb\" to \"\u015f\", \"\u00e7\", \"\u014d\" and \"\u1e21\". These proposals were not implemented.\nIn the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, in northern Afghanistan and in Pakistan, where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic-based script is still used. In the early 21st century, in Afghanistan, standardization, publication of dictionaries, and an increase in usage (for example in News agencies' website, such as that of https://) has been taking place.\nPhonology.\nWords are usually oxytones (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed.[] Consonants in brackets are only attested in loanwords.\nVowels.\nStandard Uzbek has six vowel phonemes. Uzbek language has many dialects: contrary to many Turkic languages, Standard Uzbek no longer has vowel harmony, but other dialects (Kipchak Uzbek and Oghuz Uzbek) retain vowel harmony.\nGrammar.\nAs a Turkic language, Uzbek is null subject, agglutinative and has no noun classes (gender or otherwise). Although Uzbek has no definite articles, it has indefinite articles \"bir\" \u0628\u0650\u06cc\u0631 and \"bitta\" \u0628\u0650\u06cc\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0647. Like other Turkic languages, nouns only conjugate as \"definite\" in the accusative case. An indefinite direct object is conjugated in the nominative case. The word order is subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV).\nIn Uzbek, there are two main categories of words: nominals (equivalent to nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some adverbs) and verbals (equivalent to verbs and some adverbs).\nNouns.\nPlurals are formed by suffix \"-lar\" \u0640\u0644\u0631. Nouns take the \"-ni\" \u0640\u0646\u06cc suffix as a definite article when they are direct objects; unsuffixed nouns are understood as indefinite. The dative case ending \"-ga\" \u0640\u06af\u0647 changes to \"-ka\" \u0640\u06a9\u0647 when the noun ends in \"-k\" \u0640\u06a9, \"-g\" \u0640\u06af, or \"-qa\" \u0640\u0642\u0647 when the noun ends in \"-q\" \u0640\u0642, \"-g\u02bb\" \u0640\u063a (notice \"*tog\u2018qa\" \u2192 \"toqqa\" \u062a\u0627\u063a\u0642\u064e\u0651\u0647). The possessive suffixes change the final consonants \"-k\" \u0640\u06a9 and \"-q\" \u0640\u0642 to voiced \"-g\" \u0640\u06af and \"-g\u02bb\" \u0640\u063a, respectively (\"yurak\" \u2192 \"yuragim\" \u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06af\u06cc\u0645). Unlike neighbouring Turkmen and Kazakh languages, due to the loss of \"pronominal \"-n-\"\" there is no irregularity in forming cases after possessive cases (\"uyida\" \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0647 \"in his/her/its house\", as opposed to Turkmen \"\u00f6\u00fd\u00fcnde\" \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647, though saying \"uyinda\" \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0647 is also correct but such style is mainly used in literary contexts).\nVerbs.\nUzbek verbs are also inflected for number and person of the subject, and it has more periphrases. Uzbek uses some of the inflectional (simple) verbal tenses:\n\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\nVowels marked with parentheses in the suffixes are dropped if the verb root already ends on a vowel. (e.g. \"Qara\" \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0647\u200c + \"(i)ng\" \u0640\u0650\u06cc\u0646\u0652\u06af = \"Qarang!\" \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0647\u200c\u0646\u0652\u06af; \"Look!\")\nThird person plural is commonly replaced by third person singular.\nIn the simple past and conditional tenses, the possessive suffixes are used at the end of the verb. Otherwise, the full pronoun suffix is used, except in the imperative. The third person is usually not marked.\nCopula verb.\nConjugations of the verb \"ermoq\" (to be) with regard to tenses (except for future tense), serve as copula verbs. Future conjugation of ermoq, (Old Turkic erg\u00e4y) is not present in Uzbek.\nNegation.\nNegative is expressed by adding \"-ma\" after the verb root, or with auxiliary verb \"emas\".\nExamples:\n\"Ko\u02bbrmay(man)\" \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647\u200c\u06cc(\u0645\u0646) \"(I) don't see\"\n\"Ko\u02bbrmoqchi emas(man)\" \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0642\u0686\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0645\u0633(\u0645\u0646) \"(I) don't want to see\"\nThe particle \"yo\u02bbq\" \u0640\u06cc\u0648\u0642 is used to mark the absence or prohibition of a noun or action.\nGerund.\nThe gerund is formed with the verb root + \"ish\" \u0640\u06cc\u0634.\n\"Chekish mumkin emas\" \u0686\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0645\u0633 \"Smoking is not allowed\"\nWord order.\nThe word order in the Uzbek language is subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV), like all other Turkic languages. Unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInfluences.\nThe influence of Islam, and by extension, Arabic, is evident in Uzbek loanwords. There is also a residual influence of Russian, from the time when Uzbeks were under the rule of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. There are a large number of Russian loanwords in Uzbek, particularly when related to technical and modern terms, as well everyday and sociopolitical terms. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by Persian through its historic roots. It is estimated that Uzbek contains about 60 Mongolian loanwords, scattered among the names of birds and other animals, household items, chemical elements and especially military terms.\nDialects.\nUzbek can be roughly divided into three dialect groups. The Karluk dialects, centered on Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and the Ferghana Valley, are the basis for the standard Uzbek language. This dialect group shows the most influence of Persian vocabulary, particularly in the important Tajik-dominated cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. The Kipchak dialect, spoken from the Surxondaryo region through north-central Uzbekistan into Karakalpakstan, shows significant influence from the Kipchak Turkic languages, particularly in the mutation of [j] to [\u0291] as in Kazakh and Kyrgyz. The Oghuz dialect, spoken mainly in Khorezm along the Turkmenistan border, is notable for the mutation of word-initial [k] to [g].\nBy country.\nTurkmenistan.\nIn Turkmenistan since the 2000s the government conducted a forced \"Turkmenization\" of ethnic Uzbeks living in the country. In the Soviet years and in the 1990s, the Uzbek language was used freely in Turkmenistan. There were several hundred schools in the Uzbek language, many newspapers were published in this language. Now there are only a few Uzbek schools in the country, as well as a few newspapers in Uzbek. Despite this, the Uzbek language is still considered to be one of the recognized languages of national minorities in this country. Approximately 300,000\u2013600,000 Uzbeks live in Turkmenistan. Most of the Uzbek speakers live in Dashoghuz Velayat, as well as in Lebap Velayat and partly in Ashghabad.\nRussia.\nUzbek is one of the many recognized languages of national minorities in Russia. More than 400 thousand Uzbeks are citizens of the Russian Federation and live in the country. Also in Russia there are 2 to 6 million Uzbeks from the Central Asian republics (mainly Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) who are immigrants and migrants. Large diasporas of Uzbeks live in large cities of Russia such as Saint Petersburg. Signs in Uzbek are often found in these cities. Signs refer mainly to various restaurants and eateries, barbershops, shops selling fruits, vegetables and textile products. There is a small clinic, where signs and labels are in the Uzbek language. Uzbeks in Russia prefer to use the Cyrillic Uzbek alphabet, but in recent years Uzbek youth in Russia are also actively using the Latin Uzbek alphabet. Small newspapers in Uzbek are published in large cities of Russia. Some instructions for immigrants and migrants are duplicated, including in Uzbek. Uzbek language is studied by Russian students in the faculties of Turkology throughout Russia. The largest Uzbek language learning centers in Russia are located in the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. There are also many Russians who are interested in and love the Uzbek language and culture and who study this language for themselves. Uzbek is one of the most studied languages among the many languages of the former USSR in Russia.\nUzbek language researchers.\nScientific interest in the history of the Uzbek language arose in the 19th century among European and Russian orientalists. \u00c1. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, V. Bartold, Sh. Lapin and others wrote about the history of the Uzbek language. Much attention was paid to the study of the history of the language in the Soviet period. E. Polivanov, N. Baskakov, A.Kononov, U. Tursunov, A. Mukhtarov, Sh. Rakhmatullaev and others wrote about the history of the Uzbek language among famous linguists.\nSample text.\nThe following is a sample text in Uzbek Arabic script of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with English version in the bottom), contrasted with a version of the text in Uzbek written in Latin script.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1894, Dreyfus fell victim to a judicial conspiracy that eventually sparked a major political crisis in the French Third Republic when he was wrongfully accused and convicted of being a German spy due to antisemitism. Dreyfus was arrested, cashiered from the French army and imprisoned on Devil's Island in French Guiana. Eventually, evidence emerged showing that Dreyfus was innocent and the true culprit was fellow officer Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy.\nGradual revelations indicated that the internal investigation conducted by the French army was biased; Dreyfus was an ideal scapegoat due to being a Jew, and military authorities were aware of his innocence but chose to cover up the affair and leave him imprisoned rather than lose face. A political scandal subsequently erupted, shaking French political life and highlighting antisemitism in the French army and government. After numerous judicial and political developments, the publication of \u00c9mile Zola's manifesto \"J'Accuse...!\" in 1898 brought new momentum to Dreyfus' cause. Zola accused French military and political leadership of covering up the affair. Dreyfus was eventually exonerated, rehabilitated and reinstated in the French army, although at a lower rank than his seniority would have warranted.\n\"Anti-Dreyfusards\" and antisemites in France, however, viewed even his incomplete rehabilitation unfavorably, and while attending the transfer of Zola's remains to the Panth\u00e9on, Dreyfus was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by an antisemitic militarist who was later acquitted at trial. Dreyfus later fought in World War I, notably at the battles of Verdun and the Aisne, before retiring and leading a quiet life. He died in 1935 in Paris and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. Dreyfus' life and the antisemitic persecutions he endured left a significant mark on French political consciousness, while Esterhazy remained unpunished until his death. Among Dreyfus\u2019s defenders were writers such as Zola, Charles P\u00e9guy, and Anatole France, politicians such as Georges Clemenceau and Jean Jaur\u00e8s, filmmakers such as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and the founders of the Human Rights League (LDH) Francis de Pressens\u00e9 and Pierre Quillard.\nEarly life, family, and education.\nBorn in Mulhouse, Alsace on 9 October 1859, to Rapha\u00ebl and Jeannette Dreyfus (n\u00e9e Libmann), Alfred Dreyfus was the youngest of nine children (seven of whom survived to adulthood). His grandfather was a merchant from a long established Alsatian Jewish family in Rixheim, not far from Mulhouse. His father became a prosperous industrialist who started a cotton mill, then expanded the business with a weaving factory. This enabled the Dreyfus family to live a comfortable and affluent life within Mulhouse society. He spent his first years in a house on Rue du Sauvage, then later in a mansion on Rue de la Sinne, both in Mulhouse.\nBecause of his mother's bedridden illness following his birth, his sister Henriette became like a second mother to him. Alfred was 10 years old when the Franco-Prussian War broke out in the summer of 1870, and following the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany after the war, he and his family moved to Basel, Switzerland, where he attended high school. The family later relocated to Paris.\nEarly career.\nThe childhood experience of seeing his family uprooted by the war with Germany prompted Dreyfus to decide on a career in the military. Following his 18th birthday in October 1877, he enrolled in the elite military school in Paris, where he received military training and an education in the sciences. In 1880, he graduated and was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the French army. From 1880 to 1882, he attended the artillery school at Fontainebleau to receive more specialized training as an artillery officer. On graduation, he was assigned to the 31st Artillery Regiment, which was in the garrison at Le Mans. Dreyfus was subsequently transferred to a mounted artillery battery attached to the First Cavalry Division (Paris), and promoted to lieutenant in 1885. In 1889, he was made adjutant to the director of the \u00c9tablissement de Bourges, a government arsenal, and promoted to captain.\nOn 18 April 1891, the 31-year-old Dreyfus married 20-year-old Lucie Eug\u00e9nie Hadamard (1870\u20131945). They had two children, Pierre (1891\u20131946) and Jeanne (1893\u20131981). Three days after the wedding, Dreyfus learned that he had been admitted to the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre or War College. Two years later, he graduated ninth in his class with honourable mention and was immediately designated as a trainee in the French Army's General Staff headquarters, where he would be the only Jewish officer. His father Rapha\u00ebl died on 13 December 1893.\nAt the War College examination in 1892, his friends had expected him to do well. However, one of the members of the panel, General Bonnefond, felt that \"Jews were not desired\" on the staff, and gave Dreyfus poor marks for \"cote d'amour\" (\"French slang: attraction\"; translatable as \"likability\"). Bonnefond's assessment lowered Dreyfus' overall grade; he did the same to another Jewish candidate, Lieutenant Picard. Learning of this injustice, the two officers lodged a protest with the director of the school, General Lebelin de Dionne, who expressed his regret for what had occurred, but said he was powerless to take any steps in the matter. The protest would later count against Dreyfus. The French army of the period was relatively open to entry and advancement by talent, with an estimated 300 Jewish officers, of whom ten were generals. However, within the Fourth Bureau of the General Staff, General Bonnefond's prejudices appear to have been shared by some of the new trainee's superiors. The personal assessments received by Dreyfus during 1893/94 acknowledged his high intelligence, but were critical of aspects of his personality.\nThe Dreyfus affair.\nA torn-up handwritten note, referred to throughout the affair as the \"bordereau\", was found by a French housekeeper, a woman named Marie Bastian, in a wastebasket at the German Embassy. Bastian, whose job was to burn the waste of Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, instead sent it to Hubert-Joseph Henry for potential interest to French intelligence. The bordereau described a minor French military secret, and had obviously been written by a spy in the French military.\nIn 1894, this made the French Army's counter-intelligence section, led by Lieutenant Colonel Jean Sandherr, aware that information regarding new artillery parts was being passed to Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the German military attach\u00e9 in Paris, by a highly placed spy most likely on the General Staff. Suspicion quickly fell upon Dreyfus, who was arrested for treason on 15 October 1894.\nOn 5 January 1895, Dreyfus was summarily convicted in a secret court martial, publicly stripped of his army rank, and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island in French Guiana. Following French military custom of the time, Dreyfus was formally degraded (cashiered) by having the rank insignia, buttons and braid cut from his uniform and his sword broken, all in the courtyard of the \u00c9cole Militaire before silent ranks of soldiers, while a large crowd of onlookers shouted abuse from behind railings. Dreyfus cried out: \"I swear that I am innocent. I remain worthy of serving in the Army. Long live France! Long live the Army!\"\nIn August 1896, the new chief of French military intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart, reported to his superiors that he had found evidence to the effect that the real traitor was the Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Picquart was silenced by being transferred to command a tirailleur regiment based in Sousse, Tunisia, in November 1896. When reports of an army cover-up and Dreyfus' possible innocence were leaked to the press, a heated debate ensued about antisemitism and France's identity as a Catholic nation or a republic founded on equal rights for all citizens.\nEsterhazy was found not guilty by a secret court martial, before fleeing secretly to England and shaving off his moustache. Rachel Beer, editor of \"The Observer\" and the \"Sunday Times\", interviewed him twice. He confessed to writing the bordereau under orders from Sandherr in an attempt to frame Dreyfus. She wrote about her interviews in September 1898, reporting his confession and writing a leader column accusing the French military of antisemitism and calling for a retrial for Dreyfus.\nIn France there was a passionate campaign by Dreyfus' supporters, including leading artists and intellectuals such as \u00c9mile Zola, following which he was given a second trial in 1899, but again declared guilty of treason despite the evidence of his innocence.\nHowever, due to public opinion, Dreyfus was offered and accepted a pardon by President \u00c9mile Loubet in 1899 and released from prison; this was a compromise that saved face for the military's mistake. Had Dreyfus refused the pardon, he would have been returned to Devil's Island, a fate he could no longer emotionally cope with; so officially Dreyfus remained a traitor to France, and pointedly remarked upon his release:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor two years, until July 1906, he lived in a state of house arrest with one of his sisters at Carpentras, and later at Cologny.\nOn 12 July 1906, Dreyfus was officially exonerated by a military commission. The day after his exoneration, he was readmitted into the army with a promotion to the rank of major (\"Chef d'Escadron\"). A week later, he was made Knight of the Legion of Honour, and subsequently assigned to command an artillery unit at Vincennes. On 15 October 1906, he was placed in command of another artillery unit at Saint-Denis.\nAftermath.\nWhile attending a ceremony relocating Zola's ashes to the Panth\u00e9on on 4 June 1908, Dreyfus was wounded in the arm by a gunshot from a right-wing journalist, Louis Gr\u00e9gori, who was trying to assassinate him. Gr\u00e9gori was acquitted by the Parisian court, which accepted his defence that he had not meant to kill Dreyfus, meaning merely to graze him.\nIn 1937, Dreyfus' son Pierre published his father's memoirs based on his correspondence between 1899 and 1906. The memoirs were titled \"Souvenirs et Correspondance\" and translated into English, as \"Dreyfus: His Life and Letters\", by Betty Morgan.\nDreyfus started corresponding with the marquise Marie-Louise Arconati-Visconti in 1899 and began attending her Thursday (political) salons after his release. They continued their correspondence until her death in 1923.\nLater life.\nWorld War I.\nDreyfus' prison sentence on Devil's Island had taken its toll on his health. He was granted retirement from the army in October 1907 at the age of 48. As a reserve officer, he re-entered the army as a major of artillery at the outbreak of World War I. Serving throughout the war, Dreyfus was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\nBy then in his mid-50s, Dreyfus served mostly behind the lines of the Western Front, in part as commander of an artillery supply column. However, he also performed front-line duties in 1917, notably at Verdun and on the Chemin des Dames. He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in November 1918.\nDreyfus' son Pierre also served throughout the entire war as an artillery officer, receiving the Croix de guerre.\nDeath.\nDreyfus died in Paris aged 75, on 12 July 1935. Two days later, his funeral cort\u00e8ge passed the Place de la Concorde through the ranks of troops assembled for the Bastille Day national holiday. He was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse, Paris.\nA statue of Dreyfus holding his broken sword is located at Boulevard Raspail, n\u00ba116\u2013118, at the exit of the Notre-Dame-des-Champs metro station. A duplicate statue stands in the courtyard of the Museum of Jewish Art and History in Paris.\nDuring the German occupation of France during WWII, Lucie Dreyfus, who had played a major role in the fight to exonerate her husband, was hidden in a convent in Valence. Their son, Pierre L\u00e9on Dreyfus (1891\u20131946), escaped to the United States in 1943. Their daughter, Jeanne Dreyfus L\u00e9vy (1893\u20131981), also survived, but granddaughter Madeleine Levy, arrested by French police in Toulouse, was deported and died of typhus in Auschwitz in January 1944, aged 25.\nModern aftermath.\nIn October 2021, French president Emmanuel Macron inaugurated a museum dedicated to the Dreyfus affair in M\u00e9dan in the northwestern suburbs of Paris. He said that nothing could repair the humiliations and injustices Dreyfus had suffered, and \"let us not aggravate it by forgetting, deepening, or repeating them\".\nThe reference to not repeating them follows attempts by the French far right to question Dreyfus' innocence. An army colonel was cashiered in 1994 for publishing an article suggesting that Dreyfus was guilty; far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen's lawyer responded that Dreyfus' exoneration was \"contrary to all known jurisprudence\". \u00c9ric Zemmour, a far-right political opponent of Macron, said repeatedly in 2021 that the truth about Dreyfus was not clear; his innocence was \"not obvious\".\nDreyfus had been promoted to major when he was exonerated in 1906, a lower rank than was justified by his seniority, and to lieutenant colonel in 1916. In 2025, the National Assembly finally unanimously backed a symbolic effort to promote him posthumously to brigadier general as an act of reparation, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The promotion was finalized by President Emmanuel Macron on 17 November 2025.\nLegacy.\nDreyfus' grandchildren donated over three thousand documents to the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme (Museum of Jewish Art and History), including personal letters, photographs of the trial, legal documents, writings by Dreyfus during his time in prison, personal family photographs, and his officer stripes that had been ripped off as a symbol of treason. The museum created an online platform in 2006 dedicated to the Dreyfus Affair.\nSee also.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has a green body, no visible nose, and lives in a trash can. Oscar's favorite thing is trash, as evidenced by the song \"I Love Trash\", with a running theme being his collection of seemingly useless items. Although the term \"grouch\" aptly describes Oscar's misanthropic interaction with the other characters, it also refers to his species. The character was originally performed by Caroll Spinney, from the show's first episode until his retirement. Eric Jacobson became understudy for the character in 2015, and in 2018 officially became the primary performer of the role following Spinney's retirement.\nOrigins.\nInitially, the puppet characters on \"Sesame Street\" did not appear on the actual Sesame Street set, but were relegated to the intermediary segments. Muppets creator Jim Henson wanted them to be integrated into the series, suggesting a giant bird and also a creature living in the neighborhood's trash can. The character was developed by \"Sesame Street\" head writer Jon Stone and Henson. Puppeteer Caroll Spinney found inspiration for the voice in the driver of a New York City taxi he took to the studio. His first line was, \"Where to, Mac?\".\nHenson credits the character's name based on the personality of a \"magnificently rude\" restaurant owner and namesake of Oscar's Salt of the Sea which Henson and Stone frequented. Henson's office was on East 67th Street, just around the corner from Oscar's Salt of the Sea on Third Avenue. In the early 1960s, Henson and Stone often had lunch there and observed that the owner, Oscar Karp, dressed in black, looked unkempt, and had a gruff disposition.\nThe Oscar muppet was orange for the first season of \"Sesame Street\" and then changed to green, which remained his permanent color. This was explained within the show by a visit to Swamp Mushy Muddy.\nAccording to \"Sesame Street\"'s Robert W. Morrow, Oscar was created to indirectly demonstrate racial and ethnic diversity. Since his manners and tastes were different from those of the other characters, his creators hoped to address social issues by using his differences as a metaphor for racial and ethnic differences. Some viewers saw Oscar as a \"surrogate for poor, urban Americans\" during the show's early seasons.\nIn the early \"Sesame Street\" development there was criticism that Oscar represented residents of inner city who had grown to accept injustice unchallenged, whilst other observers perceived Oscar to be a negative impression of African-Americans even though the members Sesame Workshop did not intend the character to be a representation of black people. Joan Ganz Cooney was confused by this viewpoint when journalist Linda Francke informed her of its existence.\nPerforming Oscar.\nDuring the first season of \"Sesame Street\", the street set was arranged in such a way that Spinney, who was right-handed, was forced to operate Oscar's head with his left hand. After the set was redesigned, Spinney was able to switch hands.\nIn scenes where Oscar and Big Bird (both performed by Spinney) interact together, the situation has varied depending on the number of lines one or the other is given. When Spinney performed Big Bird, a second puppeteer operated Oscar to Spinney's vocals; occasionally, Matt Vogel instead operated the Big Bird puppet to a vocal track by Spinney, who in turn performed Oscar. Other Oscar puppeteers have included Jerry Nelson and Jim Martin.\nIn 2015, due to being diagnosed with dystonia, Spinney no longer puppeteered Oscar full-time on the show. Eric Jacobson became his understudy; often lip-syncing to a prerecorded vocal track by Spinney, and other times doing the voice himself. Spinney continued to provide Oscar's voice on the series for seasons 46 and 47, as well as select commercials, online videos, and the special \"Once Upon a Sesame Street Christmas\". Afterwards, Spinney entered semi-retirement, and Jacobson fully assumed the role. Despite this, Spinney continued to receive onscreen credit for playing the characters through season 50.\nOn October 17, 2018, Spinney announced his official retirement from both his characters. The following day, he recorded his final performances as Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird as part of episode 5022 for the series' landmark 50th anniversary, though, when the episode aired, none of his vocals were kept in. Spinney's final vocal performance as Oscar the Grouch to air was for episode 4731.\nAttributes.\nOscar can also become mobile with the help of his friend Bruno the Trashman, who carries Oscar around in his trash can. Bruno is a full-body costume which allows Oscar's puppeteer to manipulate Oscar while remaining hidden by the Bruno costume. Bruno's tenure on the show lasted from 1979 to 1993. Also, as seen in the \"Elmo's World\" episode \"Dance\", Oscar's legs can protrude from the bottom of his trash can to allow him to walk around. Similarly, in \"Christmas Eve on Sesame Street\" (1978), Oscar is seen ice skating. For several seasons, Oscar was frequently shown with his friend and pet Slimey, an orange worm. On occasional episodes he has mentioned leaving Sesame Street to attend \"the annual Grouch convention in Syracuse, New York\".\nOscar openly admits that he does not like anything or anybody that is nice, except young human children (the only people that he can actually act nice to without facing ridicule from his fellow Grouches) as well as older fans of the show. The only person he liked on camera was Maria, which he would never admit. He once inadvertently complimented a dance that his followers, The Grouchketeers, had performed for him. Oscar has shown rare acts of kindness such as trying to replace Ernie's rubber duckie when Ernie had lost it. He also went out to find the missing Big Bird in \"Christmas Eve on Sesame Street\". He and his girlfriend Grundgetta also love each other, though their relationship is somewhat rocky.\nOscar's trash can.\nWhile appearing to be the size of a normal trash can on the outside, Oscar's trash can is much bigger on the inside, as revealed in \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\". Oscar has said it holds a farm, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, and piano. Other items include his pet worm Slimey, his pet elephant Fluffy, his shoes, a backdoor and a gate to Grouchland USA, his hometown.\nInternational adaptations.\nWhile Oscar receives new names in international dubs, \"Sesame Street\" international co-productions have often created their own version of the character.\nIn their second season, Germany's \"Sesamstrasse\" created an antagonistic character named Uli von B\u00f6defeld. While not a Grouch, he served the same role in plots as Oscar. When a fire destroyed the costume in 1988, a decade after he debuted, he and American segments of Oscar were both replaced by a Grouch named Rumpel. He has a pet caterpillar named Gustav, who is based on Slimey.\nIsraeli Grouch, Moishe Oofnik, Oscar's cousin, is the only character to survive the first \"Rechov Sumsum\", appearing in its current reboot; English/Hebrew series \"Shalom Sesame;\" and Israeli-Palestinian co-production \"Rechov Sumsum/Shara'a Simsim\".\nOther Grouches include Bodoque on Mexico's \"Plaza S\u00e9samo\", Pancho Contreras, technically a monster, on US Spanish version, Gugu on Brazil's \"Vila Sesamo\", K\u0131rp\u0131k on Turkey's \"Susam Soka\u011f\u0131\", Ferr\u00e3o on Portugal's \"Rua S\u00e9samo\", and Kewal Khadoosa on India's \"Galli Galli Sim Sim\". Filipino adaptation \"Sesame!\" featured Kiko Matsing, basically a gorilla; also featured Bebong (The Trashed Monster).\nSome Grouches differ from the mostly antagonistic mold. France's \"1, Rue S\u00e9same\" featured Mordicus, who, like Oscar, lives in a trash can, and is slightly cynical, but is also described as lively and enthusiastic, and participated in the neighborhood band.\nIn Pakistan, he is named Akhtar and lives in a rusty oil barrel.\nAppearances in other media.\nA hybrid of Oscar the Grouch, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster appears in \"The Goodies\" episode \"The Goodies Rule \u2013 O.K.?\", where it attacked Tim Brooke-Taylor whilst in a bin, only for Tim to eat it.\nOscar made what he called \"a very brief cameo\" in the 1981 Jim Henson movie \"The Great Muppet Caper\". When Miss Piggy threw a truck driver (played by Peter Ustinov) into a pile of boxes and a pile of trash cans, Oscar emerged from his trash can and demanded \"Hey, what's all the racket?\" Oscar also appeared in the Jim Henson holiday special, \"A Muppet Family Christmas\", when the Sesame Street Gang comes to the Grizzly Farm House for the holidays. In the film he befriends Rizzo the Rat who asks the Grouch if he could stay in his trash can for the night. Oscar agreed saying that he never had a rat in his trash can before.\nOscar could be seen among many villains in the \"South Park\" episode \"Imagination Land III\".\nOscar appears in the episode \"Fashion\" of the IFC show \"Portlandia\".\nOscar was on an episode of \"Scrubs\", imagined as the new chief of medicine.\nOscar is one of numerous PBS personalities chasing after Homer Simpson for not being able to pay a pledge in a \"Simpsons\" season 11 episode, \"\". Oscar crashes through the window of the church Homer is hiding in, and demands the money while Elmo, who was hiding in the trash can with him, tells Homer he knows where he lives. He also appears in \"Trash of the Titans\", a season 9 episode of \"The Simpsons\".\nOscar inspired an Apple Macintosh INIT written by Eric B. Shapiro and shown at the 1989 MacHack conference, featuring a singing animated Oscar that appeared from the trash can when the trash was emptied. The hack was so popular that some parents lost the entire contents of their hard disks to preschoolers wanting to see more of Oscar, prompting Shapiro to create a stand-alone application using the same animation and sounds. The software was discontinued after Children's Television Workshop sent Shapiro a cease and desist letter.\nThe fumetti comic \"Twisted Toyfare Theatre\" once featured Oscar in an issue in which he sings a variation of his \"I Love Trash\" song about Wesley Snipes' movies. In the end, Snipes (as Blade) decapitates him.\nOscar appeared on seven episodes of the game show \"1 vs. 100\", which aired between January and February 2008.\nBeginning in 2008, Oscar became the mascot for Waste Reduction Week in Canada, an environmental campaign.\nIn \"The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy\" episode \"Scythe for Sale\", a parody of Oscar emerges from a dumpster telling Billy to \"get outta my house\" and a car then crashes into his dumpster. The man in the car and \"Oscar\" then instruct the viewers that it is wrong to play with scythes (in response to Irwin's stealing and misuse of Grim's scythe) and to \"tell an adult immediately\" if they find one.\nIn the \"Night at the Museum\" sequel \"\", Oscar has an appearance with Darth Vader, trying to become part of Kahmunrah's team\u2014only to be discovered that he is not evil, just \"vaguely grouchy\". The Oscar puppet that was used in filming is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\nOn May 29, 2009, Oscar the Grouch appeared in an ABC television special on economics called \"Un-broke: What You Need to Know About Money\". He appeared showing the viewers what investing stocks means. It is shown that he has investment filings with Lehman Brothers, Worldcom, Enron, and Washington Mutual even though they are bankrupt companies, but he then says that they are not really his filings. The press kit for the special reveals that Oscar was popular with the crew for the special even during filming.\nOn October 11, 2009, Oscar appeared on the CBC Radio One show \"Q\", hosted by Jian Ghomeshi. Beyond talking about his time on \"Sesame Street\", his love for trash and recycling, Oscar revealed that his father is actually from Saint David, New Brunswick and his mother grew up in Nova Scotia, thus making him of Canadian descent. He further went on to suggest that he had cheated on Grundgetta, his long-time girlfriend.\nOn November 12, 2009, Oscar appeared on CNN to celebrate the 40th anniversary of \"Sesame Street\". In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Oscar reveals that he would still be orange if he bathed; his green exterior is apparently moss.\nOn an episode of \"Cake Boss\", Buddy and his bakers visited Sesame Street, and Danny could be seen inside Oscar's trash can. He tries his best Oscar impression by saying \"I live in the trash.\" Oscar can also be seen at the end when Buddy reveals his cake, but then goes back in his trash can, ostensibly to get away from the laughing and cheering.\nOscar also made appearances in episodes of the Cartoon Network show \"MAD\".\nOn a Q TV interview promoting the benefits of being \"[Eco-]Green\", Oscar suggests that he is actually Canadian. He later mentions that his favorite dessert is spinach sardine chocolate fudge sundaes. His second favorite dessert is mashed bananas with ice cubes and cold beef gravy, and in Season 12, he owns a car called \"The Sloppy Jalopy\".\nThe October 12, 2019 episode of season 45 of \"Saturday Night Live\", hosted by David Harbour, included a sketch presenting the origin story of Oscar the Grouch in a \"Joker\" spoof.\nIn 2023, Oscar the Grouch was appointed the Chief Trash Officer of United Airlines' Sustainable Airline Fuel (SAF) program.\nIn the 9th season of \"Masked Singer\", Oscar featured, alongside other Sesame Street characters, as a guest during \"Sesame Street Night\".\nSupporters of the striking workers in the 2025 Birmingham bin strike have displayed images of Oscar the Grouch with a raised fist in solidarity during the dispute. British union organiser Scott Walker dressed as the character at the 2025 Labour Party Conference, in support of the strike, and joined a demonstration in costume later that year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. After the death of Edward IV of England in 1483 it was claimed by Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, that she was legally married precontract to Edward, which invalidated the king's later marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. The evidence was examined and the Bishop was questioned by the Three Estates (informal sitting of parliament with the same members), who determined that Bishop Stillington's claim was valid. The finding rendered Edward IV's second secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville bigamous, thereby making all seven children illegitimate, including Edward's sons, the so-called Princes in the Tower. As the oldest male blood relative of Edward IV, his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was elected by the Three Estates to the throne as Richard III. Edward's sons remained in the royal apartments in the Tower and subsequently disappeared. Various explanations for their disappearance have been put forward. \nAfter the death of Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the new king Henry Tudor married Elizabeth of York, the eldest surviving child of Edward IV, and requested that Parliament repeal the Titulus Regius and destroy all existing copies.\nKnown life.\nIn 1449, 13-year-old Eleanor married Sir Thomas Butler (or Boteler), son of Ralph Boteler, Lord Sudeley. Thomas died at an unknown date, before Edward IV of England's overthrow of the House of Lancaster on 4 March 1461. Her father-in-law Lord Sudeley took back one of the two manors he had settled on her and her husband when they married, even though he did not have a licence for the transfer. Edward seized both properties after he became king.\nEleanor died in June 1468. She was interred on 30 June in Norwich.\nAllegations.\nAfter King Edward's death in 1483, his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed protector to the as-yet-uncrowned king Edward V. Richard placed Edward and his younger brother in the Tower of London. He then proclaimed that they were illegitimate. According to the French chronicler Philippe de Commines he acted with the support of Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells. Stillington had been briefly imprisoned and fined for speaking out against Edward IV in 1478. Commines later wrote,\nThe bishop discovered to the Duke of Gloucester that his brother king Edward had been formerly in love with a beautiful young lady and had promised her marriage upon condition that he might lie with her; the lady consented, and, as the bishop affirmed, he married them when nobody was present but they two and himself. His fortune depending on the court, he did not discover it, and persuaded the lady likewise to conceal it, which she did, and the matter remained a secret.\nRichard then persuaded Parliament to pass an act, \"Titulus Regius\", which debarred Edward V from the throne and proclaimed himself as King Richard III. At a meeting held on 23 January 1484 the former king's marriage was declared illegal. The document states:\nAnd howe also, that at the tyme of contract of the same pretensed Mariage, and bifore and longe tyme after, the seid King Edward was and stode maryed and trouth plight to oone Dame Elianor Butteler, Doughter of the old Earl of Shrewesbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontracte of Matrimonie, longe tyyme bifore he made the said pretensed Mariage with the said Elizabeth Grey, in maner and fourme abovesaid. \nOpponents of Richard declared that the precontract was fiction. Richard's leading enemy, Henry Tudor, allied himself with Elizabeth Woodville, promising to re-legitimise her children if Richard was overthrown. After Henry's army defeated and killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, he came to the throne as Henry VII. He ordered the copy of \"Titulus Regius\" in parliamentary records to be destroyed, along with all others (one copy was later found to have survived).\nStillington later joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel against Henry in 1487. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower until his death in 1491.\nPossible issue.\nIt was suggested that Eleanor had given birth to a child, possibly fathered by King Edward IV, shortly before her death.\nViews of historians.\nBecause Commines does not name the \"beautiful young lady\", and the official copy of \"Titulus Regius\" in parliament had been destroyed, Tudor historians confused Talbot with Edward's long-standing mistress Elizabeth Lucy (also known as Elizabeth Wayte), the probable mother of Edward IV's bastard son, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle. Thomas More, in his life of Richard III, states that Lucy was interrogated at the time of Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, because Edward's mother was strongly opposed to the marriage and had suggested that Edward was pre-contracted to Lucy. But Lucy denied that any contract had been made. More says that Richard revived the claim after Edward's death.\nGeorge Buck, who found the only surviving copy of \"Titulus Regius\", was the first to identify Eleanor Talbot as the woman in question. Buck, a defender of Richard, accepted the validity of the precontract. His view has been followed by many defenders of Richard since, including Horace Walpole and Clements Markham. Later Ricardians have also either accepted it as fact, or argued that Richard sincerely believed it to be true. It is also commonly argued by Ricardians that Stillington was imprisoned by Edward IV in 1478 because he incautiously spoke of the precontract to George, Duke of Clarence.\nOther historians have been more sceptical. John A. Wagner states that \"most modern historians believe the precontract to be a fabrication devised to give Richard III's usurpation a veneer of legitimacy. The betrothal cannot be documented beyond the account rehearsed in \"Titulus Regius\", and Richard never attempted to have the precontract authenticated by a church court, the proper venue for such a case\". Anne Crawford takes the view that any actual precontract with Eleanor Talbot is unlikely. If it had occurred before her marriage to Thomas Butler it would have been invalidated by the marriage. She suggests that the story may have originated with discussions between Edward's father Richard, Duke of York, and Eleanor's father John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, of a possible marriage, while both men were serving in France. But even that \"seems hardly likely\". Any valid precontract would most likely have been made in the early phase of Edward's reign, but the fact that Eleanor did not come forward when Edward married his queen militates against it. She also considers it odd that Eleanor's family did not support Richard's claims about the precontract. Since Edward was \"not stupid enough\" to have been unaware that any precontact would threaten his children's claim to the throne, if it had existed he could easily have applied to the Pope to free himself of it, which would have been the action of \"any prudent king and his advisors\". Michael Alexander argues that a precontract of marriage to Eleanor Talbot would not have affected the legitimacy of Edward's sons, since they were born after she died, her death negating any marriage.\nHowever, according to Helmholz (1986), canon law in this situation would not mitigate the illegitimacy of Edward's sons as, if the pre-contract existed, it would have meant that adultery had taken place on the part of Edward with Elizabeth. As such the illegitimacy could not be overcome by the death of Eleanor before the birth of Elizabeth's sons, even if Edward and Elizabeth married 'again' after Eleanor's death.\nEven if there was no formal precontract it is possible that Eleanor Talbot's name was used because she was known to have been one of the king's lovers. According to Thomas More, Edward had three \"concubines\" to whom he referred as the \"merriest\", the \"wiliest\" and \"the holiest harlot in the realm\" (who was always in church when she wasn't in bed with the king). More names the \"merriest\" as Jane Shore, but does not name the others because they were of higher social status (\"somewhat greater personages\"). It has been speculated that Elizabeth Lucy and Eleanor Talbot were the other two. Her loss of property after the death of her husband may have initiated the affair. Michael Hicks suggests that King Edward was liable to give \"benefits\" in exchange for sex: \"Three young widows, Eleanor Butler, Elizabeth Lucy and Elizabeth Wydeville [Woodville], may have bought concrete benefits from Edward IV with their sexual favours\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their uncle Richard III had been proclaimed the rightful king. Since the Lords and the Commons had not been officially convened as a parliament, doubts had arisen as to its validity and so when Parliament convened, it enacted the declaration as a law.\nAfter the death and overthrow of Richard III, the act was repealed, which reinstated the legitimacy of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's children.\nContents.\nEdward's marriage was invalidated because Bishop Robert Stillington testified that the king had precontracted a marriage to Lady Eleanor Butler.\nAnd how also, that at the time of contract of the same pretensed Marriage, and before and long time after, the said King Edward was and stood married and troth-plight to one Dame Eleanor Butler, Daughter of the old Earl of Shrewsbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontract of Matrimony, long time before he made the said pretensed Marriage with the said Elizabeth [Woodville] Grey, in manner and form above-said.\nThe document also claimed that Elizabeth Woodville and her mother had used witchcraft to get the king to marry her. Since Richard's brother George, Duke of Clarence, had been executed and attainted, his descendants forfeited all rights to the throne, leaving Richard the true heir. For good measure, the document also hinted that George and Edward (born in Ireland and Normandy, respectively) were themselves illegitimate and stated Richard, \"born within this land\" was the \"undoubted son and heir of Richard, late Duke of York\".\nEdward's reign was also criticised, he was said to have led by \"sensuality and concupiscence\" and delighted in \"adulation and flattery\" and to have been easily influenced by \"persons insolent, vicious and of inordinate avarice\", a reference to the Woodville family. In contrast, Richard was said to have been a man distinguished by \"great wit, prudence, justice, princely courage, and memorable and laudable acts in diverse battles.\"\nRepeal.\nAfter Richard was killed in battle, the act was repealed by the first parliament of the new king, Henry VII. The repeal was important because the new King and his supporters viewed Richard III's rule as a usurpation and also because Henry VII's prospective wife, Elizabeth of York, whom he had pledged to marry if he gained the throne, was the eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville and the Act had made her illegitimate.\nHenry also ordered his subjects to destroy all copies of it and all related documents without reading them. His orders were carried out so well that only one copy of the law has ever been found. That copy was transcribed by a monastic chronicler into the \"Croyland Chronicle\", where it was discovered by Sir George Buck more than a century later during the reign of James I.\nThe repealing act was passed in the first Parliament of Henry VII, stating that the original \"Titulus Regius\" was\nvoid, adnulled, repelled, irrite [invalidated], and of noe force ne effecte and that the original be destroyed, and that any copies should be either destroyed or returned to Parliament on pain of fine and imprisonment.\nA law report from his reign stated:\nthat the said Bill, Act and Record, be annulled and utterly destroyed, and that it be ordained by the same Authority, that the same Act and Record be taken out of the Roll of Parliament, and be cancelled and brent ['burned'], and be put in perpetual oblivion.\nHenry almost succeeded in suppressing the \"Titulus Regius\". The 100-year gap during which \"\" was censored coincided with the ruling period of the Tudor dynasty. It was known that Richard had claimed that a marriage pre-contract invalidated Edward's sons' right to the throne, but it was not known who Edward's supposed \"real\" wife was. Thomas More assumed that the act referred to Edward's longtime mistress, Elizabeth Lucy, a view that was repeated until Buck discovered the original document.\nEdward IV's first son, though \"Titulus Regius\" annulled his reign, is still counted as Edward V to emphasise that Richard III was a usurper. Thus, Henry VII's grandson was numbered Edward VI.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its territory is crossed by the Alps and the Apennines mountain range and is roughly coextensive with the former territory of the Republic of Genoa. Liguria is bordered by France (Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur) to the west, Piedmont to the north, and Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany to the east. It rests on the Ligurian Sea, and has a population of 1,509,908 as of 2025. The region is part of the Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Liguria\" predates Latin and is of obscure origin. The Latin adjectives (as in ) and \"Liguscus\" reveal the original root of the name, \"ligusc-\": in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of , according to rhotacism. Compare whence transl.\u2009the name of the place Liguria. The name derives from the ancient Ligures people, although the territory of this people was much larger than the current administrative region; it included all of North-west Italy south to the Po river, and south-eastern France.\nGeography.\nThe narrow strip of land is bordered by the sea, the Alps and the Apennine Mountains. Some mountains rise above ; the watershed line runs at an average altitude of about . The highest point of the region is the summit of Monte Saccarello ().\nLiguria is the third smallest Italian region after Aosta Valley and Molise, but is also one of the most densely populated, with a population density of 287 inhabitants/km2, much higher than the national average, and is fourth place after Campania, Lombardy and Lazio. However, there is much difference between inland mountain areas and coastal areas.\nThe region is crossed east to west by the Ligurian Alps and the Ligurian Apennines that form an interrupted chain, but discontinuous in its morphology, with stretches where the Alpine/Apennine ridge is extremely compact and high aligning very high mountain groups (north to Ventimiglia, a series of massifs which became French after the Second World War, rises up to altitudes of 2700\u20133000 m) while in other stretches (for example in the hinterland of Savona and Genoa) the mountain barrier is not very high and deeply crossed by short valleys and passes that do not reach 500 m above sea level (Bochetta di Altare, Passo dei Giovi, Crocetta d'Orero).\nThe winding arched extension goes from Ventimiglia to La Spezia. Of this, are mountainous (65% of the total) and are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\nThe continental shelf is very narrow and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its coastline. Except for the Portovenere and Portofino promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at Genoa and La Spezia.\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are and summer temperatures are , which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an orographic effect. Genoa and La Spezia can see up to of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of annually.\nAs of 2023, according to the report on land consumption of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, Marche and Liguria hold the Italian record for coastal overbuilding.\nItalian Riviera.\nThe Italian Riviera or Ligurian Riviera is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or ) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany. The Italian Riviera thus includes nearly all of the coastline of Liguria. Historically the \"Riviera\" extended further to the west, through what is now French territory as far as Marseille.\nThe Italian Riviera crosses all four Ligurian provinces and their capitals Genoa, Savona, Imperia and La Spezia, with a total length of about 350\u00a0km (218 miles). It is customarily divided into a western section, the Ponente Riviera, and an eastern section, the Levante Riviera, the point of division being the apex of the Ligurian arc at Voltri. It has about 1.6 million inhabitants, and most of the population is concentrated within the coastal area. Its mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of Liguria.\nAs a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.\nIndustries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy's leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy's major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important. in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes \"Cinque Terre\", Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 58 World Heritage Sites.\nThe Riviera's centre is Genoa, which divides it into two main sections: the Riviera di Ponente (\"the coast of the setting sun\"), extending westwards from Genoa to the French border; and the Riviera di Levante (\"the coast of the rising sun\") between Genoa and Capo Corvo. It is known for its mild climate and its reputation for a relaxed way of life, old fishing ports, and landscapes. It has been a popular destination for travellers and tourists since the time of Byron and Percy Shelley.\nMany villages and towns in the area are internationally known, such as Portofino, Bordighera, Lerici and the Cinque Terre. Many villages of Italian Riviera are counted among I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia (\"The most beautiful villages of Italy\"). The part of the Riviera di Ponente centred on Savona, is called the Riviera delle Palme (the Riviera of palms); the part centred on Sanremo, is the Riviera dei Fiori, after the long-established flower growing industry.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nEvidence of human presence in Liguria dates back to prehistoric times. Near the port of Nice, in Terra Amata, traces of the oldest huts built by nomadic hunters, around 300,000 years ago, have been found. The stratigraphy showed different settlement periods, with the remains of oval huts with a central hearth, chipped pebbles, scrapers and captured animals such as wild boar, turtles, Merk's rhinoceros, southern elephants, aurochs and various birds. Traces of Neanderthal Man have been found near Loano. In the caves of Toirano, signs of frequentation dating back to the end of the Upper Palaeolithic are visible. Remains reminiscent of Cro-Magnon Man have appeared in the Balzi Rossi cave in Ventimiglia. At the Arene Candide there is evidence of Neolithic and epigravettian strata dating between 20,000 and 18,700 years ago, while in the caves along the Pennavaira stream, in the valley of the same name in the Ingauno area, human remains have been found dating back as far as 7,000 BC.\nCopper begins to be mined from the middle of the 4th millennium BC in Liguria with the Libiola and Monte Loreto mines dated to 3700 BC.\nThese are the oldest copper mines in the western Mediterranean basin.\nFrom the 2nd millennium B.C. (Neolithic), there are records of the presence of Ligurians over a vast territory, corresponding to most of northern Italy.\nIt is commonly thought that the ancient Ligurians settled on the Mediterranean coastline, divided in several tribes, from the Rhone to the Arno (so we are told by Polybius), pushing their presence as far as the Spanish Mediterranean coast to the west and the Tiber to the south-east, colonizing the coasts of major islands such as Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily. Numerous ceramic artefacts remain of them.\nThe foundation of Genoa.\nThe Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC. In ancient times this area was inhabited by Ligures (ancient people after whom Liguria is named). According to excavations carried out in the city between 1898 and 1910, the Ligure population that lived in Genoa maintained trade relations with the Etruscans and the Greeks, since several objects from these populations were found. In the 5th century BC the first town, or oppidum, was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. The ancient Ligurian city was known as Stalia (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u00ec\u03b1), referred to in this way by Artemidorus Ephesius and Pomponius Mela; this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some from the coast. Stalia had an alliance with Rome through a \"foedus aequum\" (equal pact) in the course of the Second Punic War (218-201\u00a0BC). The Carthaginians accordingly destroyed it in 209\u00a0BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the Carthaginian Wars ended in 146\u00a0BC, it received municipal rights. The original \"castrum\" then expanded towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trade goods included skins, timber, and honey. Goods were moved to and from Genoa's hinterland, including major cities like Tortona and Piacenza. An amphitheater was also found there among other archaeological remains from the Roman period.\nRoman times.\nDuring the first Punic War, the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with Carthage, others, including the inhabitants of Stalia (later Genoa), with Rome. Under Augustus, Liguria was designated a region of Italy (\"Regio IX Liguria\") stretching from the coast to the banks of the Po River. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of Albenga, Ventimiglia and Luni. In 180\u00a0BC, the Romans, in order to dispose of Ligurian rebels in their seeking of the conquest of Gaul, they deported 47,000 Liguri Apuani, confining them to the Samnite area between Avellino and Benevento.\nMiddle Ages.\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries, Liguria was dominated by the Byzantines, the Lombards of King Rothari (about 641) and the Franks (about 774). It was also invaded by Saracen and Norman raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries, the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops' power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which Genoa soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.[]\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the Republic of Genoa experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the Mediterranean from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the Battle of Meloria (1284), it acquired control over the Tyrrhenian Sea and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, having colonies up to Black Sea and Crimean.\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of Simone Boccanegra, Genoa resumed its struggles against the Marquisate of Finale and the Counts of Laigueglia and it conquered again the territories of Finale, Oneglia and Porto Maurizio. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the Visconti family of Milan. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge Antoniotto Adorno to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\nEarly modern.\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when Andrea Doria allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic relative stability for about 250 years.\nGenoese explorer Christopher Columbus's speculative proposal to reach the East Indies by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative spice trade with Asia. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the Bahamas archipelago, at a locale he named \"San Salvador\". Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America, claiming them for the Spanish Empire.\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the Age of Discovery, when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the Cape of Good Hope. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 bombardment by Louis XIV's fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the Piedmontese and Austrian armies when these two states came into conflict with France. Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the Habsburg troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the Ligurian Republic, modelled on the French Republic. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the French Empire (1805) and divided by Napoleon into three departments: Montenotte (capital Savona), G\u00eanes (capital Genoa) and Apennins (capital Chiavari).\nLate modern and contemporary.\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the Congress of Vienna (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of \"Risorgimento\" were born in Liguria (Giuseppe Mazzini, Mameli, Nino Bixio). Italian patriot and general Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in the neighbouring Nice (then part of the Sardinian state), started his Expedition of the Thousand on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from Imperia to La Spezia, while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the Second World War, Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the German troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat, the city was awarded the gold medal for military valour.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km2, or 770 per mi2), being only less than Campania's, Lombardy's and Lazio's. In the Metropolitan City of Genoa, it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km2, whereas in the provinces of Imperia and Savona it is less than 200 inhabitants per km2. The Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur, noting it from sea in 1436, remarked \"To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses,\" and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: Genoa (pop. 610,000), La Spezia (pop. 95,000), Savona (pop. 62,000) and Sanremo (pop. 56,000).\nThe population of Liguria has been declining since the census in 1971, most markedly in the cities of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia. The age pyramid now looks more like a 'mushroom' resting on a fragile base. The negative trend has been partially interrupted only in the last decade when, after a successful economic recovery, the region has attracted consistent fluxes of immigrants. As of 2008[ [update]], the Italian national institute of statistics, ISTAT, estimated that 90,881 foreign-born immigrants live in Liguria, equal to 5.7% of the total regional population.\nEconomy.\nLigurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, wine, olive oil) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999). The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).\nSanremo Casino (official ) is a gambling and entertainment complex located in Sanremo, on the Italian Riviera. The Casino's building was designed by French architect Eug\u00e8ne Ferret, opening 14 January 1905. Seven different projects were submitted, resulting in the victory of Ferret, who adhered to the Art Nouveau movement, so much in vogue in France back then. Ferret was also to be the first manager of the proper gaming activities by an agreement signed on 5 November 1903. From 1913 the Casino had its own tram connection. From 1927 to 1934 the Casino was managed by Luigi De Santis who proved to be, among other things, a first-rate gamester for its knowledge of the game and the particularities of the world around it. In the 1930s, Pietro Mascagni, Luigi Pirandello and Francesco Pastonchi were regular clients of the Casino. De Santis invited Marta Abba to Sanremo and offered her the Compagnia Stabile (Theatre Company) of which Pirandello was to be its Artistic Director. It also granted funds to Pastonchi for the organisation and setting up of the Literary Mondays. The Sanremo Casino closed its doors on 10 June 1940. Still, undamaged by the war and two German and allied occupations, the Casino resumed its activities seven months after the end of World War II. From its first edition in 1951 until 1976, the Sanremo Casino was home of the Sanremo Music Festival.\nSteel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting production. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding, electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the region still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nEconomical statistics.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 49.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.8% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 32,000 euros or 106% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 8.3% in 2020 and was slightly lower than the national average.\nWine.\nLiguria is an Italian wine region located in the northwest region of Italy along the Italian Riviera. It is bordered by the Piedmont wine region to the north, the Alps and French wine region of Provence to the west, the Apennine Mountains and the Emilia-Romagna wine region to the east with a small border shared with Tuscany in the south-east along the Ligurian Sea.\nLiguria has several \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" regions with the most notable being the Cinque Terre DOC from cliff side vineyards situated among the five fishing villages of Cinque Terre in the province of La Spezia. The DOC produces light white wines made from grape varieties such as Bosco, Albarola and Vermentino. In the west is the red wine-producing region of Dolceacqua, producing wine from the indigenous Rossese grape.\nThe following is a list of DOCs in the Liguria region along with the grapes that may be included in the blend under varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label.\nTourism.\nLiguria has many small and picturesque villages, 20 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are:\nGovernment and politics.\nThe politics of Liguria takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.\nThe Regional Government is presided by the Governor, who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed of the President and the Ministers, who are currently 11, including a vice president.\nThe Regional Council has 40 members and is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the \"simul stabunt vel simul cadent\" clause (introduced in 1999), also the council will be dissolved and there will be a fresh election.\nIn the last regional election, which took place on 31 May 2015, Giovanni Toti (Forza Italia) defeated Raffaella Paita (Democratic Party), after 10 years of regional left-wing government by Claudio Burlando (Democratic Party).\nAt both national and local level, Liguria is considered a swing region, where no one of the two political blocs is dominant, with the two eastern provinces leaning left, and the two western provinces right.\nLiguria is one of 20 regions (administrative divisions) of Italy.\nAdministrative divisions.\nLiguria is divided into four provinces:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nCuisine.\nLiguria is the original source of pesto, one of the most popular sauces in Italian cuisine, made with fresh basil, pine kernels, olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese.\nSeafood is a major staple of Mediterranean cuisine, the Ligurian variety being no exception, as the sea has been part of the region's culture since its beginning. \"Ciuppin\" soup is made from fish leftovers and stale bread, flavoured with white wine, onion, and garlic.\nVegetables, especially beans, are important in Ligurian cooking. \"Mesciua\" soup is made from beans, olive oil and farro (old kinds of wheat including emmer). The Badalucco, conio and pigna beans are a Slow Food Presidium.\nLigurian pasta includes \"trenette\" and \"trofie\", and the fresh pasta pockets called \"pans\u00f2uti\".\nSports.\nThe two main men's football clubs are Genoa C.F.C. and U.C. Sampdoria, which have played for decades in Serie A. They share the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, and face each other in the Derby della Lanterna. The third most successful club is Spezia Calcio, which debuted in Serie A in 2020. Pro Recco is a men's water polo club that has a record 36 Serie A1 titles and 11 LEN Champions League titles.\nThe Milan\u2013San Remo (in Italian \"Milano-Sanremo\"), also called \"\"The Spring classic\" or \"La Classicissima\"\", is an annual road cycling race between Milan and Sanremo, in Northwest Italy. With a distance of 298\u00a0km (~185.2 miles) it is the longest professional one-day race in modern cycling. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907. It is traditionally the first of the five \"Monuments\" of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. \nThe Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition held in Sanremo, Italy. Except for the 1995 event, the event was part of the FIA World Rally Championship schedule from 1973 to the 2003. It was a round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge and is currently a round of the Italian national rally championship. The first \"Rallye Internazionale di Sanremo\" was held in 1928. The rally name's French word \"rallye\", as opposed to Italian \"rally\", was inspired by Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo. After another successful rally in 1929, the event was given to new organisers who decided to set up a street race through the town of Sanremo instead. The first one, 1\u00b0 Circuito Automobilistico Sanremo, was held in 1937 and won by Achille Varzi. Rallye Sanremo was restarted in 1961 as Rallye dei Fiori (\"Rally of the Flowers\") and has been held every year since.\nThe Piatti Tennis Center is a tennis academy and training center located in Bordighera, Italy, on the Italian Riviera. It was founded in 2018 by Riccardo Piatti. It was the original training base of tennis player Jannik Sinner\nTransport.\nA good motorways network ( in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nIn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region. The Port of Genoa, with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes is the first port of Italy, the second in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units after the port of transshipment of Gioia Tauro, with a trade volume of 1.86 million TEUs. The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona and Canary Islands.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; travel guide from Wikivoyage"}

After Lithuania regained independence in 1918, Gimbutas's parents organized the Lithuanian Association of Sanitary Aid which founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital.\nDuring this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper \"Vilniaus \u017eodis\" and the cultural magazine \"Vilniaus \u0161viesa\" and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War.\nGimbutas's parents were connoisseurs of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including Vyd\u016bnas, Juozas Tumas-Vai\u017egantas, and Jonas Basanavi\u010dius. With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said:I had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vyd\u016bnas, Tumas-Vai\u017egantas, even Basanavi\u010dius, who was taken care of by my parents. When I was four or five years old, I would sit in Basanavi\u010dius's easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavi\u010dius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.\nIn 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: \"All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports\u2014swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read.\"\nEmigration and life abroad.\nIn 1941, she married architect Jurgis Gimbutas. During the Second World War, Gimbutas lived under the Soviet occupation (1940\u201341) and then the German occupation (1941\u201343).\nGimbutas' first daughter, Danut\u0117, was born in June 1942. One year after the birth of their daughter, the young Gimbutas family, in the face of an advancing Soviet army, fled the country to areas controlled by Nazi Germany, first to Vienna and then to Innsbruck and Bavaria. In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, \"Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction.\"\nWhile holding a postdoctoral fellowship at T\u00fcbingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, \u017divil\u0117. In the 1950s, the Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States, where Gimbutas had a successful academic career. Her third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born in 1954 in Boston.\nGimbutas died in Los Angeles in 1994, at age 73. Soon afterwards, she was interred in Kaunas's Petra\u0161i\u016bnai Cemetery.\nCareer.\nEducation and academic appointments.\nFrom 1936, Gimbutas participated in ethnographic expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death. She graduated with honors from Au\u0161ra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the Vytautas Magnus University the same year, where she studied linguistics in the Department of Philology. She then attended the University of Vilnius to pursue graduate studies in archaeology (under Jonas Puzinas), linguistics, ethnology, folklore and literature.\nIn 1942 she completed her master's thesis, \"Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age\", with honors. She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942.\nIn 1946, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archaeology, with minors in ethnology and history of religion, from University of T\u00fcbingen with her dissertation \"Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania\" (\"Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit\"), which was published later that year. She often said that she had the dissertation under one arm and her child under the other arm when she and her husband fled the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, in the face of an advancing Soviet army in 1944.\nFrom 1947 to 1949 she did postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich.\nAfter arriving in the United States in the 1950s, Gimbutas immediately went to work at Harvard University translating Eastern European archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard's Peabody Museum. As a woman scholar, Gimbutas was banned from using Harvard's library which was reserved for men only. This was a factor in her leaving Harvard for UCLA.\nGimbutas then taught at UCLA, where she became Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies in 1964 and Curator of Old World Archaeology in 1965. In 1993, Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania.\nKurgan hypothesis.\nIn 1956 Gimbutas introduced her \"Kurgan hypothesis\", which combined archaeological study of the distinctive \"Kurgan\" burial mounds with linguistics to unravel some problems in the study of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the \"Kurgans\"; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into Europe. This hypothesis, and her method of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on Indo-European studies.\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on Bronze Age Europe, as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the prehistory of the Balts and Slavs, partly summed up in her definitive opus, \"Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe\" (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization.\nAs a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major excavations of Neolithic sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near \u0160tip, Republic of North Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe \u2013 where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds \u2013 she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and religion or spirituality, which she researched and documented throughout her career.\nThree genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the Kurgan theory of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, Y-chromosome haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.\nLate archaeology.\nGimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: \"The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe\" (1974); \"The Language of the Goddess\" (1989), which inspired an exhibition in Wiesbaden, 1993\u201394; and the last of the three, \"The Civilization of the Goddess\" (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about Neolithic cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy.\nThe \"Goddess\" trilogy articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered goddess- and woman-centered (gynocentric), and the Bronze Age Indo-European patriarchal (\"androcratic\") culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or \"matristic\") societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused economic equality.\nThe androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the hierarchical rule of male warriors.\nInfluence.\nGimbutas's work, along with that of her colleague, mythologist Joseph Campbell, is housed in the OPUS Archives and Research Center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California. The library includes Gimbutas's extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe.\nMary Mackey has written four historical novels based on Gimbutas's research: \"The Year the Horses Came\", \"The Horses at the Gate\", \"The Fires of Spring\", and \"The Village of Bones\".\nReception.\nJoseph Campbell and Ashley Montagu each compared the importance of Gimbutas's output to the historical importance of the Rosetta Stone in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas's \"The Language of the Goddess\" (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing \"The Masks of God\". The ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak argued in 2011 that a \"backlash\" against Gimbutas's work had been orchestrated, starting in the last years of her life and following her death.\nMainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas's later works. Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934\u20132012) of the University of Pennsylvania commented to \"The New York Times\" that most of Gimbutas's peers believe her to be \"immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ... She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument.\" He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric.\nDavid W. Anthony has praised Gimbutas's insights regarding the Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas's assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan. A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.\nPeter Ucko and Andrew Fleming were two early critics of the \"Goddess\" theory, with which Gimbutas later came to be associated. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph \"Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt\" warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. He notes, for example, that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as \"obviously\" significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in Egypt this was the female gesture of grief.\nFleming, in his 1969 paper \"The Myth of the Mother Goddess\", questioned the practice of identifying neolithic figures as female when they were not clearly distinguished as male and took issue with other aspects of the \"Goddess\" interpretation of Neolithic stone carvings and burial practices. Cynthia Eller also discusses the place of Gimbutas in injecting the idea into feminism in her 2000 book \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\".\nThe 2009 book \"Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism\" by Cathy Gere examines the political influence on archaeology more generally. Through the example of Knossos on the island of Crete, which had been represented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established in 1946, the institution maintained a deliberately small enrollment and operated as a self-governing academic community. Its educational model emphasized individualized learning, allowing students to design their own degree plans, typically culminating in a senior thesis. In 1998, the college expanded its offerings by establishing a graduate school.\nMarlboro College ceased operations at the end of the 2019\u20132020 academic year. Its remaining endowment and academic legacy were transferred to Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, leading to the creation of the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies at Emerson.\nHistory.\nMarlboro College was founded in 1946 by Walter F. Hendricks, who had been inspired by his time as director of English at Biarritz American University. Hendricks led the college for five years, until 1951, but would leave after a dispute with the trustees. He founded Windham College that same year.\nMany of the first students were returning World War II veterans. The campus incorporated the buildings of three farms that were on the site at Potash Hill. The first students were primarily freshmen but included some sophomores and juniors and one senior, Hugh Mulligan, who in 1948 became the first Marlboro graduate. The students made \"How Are Things At Casserole College?\" the first school song in response to the dining hall menu.\nIn 2012, Marlboro instituted the Beautiful Minds Challenge, an essay contest for high school students with full or partial scholarships and other awards as prizes. Essays could take the form of text, images, audio, or video and were judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students; finalists were flown to the Marlboro campus for a symposium where they presented their work. The program was discontinued after the 2018 competition. The Renaissance Scholars program, instituted in 2015 with the objective of attracting new students from every state and increasing diversity, caused a rise in enrollment to approximately 200 in fall 2016.\nThe college remained intentionally small; in 2017 it was one of only three liberal arts colleges listed by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" where all classes had fewer than 20 students.\nMerger.\nIn 2018, Marlboro's small size and dwindling enrollment led the Board of Trustees to begin exploring merging with another college or university. In 2019, a merger with the University of Bridgeport was announced and then called off.\nLater that year, the college announced that it would merge with Emerson College at the end of the 2019\u201320 academic year. Under the agreement, finalized on July 23, 2020, Marlboro gave its endowment to Emerson, which created the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. Marlboro students were guaranteed admission and tenure-track faculty were guaranteed teaching positions at Emerson. At the time of its closure, Marlboro had approximately 150 students.\nAcademics.\nUndergraduate.\nFreshmen were required to meet the \"Clear Writing Requirement\" by submitting an acceptable portfolio of at least 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee.\nWith the guidance of professors, juniors and seniors developed and followed an individualized \"Plan of Concentration\", often interdisciplinary, of which at least 20% was required to consist of an independent project prepared without direct faculty input; most students' plans culminated in a thesis. Students defended their work in an oral examination before one or more Marlboro faculty members and an outside evaluator unconnected to the college but with expertise in the student's field of study.\nMarlboro's strengths included Asian studies, religion and theology, and life sciences.\nIn March 2014, Marlboro and five nearby colleges, Community College of Vermont, Landmark College, the School for International Training, Union Institute, and Vermont Technical College, formed the Windham Higher Education Cooperative, allowing students to take one course a semester at another participating institution.\nGraduate.\nMarlboro College Graduate and Professional Studies began in 1998. Primarily aimed at working professionals and focused on technology, in 2010 it shifted to programs focused on socially responsible management and master's studies in teaching (teaching with technology, teaching for social justice, and TESOL). later added an accelerated Master's track open to undergraduates in some programs.\nThe graduate school was initially located in nearby Brattleboro. It moved to the main college campus in Marlboro in April 2017, and after that offered courses increasingly online and instituted a teach-out. Enrollment was suspended for 2019\u201320 and graduate programs were not transferred to Emerson under the merger agreement.\nRankings and reputation.\nIn \"The Princeton Review\"'s 2014 annual college guide, Marlboro College received the highest possible academic rating of 99 and was ranked #1 nationally for the quality of its faculty. In 2017, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked it #117 among liberal arts colleges in the United States.\nIn 2006 Loren Pope wrote in \"Colleges That Change Lives\" that \"the Marlboro adventure\" was \"far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone\".\nStudent life and governance.\nMarlboro was founded on an ethos of independence combined with community participation. Students, faculty, and staff made decisions together in weekly \"Town Meetings\", and there was an elected community court. Students, faculty, and staff served on elected committees that played a role in hiring decisions and steering the curriculum. All campus buildings were open 24/7, and the library used a self-checkout honor system.\nDuring spring and fall, students were encouraged to work regularly on the school farm. Campuswide Work Days took place each semester, with students, faculty, and staff working together on projects as needed, in the spirit of the first class, who built their own dormitories.\nThe administration published a magazine called \"Potash Hill\". The student newspaper, \"The Citizen\", and the \"Marlboro College Literary Magazine\" were edited by students elected at Town Meetings.\nOpen mic nights at the Campus Center happened several times a semester in addition to events including the Drag Ball, MayFest, and Apple Days, and other events. The night before writing portfolios were due, a \"Midnight Breakfast\" was held.\nThe college had few organized sports teams, but the \"Outdoor Program\" promoted rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, and hiking, and college was only 15\u00a0miles from the Mount Snow ski resort. A broomball tournament was held every February beginning in 1990.\nCampus.\nThe Marlboro College campus is located on South Road in the town of Marlboro, Vermont, in the Green Mountains. In the early years of the college, students and faculty worked together to adapt the buildings of three farms on the site, which became the main classroom building, the dining hall, and the admissions and administration buildings.\nThrough grants from federal, state and private entities, the college improved the energy efficiency of the Dining Hall, Dalrymple classroom building, Mather administration building, and Admissions building since 2008, as well as the student residences. In summer 2011, the half-circle driveway at the campus entrance was converted to green space and walking paths.\nThe Serkin Performing Arts Center has a 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with baby grand pianos and a 5,000-square foot dance studio. Whittemore Theater, used primarily by the Theater department, was attached to Drury Gallery, which displayed student works.\nThe Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, housing studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces in 14,000\u00a0square feet, opened in May 2016.\nIn the summer, the campus is the location of the Marlboro Music Festival, founded in 1951. A new 99-year lease was signed in February 2019 and a residence hall and the Jerome and Celia Reich Building, containing a music library and chamber music rehearsal spaces, are scheduled for completion in 2021.\nSale.\nThe former Marlboro campus was sold in May 2020 to Democracy Builders, founded by Seth Andrew, which intended to use it for a low-residency, low-cost college program for low-income students. The Degrees of Freedom program would last four years, from eleventh grade to the second year of college, and would result in an associate degree. The program was slated to be largely online, with students only being on campus two weeks out of each trimester.\nIn February 2021, Andrew announced that Democracy Builders had sold the campus to \"Type 1 Civilization Academy\" via a quitclaim deed. On March 9, 2021, During an invitation-only community meeting on Zoom, Andrew announced that the Type 1 deal had been cancelled. He called the agreement \"an engagement\" rather than \"a marriage\". Andrew filed another quit claim deed which transferred the property back to Democracy Builders. The principal of Type 1, Adrian Stein, said that Type 1 was legitimately in control of the campus and that the issue will likely end up in court unless they can find \"some other kind of equitable settlement.\"\nOpening of the Democracy Builders program was deferred in April 2021 after Andrew was charged with financial crimes.\nIn July 2021, the campus was purchased by the Marlboro Music Festival. The Marlboro Music Festival formed the subsidiary nonprofit organization, Potash Hill, Inc. to manage the property.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His films, in which he has often played eccentric characters, have grossed over $10.8 billion worldwide.\nDepp began his career as a musician performing in several amateur rock bands before making his feature film debut in the horror film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984). He then acted in \"Platoon\" (1986) before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series \"21 Jump Street\" (1987\u20131990).

He earned three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles as the leading man in ' (2003), J. M. Barrie in \"Finding Neverland\" (2004), and the title role in ' (2007). His other well-received films include \"Public Enemies\" (2009), \"Rango\" (2011), \"Into the Woods\" (2014), \"Black Mass\" (2015), \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (2017) and \"Minamata\" (2020). He portrayed Gellert Grindelwald in two films within the Wizarding World's \"Fantastic Beasts\" films in 2016 and .\nFor his work in the film industry, he received an Honorary C\u00e9sar and star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He was named \"People's\" Sexiest Man Alive twice, in 2003 and in 2009. Outside acting, Depp has produced films through his company Infinitum Nihil, which he founded in 2004. He also formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. In 2022, Depp won a defamation case against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, with the jury awarding him $15 million and Heard $2 million in her countersuit. The highly publicized case sparked widespread debate on defamation, domestic abuse, and male victims of domestic violence, leading to a settlement in December 2022.\nEarly life.\nDepp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Depp (n\u00e9e Wells; later Palmer) and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15, and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called \"an inspiration\".\nDepp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands. He dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.\nAfter modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels. He co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album \"Young Man's Blues\". Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.\nDepp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, Irish and African American ancestry. Elizabeth Key Grinstead, one of the first African Americans in the North American colonies to sue for her freedom and win, is an eighth great-grandmother. His surname comes from a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, \"I guess I have some Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian.\"\nDepp's claims came under scrutiny when \"Indian Country Today\" wrote that Depp had never inquired about his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation. This led to criticism of Depp, from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry, and Native community leaders consider him \"a non-Indian\" and a pretendian. Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in \"The Lone Ranger\" was criticized, along with his choice to name his rock band \"Tonto's Giant Nuts\". During the promotion for \"The Lone Ranger\", Depp was formally adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.\nCareer.\n1980s: Television and early film roles.\nDepp moved to Los Angeles with his band when he was 20. After the band split up, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage. After they became drinking buddies, Cage advised him to pursue acting. Depp had been interested in acting since reading a biography of James Dean and watching \"Rebel Without a Cause\". Cage helped Depp get an audition with Wes Craven for \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"; Depp, who had no acting experience, said he \"ended up acting by accident\". Thanks in part to his catching the eye of Craven's daughter, Depp landed the role of the main character's boyfriend, one of Freddy Krueger's victims.\nAlthough Depp said he \"didn't have any desire to be an actor\", he continued to be cast in films, making enough to cover some bills that his musical career left unpaid. After a starring role in the 1985 comedy \"Private Resort\", Depp was cast in the lead role of the 1986 skating drama \"Thrashin\"' by the film's director, but its producer overrode the decision. Instead, Depp appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War drama \"Platoon\". He became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series \"21 Jump Street\", which premiered in 1987. He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series \"forced [him] into the role of product\".\n1990s: Diversification.\nDisillusioned by his experiences as a teen idol in \"21 Jump Street\", Depp began taking roles he found more interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. His first film release in 1990 was John Waters's \"Cry-Baby\", a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although not a box-office success upon its release, over the years it has gained cult classic status. Also in 1990, Depp played the title character in Tim Burton's romantic fantasy film \"Edward Scissorhands\" opposite Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder. The film was a commercial and critical success with a domestic gross of $53 million. In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study how to create sympathy without dialogue. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" praised Depp's performance, writing that he \"artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a terrific performance\", while Rita Kempley of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that he \"brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands\". Depp earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the film. Owing to this role, a species of extinct arthropod with prominent claws was named after Depp as \"Kootenichela deppi\" (\"chela\" is Latin for claws or scissors).\nDepp had no film releases in the next two years, except a brief cameo in \"\" (1991), the sixth installment in the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy \"Benny and Joon\", he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a sleeper hit. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Depp \"may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life\". Depp received a second Golden Globe nomination for the performance. His second film of 1993 was Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\", a drama about a dysfunctional family co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliette Lewis. It did not perform well commercially, but received positive notices from critics. Although most of the reviews focused on DiCaprio, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote that \"Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization\". Depp's last 1993 release was Emir Kusturica's surrealist comedy-drama \"Arizona Dream\", which opened to positive reviews and won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\nIn 1994, Depp reunited with Burton, playing the title role in \"Ed Wood\", a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later said that he was depressed about films and filmmaking at the time, but that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed\". He found that the role gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\" and that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Although it did not earn back its production costs, \"Ed Wood\" received a positive reception from critics, with Maslin writing that Depp had \"proved himself as an established, certified great actor\" and \"captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud\". Depp was nominated for a third time for a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe for his performance.\nThe next year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite Marlon Brando in the box-office hit \"Don Juan DeMarco\", as a man who believes he is Don Juan, the world's greatest lover. He starred in Jim Jarmusch's \"Dead Man\", a Western shot entirely in black-and-white; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. And in the financial and critical failure \"Nick of Time\", Depp played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.\nIn 1997, Depp and Al Pacino starred in the crime drama \"Donnie Brasco\", directed by Mike Newell. Depp played Joseph D. Pistone, an undercover FBI agent who assumes the name Donnie Brasco to infiltrate the Mafia in New York City. To prepare, Depp spent time with Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. \"Donnie Brasco\" was a commercial and critical success, and is considered one of Depp's finest performances. Also in 1997, Depp debuted as a director and screenwriter with \"The Brave\". He starred in it as a poor Native American man who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man, played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a snuff film in exchange for money for his family. It premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival to generally negative reviews. \"Variety\" called it \"a turgid and unbelievable neo-western\", and Time Out wrote that \"besides the implausibilities, the direction has two fatal flaws: it's both tediously slow and hugely narcissistic as the camera focuses repeatedly on Depp's bandana'd head and rippling torso\". Due to the reviews, Depp did not release \"The Brave\" in the U.S.\nDepp was a fan and friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, and played his alter ego Raoul Duke in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" (1998), Terry Gilliam's film adaptation of Thompson's pseudo-biographical novel of the same name. It was a box-office failure and polarized critics. Later that year, Depp made a brief cameo in Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki's \"L.A. Without a Map\" (1998).\nDepp appeared in three films in 1999. The first was the sci-fi thriller \"The Astronaut's Wife\", co-starring Charlize Theron, which was not a commercial or critical success. The second,\"The Ninth Gate\", starred Depp as a seller of old books who becomes entangled in a mystery. It was moderately more successful with audiences but received mixed reviews. The third was Burton's adaptation of \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", where Depp played Ichabod Crane opposite Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone, saying he \"always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl\". \"Sleepy Hollow\" was a commercial and critical success.\n2000s: Worldwide recognition.\nDepp's first film release of the new millennium was British-French drama \"The Man Who Cried\" (2000), directed by Sally Potter and starring him as a Roma horseman opposite Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, and John Turturro. It was not a critical success. Depp also had a supporting role in Julian Schnabel's critically acclaimed \"Before Night Falls\" (2000). His final film of 2000 was Hallstr\u00f6m's critically and commercially successful \"Chocolat,\" in which he played a Roma man and the love interest of the main character, Juliette Binoche. Depp's next roles were both based on historical persons. In \"Blow\" (2001), he starred as cocaine smuggler George Jung, who was part of the Medell\u00edn Cartel in the 1980s. The film underperformed at the box office and received mixed reviews. In the comic book adaptation \"From Hell\" (2001), Depp portrayed inspector Frederick Abberline, who investigated the Jack the Ripper murders in the 1880s London. The film also received mixed reviews but was a moderate commercial success.\nIn 2003, Depp starred in the Walt Disney Pictures adventure film \"\", which was a major box office success. He earned widespread acclaim for his comic performance as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and won a Screen Actor's Guild Award for Best Actor as well as an MTV Movie Award. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and that he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and cartoon skunk Pep\u00e9 Le Pew. Studio executives had at first been ambivalent about Depp's portrayal, but the character became popular with audiences. In his other film release in 2003, Robert Rodriguez' action film \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\", Depp played a corrupt CIA agent. A moderate box-office success, it received average to good reviews, with Depp's performance in particular receiving praise.\nDepp next starred as an author with writer's block in the thriller \"Secret Window\" (2004), based on a short story by Stephen King. It was a moderate commercial success but received mixed reviews. Released around the same time, the British-Australian independent film \"The Libertine\" (2004) saw Depp portray the seventeenth-century poet and rake, the Earl of Rochester. It had only limited release, and received mainly negative reviews. Depp's third film of 2004, \"Finding Neverland\", was more positively received by the critics, and earned him his second Academy Award nomination as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG nominations for his performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie. Depp also made a brief cameo appearance in the French film \"Happily Ever After\" (2004), and founded his own film production company, Infinitum Nihil, under Warner Bros. Pictures.\nDepp continued his box-office success with a starring role as Willy Wonka in Tim Burton's adaptation of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005). It also had a positive critical reception, with Depp being nominated again for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical. \"Chocolate Factory\" was followed by another Burton project, stop-motion animation \"Corpse Bride\" (2005), in which Depp voiced the main character, Victor Van Dort. Depp reprised the role of Jack Sparrow in the \"Pirates\" sequels ' (2006) and ' (2007), both of which were major box office successes. He also voiced the character in the video game \"\". According to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow was the main reason for many cinema-goers to see a \"Pirates\" film.\nIn 2007, Depp collaborated with Burton for their sixth film together, this time playing murderous barber Sweeney Todd in the musical \"\" (2007). Depp cited Peter Lorre's performance in \"Mad Love\" (1935), in which Lorre played a \"creepy but sympathetic\" surgeon, as his main influence for the role. \"Sweeney Todd\" was the first film in which Depp had been required to sing. Instead of hiring a qualified vocal coach, he prepared for the role by recording demos with his old bandmate Bruce Witkin. The film was a commercial and critical success. \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Chris Nashawaty stated that, \"Depp's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding ... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors ... it's hard not to be reminded of \"Edward Scissorhands\" frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago ... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" Depp won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy Actor for the role, and was nominated for the third time for an Academy Award.\nIn 2009, Depp portrayed real-life gangster John Dillinger in Michael Mann's 1930s crime film \"Public Enemies\". It was commercially successful and gained moderately positive reviews. Roger Ebert stated in his review that, \"This Johnny Depp performance is something else. For once an actor playing a gangster does not seem to base his performance on movies he has seen. He starts cold. He plays Dillinger as a fact.\" Depp's second film of 2009, \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\", reunited him with director Terry Gilliam. Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell each played the character initially portrayed by their friend Heath Ledger, who had died before the film was completed. All three actors gave their salaries to Ledger's daughter, Matilda.\n2010s: Career fluctuations.\nDepp began the 2010s with another collaboration with Tim Burton, \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), in which he played the Mad Hatter opposite Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman. Despite mixed reviews, it earned US$1.025 billion in the box office, thus becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2010 and one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Depp's second film release of 2010 was the romantic thriller \"The Tourist\", in which he starred opposite Angelina Jolie. It was commercially successful, although panned by critics. Regardless, he received Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Golden Globe nominations for both films.\nDepp's first 2011 film release was the animated film \"Rango\", in which he voiced the title character, a lizard. It was a major critical and commercial success. His second film of the year, the fourth installment in the \"Pirates\" series, \"\", was again a box office hit, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2011. Later in 2011, Depp released the first two projects co-produced by his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was a film adaptation of the novel \"The Rum Diary\" by Hunter S. Thompson and starred Depp. It failed to bring back its production costs and received mixed reviews. The company's second undertaking, Martin Scorsese's \"Hugo\" (2011), garnered major critical acclaim and several awards nominations, but similarly did not perform well in the box office. In 2011, Depp also made a brief cameo in the Adam Sandler film \"Jack and Jill\".\nBy 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars, and was listed by the \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million. That year, he and his \"21 Jump Street\" co-stars Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series' feature film adaptation. Depp also starred in and co-produced his eighth film with Tim Burton, \"Dark Shadows\" (2012), alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Eva Green. The film was based on a 1960s Gothic television soap opera of the same name, which had been one of his favorites as a child.\nAfter Infinitum Nihil's agreement with WB expired in 2011, Depp signed a multi-year first-look deal with Walt Disney Studios. The first film made in the collaboration was \"The Lone Ranger\" (2013), in which Depp starred as Tonto. Depp's casting as a Native American brought accusations of whitewashing, and the film was not well received by the public or the critics, causing Disney to take a US$190 million loss. Following a brief cameo in the independent film \"Lucky Them\" (2013), Depp starred as an AI-studying scientist in the sci-fi thriller \"Transcendence\" (2014), which was yet another commercial failure, and earned mainly negative reviews. His other roles in 2014 were a minor supporting part as The Wolf in the film adaptation of \"Into the Woods\", and a more substantial appearance as eccentric French-Canadian ex-detective in Kevin Smith's horror-comedy \"Tusk\", in which he was credited by the character's name, Guy LaPointe.\nIn 2015, Depp appeared in two films produced by Infinitum Nihil. The first was comedy-thriller \"Mortdecai\", in which he acted opposite Gwyneth Paltrow. The film was a critical and commercial failure. The second film, \"Black Mass\" (2015), in which he played Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, was better received. Critics from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Variety\" called it one of Depp's best performances to date, and the role earned Depp his third nomination for the Best Actor SAG award. However, the film failed to bring back its production costs. Depp also made a cameo appearance in the critically panned \"London Fields\", starring his then-wife Amber Heard, which was to be released in 2015, but its general release was delayed by litigation until 2018. In addition to his work in films in 2015, French luxury fashion house Dior signed Depp as the face of their men's fragrance, Sauvage, and he was inducted as a Disney Legend.\nDepp's first film release in 2016 was \"Yoga Hosers\", a sequel to \"Tusk\" (2014), in which Depp appeared with his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp. Next, he played businessman and presidential candidate Donald Trump in a Funny or Die satire entitled \"\", released during the run-up to the US presidential election. He earned praise for the role, with a headline from \"The A.V. Club\" declaring, \"Who knew Donald Trump was the comeback role Johnny Depp needed?\". It was also announced that Depp had been cast in a new franchise role as Dr. Jack Griffin/The Invisible Man in Universal Studios's planned shared film universe entitled the Dark Universe, a rebooted version of their classic Universal Monsters franchise. One of the severed zombie heads featured in \"The Walking Dead\" season 6 episode \"Not Tomorrow Yet\" was based on Depp. Episode director Greg Nicotero said, \"I think we had sculpted an emaciated version of a dummy head for something and we used Johnny Depp's head as a basis just for a clay sculpt.\" Depp reprised the role of the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" (2016), the sequel to \"Alice in Wonderland\". In contrast to the first film's success, the sequel lost Disney approximately US$70 million. Depp had also been secretly cast to play dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in a cameo appearance in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016), the first installment of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise. His name was not mentioned in the promotional materials and his cameo was only revealed at the end of the film.\nIn 2017, Depp appeared alongside other actors and filmmakers in \"The Black Ghiandola\", a short film made by a terminally ill teenager through the non-profit Make a Film Foundation. He also reprised his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth installment of the \"Pirates\" series, \"\" (2017). In the US, it did not perform as well as previous installments. However, the film had a good box office return internationally, especially in China, Japan and Russia. Depp's last film release in 2017 was the Agatha Christie adaptation \"Murder on the Orient Express\", in which he was part of an ensemble cast led by director-star Kenneth Branagh.\nIn 2018, Depp voiced the title character Sherlock Gnomes in the animated movie \"Gnomeo &amp; Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes\". Although moderately commercially successful, it was critically panned. Depp then starred in two independent films, both produced by him and his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was \"City of Lies\", in which he starred as Russell Poole, an LAPD detective who attempts to solve the murders of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. It was set for release in September 2018, but was pulled from the release schedule after a crew member sued Depp for assault. The second film was the comedy-drama \"Richard Says Goodbye\", in which Depp played a professor with terminal cancer. It premiered at the Zurich Film Festival in October 2018. Depp's last film release of 2018 was \"\", in which he reprised his role as Grindelwald. Depp's casting received criticism from fans of the series due to the domestic violence allegations against him.\nDepp also experienced other career setbacks around this time, as Disney confirmed that they would not be casting him in new \"Pirates\" installments and he was reported to no longer be attached to Universal's Dark Universe franchise. Depp's next films was the independent drama \"Waiting for the Barbarians\" (2019), which premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and is based on a novel by J. M. Coetzee.\n2020s: Personal struggles and resurgence.\nIn \"Minamata\" (2020), Depp portrayed photographer W. Eugene Smith. The film premiered at the 2020 Berlin International Film Festival. In November 2020, Depp resigned from his role as Grindelwald in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise at the request of its production company, Warner Bros., after he lost his UK libel case against \"The Sun\", which had accused him of being a domestic abuser. He was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen.\nIn March 2021, \"City of Lies\", which was originally scheduled for 2018, was released in theaters and streaming services. The same month, an online petition to bring Depp back to the \"Pirates\" franchise, begun four months earlier, reached its goal of 500,000 signatures. His \"Pirates\" co-star Kevin McNally also expressed support for Depp returning to the role. In July 2021, Andrew Levitas, the director of \"Minamata\" (2020), accused MGM\u00a0of trying to bury the film due to Depp's involvement, with Depp claiming he is being boycotted by the Hollywood industry and calling his changed reputation an \"absurdity of media mathematics\". \"Minamata\" was released in the UK and Ireland in August 2021, and in North America in December 2021. The film received positive reviews, with multiple publications praising Depp's performance as his best in years. Depp also continues as the face of Dior's men's fragrance, Sauvage.\nDepp received multiple honorary awards at numerous European film festivals, including at the Camerimage festival in Poland, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival\u00a0in the Czech Republic, and the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival\u00a0in Spain, where Depp was awarded the Donostia Award. These awards were controversial, with various domestic violence charities criticizing the festivals. The organizers of the ceremonies released statements defending their decision to award Depp, with the San Sebastian Film Festival stating that \"he has not been charged by any authority in any jurisdiction, nor convicted of any form of violence against women\".\nIn September 2021, Depp described himself as a victim of cancel culture. The same month, he launched IN.2, a London-based sister company to his production company, Infinitum Nihil, and announced that IN.2 and the Spanish production company \"A Contracorriente Films\" were starting a new development fund for TV and film projects. On February 15, 2022, Depp received the Serbian Gold Medal of Merit from President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 for \"outstanding merits in public and cultural activities, especially in the field of film art and the promotion of the Republic of Serbia in the world\". \"Minamata\" and animated series \"Puffins\" were shot in the country.\nOn May 29, 2022, Depp, who was still awaiting a verdict in his highly publicized defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, made a surprise appearance at a Jeff Beck gig in Sheffield, playing guitar alongside Beck to three classic songs from John Lennon, Marvin Gaye and Jimi Hendrix. Depp joined Beck on his last concert tour in the UK and Europe during June and July and in the United States in October and November, to promote their album \"18\". In August 2022, he made a cameo appearance at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards.\nDepp next starred as King Louis XV in French actor-director Ma\u00efwenn's period film \"Jeanne Du Barry\" (2023). This was the first film for Depp where he acted in French. The film premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival as the opening film, where it was greeted with a 7-minute standing ovation and received a mixed reception from film critics. Many critics deemed it Depp's comeback role, something he did not agree with.\n\"Mod\u00ec, Three Days on the Wing of Madness\" (2024), was Depp's first directorial effort in over 25 years. The film is about 72 hours in the life of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, and Depp co-produced it through his European company IN.2 Film, alongside Al Pacino.

A European sister-company to Infinitum Nihil, entitled IN.2, was launched in September 2021. In a press release, Depp stated: \"From the student to the maestro, from the aspiring artists to the yet-knowns, to the well-established great masters across all forms of modern media, IN.2 will build a space where artists can be artists, where they will be free to create those unexpected moments, those happy accidents that contain the propensity to constitute great art and so bring their unique vision to life.\"\nDepp co-owned the nightclub The Viper Room in Los Angeles from 1993 to 2003, and he was also part owner of the restaurant-bar Man Ray in Paris for a short period of time. Depp and Douglas Brinkley edited folk singer Woody Guthrie's novel \"House of Earth\", which was published in 2013.\nMusic.\nPrior to his acting career, Depp was a guitarist, and has later featured on songs by Oasis, Shane MacGowan, Iggy Pop, Vanessa Paradis, Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, and The New Basement Tapes, among others.

The band made their live debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles in September 2015, and has since done three world tours in 2016, 2018 and 2023. Their second studio album, \"Rise\", was released in June 2019 and consists mostly of original material, including songs written by Depp. The album also features a cover version of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", sung by Depp.\nIn 2020, Depp released a cover of John Lennon's \"Isolation\" with guitarist Jeff Beck, and stated that they would be releasing more music together in the future. Beginning in May 2022, Depp joined Beck onstage for a number of concerts in the United Kingdom, where Beck announced they had recorded an album together. Their joint record, titled \"18\", was released on July 15, 2022. Depp also accompanied Beck on his last European and American tours, which began in June and ended in November. In May 2023, Depp performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, sharing the stage with Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kirk Hammett among others.\nOn July 17, 2024, Depp was a special guest at one of the three Andrea Bocelli 30th anniversary concerts. Together, Depp and Bocelli performed the song \"En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor\" in honor of Jeff Beck. Depp played the guitar, while Bocelli sang. Other guests included Will Smith, Ed Sheeran, Russell Crowe, Brian May, Jon Batiste and Laura Pausini.\nArt.\nIn July 2022, artwork made by Depp sold out less than a day since it debuted in the art retailer Castle Fine Art in London's Covent Garden. The art house hosted his \"Friends &amp; Heroes\" collection, which was described as paintings of people \"who have inspired him as a person\". Among the art pieces, the names include actors Al Pacino and Elizabeth Taylor and musicians Bob Dylan and Keith Richards. Depp made for nearly $4 million and sold 780 prints through the art house's 37 galleries. Ahead of the sale, Depp expressed his desire to display his art publicly and stated, \"I've always used art to express my feelings and to reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire.\" He added, \"My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves.\" All 780 pieces sold within hours, with framed individual images going for \u00a33,950 and the complete portfolio of four images selling for \u00a314,950. \"This world-first release proved to be our fastest-selling collection to date, with all titles selling out in just hours\", the gallery announced on Instagram. Speaking on behalf of fine art publishers, Washington Green Glyn Washington described Depp as a \"true creative, with an extraordinary eye for detail and nuance\".\nA second installment in the \"Friends &amp; Heroes\" collection, this time entitled \"Friends &amp; Heroes II\" was released in March 2023. Prints of public figures Heath Ledger, Bob Marley, River Phoenix and Hunter S. Thompson were made available for sale, as a four-piece, and signed by Depp, or sold individually. In July 2023, Depp unveiled an auto portrait, entitled \"Five\" which he had painted in 2021. The meaning of the number five is, according to Depp, linked the fact that he was about to enter the fifth year of a dark phase in his life. Depp spoke about the difficulty in creating a self-portrait, stating: \"It's not the most comfortable thing doing a self-portrait. Although, in a weird way, almost everything you do is a self-portrait in one way or another.\" The collections were once again hosted by Castle Fine Art gallery.\nDepp opened his first art exhibition \"A Bunch of Stuff\" on October 4, 2024, at the Starrett\u2013Lehigh Building in New York City. The exhibition features artworks created by Depp over many decades, with some dating back to his 20s. On September 30, 2024, a special preview event took place, with Depp and some of his friends and family members present, including Jim Jarmusch, Jerry Bruckheimer and Justin Bartha.\nPhilanthropy.\nDepp has a history of supporting various charitable causes. In 2006, Depp received the \"Courage to Care\" award from Children's Hospital Los Angeles for his advocacy for children and children's charities. In 2016, he received the \"Rhonda's Kiss Healing and Hope Award\" at the Rhonda's Kiss annual benefit concert. The award recognized his work with cancer patients and his contributions to research.\nDepp donated nearly $800,000 to several charities through the sale of his \"Never Fear Truth\" NFTs. The donations were made to children's hospitals and other organizations, including the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Perth Children's Hospital Foundation, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, and The Footprint Coalition. He also donated the $1 million settlement he received from Amber Heard to five charities: Make-A-Film Foundation, The Painted Turtle, Tetiaroa Society, Red Feather, and Amazonia Fund Alliance.\nDepp and Rod Stewart collaborated on a private benefit concert to raise money for Celia Hammond's Animal Trust. The event, which took place in London, aimed to support the charity's efforts in rescuing and caring for cats and kittens. The concert successfully raised over $300,000. Depp donated an original, signed piece of artwork to The Bright Foundation, a UK-based children's arts education charity, for auction. The auction, managed by Kerry Taylor Auctions, included the artwork and three of Depp's costumes. The proceeds will help the arts education charity to provide access to creative activities for children and young people facing disadvantage in the UK.\nDepp has visited hospitals' children's wards as Jack Sparrow around the world, from Vancouver, Paris, London, Australia and U.S. His most recent visits were in Spain. He also recorded a video message as the character to a terminally ill boy. Depp made a voice message as himself for a girl who had been in a coma for five months; parents of the girl asked him to tape a message because he was the favorite actor of their daughter and they hoped playing the message would help wake her up.\nPublic image and reception.\nIn the 1990s, Depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that role. After becoming a teen idol in \"21 Jump Street\", he publicly protested against the image, and with his subsequent film and public relations choices began to cultivate a new public persona. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" characterized Depp in the 1990s as the \"bad boy of Hollywood\"; Depp's chain smoking, recreational drug use and drinking habits were generally documented during this time. According to \"The Guardian\" journalist Hadley Freeman in 2020:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Along with Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, he was part of a holy trinity of grunge heart-throbs. They were the opposite of the \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" boys, or Brad Pitt and DiCaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. ...This uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic\u2014they had bands!\u2014and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls.\nSimilarly, film scholar Anne Everett has described Depp's 1990s films and public persona as \"anti-macho\" and \"gender-bending\", going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man. After \"21 Jump Street\", Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as \"Edward Scissorhands\". Critics often described Depp's characters as \"iconic loners\" or \"gentle outsiders\". According to Depp, his onetime agent, Tracey Jacobs of United Talent Agency (UTA), had to take \"a lot of heat over the years\" for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking, \"Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a man for a change? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster?\". According to Everett, his \"rule-breaking\" roles matched with the \"much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp's own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters\". Indian actor Dino Morea hailed Depp as a creative muse, crediting the iconic actor's fearless character portrayals as a guiding influence on his own artistic journey. He also stated that Depp's fearless commitment to complex characters encouraged him to explore bolder, more challenging roles in his own career.\nAfter a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Walt Disney Studios' \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise. The five films in the series have earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the \"Pirates\" franchise, Depp also made four further films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depp's career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of 2021). In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars, and was listed by the \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75\u00a0million in a year.\nAccording to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp's collaboration with Disney \"can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is, finally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero\". In 2003, the same year as the first film in the \"Pirates\" series was released, Depp was named \"World's Sexiest Man\" by \"People\"; he would receive the title again in 2009. During the decade and into the 2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world and was named by public vote as \"Favorite Male Movie Star\" at the People's Choice Awards every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became the highest-paid actor in the American film industry, earning as high as $75 million per film, and as of 2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide. Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics' views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal. Regardless, Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when he starred as John Dillinger in \"Public Enemies\" (2009).\nIn the 2010s, Depp's films were less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as \"Dark Shadows\" (2012), \"The Lone Ranger\" (2013), and \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" (2016) underperforming at the box office. Depp also received negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US$650 million fortune. After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of \"The Sun\", Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.' \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise. Many publications alleged that Depp would struggle to find further work in major studio productions in the future.\nPersonal life.\nDepp owns a property in West Hollywood and currently lives in London. By February 2023, he had not yet bought a property there, instead choosing to either stay at hotels or at friends' houses.\nRelationships.\nDepp married Lori Anne Allison on December 24, 1983, in Miami-Dade County, Florida. She was the sister of his rock band's bassist. The couple moved to Los Angeles County, California to pursue careers in music; Depp found some success with his group \"The Kids\", opening for the Ramones and Iggy Pop, but Allison's career as a record producer was halted after she became deaf in one ear, prompting her to pursue a career as a makeup artist for film and television. Through her connections, Allison was able to introduce Depp to Nicolas Cage. Cage was impressed by Depp and arranged for him to audition for \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", which became his first film credit. After two years of marriage, their divorce finalized on March 7, 1986. Depp and Allison remained friendly over the years, with her still using Depp as her professional surname and voicing sympathy for him during his defamation trial against his second wife Amber Heard.\nIn the late 1980s, he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn. In 1990, he proposed to his \"Edward Scissorhands\" co-star Winona Ryder, whom he had begun dating the year prior.&lt;ref name=\"https://people.com/movies/johnny-depp-dating-history/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They ended their relationship in 1993; Depp later had the \"Winona Forever\" tattoo on his right arm changed to \"Wino Forever\". Between 1994 and 1998, he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss. Following his breakup with Moss, Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, whom he met while filming \"The Ninth Gate\" in France in 1998. They have two children, daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999) and a son, Jack (born 2002). Depp stated that having children has given him a \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything\u00a0...You cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked.\" In June 2012, Depp and Paradis announced their separation.\nFollowing the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis, Depp began dating actress Amber Heard, with whom he had co-starred in \"The Rum Diary\" (2011). Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony on February 3, 2015. Heard filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, alleging in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Depp denied these claims and alleged that she was \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution\". A settlement was reached in August 2016, and the divorce was finalized in January 2017. Heard dismissed the restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their \"relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm\". Depp paid Heard a divorce settlement of US$7\u00a0million, which she pledged to donate to the ACLU and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).\nLegal issues and allegations.\nHeard related litigations.\n \"Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\" \nIn 2018, Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the UK against News Group Newspapers (NGN), publishers of \"The Sun\", over an April 2018 article titled \"GONE POTTY How Can J K Rowling be \"genuinely happy\" casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\". The case had a highly publicized trial in July 2020, with both Depp and Heard testifying for several days. Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, said that Heard had \"blatantly lied\" in her evidence while NGN's lawyer, Sasha Wass, said that \"all the evidence in [the] case and all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence\" leave \"no doubt that Mr. Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife\".\nIn November 2020, the High Court of Justice ruled that 12 of the 14 incidents of physical violence alleged by NGN occurred and that in three of them, Depp had put Heard \"in fear of her life\". The court rejected Depp's claim of a hoax as well as his characterization of Heard as a \"gold-digger\". On the other hand, the court found that the characterization of Depp as a \"wife beater\" by \"The Sun\" was \"substantially true\". Following the verdict, Depp resigned from the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise after being asked to do so by its production company, Warner Bros.\nDepp appealed the verdict, with his lawyers accusing Heard of not following through on a pledge to donate her divorce settlement to charity, contrary to her testimony. Depp's lawyers also asserted that Heard's donation testimony had significantly influenced the judge's view of Heard. In response, Heard's legal team stated that she had not yet finished paying her pledged donation due to the financial burden of the lawsuits against her by Depp and that Depp was using this to \"divert attention from the UK Court's findings relating to allegations of Mr. Depp committing domestic abuse and violence\". Depp's appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in March 2021, with the Court concluding:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We do not accept that there is any ground for believing that the judge may have been influenced by any such general perception as [Depp's lawyer] relies on. In the first place, he does not refer to [Heard's] charitable donation at all in the context of his central findings. On the contrary, he only mentions it in a very particular context... and after he had already reached his conclusions in relation to the 14 incidents... It is clear from a reading of the judgment as a whole that the judge based his conclusions on each of the incidents on his extremely detailed review of the evidence specific to each incident. ... In an approach of that kind there was little need or room for the judge to give weight to any general assessment of Ms. Heard's credibility... we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success.\n \"Depp v. Heard\" \nIn February 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for \"The Washington Post\". The lawsuit ultimately resulted in Depp alleging that the op-ed contained three defamatory statements: first, its headline, \"Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence \u2014 and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change\"; second, Heard's writing: \"Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out\"; and third, Heard's writing: \"I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.\" Depp alleged that he had been the one who was abused by Heard, that her allegations constituted a hoax against him, and that as a consequence, Disney had declined to cast him in future projects.\nHeard countersued Depp in August 2020, alleging that he had coordinated \"a harassment campaign via Twitter and [by] orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from \"Aquaman\" and L'Oreal\". Ultimately, Heard's counter-suit went to trial over three allegations that Depp had defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer, Adam Waldman, published in the \"Daily Mail\" in April 2020: first, Waldman stated that \"Heard and her friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield\", publicizing a \"sexual violence hoax\" against Depp; second, Waldman stated that in one incident at a penthouse, \"Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911\" as a \"hoax\" against Depp; third, Waldman stated that there had been an \"abuse hoax\" by Heard against Depp.\nIn October 2020, the judge in the case dismissed Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman after he leaked confidential information covered by a protective order to the media. Following the verdict in Depp's lawsuit against \"The Sun\" the next month, Heard's lawyers filed to have the defamation suit dismissed, but Judge Penny Azcarate ruled against it because Heard had not been a party in the UK case. In August 2021, a New York judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents related to Heard's charity pledge to the organization.\nThe Depp v. Heard trial took place in Fairfax County, Virginia from April 11 to June 1, 2022. During the trial, Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse, stating that Depp \"plunged into the depths of paranoia and violence after binging on drugs and alcohol\" during their relationship. On the other hand, Depp accused Heard of several instances of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship.\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury returned a verdict after 13 hours of deliberation. In their verdict, the jury found that all three statements from Heard's op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and were made with actual malice. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, although the punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by a Virginia state law. For Heard's countersuit, the jury found that Waldman's first and third statements to the \"Daily Mail\" were not defamatory, but that Waldman's second statement to the \"Daily Mail\" was false, defamatory, and made with actual malice. As a result, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp.\nDepp reacted to the result of the trial by declaring that the \"jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled.\" Depp also stated that he was \"overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world\". He continued: \"I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up.\" Depp also highlighted \"the noble work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point\", and praised his \"diligent and unwavering legal team\" for \"an extraordinary job\".\nAfter they filed to appeal the verdict, Heard and Depp settled the case in December 2022, with Heard maintaining that the settlement was \"not an act of concession\"; meanwhile Depp's lawyers stated that the \"jury's unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp's favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place\", and that the settlement would result in $1 million being paid to Depp, which \"Depp is pledging and will donate to charities\".\nSpeaking about the lawsuit in 2025, Depp told \"The Sunday Times\" that \"it had gone far enough. I knew I'd have to semi-eviscerate myself. Everyone was saying, 'It'll go away!' But I can't trust that. What will go away? The fiction pawned around the fucking globe? No it won't. If I don't try to represent the truth it will be like I've actually committed the acts I am accused of. And my kids will have to live with it. Their kids. Kids that I've met in hospitals. So the night before the trial in Virginia I didn't feel nervous. If you don't have to memorize lines, if you're just speaking the truth? Roll the dice.\"\nOther legal issues and allegations.\nDepp was arrested in Vancouver in 1989 for assaulting a security guard after the police were called to end a loud party at his hotel room.\nDepp was also arrested in New York City in 1994 after causing significant damage to his room at The Mark Hotel, where he was staying with Kate Moss, his girlfriend. The charges were dropped against him after he agreed to pay US$9,767 in damages.\nDepp was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazi, when the photographers tried to take his picture. He allegedly threatened them with a wooden plank when they approached him outside Mirabelle restaurant in central London on an early Sunday morning.\nIn 2012, UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp and three security firms, Premier Group International, Damian Executive Production Inc. and Staff Pro Inc., claiming to have been roughed up by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011. During the incident, she was allegedly hand-cuffed and dragged 40 feet across the floor, resulting in injuries including a dislocated elbow. Depp's attorneys contended that Eckert provoked the alleged assault and therefore \"consented to any assault and battery\". Eckert's court papers stated that Depp, despite being his security guards' direct manager, did nothing to stop the attack. Before the case went to trial, Depp settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum, according to TMZ.\nIn April 2015, Depp and his then-wife Amber Heard breached Australia's biosecurity laws when they failed to declare their two dogs to the customs when they flew to Queensland, where he was working on a film. Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation. She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document; Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws. \"The Guardian\" called the case the \"highest profile criminal quarantine case\" in Australian history.\nIn March 2016, Depp cut ties with his management company, The Management Group (TMG), and sued them in January 2017 for alleged embezzlement and for allegedly improperly managing his money and leaving him over $40 million in debt. TMG stated that Depp was responsible for his own fiscal mismanagement and countersued him for unpaid fees. In a related suit, Depp also sued his lawyers, Bloom Hergott, in January 2017. Both lawsuits were settled, the former in 2018 and the latter in 2019.\nIn 2018, two of Depp's former bodyguards sued him for unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions. Among other complaints, the two bodyguards claimed in their suit that they were required to perform tasks that were beyond the scope of their capacity as bodyguards, including being asked to repeatedly drive vehicles that \"contained illegal substances, open containers and minors\". Despite this and despite being exposed to other unsafe working conditions while putting in 12-hour work shifts on the job without rest or meal breaks, the bodyguards added, they were neither paid overtime nor otherwise fairly or lawfully compensated. The suit was settled in 2019.\nAlso in 2018, Depp was sued for allegedly hitting and verbally insulting a crew member while under the influence of alcohol on the set of \"City of Lies\". A lawyer for Depp told the media that \"Depp never touched the [crew member], as over a dozen witnesses present will attest\"; meanwhile, Depp's legal team entered a court filing that did not admit that Depp hit the crew member, but stated that the crew member \"provoked\" the incident with \"unlawful and wrongful conduct\", causing Depp and film director Brad Furman to fear for their safety. A film script supervisor submitted a court declaration that Depp did not hit the crew member, and only scolded him. Before the lawsuit went to trial, a tentative settlement regarding the dismissal of the lawsuit was reached between Depp and the crew member in July 2022.\nIn August 2022, Depp and Jeff Beck were accused of stealing an incarcerated African American man's poem by incorporating its verses into the lyrics to their song \"Sad Motherfuckin' Parade\" in their 2022 collaborative album, \"18\". Bruce Jackson, the folklorist who made the accusation, requested that Depp and Beck give due credit to Slim Wilson, the actual originator of the lyrics, for the song. He also requested that if any profits are made from the album, the two should donate them to an organization that aids African Americans. In response, Depp and Beck sued Jackson, claiming that \"Sad Motherfuckin' Parade\" is an \"original work of authorship and creativity\" and that Jackson's accusation amounts to a cash grab. Jackson responded by noting that he had never made any \"formal financial demands\" and, while maintaining that Depp and Beck never wrote the lyrics to that song, said that them suing the person who caught them stealing the lyrics is akin to \"a burglar suing a homeowner because he cut his hand on the kitchen window he broke getting in\". This lawsuit is still ongoing.\nAlcohol and drug use.\nDepp has struggled with substance abuse for much of his life. He has stated that he began using drugs by taking his mother's \"nerve pills\" at the age of 11, was smoking at age 12 and by the age of 14 had used \"every kind of drugs there were\". In a 1997 interview, Depp acknowledged past abuse of alcohol during the filming of \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\" (1993). In a 2008 interview, Depp stated that he had \"poisoned\" himself with alcohol \"for years\". In 2013, Depp declared that he had stopped drinking alcohol, adding that he \"pretty much got everything [he] could get out of it\"; Depp also said, \"I investigated wine and spirits thoroughly, and they certainly investigated me as well, and we found out that we got along beautifully, but maybe too well.\" Regarding his breakup with longtime partner Vanessa Paradis, Depp said that he \"definitely wasn't going to rely on the drink to ease things or cushion the blow or cushion the situation ...[because] that could have been fatal\". In a 2018 \"Rolling Stone\" profile of Depp, reporter Stephen Rodrick wrote that he had used hashish in his presence and described him as \"alternately hilarious, sly and incoherent\"; Depp also said that the allegation made by his former business managers that he had spent US$30,000 per month on wine was \"insulting\" because he had spent \"far more\" than that amount. During his 2020 libel trial, Depp admitted to having been addicted to Roxicodone and to having misused alcohol. He also admitted to using other substances such as marijuana, MDMA and cocaine but denied ever having been addicted to any of them.\nPolitical views.\nIn November 2016, Depp joined the campaign Imprisoned for Art to call for the release of Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was being held in custody in Russia.\nAt the Glastonbury Festival 2017, Depp, criticizing President Donald Trump, asked: \"When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify: I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it's been a while and maybe it's time. I'm not insinuating anything.\" The comment was interpreted as a reference to John Wilkes Booth, the actor who assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Shawn Holtzclaw of the Secret Service told CNN they were aware of Depp's comment, but that \"for security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities\". Depp apologized shortly afterward, saying the remark \"did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice\".\nActing credits and awards.\nAccording to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, Depp's most critically and commercially successful films include \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990), \"Arizona Dream\" (1993), \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" (1993), \"Ed Wood\" (1994), \"Donnie Brasco\" (1997), \"Sleepy Hollow\" (1999), \"Chocolat\" (2000), ' (2003), \"Finding Neverland\" (2004), \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), ' (2007), \"Public Enemies\" (2009), \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), \"Black Mass\" (2015) and \"Minamata\" (2020).

He is among the best known Quebec writers in English Canada.\nLife.\nHe was born in Sainte-Justine, Quebec, and studied at Coll\u00e8ge St-Louis in New Brunswick, the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in Quebec, and at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France, where he received a doctorate in literature.\nFrom 1994 to 1997, he served as head of the Canada Council. In 1998, he ran as an electoral candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party under Jean Charest, in the riding of Cr\u00e9mazie. He was defeated by 309 votes.\nIn 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. From 1999 to 2004, Carrier was National Librarian of Canada. With Ian E. Wilson, the then National Archivist, he developed the process to unify the National Archive and National Library.\nIn 1992, Carrier's \"Prayers of a Very Wise Child\" (\"Pri\u00e8res d'un enfant tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s sage\") won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.\nCarrier championed Jacques Poulin's novel \"Volkswagen Blues\" in \"Canada Reads 2005\".\nAlso involved in theatre (having served as playwright at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nouveau Monde), Carrier has adapted \"La guerre, yes sir!\" and \"Floralie, o\u00f9 es-tu?\" for the stage. \"La guerre, yes sir!\" was produced as a play in 1970, was performed in English at the Stratford festival, and has been made into a film. \"Floralie, o\u00f9 es-tu?\" was performed by Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nouveau-Monde in 1974. The trilogy consisting of these two novels and \"Il est par l\u00e0, le soleil\" sold better in English than in French.\nA quote from \"Le chandail de hockey\" (\"The Hockey Sweater\"), one of Carrier's \"contes\", was reprinted on the back of the Canadian five-dollar bill. The story, about when Carrier was a young boy who orders a Montreal Canadiens sweater from the Eaton's catalogue, but receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey instead, is considered by many to be a literary allegory for the linguistic and cultural tensions between English and French Canadians, and is thus considered essential reading for anybody who seeks to understand the complex realities of linguistic and cultural identity in Canada. But it is also a much-beloved children's story in anglophone Canada without such complex overtones as it may have in a broader context. The National Film Board of Canada has made this story into an animated short film, narrated by Carrier in both the French and English versions.\n\"Heartbreaks Along The Road\" (\"De l'amour dans la ferraille\") is a work of magical realism - he pokes fun at political and religious figures, using ridiculous scenarios, and exaggerated personality characteristics, while telling the story from different characters' points of view. There are many levels to his satire and his writing is flowery and descriptive.\nSheila Fischman has won various awards for translation of his books into English.\nTwo schools are named after Roch Carrier: Roch Carrier French Immersion Public School in Woodstock, Ontario, and Roch Carrier Elementary School in Kanata, Ontario.\nRoch Carrier was president on the board of directors for Experiences Canada (formerly known as the Society for Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada, or SEVEC) from 2008 to 2009. Upon his retirement from the board he was made an Honorary Member."}

Deemed \"obsolete, or have not been updated to adopt current voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, federal data standards, or current good practices for information security\", the NIST replaced FIPS 6-4 with \"INCITS 31 \u2013 2009\" codes for the \"Identification of the States and Equivalent Areas within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas\".\nThe five-digit codes of FIPS 6-4 used the two digit FIPS state code (FIPS Publication 5-2, also withdrawn on September 2, 2008), followed by the three digits of the county code within the state or possession. County FIPS codes in the United States are usually (with a few exceptions) in the same sequence as alphabetized county names within a state. They are usually (but not always) odd numbers, so that new or changed county names can be fit in their alphabetical sequence slot.\nIn response to the NIST decision, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it would replace the FIPS 6-4 codes with the INCITS 31 codes after the 2010 census, with the Census bureau assigning new codes as needed for their internal use during the transition. The Census Bureau decided that, based on decades of using the terminology FIPS to describe its codes, it would continue to use the FIPS name for its updated codes, where FIPS now stood for FIP \"Series\", since there no longer existed an official FIP \"Standard\".\nFIPS county codes are still used by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) to define geographic locations for their SAME-based public alerting systems. In this application, a \"0\" (zero) is added as the first digit and used as a \"placeholder\", making each FIPS code a six-digit sequence.

{"id": "71897", "revid": "42958447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71897", "title": "Marwan Barghouti", "text": "Palestinian politician\nMarwan Barghouti (also transliterated al-Barghuthi; ; born 6 June 1959) is a Palestinian political leader who has served as an elected legislator and has been an advocate of a two-state solution since prior to his imprisonment by Israel. \nBarghouti led street protests and diplomatic initiatives until 2002, the early Second Intifada, when he was captured, convicted, and imprisoned by Israel on charges of involvement in deadly attacks that resulted in the deaths of five people. Barghouti declined to recognise the legitimacy of the court or enter a plea, but stated that he had no connection to the incidents for which he was convicted. An Inter-Parliamentary Union report found that Barghouti was not given a fair trial and questioned the quality of the evidence.\nDespite his imprisonment, Barghouti has consistently topped opinion polls asking Palestinians whom they would vote for in a Presidential election, ahead of both current Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas and leaders of Hamas. Several prominent supporters of a resumption of the Israel-Palestine peace process view Barghouti as the leader most able to unify the Palestinians and negotiate a compromise with Israel. He has been referred to as \"the Palestinian Mandela\".\nDuring his years in prison, Barghouti has continued to be politically active. He was an instigator and lead author of the 2006 Palestinian Prisoners' Document, which proposed a political path to a two-state solution, and secured support from Hamas. He has organised education for fellow inmates, and in 2017 led a hunger strike that led to increased visitation rights. Since October 2023, he has been denied visits from his family and been severely beaten several times, leading to persistent damage to his health, according to his lawyer. Israeli authorities have rejected his complaints over the incidents. Several attempts to secure his release through negotiations have failed.\nEarly life, education and expulsion.\nBarghouti was born in the village of Kobar near Ramallah in the West Bank. Like his distant cousin Mustafa Barghouti, a fellow Palestinian political leader, he belongs to the extended Barghouti family. His younger brother Muqbel described him as \"a naughty and rebellious boy.\"\nIn 1967, when Barghouti was seven years old, Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six-Day War. According to \"The Economist\", Marwan's \"neighbours were beaten up or arrested for flying Palestinian flags. Military bases and Jewish settlements sprang up around their village. Israeli soldiers shot dead the family dog for barking.\"\nBarghouti joined Fatah at age 15, and he was a co-founder of the Fatah Youth Movement (Shabiba) on the West Bank. That year he was first imprisoned by Israel. At 18, he was imprisoned again. He later wrote that during the subsequent interrogation, he was forced to strip naked, spread his legs, and was struck on the genitals so hard that he lost consciousness. He completed his secondary education and received a high school diploma while serving a four-year term in jail, where he became fluent in Hebrew.\nBarghouti enrolled at Birzeit University in 1983, though arrest and exile meant that he did not receive his Bachelor's degree (History and Political Science) until 1994. He earned a Master's degree in International Relations, also from Birzeit, in 1998. As an undergraduate, he was active in student politics on behalf of Fatah and headed the Birzeit Student Council. In 1984, he married Fadwa Ibrahim, a fellow student. Fadwa studied law and was a prominent advocate in her own right on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, before becoming the leading campaigner for her husband's release from his current jail term. Together the couple had four children. Before his eldest son was born, and while still a student leader, Barghouti was jailed for a third time. He missed the birth of his eldest son. In May 1987, Israel expelled him. Initially Barghouti and Fadwa moved to Tunis, and then in April 1988 to Amman.\nFirst Intifada, the Oslo Accords and the aftermath.\nFrom exile, during the First Intifada, Barghouti continued to maintain contacts among activists in the West Bank. He simultaneously built relationships with the older generation of Fatah activists, who had waged their struggle from exile for more than three decades. He was elected to Fatah's Revolutionary Council, the movement's internal parliament, in 1989. When he was allowed to return to Palestine in April 1994 as a result of the Oslo Accords, Barghouti found that he was able to bridge the divide between the two groups.\nAlthough he was a strong supporter of the peace process, he doubted that Israel was committed to it. In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council for the district of Ramallah. Barghouti campaigned against corruption in Arafat's administration and human rights violations by its security services. He participated in diplomacy and built relationships with a number of Israeli politicians, and with leaders of Israel's peace movement. A series of peace conferences in the wake of the Oslo accords featured \"heated discussions.\" When Meir Shitreet fell ill during a peace conference in Italy, Shitreet said that Barghouti sat at his bedside through the night. In 1998 he attended a meeting with members of the Israeli Knesset, referring to those present as friends, and called to \"strengthen this peace process.\" Haim Oron, a former Israeli cabinet minister, recalled that \"he spoke about the right of the Palestinians, and when I spoke about the right of Jews, he understood\". His assistant has claimed that Barghouti never refused to meet any Israeli.\nBy the late 1990s, Palestinians had become frustrated with the lack of progress toward an independent state that they felt had been promised by the Oslo accords, and by the privations of life under occupation. There were frequent demonstrations by civil society and political groups. According to Diana Buttu, \"Marwan was somebody who was present at each and every protest for weeks and weeks and weeks on end. It became very clear that we were just never going to see freedom.\" Barghouti met with the central committees of almost every Israeli party, the journalist Gideon Levy has claimed, to warn them that, with an impasse in the peace process, the situation was tending toward violence. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was Secretary-General of Fatah in the West Bank. By the summer of 2000, particularly after the Camp David summit failed, Barghouti was disillusioned and said that popular protests and \"new forms of military struggle\" would be features of the \"next Intifada.\"\nSecond Intifada.\nOutbreak of Second Intifada and political leadership.\nIn September 2000, the Second Intifada began. Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of demonstrations, as a spokesperson for Palestinian interests, and as leader of the Tanzim, a grouping of younger activists within Fatah who had taken up arms. Barghouti described himself as \"a politician, not a military man.\" Barghouti led marches to Israeli checkpoints, where riots broke out against Israeli soldiers and spurred on Palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations, advocating the use of force to expel Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He has stated that, \"I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom\" and has said, \"I still seek peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine based on full withdrawal from Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.\"\nAs the Palestinian death toll in the Second Intifada mounted, Barghouti called for Palestinians to target Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza, but not within Israel. Others, such as leaders of Hamas, openly backed attacks on civilians within Israel.\nIsrael has accused Barghouti of having co-founded and lead the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades during this period, which he has denied. Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2001. That August, Israeli forces fired two missiles from an illegal West Bank settlement at a convoy of cars in Ramallah and injured Barghouti's bodyguard. At the time, Israeli security sources claimed that they had intended to kill another Fatah operative. The then-head of Shin Bet subsequently claimed to have made two attempts to assassinate Barghouti. Barghouti went into hiding.\nIsraeli arrest, interrogation and trial.\nBarghouti was captured on 15 April 2002 by Israeli soldiers, who had disguised their journey to his location by hiding in an ambulance. He was transferred to the Moscovia Detention Centre. On 18 April, Barghouti was reported to have declined to cooperate with his interrogators, and allowed to communicate freely with his lawyer. He was then denied the right to see his lawyer for the next month, except for an occasion on which they were not allowed to discuss the investigation. The next time he was able to talk freely with his lawyer, Barghouti described having been subject to severe sleep deprivation and insufficient food. He described the torture, in the form of the \"shabeh\" method, in a later book, \"1000 Days In Solitary Jail\". He said that he was forced to sit on a chair with nails protruding into his back for hours at a time. Simon Foreman, the lawyer commissioned by the Inter-Parliamentary Union to report on the trial, has said \"the witnesses whose statements were used to accuse [Barghouti], many of them made the same kind of statements and those allegations were disregarded, openly disregarded by the courts.\" Barghouti has also stated that the interrogators threatened to kill him and his eldest son. He has written that during his pre-trial detention, in addition to Moscovia, he was held for periods at Camp 1391 and the Petah Tikva prison.\nCharges, verdict and sentences.\nIsrael filed its indictment on 14 August and Barghouti's trial commenced on 5 September. Barghouti was charged with 26 charges of murder and attempted murder stemming from attacks carried out by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades on Israeli civilians and soldiers. Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. He stressed that he supported armed resistance to the Israeli occupation, but condemned attacks on civilians inside Israel. According to the case argued by Israel at his trial, he had supported and authorized such attacks. On 20 May 2004, he was convicted of five counts of murder: authorizing and organizing the murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis (a.k.a. Father Germanos, a Greek Orthodox monk-priest), a shooting adjacent to Giv'at Ze'ev in which a civilian was killed, and the Seafood Market attack in Tel Aviv in which three civilians were killed. In addition, he was convicted of attempted murder for a failed car bomb attack near Malha Mall that exploded prematurely, resulting in the deaths of two suicide bombers, and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. He was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 other attacks as no proof was brought to link Barghouti directly with the specific decisions of the local leadership of the Tanzim to carry out these particular attacks. Following the verdict, Barghouti shouted in Hebrew, \"This is a court of occupation that I do not recognize. A day will come when you will be ashamed of these accusations. I have no more connection to these charges than you, the judges, do.\" On 6 June 2004, he was sentenced to the maximum possible punishment for his convictions: five cumulative life sentences for the murders and an additional 40 years, consisting of 20 years each for attempted murder and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. The Israeli verdict against him in effect removed Arafat's only political rival.\nCriticism of trial.\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union found that the \"numerous breaches of international law\" to which Barghouti was subjected \"make it impossible to conclude that Mr. Barghouti was given a fair trial.\" The criticisms raised by Simon Foreman, the report's author, included the court's failure to consider the public allegations of torture; its authorisation of incommunicado detention; prejudicial statements by the presiding judge; the transportation of Barghouti to Israel contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention; and the poor evidence for guilt. Foreman wrote, \"According to the prosecution, only 21 of the prosecution witnesses were actually in a position to testify directly regarding Mr. Barghouti's role in these attacks. But none of these 21 individuals in fact accused him. About 12 of them explicitly told the court that he was not involved.\" Concerning \"material\" evidence, Barghouti's lawyer told Foreman that \"no document originated by Mr. Barghouti had implicated him in the acts of which he was being accused.\"\nCampaign for release and prisoner-swap negotiations.\nFadwa began campaigning for her husband\u2019s release the day he was arrested. The International Campaign to Free Marwan Barghouti and All Palestinian Prisoners was launched in 2013 from Nelson Mandela's former cell on Robben Island. The campaign was launched by Fadwa and Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Mandela at the Rivonia Trial. Barghouti has often drawn comparisons to Mandela from commentators inclined toward a resumption of the peace process. For example, Reuters reported that some see Barghouti \"as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, the man who could galvanize a drifting and divided national movement if only he were set free by Israel.\" Many of his supporters have campaigned for his release. They include prominent Palestinian figures, members of European Parliament and the Israeli group Gush Shalom. According to \"The Jerusalem Post\", \"[u]nlike many in the Western media, Palestinian journalists have rarely referred to Barghouti in these terms. \nIn August 2023, Barghouti's wife Fadwa held meetings with senior officials and diplomats across the world, including Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, to advocate for her husband's release and position him as a successor to Abbas. According to Al-Sharq al-Awsat, Barghouti would run in Palestinian presidential elections and maintained a polling lead over all other candidates.\nThe Israeli debate on whether to free Barghouti.\nIn 2008, 45% of Israelis supported the release of Barghouti, while 51% were opposed. Another approach is to suggest that Israel's freeing of Barghouti would be an excellent show of good faith in the peace process. Some prominent Israelis have called for Barghouti's release, citing his unique ability to unite Palestinians. These include Ami Ayalon, Efraim Halevy, Meir Shitreet, and both Yossi Beilin and Haim Oron, two former ministers on the left of Israeli politics.[6] Several IDF officers involved in Barghouti's 2002 capture have taken a similar view.\nEvery Israeli administration since Barghouti's imprisonment has declined to release him. Ayalon claimed in 2024 that \"You will not find anybody in our current political community that has any interest in releasing Marwan Barghouti.\" Figures who have spoken in opposition to his release include former Defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon, Avi Dichter, and former Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, who called Barghouti \"an assassin who has blood on his hands.\"\nThis view gained popularity among the Israeli left after the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip. Still others, operating from a realpolitik perspective, have pointed out that allowing Barghouti to re-enter Palestinian politics could serve to bolster Fatah against gains in Hamas' popularity.\nIn January 2007, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres declared that he would pardon Barghouti if elected president. Peres was elected, but issued no pardon.\nHistory of negotiations concerning Barghouti's release.\nIn 2004, Israel's ambassador to Washington Danny Ayalon proposed, with the \"tacit agreement\" of Ariel Sharon, that Israel would free Barghouti in exchange for the Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, who was imprisoned by the United States. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rejected the request. In 2006, there were conflicting claims concerning proposals for Barghouti's release. A Saudi newspaper reported that Condoleezza Rice had proposed such a step to Israel, with no mention of a quid pro quo, but Ehud Olmert denied that the idea had been raised in talks with the United States. He reportedly continued to oppose Barghouti's release in 2007.\nHamas sought the inclusion of Barghouti in the 2011 prisoner exchange deal that led to the release of Gilad Shalit, but Israel refused to include him.\nDuring the prisoner swap negotiations in 2024 and 2025 that arose from the Gaza War, Hamas said that Barghouti was at the top of their list of prisoners whom they wanted Israel to free. Israel again refused. \"The Economist\" reported that Mahmoud Abbas, who was expected to face a political challenge from Barghouti on the latter's release, \"urged Qatari mediators to remove Barghouti's name from the list of prisoner exchanges.\" In January 2025, an Israeli government official denied reports that Barghouti was set to be released and exiled to Turkey.\nPolitical activity in prison.\n2005 and 2006 Palestinian elections and disputes with Fatah.\nYasser Arafat died in November 2004, and the Palestinian Authority called a presidential election for January 2005. Barghouti announced from his isolation cell that he would contest the election, challenging interim-President Mahmoud Abbas, a long-time Fatah administrator of Arafat's generation. Fadwa registered her husband's candidacy as an independent on 1 December.\nThe Israeli government came to know that two of Barghouti's closest confidantes \u2013 Fadwa and advisor Qadura Fares \u2013 privately opposed Barghouti's decision to stand, and decided to allow the two to meet with Barghouti to press their case, breaking two years in which he had been denied such contact. His candidacy was also criticised by Fatah leaders as a threat to the movement's unity. His campaign manager announced Barghouti's decision to withdraw from the race on 12 December. In a letter read at the announcement, Barghouti accused Fatah's leadership of having grown \"old, weak and alienated\" from the rank and file. In 2016, Fares said that he believed his advice had been a mistake.\nAbbas won the election, and there has been no Palestinian presidential election since.\nIn 2006 Israeli media reported that MK Haim Oron had met with Barghouti in prison dozens of times, and had carried messages back and forth between Barghouti and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni also met directly with Barghouti.\nSplit from Fatah.\nOn 14 December 2005, Barghouti announced that he had formed a new political party, al-Mustaqbal (\"The Future\"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's \"Young Guard\", who repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The list, which was presented to the Palestinian Authority's central elections committee on that day, included Mohammed Dahlan, Qadura Fares, Samir Mashharawi and Jibril Rajoub.\nThe split followed Barghouti's earlier refusal of Mahmoud Abbas' offer to be second on the Fatah party's parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. Barghouti had actually topped the list, but this had not become apparent until after the new party had been registered.\nReactions to the news were split. Some suggested that the move was a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti's new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti's supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who do not agree with Hamas' political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers also hypothesized that the formation of al-Mustaqbal was mostly a negotiating tactic to get members of the Young Guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list.\nBarghouti eventually was convinced that the idea of leading a new party, especially one that was created by splitting from Fatah, would be unrealistic while he was still in prison. Instead he stood as a Fatah candidate in the January 2006 PLC elections, comfortably regaining his seat in the Palestinian Parliament.\nPrisoners' Document and other activism.\nOn 11 May 2006, Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons released the National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners. The document was a proposal initiated by Marwan Barghouti and leaders of Hamas, the PFLP, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the DFLP that proposed a basis upon which a coalition government should be formed in the Palestinian Legislative Council. This came as a result of the political stalemate in the Palestinian territories that followed Hamas' election to the PLC in January 2006. Crucially, the document also called for negotiation with the state of Israel in order to achieve lasting peace. The document quickly gained popular currency and is now considered the bedrock upon which a national unity government should be achieved. According to Haaretz, Barghouti, although not officially represented in the negotiations of a Palestinian unity government in February 2007, played a major role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah and formulating the compromise reached on 8 February 2007. In 2009, he was elected to party leadership at the Fatah Conference in Bethlehem.\nIn March 2010, Barghouti completed a doctorate in political science. He had been accepted by Cairo University and the Arab Academy for Research and Studies in 1999, prior to his arrest in 2002. His doctoral thesis was titled \u201cThe Legislative and Political Performance of the Palestinian Legislative Council and its Contribution to the Democratic Process in Palestine from 1996 to 2008.\u201d Barghouti was reported to have taught a master\u2019s level course in \"Israel Studies\" to hundreds of fellow Palestinian prisoners while incarcerated. One former inmate, Abu Muhsin, said he had studied under Barghouti during his 23-year sentence, ultimately earning a bachelor's degree in political science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a master's degree from Al-Quds University. Barghouti\u2019s attainment of a doctorate in 2010 enabled him to teach university-level courses in prison. Barghouti had organised a programme to provide education to his fellow prisoners. In a 2014 interview he stated:I teach and lecture on a variety of topics in various disciplines, including at the university level... There are dozens of prisoners who never had the chance to be educated at the secondary or university level and who want to pursue their education. I have been in charge of teaching them and we\u2019ve achieved good results in both foreign language instruction and university syllabuses with the help of some of my fellow detainees.\nBarghouti declined to testify before an Israeli court in January 2012, but used the opportunity of his appearance to say that \"an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the establishment of a Palestinian state will bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\" according to Haaretz's Avi Issacharoff. That March, in a letter from prison, Barghouti called for a new wave of civil resistance against the occupation, and for the Palestinian Authority to end all coordination with Israel. He wrote \"Large-scale popular resistance at this stage serves the cause of our people.\" Barghouti has frequently been punished for releasing statements through internment in solitary confinement.\nIn November 2014, months after more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed by Israel in the 2014 Gaza War, Barghouti urged the Palestinian Authority to end security cooperation with Israel and called for a Third Intifada against Israel. In 2016, a plan for confronting the occupation, purportedly authored by Barghouti and smuggled from prison, was presented by an ally. The plans hinged on \"mass disobedience\" and demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people according to the Economist's \"1843\" Magazine. Barghouti expected that Israel would kill some of the demonstrators.\n2017 hunger strike and prison education programme.\nIn April 2017 he organized a hunger strike of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails. In an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", Barghouti said that the hunger strikers sought to end the \"torture, inhumane and degrading treatment, and medical negligence\" to which prisoners were subject. A list of demands issued by the strikers included access to telephones to communicate with their families, increased visitation rights, and a series of steps to address medical negligence. They also included access to books and newspapers and an end to the practices of solitary confinement and administrative detention.\nOn 7 May, the Israel Prison Service released videos allegedly showing Barghouti hiding in the toilet stall of his cell while eating cookies and candy, then trying to flush the wrappers. The videos were recorded on 27 April and on 5 May, a period during which almost 1,000 of Barghouti's fellow prisoners were refusing all food. Anonymous sources in the prison service confirmed the authenticity of the videos, saying that the food was made available to Barghouti to test his adherence to the hunger strike. Barghouti's attorney refused to respond to the videos, while his wife claimed that they had been \"fabricated\" to discredit him. Israeli media reported that this was not Barghouti's first time being caught secretly breaking a hunger strike, and that in 2004 he had been photographed hiding a plate after eating off it in his cell. According to Haaretz's Amos Harel, among Palestinians, the episode \"only strengthened his image as a leader who is feared by Israel \u2013 which resorts to ugly tricks in order to trip him up,\". The hunger strike ended after Israel conceded a second family visit for each prisoner per month.\nSubsequent activism and continued popularity.\nBarghouti intended to contest the Palestinian Presidential elections slated for 2021, but they were cancelled by President Abbas, citing Israel's refusal to permit voting in East Jerusalem. Immediately prior to the cancelation, a poll suggested that Barghouti would go on to win the Presidency, with more than double Abbas's support, and significantly more than that of Ismail Haniyeh. Barghouti remains the most popular Palestinian leader. In each of the six polls conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research between September 2023 and May 2025, Barghouti came out ahead of a Hamas candidate when Palestinians were asked who they would vote for as President in a two-way race. There has been no Palestinian Presidential election since 2005 and postponed indefinitely.\nConditions of imprisonment and alleged mistreatment.\nBarghouti was held in solitary confinement for three years following his 2002 detention and has frequently been returned to solitary confinement since. Since 7 October 2023, Barghouti has been interred in solitary confinement. Shortly after that date, the governor of Ofer Prison ordered Barghouti to kneel before the governor, according to his son, Arab Barghouti. Arab described the order as an attempt to humiliate Barghouti, and by extension the watching prisoners, who saw Barghouti as a leader. Arab added that when his father refused to comply he was forced to his knees by prison guards, dislocating his shoulder.\nIn December 2023, his lawyer claimed, Barghouti was beaten on several occasions, and on one occasion \"dragged on the floor naked in front of other prisoners.\" In March 2024, Barghouti told his lawyers that he was dragged to an area of Megiddo prison without security cameras and assaulted with batons by prison guards. The Guardian reported, \"He recalled bleeding from the nose as he was dragged across the floor by his handcuffs, before he was beaten unconscious.\" According to his family, speaking in February 2024, Barghouti was held in the dark, with loud music playing into his cell for days at a time. In May 2024, The Guardian reported that Barghouti \"spends his days huddled in a cramped, dark, solitary cell, with no way to tend to his wounds, and a shoulder injury from being dragged with his hands cuffed behind his back,\". The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel said that Barghouti had been subjected to treatment amounting to torture, which they said had \"become standard across all detention facilities since 7 October.\"\nIsraeli prison authorities were accused of \"brutally assaulting\" Barghouti in September 2024. The Israeli prison service said in October 2024 that they had rejected two complaints of mistreatment by Barghouti over the past year on the grounds that there had been no violation of the law.\nPersonal life.\nOn 21 October 1984, Barghouti married Fadwa Barghouti. They have four children: Qassam, Ruba, Sharaf and Arab, along with six grandchildren (as of 2024). In a 2025 interview with Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart on their podcast, \"Leading\", Arab Barghouti revealed that his father was a fan of Real Madrid CF.\nHis daughter-in-law, Nadeen Ayoub, who married his son Sharaf in 2016, participated in the 2025 Miss Universe contest as Miss Palestine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71899", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71899", "title": "Lincoln Cathedral", "text": "Lincoln Cathedral, also called Lincoln Minster, and formally the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, is a Church of England cathedral in Lincoln, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Lincoln and is the mother church of the diocese of Lincoln. The cathedral is governed by its dean and chapter, and is a grade I listed building.\nThe earliest parts of the current building date to 1072, when bishop Remigius de F\u00e9camp moved his seat from Dorchester on Thames to Lincoln. The building was completed in 1092, but severely damaged in an earthquake in 1185. It was rebuilt over the following centuries in different phases of the Gothic style, with significant surviving parts of the cathedral in Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular.\nThe cathedral holds one of the four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta, which is now displayed in Lincoln Castle. It is the fourth largest cathedral in the UK by floor area, at approximately , after Liverpool Cathedral, St Paul's Cathedral, and York Minster. It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: \"I have always held\u00a0... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.\"\nHistory.\nThe first Bishop of Lincoln Remigius de F\u00e9camp moved the episcopal seat (\"cathedra\") there \"some time between 1072 and 1092\". About this, James Essex writes that \"Remigius\u00a0... laid the foundations of his Cathedral in 1072\" and \"it is probable that he, being a Norman, employed Norman masons to superintend the building\u00a0... though he could not complete the whole before his death.\"\nBefore that, writes B. Winkles, \"It is well known that Remigius appropriated the parish church of St Mary Magdalene in Lincoln, although it is not known what use he made of it.\"\nWhen Lincoln Cathedral was first built, William the Conqueror granted the parish of Welton to Remigius in order to endow six prebends which provided income to support six canons attached to the cathedral. These were subsequently confirmed by William II and Henry I.\nUntil then St Mary's Church in Stow was considered to be the \"mother church\" of Lincolnshire (although it was not a cathedral, because the seat of the diocese was at Dorchester Abbey in Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire). However, Lincoln was more central to a diocese that stretched from the Thames to the Humber.\nRemigius built the first Lincoln Cathedral on the present site, finishing it in 1092 and then dying on 7 May of that year, two days before it was consecrated. In 1124, the timber roofing was destroyed in a fire. Alexander (bishop, 1123\u201348) rebuilt and expanded the cathedral, but it was mostly destroyed by an earthquake about forty years later, in 1185 (dated by the British Geological Survey as occurring 15 April 1185). The earthquake was one of the largest felt in the UK: it has an estimated magnitude of over 5. The damage to the cathedral is thought to have been very extensive: the cathedral is described as having \"split from top to bottom\"; in the current building, only the lower part of the west end and its two attached towers remain of the pre-earthquake cathedral.\nSome (Kidson, 1986; Woo, 1991) have suggested that the damage to Lincoln Cathedral was probably exacerbated by poor construction or design, with the actual collapse most probably caused by a vault failure.\nAfter the earthquake, a new bishop was appointed. He was Hugh de Burgundy of Avalon, France, who became known as St Hugh of Lincoln. He began a massive rebuilding and expansion programme. With his appointment of William de Montibus as master of the cathedral school and chancellor, Lincoln briefly became one of the leading educational centres in England, producing writers such as Samuel Presbiter and Richard of Wetheringsett, though it declined in importance after William's death in 1213. Rebuilding began with the choir (St Hugh's Choir) and the eastern transepts between 1192 and 1210. The central nave was then built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. Lincoln Cathedral soon followed other architectural advances of the time \u2013 pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting were added to the cathedral. This allowed support for incorporating larger windows. \nThere are thirteen bells in the south-west tower, two in the north-west tower, and five in the central tower (including Great Tom). Accompanying the cathedral's large bell, Great Tom of Lincoln, is a quarter-hour striking clock which was installed in the early 19th century. The two large stained glass rose windows, the matching Dean's Eye and the Bishop's Eye were added to the cathedral during the late Middle Ages. The former, the Dean's Eye in the north transept dates from the 1192 rebuild begun by St Hugh, completed in 1235. The latter, the Bishop's Eye, in the south transept was reconstructed a hundred years later in 1330. A contemporary record, \"The Metrical Life of St Hugh\", refers to the meaning of these two windows (one on the dark, north, side and the other on the light, south, side of the building):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For north represents the devil, and south the Holy Spirit and it is in these directions that the two eyes look. The bishop faces the south in order to invite in and the dean the north in order to shun; the one takes care to be saved, the other takes care not to perish. With these Eyes the cathedral's face is on watch for the candelabra of Heaven and the darkness of Lethe (oblivion).\nAfter the additions of the Dean's eye and other major Gothic additions it is believed some mistakes in the support of the tower occurred, for in 1237 the main tower collapsed. A new tower was soon started and in 1255 the cathedral petitioned Henry III to allow them to take down part of the town wall to enlarge and expand the cathedral, including the rebuilding of the central tower and spire. They replaced the small rounded chapels (built at the time of St Hugh) with a larger east end to the cathedral. This was to handle the increasing number of pilgrims to the cathedral, who came to worship at the shrine of Hugh of Lincoln.\nIn 1290 Eleanor of Castile died and King Edward I of England decided to honour her, his Queen Consort, with an elegant funeral procession. After her body had been embalmed, which in the 13th century involved evisceration, Eleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln cathedral and Edward placed a duplicate of the Westminster Abbey tomb there. The Lincoln tomb's original stone chest survives; its effigy was destroyed in the 17th century and replaced with a 19th-century copy. On the outside of Lincoln Cathedral are two prominent statues often identified as Edward and Eleanor, but these images were heavily restored in the 19th century and they were probably not originally intended to depict the couple.\nBetween 1307 and 1311 the central tower was raised to its present height of . The western towers and front of the cathedral were also improved and heightened. At this time, a tall lead-encased wooden spire topped the central tower but was blown down in a storm in 1548. Around 1380, the western towers were raised to their current height. They were capped with wooden spires covered with lead in 1420, but by 1807 they were dismantled. With its spire the tower reputedly reached a height of , making it the world's tallest structure at the time, though some consider this doubtful.\nOther additions to the cathedral at this time included its elaborate carved screen and the 14th-century misericords, as was the Angel Choir. For a large part of the length of the cathedral, the walls have arches in relief with a second layer in front to give the illusion of a passageway along the wall. However the illusion does not work, as the stonemason, copying techniques from France, did not make the arches the correct length needed for the illusion to be effective.\nIn 1398 John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford founded a chantry in the cathedral to pray for the welfare of their souls. In the 15th century the building of the cathedral turned to chantry or memorial chapels. The chapels next to the Angel Choir were built in the Perpendicular style, with an emphasis on strong vertical lines, which survive today in the window tracery and wall panelling.\nIn 1548 the spire collapsed in a storm.\nMagna Carta.\nHugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, was one of the signatories to Magna Carta and for hundreds of years the cathedral held one of the four remaining copies of the original, now securely displayed in Lincoln Castle.\nThe Lincoln Magna Carta was on display at the British Pavilion during the 1939 New York World's Fair. In March 1941, the Foreign Office proposed that the Lincoln Magna Carta be gifted to the United States, citing the \"many thousands of Americans who waited in long queues to view it\" and the US passage of the Lend-Lease Act, among other reasons. In 2009 the Lincoln Magna Carta was lent to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\nThere are three other surviving copies: two at the British Library and one at Salisbury Cathedral.\nLittle Saint Hugh.\nIn August 1255 the body of an eight-year-old boy was found in a well in Lincoln. He had been missing for nearly a month. This incident became the source of a blood libel in the city, with Jews accused of his abduction, torture, and murder. Many Jews were arrested and eighteen were hanged. The boy became known as Little Saint Hugh, to distinguish him from Saint Hugh of Lincoln, but he was never canonised.\nThe cathedral benefited from these events because Hugh was seen as a martyr, and many devotees came to the city and cathedral to venerate him. Geoffrey Chaucer mentions the case in \"The Prioress's Tale\" and a ballad was written about it in 1783. In 1955 a plaque was placed near \"the remains of the shrine of 'Little St Hugh'\" in the cathedral, that decries the \"Trumped up stories of 'ritual murders' of Christian boys by Jewish communities.\"\nFeatures.\nLincoln Imp.\nA carving in the Angel Choir is known as the Lincoln Imp, and since the late nineteenth century it has become the symbol of the city. The carving dates from the 13th century but received little attention until the late 19th century, when it figured in Arnold Frost's poem, \"The Ballad of the Wind, the Devil and Lincoln Minster\".\nWren library.\nThe Wren Library houses a rare collection of over 277 manuscripts, including the fifteenth-century \"Thornton Romances\" found in the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript.\nRose windows.\nLincoln Cathedral features two major rose windows, which are a highly uncommon feature among medieval architecture in England. On the north side of the cathedral is the \"Dean's Eye\" which survives from the original structure of the building and on the south side is the \"Bishop's Eye\" which was most likely rebuilt c.\u20091325\u20131350. This south window is one of the largest examples of curvilinear tracery seen in medieval architecture. Curvilinear tracery is a form of tracery where the patterns are continuous curves. This form was often done within pointed arches and squared windows because those are the easiest shapes, so the circular space of the window was a unique challenge to the designers. \nA solution was created that called for the circle to be divided into smaller shapes that would make it simpler to design and create. Curves were drawn within the window which created four distinct areas of the circle. This made the spaces within the circle where the tracery would go much smaller, and easier to work with. This window is also unique in that the focus of the tracery was shifted away from the centre of the circle and instead placed in other sections. The glazing of the window was difficult as the tracery for many of the same reasons; therefore, the designers cut back on the amount of iconography within the window.\nMost cathedral windows during this time displayed many colourful images of the Bible; however, at Lincoln there are very few images. Some of those images that can be seen within the window include saints Paul, Andrew, and James.\nVaults.\nOne major architectural features of Lincoln Cathedral are the vaults. The varying vaults within the cathedral are said to be both original and experimental. They demonstrate the experimental aspect seen at Lincoln. The vaults differ between the nave, aisles, choir, and chapels. Along the North Aisle there is a continuous ridge rib with a regular arcade that ignores the bays. In the South Aisle there is a discontinuous ridge rib that puts an emphasis on each bay. The North West Chapel has quadripartite vaults and the South Chapel has vaults that stem from one central support column. The use of sexpartite vaults allowed for more natural light to enter the cathedral through the clerestory windows, which were placed inside of each bay.\nSaint Hugh's Choir exhibits a series of asymmetrical vaults that appear to almost be a diagonal line created by two ribs on one side translating into only a single rib on the other side of the vault. This pattern divides the space of the vaults and bays, placing the emphasis on the bays.\nThe chapter house is a decagonal building with a single, central column from which twenty ribs rise producing unusual vaulting.\nEach area of Lincoln can be identified solely by the different vaults of the space. Each vault, or each variation of the vault, is unique. The vaults are attributed to French-Normand master mason Geoffrey de Noiers. de Noiers was succeeded by Alexander the Mason, who developed the nave's more elaborate, but symmetrical tierceron vaulting, the crossing vaulting, Galilee Porch and western facade screen.\nTower clock.\nA clock by John Thwaite was installed in the north west tower in 1775. This was later improved by Benjamin Vulliamy and moved to the broad tower around 1835. It was replaced in 1880 by a new clock built by Potts and Sons of Leeds, under the instruction of Edmund Beckett QC. Cambridge Chimes were a feature of the new clock. The machinery, featuring a double three-legged gravity escapement to Beckett's designs, weighs about , with the driving weights being , suspended by steel-wire ropes long, and the pendulum weight of . The beat is 1.5 seconds. \nThe hour hammer is , striking upon the Great Tom bell. The striking trains require winding daily, when done manually it took 20 minutes. The going train required winding twice per week. The clock mechanism contains the inscription \"Quod bene vortat Deus Opt. Max., Consiliis Edmundi Beckett, Baronetti, LL.D., Opera Gul. Potts et Filiorum, civium Leodiensium, Sumptibus Decani et Capituli, Novum in Turri positum est Horologium, A.D. MDCCCLXXX\".\nBells.\nThe South West tower of the cathedral contains a fine ring of 13 bells, all cast by John Taylor &amp; Co in Loughborough. The back 8 bells were cast in 1913, with 4 new trebles being added in 1927. In 1948 a flat 6th was added to allow for ringing on the middle 8 bells. The treble bell weighs 5cwt 0qr 2lb (281 kg), with the tenor weighing 23cwt 3qr 23lb (1,217 kg) and striking the note D (nominal 600.0 Hz). The bells are rung from the section of the tower just above The Great West Front, with the ringing chamber having three windows on all but one side. The bells themselves are hung below the louvres to minimise tower movement as much as possible.\nModern history.\nWartime history.\nSometime during the later stages of the Second World War, the accomplished RAF pilot and future Black British civil rights leader, Billy Strachan, almost crashed his aircraft into Lincoln Cathedral. Strachan credited this experience with ending his piloting career, as he found it psychologically impossible to continue flying combat missions.\nLincolnshire was home to many Bomber Command airfields during the Second World War, giving rise to the nickname of \"Bomber County\". The station badge for the nearby RAF Waddington depicts Lincoln Cathedral rising through the clouds. Until the opening of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in 2012, the cathedral had the only memorial in the United Kingdom dedicated to Bomber Command's large losses of aircrew in the Second World War.\nDuring the war, \"priceless British treasures\" were placed in a chamber sixty feet beneath the cathedral for safekeeping. This did not include the cathedral's copy of Magna Carta as it was on loan in the United States.\n21st century.\nA major renovation of the West Front was undertaken in 2000. It was discovered that the flying buttresses on the east end were no longer connected to the adjoining stonework, and repairs were made to prevent collapse. Additionally, the stonework of the Dean's Eye window in the transept was crumbling, meaning that a complete reconstruction of the window has had to be carried out according to the conservation criteria set out by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. There was a period of great anxiety when it emerged that the stonework needed to shift only for the entire window to collapse. Specialist engineers removed the window's tracery before installing a strengthened, more stable replacement. In addition to this the original stained glass was cleaned and set behind a new clear isothermal glass which offers better protection from the elements. By April 2006 the renovation project was completed at a cost of \u00a32\u00a0million.\nIt was announced in January 2020 that since 2016, archaeologists had found over 50 burials during the renovations, including a priest buried with a chalice and paten. Among the artifacts recovered was a coin depicting Edward the Confessor, who was king from 1042 to 1066. During the dig, sections of some extensively decorated Roman buildings and related artifacts were also discovered. Some of the Roman, medieval and Saxon objects were to be displayed at the visitor centre which was expected to open later in 2020. In 2022 the scaffolding of the Lincoln Cathedral was removed from its west front after 36 years.\nMaintaining the cathedral costs \u00a35.86\u00a0million a year (as at 2016). Between 2006 and 2009, 200,000 to 208,000 people visited Lincoln Cathedral annually. In 2010 the figure dropped to 150,000, making it the 16th-most visited attraction in the East Midlands. The fall in visitor numbers was attributed to the cancellation of the Lincoln Christmas Market that year.\nThe cathedral website states: \"Everyone is free to enter and gaze at the glory of the nave; you can sit in the peace of the Morning Chapel or visit the shop. If you want to explore further, we do ask you to pay.\" The cathedral offers tours of the cathedral, the tower and the roof. The peak of its season is the Lincoln Christmas Market, accompanied by an annual production of Handel's \"Messiah\".\nCathedral stone.\nLincoln Cathedral is one of the few English cathedrals built from the rock on which it stands. It is mostly built from Lincolnshire Limestone. The cathedral has owned the existing quarry, on Riseholme Road, Lincoln, since 1876. As of 2016, the quarry was expected to run out of stone in 2021. The cathedral's stonemasons use more than 100 tonnes of stone per year for maintenance and repairs.\nMusic.\nChoir and organists.\nThe choir is currently formed of adult singers (who are either lay vicars or choral scholars), and teams of about 20 girls and 20 boys. The cathedral accepted female choristers in 1995. Lincoln was the second cathedral in the country to adopt a separate girls' choir (after Salisbury Cathedral) and remains one of few which provides the same musical opportunities and equal weekly singing duties to both girls and boys. The choristers can now attend any school and are currently drawn from over ten local schools.\nThe Master of the Choristers (director of music) is Aric Prentice, who conducts the choir of boys and men; the Cathedral Organist and assistant director of music is Jeffrey Makinson, who conducts the choir of girls and men. The organist emeritus is Colin Walsh, previously organist and master of the choristers and then organist laureate.\nThe records of cathedral organists at Lincoln are continuous from 1439 when John Ingleton was the incumbent. Notable organists have included the Renaissance composers William Byrd and John Reading (snr) and the biographer of Mendelssohn, William Thomas Freemantle.\nOrgan.\nOne of the best examples of the work of \"Father\" Henry Willis, and the last he designed before his death, the cathedral organ dates from 1898. Willis had completed the design by 1885 but a shortfall in funding delayed construction and installation. This was made possible in 1898, after a donation of \u00a31,000 () from Alfred Shuttleworth, an engineer and later chairman of Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth. This, together with other private gifts and a public subscription, allowed work to progress. On St Hugh's Day, 17 November 1898, the organ was inaugurated at a service attended by 4,700 people. Willis had intended that the organ be electrically powered, the first organ in an English cathedral to be powered in this way. As the Brayford Wharf Power Station had not yet been completed, manual power was instead provided by infantrymen from the Lincolnshire Regiment.\nThe organ has been restored twice, in 1960 and in 1998. On both occasions the work was undertaken by Harrison &amp; Harrison. It is one of only two Willis organs in English cathedrals with its original tonal scheme. The organ specification is held on the National Pipe Organ Register.\nIn literature and media.\nIn literature.\nIn Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration \"Lincoln Cathedral\" to a painting by Thomas Allom, she remarks on the derivation of Gothic tracery from \"the arches of the old oak trees\". This was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.\nIn media.\nThe cathedral was used for the filming of \"The Da Vinci Code\" (based on the book of the same name). Filming took place mainly within the cloisters, and chapter house, of the cathedral, and remained a closed set. The cathedral took on the role of Westminster Abbey, as the abbey had refused to permit filming. Although there was protest at the filming, the filming was completed by the end of August 2005. To make the Lincoln chapter house appear similar to the Westminster chapter house, murals were painted on a special layer over the existing wall, and elsewhere polystyrene replicas of Isaac Newton's tomb and other abbey monuments were set up. For a time these murals and replicas remained in the chapter house, as part of a Da Vinci Code exhibit for visitors, but in January 2008 they were all sold off in an auction to raise money for the cathedral.\nThe cathedral also doubled as Westminster Abbey for the film \"Young Victoria\", filmed in September 2007, and did again in June 2018 for the Netflix Shakespeare film \"The King\".\nDuring 2022 the cathedral was also one of the locations for the 2023 Ridley Scott film \"Napoleon\", in which it serves both as Notre-Dame Cathedral for the coronation scene and Milan Cathedral in a sequence shown within the extended director's cut of the film.\nThe cathedral is LCR FM's transmitter site.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Warren Court presided over a major shift in American constitutional jurisprudence, which has been recognized by many as a \"constitutional revolution\" in the liberal direction, with Warren writing the majority opinions in landmark cases such as \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), \"Miranda v. Arizona\" (1966), and \"Loving v. Virginia\" (1967). Warren also led the Warren Commission, a presidential commission that investigated the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Warren is the last Chief Justice to have served in an elected office before nomination to the Supreme Court, and is generally considered to be one of the most influential Supreme Court justices and political leaders in the history of the United States.\nWarren was born in 1891 in Los Angeles and was raised in Bakersfield, California. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, he began a legal career in Oakland. He was hired as a deputy district attorney for Alameda County in 1920 and was appointed district attorney in 1925. He emerged as a leader of the state Republican Party and won election as the attorney general of California in 1938. In that position he supported, and was a firm proponent of the forced removal and internment of over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. In the 1942 California gubernatorial election, Warren defeated incumbent Democratic governor Culbert Olson. As the 30th Governor of California, Warren presided over a period of major growth\u2014for the state as well as the nation. Serving from 1943 to 1953, Warren is the only governor of California to be elected for three consecutive terms.\nWarren served as Thomas E. Dewey's running mate in the 1948 presidential election, but the ticket lost the election to incumbent president Harry S. Truman and Senator Alben W. Barkley in an election upset. Warren sought the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential election, but the party nominated General Dwight D. Eisenhower. After Eisenhower won election as president, he appointed Warren as Chief Justice. A series of rulings made by the Warren Court in the 1950s helped lead to the decline of McCarthyism. Warren helped arrange a unanimous decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), which ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. After \"Brown\", the Warren Court continued to issue rulings that helped bring an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws that were prevalent throughout the Southern United States. In \"Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States\" (1964), the Court upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that prohibits racial segregation in public institutions and public accommodations.\nIn the 1960s, the Warren Court handed down several landmark rulings that significantly transformed criminal procedure, redistricting, and other areas of the law. Many of the Court's decisions incorporated the Bill of Rights, making the protections of the Bill of Rights apply to state and local governments. \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (1963) established a criminal defendant's right to an attorney in felony cases, and \"Miranda v. Arizona\" (1966) required police officers to give what became known as the \"Miranda\" warning to suspects taken into police custody that advises them of their constitutional protections. \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964) established that all state legislative districts must be of roughly equal population size, while the Court's holding in \"Wesberry v. Sanders\" (1964) required equal populations for congressional districts, thus achieving \"one man, one vote\" in the United States. \"Schmerber v. California\" (1966) established that forced extraction of a blood sample is not compelled testimony, illuminating the limits on the protections of the 4th and 5th Amendments and \"Warden v. Hayden\" (1967) dramatically expanded the rights of police to seize evidence with a search warrant, reversing the mere evidence rule. Furthermore, \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965) established a constitutional right to privacy and struck down a state law that restricted access to contraceptives, and \"Loving v. Virginia\" (1967) struck down state anti-miscegenation laws, which had banned or otherwise regulated interracial marriage.\nWarren announced his retirement in 1968 and was succeeded by Appellate Judge Warren E. Burger in 1969. The Warren Court's rulings have received both support and criticism from liberals and conservatives alike, and few of the Court's decisions have been overturned.\nEarly life, family, and education.\nWarren was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 19, 1891, to Matt Warren and his wife, Crystal. Matt, whose original family name was Vaare, was born in Stavanger, Norway, in 1864, and he and his family migrated to the United States in 1866. Crystal, whose maiden name was Hernlund, was born in H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden; she and her family migrated to the United States when she was an infant. After marrying in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Mathias and Crystal settled in Southern California in 1889, where Matthias found work with the Southern Pacific Railroad. Earl Warren was the second of two children, after his older sister, Ethel. Earl did not receive a middle name; his father later commented that \"when you were born I was too poor to give you a middle name.\" In 1896, the family resettled in Bakersfield, California, where Warren grew up. Though not an exceptional student, Warren graduated from Kern County High School in 1908.\nHoping to become a trial lawyer, Warren enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, after graduating from high school. He majored in political science and became a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity. Like many other students at Berkeley, Warren was influenced by the progressive movement, and he was especially affected by Governor Hiram Johnson of California and Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. While at Berkeley, Warren was little more than an average student who earned decent but undistinguished grades and after his third year, he entered the school's Department of Jurisprudence (now UC Berkeley School of Law). He received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1914. Like his classmates upon graduation, Warren was admitted to the California bar without examination. After graduation, he took a position with the Associated Oil Company in San Francisco. Warren disliked working at the company and was disgusted by the corruption he saw in San Francisco, so he took a position with the Oakland law firm of Robinson and Robinson.\nAfter the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Warren volunteered for an officer training camp, but was rejected due to hemorrhoids. Still hoping to become an officer, Warren underwent a procedure to remove the hemorrhoids, but by the time he fully recovered from the operation the officer training camp had closed. Warren enlisted in the United States Army as a private in August 1917, and was assigned to Company I of the 91st Division's 363rd Infantry Regiment at Camp Lewis, Washington. He was made acting first sergeant of the company before being sent to a three-month officer training course. After he returned to the company in May 1918 as a second lieutenant, the regiment was sent to Camp Lee, Virginia, to train draftees. Warren spent the rest of the war there and was discharged less than a month after Armistice Day, following a promotion to first lieutenant. Warren remained in the United States Army Reserve until 1934, rising to the rank of captain.\nCity and district attorney.\nIn late 1918, Warren returned to Oakland, where he accepted a position as the legislative assistant to Leon E. Gray, a newly elected member of the California State Assembly. Shortly after arriving in the state capital of Sacramento, Warren was appointed as the clerk of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. After a brief stint as a deputy city attorney for Oakland, in 1920 Warren was hired as a deputy district attorney for Alameda County. By the end of 1924, Warren had become the most senior person in the department outside of the district attorney, Ezra Decoto. Though many of his professional colleagues supported Calvin Coolidge, Warren cast his vote for Progressive Party candidate Robert La Follette in the 1924 presidential election. That same year, Warren made his first foray into electoral politics, serving as the campaign manager for his friend, Republican Assemblyman Frank Anderson.\nWith the support of Governor Friend Richardson and publisher Joseph R. Knowland, a leader of the conservative faction of San Francisco Bay Area Republicans, Warren was appointed as the Alameda County district attorney in 1925. Warren faced a tough re-election campaign in 1926, as local Republican boss Michael Joseph Kelly sought to unseat him. Warren rejected political contributions and largely self-funded his campaign, leaving him at a financial disadvantage to Kelly's preferred candidate, Preston Higgins. Nonetheless, Warren won a landslide victory over Higgins, taking over two-thirds of the vote. When he ran for re-election again in 1930, he faced only token opposition.\nWarren gained a statewide reputation as a tough, no-nonsense district attorney who fought corruption in government and ran his office in a nonpartisan manner. Warren strongly supported the autonomy of law enforcement agencies, but also believed that police and prosecutors had to act fairly. Unlike many other local law enforcement officials in the 1920s, Warren vigorously enforced Prohibition. In 1927, he launched a corruption investigation against Sheriff Burton Becker. After a trial that some in the press described as \"the most sweeping expos\u00e9 of graft in the history of the country,\" Warren won a conviction against Becker in 1930. When one of his own undercover agents admitted that he had perjured himself in order to win convictions in bootleg cases, Warren personally took charge of prosecuting the agent. Warren's efforts gained him national attention; a 1931 nationwide poll of law enforcement officials found that Warren was \"the most intelligent and politically independent district attorney in the United States\".\nIn 1932, he argued his first Supreme Court case, Central Pacific Railway Co. v. Alameda County. That happened to be the last oral argument that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes heard, as he announced his retirement later that afternoon, and stepped down from the court just five days later. Warren would be teased by his friends, who would say \"He was 30 years on the State Court, he was 20 years on the Supreme Court, he listened to you just once and he said, \"I've had it.\"\nThe Great Depression hit the San Francisco Bay area hard in the 1930s, leading to high levels of unemployment and a destabilization of the political order. Warren took a hard stance against labor in the buildup to the San Francisco General Strike. In \"Whitney v. California\" (1927) Warren prosecuted a woman under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act for attending a communist meeting in Oakland. In 1936, Warren faced one of the most controversial cases of his career after George W. Alberts, the chief engineer of a freighter, was found dead. Warren believed that Alberts was murdered in a conspiracy orchestrated by radical left-wing union members, and he won the conviction of union officials George Wallace, Earl King, Ernest Ramsay, and Frank Conner. Many union members argued that the defendants had been framed by Warren's office, and they organized protests of the trial.\nState party leader.\nWhile continuing to serve as the district attorney of Alameda County, Warren emerged as leader of the state Republican Party. He served as the county chairman for Herbert Hoover's 1932 campaign and, after Franklin D. Roosevelt won that election, he attacked Roosevelt's New Deal agenda. In 1934, Warren became chairman of the state Republican Party and he took a leading public role in opposing the gubernatorial candidacy of Democrat Upton Sinclair. Warren earned national notoriety in 1936 for leading a successful campaign to elect a slate of unpledged delegates to the 1936 Republican National Convention; he was motivated largely by his opposition to the influence of Governor Frank Merriam and publisher William Randolph Hearst. In the 1936 presidential election, Warren campaigned on behalf of the unsuccessful Republican nominee, Alf Landon.\nFamily and social life.\nAfter World War I, Warren lived with his sister and her husband in Oakland. In 1921, he met Nina Elisabeth Meyers (n\u00e9e Palmquist), a widowed, 28-year-old store manager with a three-year-old son. Nina had been born in Sweden to a Baptist minister and his wife, and her family had emigrated to the United States when she was an infant. On October 4, 1925, shortly after Warren was appointed district attorney, Warren and Nina married. Their first child, Virginia, was born in 1928, and they had four more children: Earl Jr. (born 1930), Dorothy (born 1931), Nina Elisabeth (born 1933), and Robert (born 1935). Warren also adopted Nina's son, James. Warren was the father-in-law of John Charles Daly, the host of the television game show \"What's My Line?\" through his daughter Virginia's marriage. Warren enjoyed a close relationship with his wife; one of their daughters later described it as \"the most ideal relationship I could dream of.\" In 1935, the family moved to a seven-bedroom home just outside of downtown Oakland. Though the Warrens sent their children to Sunday school at a local Baptist church, Warren was not a regular churchgoer. In 1938, Warren's father, Matt, was murdered at the family home in Bakersfield; investigators never discovered the identity of the murderer. Warren and his family moved to the state capital of Sacramento in 1943, and to the Wardman Park Hotel, a residential hotel in Washington, D.C., in 1953.\nWarren was very active after 1919 in such groups as Freemasonry, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Loyal Order of Moose (obtained the Pilgrim Degree of Merit, the highest award given in the fraternity) and the American Legion. Each one introduced Warren to new friends and political connections. He rose through the ranks in the Masons, culminating in his election in 1935 as the Grand Master of the Freemasons for the state of California from 1935 to 1936. Biographer Jim Newton says that Warren \"thrived in the Masons because he shared their ideals, but those ideals also helped shape him, nurturing his commitment to service, deepening his conviction that society's problems were best addressed by small groups of enlightened, well-meaning citizens. Those ideals knitted together Warren's Progressivism, his Republicanism, and his Masonry.\"\nAttorney General of California.\nIn 1934, Warren and his allies won passage of a state ballot measure that transformed the position of Attorney General of California into a full-time office; previous officeholders had worked part-time while maintaining their own private practice. After incumbent Ulysses S. Webb announced his retirement, Warren jumped into the 1938 state attorney general election. Earlier in the 20th century, progressives had passed a state constitutional amendment allowing for \"cross-filing,\" whereby a candidate could file to run in multiple party primaries for the same office. Warren took advantage of that amendment and ran in multiple primaries. Even though he continued to serve as chairman of the state Republican Party until April 1938, Warren won the Republican, Progressive, and, crucially, Democratic primaries for attorney general. He faced no serious opposition in the 1938 elections, even while incumbent Republican Governor Frank Merriam was defeated by Democratic nominee Culbert Olson.\nOnce elected, he organized state law enforcement officials into regions and led a statewide anti-crime effort. One of his major initiatives was to crack down on gambling ships operating off the coast of Southern California. Warren continued many of the policies from his predecessor Ulysses S. Webb's four decades in office. These included eugenic forced sterilizations and the confiscation of land from Japanese owners. Warren, who was a member of the outspoken anti-Asian society Native Sons of the Golden West, successfully sought legislation expanding the land confiscations. During his time as Attorney General, Warren appointed as one of his deputy attorneys general Roger J. Traynor, who was then a law professor at UC Berkeley and later became the 23rd chief justice of California, as well as one of the most influential judges of his time.\nInternment of Japanese Americans.\nAfter World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, foreign policy became an increasingly important issue in the United States; Warren rejected the isolationist tendencies of many Republicans and supported Roosevelt's rearmament campaign. The United States entered World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Following the attack, Warren organized the state's civilian defense program, warning in January 1942 that \"the Japanese situation as it exists in this state today may well be the Achilles' heel of the entire civilian defense effort.\" He became a driving force behind the internment of over one hundred thousand Japanese Americans without any charges or due process.\nThough the decision to intern Japanese Americans was made by General John L. DeWitt, and the internment was carried out by federal officials, Warren's advocacy played a major role in providing public justification for the internment. In particular, Warren had claimed that Japanese Americans had willfully infiltrated \"every strategic spot\" in California coastal and valley counties, had warned of potentially greater danger from American born ethnic Japanese than from first-generation immigrants, and asserted that although there were means to test the loyalty of a \"Caucasian\" that the same could not be said for ethnic Japanese. Warren further argued that the complete lack of disloyal acts among Japanese Americans in California to date indicated that they intended to commit such acts in the future. Later, Warren vigorously protested the return of released internees back into California.\nBy early 1944, Warren had come to regret his role in the internment of Japanese Americans, and he eventually approved of the federal government's decision to allow Japanese Americans to begin returning to California in December 1944; however, he long resisted any public expression of regret in spite of years of repeated requests from the Japanese American community.\nIn a 1972 oral history interview, Warren said that \"I feel that everybody who had anything to do with the relocation of the Japanese, after it was all over, had something of a guilty consciousness about it, and wanted to show that it wasn't a racial thing as much as it was a defense matter.\" When during the interview Warren mentioned the faces of the children separated from their parents, he broke down in tears and the interview was temporarily halted. In 1974, shortly before his death, Warren privately confided to journalist and former internee Morse Saito that he greatly regretted his actions during the evacuation.\nIn his posthumously published memoirs, Warren fully acknowledged his error, stating that he\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;since deeply regretted the removal order and my own testimony advocating it, because it was not in keeping with our American concept of freedom and the rights of citizens... Whenever I thought of the innocent little children who were torn from home, school friends, and congenial surroundings, I was conscience-stricken... [i]t was wrong to react so impulsively, without positive evidence of disloyalty.\u2014\u200a\nGovernor of California.\nElection.\nWarren frequently clashed with Governor Culbert Olson over various issues, partly because they belonged to different parties. As early as 1939, supporters of Warren began making plans for his candidacy in California's 1942 gubernatorial election. Though initially reluctant to run, Warren announced his gubernatorial candidacy in April 1942. He cross-filed in the Democratic and Republican primaries, ran without a party label, and refused to endorse candidates running for other offices. He sought to attract voters regardless of party, and stated \"I can and will support President Roosevelt better than Olson ever has or ever will.\" Many Democrats, including Olson, criticized Warren for \"put[ting] on a cloak of nonpartisanship,\" but Warren's attempts to appear above parties resonated with many voters. In August, Warren easily won the Republican primary, and surprised many observers by nearly defeating Olson in the Democratic primary. In November, he decisively defeated Olson in the general election, taking just under 57 percent of the vote. Warren's victory immediately made him a figure with national stature, and he enjoyed good relations with both the conservative wing of the Republican Party, led by Robert A. Taft, and the moderate wing of the Republican Party, led by Thomas E. Dewey.\nPolicies.\nWarren modernized the office of governor, and state government generally. Like most progressives, Warren believed in efficiency and planning. During World War II, he aggressively pursued postwar economic planning. Fearing another postwar decline that would rival the depression years, Governor Earl Warren initiated public works projects similar to those of the New Deal to capitalize on wartime tax surpluses and provide jobs for returning veterans. For example, his support of the Collier-Burns Act in 1947 raised gasoline taxes that funded a massive program of freeway construction. Unlike states where tolls or bonds funded highway construction, California's gasoline taxes were earmarked for building the system. Warren's support for the bill was crucial because his status as a popular governor strengthened his views, in contrast with opposition from trucking, oil, and gas lobbyists. The Collier-Burns Act helped influence passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, setting a pattern for national highway construction. In the mid-1940s, Warren sought to implement a state universal health care, but he was unable to pass his plan due to opposition from the medical and business communities. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco during Warren\u00b4s tenure as governor of California. He played an important role in the United Nations Conference on International Organization from April 25 to June 26, 1945, which resulted in the United Nations Charter.\nWarren also pursued social legislation. He built up the state's higher education system based on the University of California and its vast network of small universities and community colleges. After federal courts declared the segregation of Mexican schoolchildren illegal in \"Mendez v. Westminster\" (1947), Governor Warren signed legislation ending the segregation of American Indians and Asians. He sought the creation of a commission to study employment discrimination, but his plan was blocked by Republicans in the state legislature. Governor Warren stopped enforcing California's anti-miscegenation law after it was declared unconstitutional in \"Perez v. Sharp\" (1948). He also improved the hospital and prison systems. These reforms provided new services to a fast-growing population; the 1950 Census showed that California's population had grown by over 50% over the previous ten years.\nRe-election campaigns.\nBy 1946, California's economy was booming, Warren was widely popular, and he enjoyed excellent relations with the state's top Democratic officeholder, Attorney General Robert W. Kenny. At the urging of state party leaders, Kenny agreed to run against Warren in the 1946 gubernatorial election, but Kenny was reluctant to criticize his opponent and was distracted by his role in the Nuremberg trials. As in 1942, Warren refused to endorse candidates for other offices, and he sought to portray himself as an effective, nonpartisan governor. Warren easily won the Republican primary for governor and, in a much closer vote, defeated Kenny in the Democratic primary. After winning both primaries, Warren endorsed Republican William Knowland's U.S. Senate candidacy and Goodwin Knight's candidacy for lieutenant governor. Warren won the general election by an overwhelming margin, becoming the first Governor of California since Hiram Johnson in 1914 to win a second term.\nThough he considered retiring after two terms, Warren ultimately chose to seek re-election in 1950, partly to prevent the more conservative Knight from succeeding him. He easily won the Republican primary, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by James Roosevelt. Warren consistently led Roosevelt in general election polls and won re-election in a landslide, taking 65 percent of the vote. He was the first Governor of California elected to three consecutive terms. During the 1950 campaign, Warren refused to formally endorse Richard Nixon, the Republican nominee for the Senate. Warren disliked what he saw as Nixon's ruthless approach to politics and was wary of having a conservative rival for leadership of the state party. Despite Warren's refusal to campaign for him, Nixon defeated Democratic nominee Helen Gahagan Douglas by a decisive margin.\nNational politics, 1942\u20131952.\nAfter his election as governor, Warren emerged as a potential candidate for president or vice president in the 1944 election. Seeking primarily to ensure his status as the most prominent Republican in California, he ran as a favorite son candidate in the 1944 Republican primaries. Warren won the California primary with no opposition, but Thomas Dewey clinched the party's presidential nomination by the time of the 1944 Republican National Convention. Warren delivered the keynote address of the convention, in which he called for a more liberal Republican Party. Dewey asked Warren to serve as his running mate, but Warren was uninterested in the vice presidency and correctly believed that Dewey would be defeated by President Roosevelt in the 1944 election.\nAfter his 1946 re-election victory, Warren began planning a run for president in the 1948 election. The two front-runners for the nomination were Dewey and Robert Taft, but Warren, Harold Stassen, Arthur Vandenberg, and General Douglas MacArthur each had significant support. Prior to the 1948 Republican National Convention, Warren attempted to position himself as a dark horse candidate who might emerge as a compromise nominee. However, Dewey won the nomination on the third ballot of the convention. Dewey once again asked Warren to serve as his running mate, and this time Warren agreed. Far ahead in the polls against President Harry S. Truman, the Democratic nominee, Dewey ran a cautious campaign that largely focused on platitudes rather than issues. Warren campaigned across the country on behalf of the ticket, but was frustrated by his inability to support specific policies. To the surprise of many observers, Truman won the election, and this became the only election Warren ever lost.\nAfter his 1950 re-election, Warren decided that he would seek the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential election, and he announced his candidacy in November 1951. Taft also sought the nomination, but Dewey declined to make a third run for president. Dewey and his supporters instead conducted a long campaign to draft General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Republican presidential nominee. Warren ran in three Republican presidential primaries, but won just a handful of delegates outside of his home state. In the California primary, he defeated a challenge from Thomas H. Werdel, whose conservative backers alleged that Warren had \"abandoned Republicanism and embraced the objectives of the New Deal.\" After Eisenhower entered the race, Warren realized that his only hope of nomination was to emerge as a compromise nominee at the 1952 Republican National Convention after a deadlock between supporters of Eisenhower and Taft.\nAfter the primaries, Warren had the support of 80 delegates, while Eisenhower and Taft each had about 450 delegates. Though the California delegation was pledged to support Warren, many of the delegates personally favored Eisenhower or Taft. Unknown to Warren, Eisenhower supporters had promised Richard Nixon the vice presidency if he could swing the California delegation to Eisenhower. By the time of the convention, Nixon and his supporters had convinced most California delegates to switch their votes to Eisenhower after the first presidential ballot. Eisenhower won 595 votes on the first presidential ballot of the convention, just 9 short of the majority. Before the official end of the first ballot, several states shifted their votes to Eisenhower, giving him the nomination. Warren's decision to support a convention rule that unseated several contested delegations was critical to Eisenhower's victory; Eisenhower himself said that \"if anyone ever clinched the nomination for me, it was Earl Warren.\" Nixon was named as Eisenhower's running mate, and Warren campaigned on behalf of the Republican ticket in fourteen different states. Ultimately, Eisenhower defeated Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson II, taking 55 percent of the national popular vote. Nixon resigned from the Senate to become vice president, and Warren appointed Thomas Kuchel to the Senate seat vacated by Nixon.\nChief Justice of the United States.\nAppointment.\nAfter the 1952 election, President-elect Eisenhower promised that he would appoint Warren to the next vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. Warren turned down the position of Secretary of the Interior in the new administration, but in August 1953 he agreed to serve as the Solicitor General. In September 1953, before Warren's nomination as solicitor general was announced, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson died. To fill the critical position of chief justice, Eisenhower first offered the position of chief justice to Thomas E. Dewey, but Dewey declined the offer. He then considered either elevating a sitting Supreme Court justice or appointing another individual with judicial experience but ultimately chose to honor his promise to appoint Warren to the first Supreme Court vacancy. Explaining Warren's qualifications for the Court, Eisenhower wrote to his brother, \"Warren has had seventeen years of practice in public law, during which his record was one of remarkable accomplishment and success... He has been very definitely a liberal-conservative; he represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court.\"\nWarren received a recess appointment in October 1953. In the winter of 1953\u20131954, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported him favorably by a 12\u20133 majority, with three southerners in James Eastland, Olin D. Johnston and Harley M. Kilgore reporting negatively. The Senate would then confirm Warren's appointment by acclamation in March 1954; unlike the future appointments of John Marshall Harlan II and Potter Stewart (who ironically would prove the most conservative members of the Warren Court) southern senators made no effort to block Warren. To date, Warren is the most recent chief justice to have held statewide elected office at any point in his career and the most recent serving politician to be appointed Chief Justice. Warren was also the first Scandinavian American to be appointed to the Supreme Court.\nLeadership and philosophy.\nWhen Warren was appointed, all of the other Supreme Court justices had been appointed by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman, and most were committed New Deal liberal Democrats. Nonetheless, they disagreed about the role that courts should play. Felix Frankfurter led a faction that insisted upon judicial self-restraint and deference to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction by agreeing the Court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy but favored a more activist role for the courts in matters related to individual liberties. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the Black and Douglas faction. William J. Brennan Jr. became the intellectual leader of the activist faction after he was appointed to the court by Eisenhower in 1956 and complemented Warren's political skills by the strong legal skills that Warren lacked.\nAs chief justice, Warren's most important prerogative was the power to assign opinions if he was in the majority. That power had a subtle but important role in shaping the Court's majority opinions, since different justices would write different opinions. Warren initially asked the senior associate justice, Hugo Black, to preside over conferences until he became accustomed to the processes of the Court. However, Warren learned quickly and soon was in fact, as well as in name, the Court's chief justice. Warren's strength lay in his public gravitas, his leadership skills, and his firm belief that the Constitution guaranteed natural rights and that the Court had a unique role in protecting those rights. His arguments did not dominate judicial conferences, but Warren excelled at putting together coalitions and cajoling his colleagues in informal meetings.\nWarren saw the US Constitution as the embodiment of American values, and he cared deeply about the ethical implications of the Court's rulings. According to Justice Potter Stewart, Warren's philosophical foundations were the \"eternal, rather bromidic, platitudes in which he sincerely believed\" and \"Warren's great strength was his simple belief in the things we now laugh at: motherhood, marriage, family, flag, and the like.\" The constitutional historian Melvin I. Urofsky concludes that \"scholars agree that as a judge, Warren does not rank with Louis Brandeis, Black, or Brennan in terms of jurisprudence. His opinions were not always clearly written, and his legal logic was often muddled.\" Other scholars have also reached this conclusion.\n1950s.\n\"Brown v. Board of Education\".\nSoon after joining the Court, Warren presided over the case of \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which arose from the NAACP's legal challenge against Jim Crow laws. The Southern United States had implemented Jim Crow laws in aftermath of the Reconstruction Era to disenfranchise African Americans and segregate public schools and other institutions. In the 1896 case of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", the Court had held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit segregation in public institutions if the institutions were \"separate but equal.\" In the decades after \"Plessy\", the NAACP had won several incremental victories, but 17 states required the segregation of public schools by 1954. In 1951, the Vinson Court had begun hearing the NAACP's legal challenge to segregated school systems but had not rendered a decision when Warren took office.\nBy the early 1950s, Warren had become personally convinced that segregation was morally wrong and legally indefensible. Warren sought not only to overturn \"Plessy\" but also to have a unanimous verdict. Warren, Black, Douglas, Burton, and Minton supported overturning the precedent, but for different reasons, Robert H. Jackson, Felix Frankfurter, Tom C. Clark, and Stanley Forman Reed were reluctant to overturn \"Plessy\". Nonetheless, Warren won over Jackson, Frankfurter, and Clark, in part by allowing states and federal courts the flexibility to pursue desegregation of schools at different speeds. Warren extensively courted the last holdout, Reed, who finally agreed to join a unanimous verdict because he feared that a dissent would encourage resistance to the Court's holding. After the Supreme Court formally voted to hold that the segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Warren drafted an eight-page outline from which his law clerks drafted an opinion, and the Court handed down its decision in May 1954. In the Deep South at the time signs appeared calling to \"Impeach Earl Warren.\"\nOther decisions and events.\nIn arranging a unanimous decision in \"Brown\", Warren fully established himself as the leader of the Court. He also remained a nationally prominent figure. After a 1955 Gallup poll found that a plurality of Republican respondents favored Warren to succeed Eisenhower, Warren announced that he would not resign from the Court under any circumstances. Eisenhower seriously considered retiring after one term and encouraging Warren to run in the 1956 presidential election but ultimately chose to run after he had received a positive medical report following his heart attack. Despite that brief possibility, a split developed between Eisenhower and Warren, and some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was \"the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made.\"\nMeanwhile, many Southern politicians expressed outrage at the Court's decisions and promised to resist any federal attempt to force desegregation, a strategy known as massive resistance. Although \"Brown\" did not mandate immediate school desegregation or bar other \"separate but equal\" institutions, most observers recognized that the decision marked the beginning of the end of Jim Crow. Throughout his years as chief justice, Warren kept decisions concerning segregation unanimous. \"Brown\" applied only to schools, but soon, the Court expanded the concept to other state actions by striking down racial classifications in many areas. Warren compromised by agreeing to Frankfurter's demand that the Court go slowly in implementing desegregation. Warren used Frankfurter's suggestion for a 1955 decision (\"Brown II\") to include the phrase \"all deliberate speed.\" In 1956, after the Montgomery bus boycott, the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's decision that segregated buses are unconstitutional. Two years later, Warren assigned Brennan to write the Court's opinion in \"Cooper v. Aaron\". Brennan held that state officials were legally bound to enforce the Court's desegregation ruling in \"Brown\".\nIn the 1956 term, the Warren Court received condemnation from right-wingers such as Senator Joseph McCarthy by handing down a series of decisions, including \"Yates v. United States\", which struck down laws designed to suppress communists and later led to the decline of McCarthyism. The Warren Court's decisions in those cases represented a major shift from the Vinson Court, which had generally upheld such laws during the Second Red Scare. That same year, Warren was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1957, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n1960s.\nAfter the Republican Party nominated Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, Warren privately supported the Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy. They became personally close after Kennedy was inaugurated. Warren later wrote that \"no American during my long life ever set his sights higher for a better America or centered his attacks more accurately on the evils and shortcomings of our society than did [Kennedy].\" In 1962, Frankfurter retired and was replaced by Kennedy appointee Arthur Goldberg, which gave the liberal bloc a majority on the Court. Goldberg left the Court in 1965 but was replaced by Abe Fortas, who largely shared Goldberg's judicial philosophy. With the liberal bloc firmly in control, the Warren Court handed down a series of momentous rulings in the 1960s.\nBill of Rights.\nThe 1960s marked a major shift in constitutional interpretation, as the Warren Court continued the process of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights in which the provisions of the first ten amendments to the US Constitution were applied to the states. Warren saw the Bill of Rights as a codification of \"the natural rights of man\" against the government and believed that incorporation would bring the law \"into harmony with moral principles.\" When Warren took office, most of the provisions of the First Amendment already applied to the states, but the vast majority of the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. The Warren Court saw the incorporation of the remaining provisions of the First Amendment as well as all or part of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. The Warren Court also handed down numerous other important decisions regarding the Bill of Rights, especially in the field of criminal procedure.\nIn \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\", the Supreme Court reversed a libel conviction of the publisher of the \"New York Times\". In the majority opinion, Brennan articulated the actual malice standard for libel against public officials, which has become an enduring part of constitutional law. In \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\", the Court reversed the suspension of an eighth-grade student who wore a black armband in protest of the Vietnam War. Fortas's majority opinion noted that students did not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\" The Court's holding in \"United States v. Seeger\" expanded those who could be classified as conscientious objectors under the Selective Service System by allowing nonreligious individuals with ethical objections to claim conscientious objector status. Another case, \"United States v. O'Brien\", saw the Court uphold a prohibition against burning draft-cards. Warren dissented in \"Street v. New York\" in which the Court struck down a state law that prohibited the desecration of the American flag. When his law clerks asked why he dissented in the case, Warren stated, \"Boys, it's the American flag. I'm just not going to vote in favor of burning the American flag.\" In the 1969 case of \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\", the Court held that governments cannot punish speech unless it is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\"\nIn 1962, \"Engel v. Vitale\" held that the Establishment Clause prohibits mandatory prayer in public school. The ruling sparked a strong backlash from many political and religious leaders, some of whom called for the impeachment of Warren. Warren became a favored target of right-wing groups, such as the John Birch Society, as well as the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater. \"Engel\", the criminal procedure cases, and the persistent criticism of conservative politicians like Goldwater and Nixon contributed to a decline in the Court's popularity in the mid- and the late 1960s. \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" had the Court strike down a state law designed to restrict access to contraception, and it established a constitutional right to privacy. \"Griswold\" later provided an important precedent for the case of \"Roe v. Wade\", which disallowed many laws designed to restrict access to abortion.\nCriminal procedure.\nIn the early 1960s, the Court increasingly turned its attention to criminal procedure, which had traditionally been primarily a domain of the states. In \"Elkins v. United States\" (1960), Warren joined with the majority in striking down the \"Silver Platter Doctrine,\" a loophole to the exclusionary rule that had allowed federal officials to use evidence that had been illegally gathered by state officials. The next year, in \"Mapp v. Ohio\", the Court held that the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" applied to state officials. Warren wrote the majority opinion in \"Terry v. Ohio\" (1968) in which the Court established that police officers may frisk a criminal suspect if they have a reasonable suspicion that the suspect is committing or is about to commit a crime. In \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (1962), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment required states to furnish publicly funded attorneys to all criminal defendants accused of a felony and unable to afford counsel. Prior to \"Gideon\", criminal defendants had been guaranteed the right to counsel only in federal trials and capital cases.\nIn \"Escobedo v. Illinois\" (1964), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal suspects the right to speak to their counsel during police interrogations. \"Escobedo\" was limited to criminal suspects who had an attorney at the time of their arrest and requested to speak with that counsel. In the landmark case of \"Miranda v. Arizona\", Warren wrote the majority opinion, which established a right to counsel for every criminal suspect and required police to give criminal suspects what became known as a \"Miranda warning\" in which suspects are notified of their right to an attorney and their right to silence. Warren incorporated some suggestions from Brennan, but his holding in \"Miranda\" was most influenced by his past experiences as a district attorney. Unlike many of the other Warren Court decisions, including \"Mapp\" and \"Gideon\", \"Miranda\" created standards that went far beyond anything that had been established by any of the states. \"Miranda\" received a strong backlash from law enforcement and political leaders. Conservatives angrily denounced what they called the \"handcuffing of the police.\"\nReapportionment (one man, one vote).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.\n--Chief Justice Earl Warren on the right to vote as the foundation of democracy in \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964).\nIn 1959, several residents dissatisfied with Tennessee's legislative districts brought suit against the state in \"Baker v. Carr\". Like many other states, Tennessee had state legislative districts of unequal populations, and the plaintiffs sought more equitable legislative districts. In \"Colegrove v. Green\" (1946), the Supreme Court had declined to become involved in legislative apportionment and instead left the issue as a matter for Congress and the states. In \"Gomillion v. Lightfoot\" (1960), the Court struck down a redistricting plan designed to disenfranchise African-American voters, but many of the justices were reluctant to involve themselves further in redistricting. Frankfurter insisted that the Court should avoid the \"political thicket\" of apportionment and warned that the Court would never be able to find a clear formula to guide lower courts. Warren helped convince Associate Justice Potter Stewart to join Brennan's majority decision in \"Baker v. Carr\", which held that redistricting was not a political question and so federal courts had jurisdiction over the issue. The opinion did not directly require Tennessee to implement redistricting but instead left it to a federal district court to determine whether Tennessee's districts violated the Constitution. In another case, \"Gray v. Sanders\", the Court struck down Georgia's County Unit System, which granted disproportional power to rural counties in party primaries. In a third case, \"Wesberry v. Sanders\", the Court required states to draw congressional districts of equal population.\nIn \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1963), the chief justice wrote what biographer Ed Cray terms \"the most influential of the 170 majority opinions [Warren] would write.\" While eight of the nine justices had voted to require congressional districts of equal population in \"Wesberry\", some of the justices were reluctant to require state legislative districts to be of equal population. Warren indicated that the Equal Protection Clause required that state legislative districts be apportioned on an equal basis: \"legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.\" His holding upheld the principle of \"one man, one vote,\" which had previously been articulated by Douglas. After the decision, the states reapportioned their legislatures quickly and with minimal troubles. Numerous commentators have concluded reapportionment was the Warren Court's great \"success story.\"\nCivil rights.\nCivil rights continued to be a major issue facing the Warren Court in the 1960s. In \"Peterson v. Greenville\" (1963), Warren wrote the Court's majority opinion, which struck down local ordinances that prohibited restaurants from serving black and white individuals in the same room. Later that decade, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in \"Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States\". The Court held that the Commerce Clause empowered the federal government to prohibit racial segregation in public accommodations like hotels. The ruling effectively overturned the 1883 \"Civil Rights Cases\" in which the Supreme Court had held that Congress could not regulate racial discrimination by private businesses. The Court upheld another landmark civil rights act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, by holding that it was valid under the authority provided to Congress by the Fifteenth Amendment.\nIn 1967, Warren wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case of \"Loving v. Virginia\" in which the Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage. Warren was particularly pleased by the ruling in \"Loving\" since he had long regretted that the Court had not taken up the similar case of \"Naim v. Naim\" in 1955. In \"Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections\" (1966), the Court struck down poll taxes in state elections. In another case, \"Bond v. Floyd\", the Court required the Georgia legislature to seat the newly elected legislator Julian Bond; members of the legislature had refused to seat Bond because he opposed the Vietnam War.\nWarren Commission.\nShortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the newly sworn-in president, Lyndon B. Johnson, convinced Warren to serve as the head of a bipartisan commission tasked with investigating the assassination. From December 1963 to October 1964, Warren simultaneously served as chief justice of the United States and chairman of the Warren Commission. Warren originally declined to head the Commission due to his belief that a sitting-Chief Justice should not be involved in non-judicial work, however when Johnson told him that he feared war would break out with the Soviet Union Warren changed his mind. Another factor in his reconsideration was President Johnson's insistence that the \"nation's prestige\" was at stake.\nAt the start of the investigation, Warren decided to hire the commission's legal staff from outside the government to avoid any improper influence on their work. \u00a0Warren appointed Lee Rankin as general counsel and worked closely with Rankin and his assistants, Howard P. Willens and Norman Redlich, to recruit staff lawyers, supervise their investigation and publish the Commission's report. To avoid the confusion and duplication of parallel investigations, Warren convinced the Texas authorities to defer any local inquiry into the assassination.\nWarren was personally involved in several aspects of the investigation. \u00a0He supervised four days of testimony by Lee Harvey Oswald's widow, Marina Oswald, and was widely criticized for telling the press that, although her testimony would be publicly disclosed, \"it might not be in your lifetime.\" He attended the closed-door interview of Jacqueline Kennedy and insisted on participating in the deposition of Jack Ruby in Dallas, where he visited the book depository. Warren also participated in the investigation of Kennedy's medical treatment and autopsy. At Robert Kennedy's insistence, Warren handled the unwelcome task of reviewing the autopsy photos alone. \u00a0Because the photos were so gruesome, Warren decided that they should not be included in the Commission's records.\nWarren closely supervised the drafting of the Commission's report. He wanted to ensure that Commission members had ample opportunity to evaluate the staff's work and to make their own judgments about important conclusions in the report. He insisted that the report should be unanimous and so he compromised on a number of issues to get all the members to sign the final version. Although a reenactment of the assassination \"produced convincing evidence\" supporting the single-bullet theory, the Commission decided not to take a position on the single-bullet theory.\u00a0The Commission unanimously concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone.\nThe Warren Commission was an unhappy experience for the chief justice. As Willens recalled, \"One can't say too much about the Chief's sacrifice. The work was a drain on his physical well-being.\" However, Warren always believed that the Commission's primary conclusion, that Oswald acted alone, was correct.\u00a0In his memoirs, Warren wrote that Oswald was incapable of being the key operative in a conspiracy, and that any high-level government conspiracy would inevitably have been discovered. \"Newsweek\" magazine quoted Warren saying that, if he handled the Oswald case as a district attorney, \"I could have gotten a conviction in two days and never heard about the case again.\" Warren wrote that \"the facts of the assassination itself are simple, so simple that many people believe it must be more complicated and conspiratorial to be true.\" Warren told the Commission staff not to worry about conspiracy theories and other criticism of the report because \u201chistory will prove us right.\u201d\nRetirement.\nBy 1968, Warren was ready to retire from the Court. He hoped to travel the world with his wife, and he wanted to leave the bench before he suffered a mental decline, something that he perceived in both Hugo Black and William Douglas. He also feared that Nixon would win the 1968 presidential election and appoint a conservative successor if Warren left the Court later. On June 13, 1968, Warren submitted his letter of resignation to President Johnson (who made it official on June 21), effective upon the confirmation of a successor. In an election year, confirmation of a successor was not assured; after Warren announced his retirement, about half of the Senate Republican caucus pledged to oppose any Supreme Court appointment prior to the election.\nJohnson nominated Associate Justice Fortas, a personal friend and adviser to the president, as Warren's successor, and nominated federal appellate judge Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas. Republicans and Southern Democrats joined to scuttle Fortas's nomination. Their opposition centered on criticism of the Warren Court, including many decisions that had been handed down before Fortas joined the Court, as well as ethical concerns related to Fortas's paid speeches and closeness with Johnson. Though the majority of the Senate may have favored the confirmation of Fortas, opponents conducted a filibuster, which blocked the Senate from voting on the nomination, and Johnson withdrew the nomination. In early 1969, Warren learned that Fortas had made a secret lifetime contract for $20,000 a year to provide private legal advice to Louis Wolfson, a friend and financier in deep legal trouble. Warren immediately asked Fortas to resign, which he did after some consideration.\nNixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 presidential election and took office in January 1969. Though reluctant to be succeeded by a Nixon appointee, Warren declined to withdraw his letter of resignation. He believed that withdrawing the letter would be \"a crass admission that he was resigning for political reasons.\" Nixon and Warren jointly agreed that Warren would retire in June 1969 to ensure that the Court would have a chief justice throughout the 1968 term and to allow Nixon to focus on other matters in the first months of his presidency. Nixon did not solicit Warren's opinion regarding the next chief justice and ultimately appointed the conservative federal appellate judge Warren E. Burger. Warren later regretted his decision to retire and reflected, \"If I had ever known what was going to happen to this country and this Court, I never would have resigned. They would have had to carry me out of there on a plank.\" In addition, he later remarked on his retirement and on the Warren Court, \"I would like the Court to be remembered as the people's court.\"\nFinal years and death.\nAfter stepping down from the Court, Warren began working on his memoirs and took numerous speaking engagements. He also advocated for an end to the Vietnam War and the elimination of poverty. He avoided publicly criticizing the Burger Court, but was privately distressed by the Court's increasingly conservative holdings. He closely followed investigations into the Watergate scandal, a major political scandal that stemmed from a break-in of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters and the Nixon administration's subsequent attempts to cover up that break-in. Warren continued to hold Nixon in low regard, privately stating that Nixon was \"perhaps the most despicable president that this country has ever had.\"\nFive years into retirement, Warren died due to cardiac arrest at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., at 8:10\u00a0p.m. on July 9, 1974, at the age of 83. He had been hospitalized since July 2 due to congestive heart failure and coronary insufficiency. On that same day, he was visited by Justices Brennan and Douglas, until 5:30\u00a0p.m. Warren could not resist asking his friends whether the Court would order President Nixon to release the sixty-four tapes demanded by the Watergate investigation. Both justices assured him that the court had voted unanimously in \"United States v. Nixon\" for the release of the tapes. Relieved, Warren died just a few hours later, safe in the knowledge that the Court he had so loved would force justice on the man who had been his most bitter foe.\nWarren had his wife and one of his daughters, Nina Elizabeth Brien, at his bedside when he died. After he lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building, his funeral was held at Washington National Cathedral, and he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. The only other former governor of California whose final funeral services did not take place in California would be Ronald Reagan, who became President of the United States and whose final funeral service also took place at Washington National Cathedral.\nLegacy.\nHistorical reputation.\nWarren is generally considered to be one of the most influential U.S. Supreme Court justices, as well as political leaders in the history of the United States. The Warren Court has been recognized by many to have created a liberal \"Constitutional Revolution\", which embodied a deep belief in equal justice, freedom, democracy, and human rights. In July 1974, after Warren died, the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented that \"Mr. Warren ranked with John Marshall and Roger Taney as one of the three most important chief justices in the nation's history.\" In December 2006, \"The Atlantic\" cited Earl Warren as the 29th most influential person in the history of the United States and the second most influential Chief Justice, after John Marshall. In September 2018, \"The Economist\" named Warren as \"the 20th century's most consequential American jurist\" and one of \"the 20th century's greatest liberal jurists\".\nPresident Harry S. Truman wrote in his tribute to Warren, which appeared in the \"California Law Review\" in 1970, \"[t]he Warren record as Chief Justice has stamped him in the annals of history as the man who read and interpreted the Constitution in relation to its ultimate intent. He sensed the call of the times-and he rose to the call.\" Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas wrote, in the same article, \"in my view [Warren] will rank with Marshall and Hughes in the broad sweep of United States history\". According to biographer Ed Cray, Warren was \"second in greatness only to John Marshall himself in the eyes of most impartial students of the Court as well as the Court's critics.\" Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Lewis described Warren as \"the closest thing the United States has had to a Platonic Guardian\". In 1958, Martin Luther King Jr. sent one copy of his newly published book, \"Stride Toward Freedom\", to Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing on the first free end page: \"To: Justice Earl Warren. In appreciation for your genuine good-will, your great humanitarian concern, and your unswerving devotion to the sublime principles of our American democracy. With warm Regards, Martin L. King Jr.\" The book remained with Warren's family until 2015, when it was auctioned online for US$49,335 (including the buyer's premium).\nWarren's critics found him a boring person. Dennis J. Hutchinson wrote: \"Although Warren was an important and courageous figure and although he inspired passionate devotion among his followers...he was a dull man and a dull judge.\" Conservatives attacked the Warren Court's rulings as inappropriate and have called for courts to be deferential to the elected political branches. In his 1977 book \"Government by Judiciary\", originalist and legal scholar Raoul Berger accuses the Warren Court of overstepping its authority by interpreting the 14th Amendment in a way contrary to the original intent of its draftsmen and framers in order to achieve results that it found desirable as a matter of public policy.\nOverall, law professor Justin Driver divides interpretations of the Warren Court into three main groups: conservatives such as Robert Bork who attack the Court as \"a legislator of policy...that was not theirs to make\", liberals such as Morton Horwitz who strongly approve of the Court, and liberals such as Cass Sunstein who largely approve of the Court's overall legacy but believe that it went too far in making policy in some cases. Driver offers a little-known fourth view, arguing that the Warren Court took overly conservative stances in such cases as \"Powell v. Texas\" and \"Hoyt v. Florida\". As for the legacy of the Warren Court, Chief Justice Burger, who succeeded Earl Warren in 1969, proved to be quite ineffective at consolidating conservative control over the Court, so the Warren Court legacy continued in many respects until about 1986, when William Rehnquist became chief justice and took firmer control of the agenda. Even the more conservative Rehnquist Court refrained from expressly overturning major Warren Court cases such as \"Miranda\", \"Gideon\", \"Brown v. Board of Education\", and \"Reynolds v. Sims\". On occasion, the Rehnquist Court expanded Warren Court precedents, such as in \"Bush v. Gore\", where the Rehnquist Court applied the principles of 1960s voting rights cases to invalidate Florida's recount in the 2000 U.S. presidential election.\nMemorials and honors.\nEarl Warren was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1981. He was also honored by the United States Postal Service with a 29\u00a2 Great Americans series postage stamp. In December 2007, Warren was inducted into the California Hall of Fame. An extensive collection of Warren's papers, including case files from his Supreme Court service, is located at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Most of the collection is open for research.\nOn the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, Warren's alma mater, \"Earl Warren Hall\" is named after him. In addition, the UC Berkeley School of Law has established \"The Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity\", or \"Warren Institute\" for short, in memory of Earl Warren, while the \"Warren Room\" inside the Law Building was also named in his honor.\nIn 2016 the United States Navy named the support ship in his honour.\nA number of governmental and educational institutions have been named for Warren:\nElectoral history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Earl Warren electoral history\nCalifornia Republican presidential primary, 1936:\n1936 Republican presidential primaries:\nRepublican primary for Governor of California, 1942:\nDemocratic primary for Governor of California, 1942:\nCalifornia gubernatorial election, 1942:\nCalifornia Republican presidential primary, 1944\n1944 Republican presidential primaries:\nRepublican primary for Governor of California, 1946:\nDemocratic primary for Governor of California, 1946:\nCalifornia gubernatorial election, 1946:\n1948 Republican presidential primaries:\n1948 Republican National Convention (Presidential tally)\n1948 Republican National Convention (Vice Presidential tally):\n1948 United States presidential election\nCalifornia gubernatorial election, 1950:\n1952 Republican presidential primaries:\n1952 Republican National Convention (1st ballot)\n1952 Republican National Convention (2nd ballot)\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

{"id": "71917", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71917", "title": "Natural Color System", "text": "Proprietary perceptual color model\nThe Natural Colour System (NCS) is a proprietary perceptual color model. It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders H\u00e5rd, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception as opposed to color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.\nDefinition.\nThe NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision\u2014which might coincide with the psychological primaries\u2014as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g., a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.\nColors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (\"s\", = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (\"c\", = relative visual similarity to the \"strongest\", most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (\"\u03a6\", = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e., there is no \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\". The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (\"w\"). Achromatic colors, i.e., colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital \"N\"; for example, \u2003 \"NCS S 9000-N\" (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital \"S\", which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.\nIn summary, the NCS color notation for \u2003 S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.\n formula_1\nwith\n formula_2\nSaturation and lightness.\nIn addition to the above values \"s\" (blackness), \"w\" (whiteness), \"c\" (chromaticness) and \"\u03a6\" (hue), the NCS system can also describe the two perceptual quantities saturation and lightness. NCS saturation (\"m\") refers to a color's relation between its chromaticness and whiteness (regardless of hue), defined as the ratio between the chromaticness and the sum of its whiteness and chromaticness formula_3. The NCS saturation ranges between 0 and 1.\nFor the example color of S 2030-Y90R, the saturation is calculated as \n formula_4\nNCS lightness (\"v\") is a color's perceptual characteristic to contain more of the achromatic elementary colors black or white than another color. NCS lightness values varies from 0 for the elementary color black (S) to 1 for the elementary color white (W). For achromatic colors, that is any black, gray or white with no chromatic component (\"c\" = 0), lightness is defined as \n formula_5\nFor chromatic colors, the NCS lightness is determined by comparing the chromatic color to a reference scale of achromatic colors (\"c\" = 0), and is determined to have the same lightness value \"v\" as the sample on the reference scale to which it has the least noticeable edge-to-edge difference.\nExamples.\nTwo examples of NCS color notation\u2014the yellow and blue shades of the Swedish flag:\nThe NCS is represented in nineteen countries and is the reference norm for color designation in Sweden (since 1979), Norway (since 1984), Spain (since 1994) and South Africa (since 2004). It is also one of the standards used by the International Colour Authority, a leading publisher of color trend forecasts for the interior design and textile markets.\nNCS 1950 Standard Colors.\nIn order to be able to manufacture physical representations of the NCS color space (such as color atlases), a reduced set of colors had to be selected that would illustrate the system well. Originally developed in 1979 as part of becoming the Swedish national color standard by the SIS (Swedish Standards Institute), the Natural Color System was described in an atlas containing 1412 colors. In 1984, an additional 118 colors were added for a total of 1530 colors. Eleven years later, in 1995, a second edition of the NCS Color Samples was released containing 1750 standard colors. In 2004, 200 more colors (184 light colors and 16 in the blue-green space) were added, resulting in the NCS 1950 standard colors. Colors that have a representation in the NCS 1950 samples are denoted with a leading capital \"S\", for example \u2003 NCS S 1070-Y10R (a chromatic, slightly reddish yellow).\nComparisons to other color systems.\nThe most important difference between NCS and most other color systems resides in their starting points. The aim of NCS is to define colors from their visual appearance, as they are experienced by human consciousness. Other color models, such as CMYK and RGB, are based on an understanding of physical processes, how colors can be achieved or \"made\" in different media.\nAccording to the opponent process hypothesis, the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in color opponency include the bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina, which process the signal originated by the retinal cones before it is sent to the brain. Models like RGB are based on what happens at the lower, retinal cone level, and thus are fitted for presenting self-illuminated, dynamic images as done by TV sets and computer displays; see additive color. The NCS model, for its part, describes the organization of the color sensations as perceived at the upper, brain level, and thus is much better fitted than RGB to deal with how humans experience and describe their color sensations (hence the \"natural\" part of its name). More problematic is the relation with the CMYK-model which is generally seen as a correct prediction of the behavior of mixing pigments, as a system of subtractive color. The NCS coincides with the CMYK as regards the green-yellow-red segment of the color circle, but differs from it in seeing the saturated subtractive primary colors magenta and cyan as complex sensations of a \"redblue\" and a \"greenblue\" respectively and in seeing green, not as a secondary color mix of yellow and cyan, but as a unique hue. The NCS explains this by assuming that the behavior of paint is partly counterintuitive to human phenomenology. Observing that the mix of yellow and \"greenblue\" (cyan) paint results in a green color, would thus be at odds with the intuition of human perception, because green would be perceived as an elementary hue while yellow and the presumed blue component of \"greenblue\" are by the NCS considered to be mutually excluding percepts.\nHering argued that yellow is not a \"redgreen\" but a unique hue. Colorimetrist Jan Koenderink, in a critique of Hering's system, considered it inconsistent not to apply the same argument to the other two subtractive primaries (or additive secondaries), cyan and magenta, and see them as unique hues as well, not a \"greenblue\" or a \"redblue\". He also pointed out the difficulty within a four-color theory that the primaries would not be equally spaced in the color circle; and the problem that Hering does not account for the fact that cyan and magenta are lighter than green, blue and red, whereas this is, in his view, elegantly explained within the CMYK-model. He concluded that Hering's scheme fitted common language better than color experience.\nOverview of the six base colors in Natural Colour System with their equivalent in hex triplet, RGB and HSV coordinates systems.

{"id": "71920", "revid": "13791031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71920", "title": "House of Orange-Nassau", "text": "European dynasty of German and Dutch origin\nThe House of Orange-Nassau (, ), also known as the House of Orange or rarely the Fourth House of Orange in comparison with the other noble houses that held the Principality of Orange, is the current reigning house of the Netherlands. A branch of the European House of Nassau, the house has played a central role in the politics and government of the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, particularly since William the Silent organised the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, which after the Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648) led to an independent Dutch state. William III of Orange led the resistance of the Netherlands and Europe to Louis XIV of France and orchestrated the Glorious Revolution in England that established parliamentary rule. Similarly, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was instrumental in the Dutch resistance during World War II.\nSeveral members of the house served during the Eighty Years war and after as stadtholder (\"governor\"; Dutch: \"stadhouder\") during the Dutch Republic. However, in 1815, after a long period as a republic, the Netherlands became a monarchy under the House of Orange-Nassau.\nThe dynasty was established as a result of the marriage of Henry III of Nassau-Breda from Germany and Claudia of Chalon-Orange from French Burgundy in 1515. Their son Ren\u00e9 of Chalon inherited in 1530 the independent and sovereign Principality of Orange from his mother's brother, Philibert of Chalon. As the first Nassau to be the Prince of Orange, Ren\u00e9 could have used \"Orange-Nassau\" as his new family name. However, his uncle, in his will, had stipulated that Ren\u00e9 should continue the use of the name Chalon-Orange. After Ren\u00e9's death in 1544, his cousin William of Nassau-Dillenburg inherited all of his lands. This \"William I of Orange\", in English better known as William the Silent, became the founder of the House of Orange-Nassau.\nOrigins.\nNassau Castle was founded around 1100 by Dudo, Count of Laurenburg, the founder of the House of Nassau. In 1120, Dudo's sons and successors, Counts Rupert I and Arnold I, established themselves at Nassau Castle, taking for themselves the title \"Count of Nassau\". In 1255 the Nassau possessions were split between Walram and Otto, the sons of Count Henry II. The descendants of Walram were known as the Walram Line, and they became Dukes of Nassau and, in 1890, Grand Dukes of Luxembourg. This line also included Adolph of Nassau, who was elected King of the Romans in 1292. The descendants of Otto became known as the Ottonian Line, and they inherited parts of the County of Nassau, as well as properties in France and the Netherlands.\nThe House of Orange-Nassau stems from the younger Ottonian Line. The first of this line to establish himself in the Netherlands was John I, Count of Nassau-Siegen, who married Margaret of the Mark. The real founder of the Nassau fortunes in the Netherlands was John's son, Engelbert I. He became counsellor to the Burgundian Dukes of Brabant, first to Anton of Burgundy, and later to his son Jan IV of Brabant. He also would later serve Philip the Good. In 1403, he married the Dutch noblewoman Johanna van Polanen and so inherited lands in the Netherlands, with the Barony of Breda as the core of the Dutch possessions and the family fortune.\nA nobleman's power was often based on his ownership of vast tracts of land and lucrative offices. It also helped that much of the lands that the House of Orange-Nassau controlled sat under one of the commercial and mercantile centres of the world (see below under Lands and Titles). The importance of the family grew throughout the 15th and 16th centuries as they became councilors, generals and stadholders of the Habsburgs (see and list of knights of the Golden Fleece). Engelbert II of Nassau served Charles the Bold and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, who had married Charles's daughter Mary of Burgundy. In 1496, he was appointed stadtholder of Flanders and by 1498 he had been named President of the Grand Conseil. In 1501, Maximilian named him Lieutenant-General of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. From that point forward (until his death in 1504), Engelbert was the principal representative of the Habsburg Empire to the region. Hendrik III of Nassau-Breda was appointed stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland by Charles of Ghent in the beginning of the 16th century. Hendrik was succeeded by his son Ren\u00e9 of Chalon in 1538, who had inherited the title of Prince of Orange and the principality of that name from his maternal uncle Philibert of Chalon. In 1544, Ren\u00e9 died in battle aged 25. His possessions, including the principality and title, passed by his will as sovereign prince to his paternal cousin, William I of Orange. From then on, the family members called themselves \"Orange-Nassau.\"\nEighty Years' War.\nAlthough Charles V pretended to resist the Protestant Reformation, he ruled the Dutch territories wisely with moderation and regard for local customs, and he did not persecute his Protestant subjects on a large scale. His son Philip II inherited his antipathy for the Protestants but not his moderation. Under the reign of Philip, a true persecution of Protestants was initiated and taxes were raised to an outrageous level. Discontent arose and William of Orange (with his vague Lutheran childhood) stood up for the Protestant (mainly Calvinist) inhabitants of the Netherlands. Things went badly after the Eighty Years' War started in 1568, but luck turned to his advantage when Protestant rebels attacking from the North Sea captured Brielle, a coastal town in present-day South Holland in 1572. Many cities in Holland began to support William. During the 1570s he had to defend his core territories in Holland several times, but in the 1580s the inland cities in Holland were secure. William of Orange was considered a threat to Spanish rule in the area and was assassinated in 1584 by a hired killer sent by Philip.\nWilliam was succeeded by his second son Maurits, a Protestant who proved an excellent military commander. His abilities as a commander and the lack of strong leadership in Spain after the death of Philip II (1598) gave Maurits excellent opportunities to conquer large parts of the present-day Dutch territory. In 1585 Maurits was elected stadtholder of the provinces of Holland and Zealand as his father's successor and as a counterpose to Elizabeth's delegate, the Earl of Leicester. In 1587 he was appointed captain-general (military commander-in-chief) of the armies of the Dutch Republic. In the early years of the 17th century, there arose quarrels between stadtholder and oligarchist regents\u2014a group of powerful merchants led by Johan van Oldebarnevelt\u2014because Maurits wanted more powers in the Republic. Maurits won this power struggle by arranging the judicial murder of Oldebarnevelt.\n17th century.\nExpansion of dynastic power.\nMaurice died unmarried in 1625 and left no legitimate children. He was succeeded by his half-brother Frederick Henry (Dutch: \"Frederik Hendrik\"), youngest son of William I. Maurits urged his successor on his deathbed to marry as soon as possible. A few weeks after Maurits's death, he married Amalia van Solms-Braunfels.\nFrederick Henry and Amalia were the parents of a son and several daughters. These daughters were married to important noble houses such as the house of Hohenzollern, but also to the Frisian Nassaus, who were stadtholders in Friesland. His only son, William, married Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the eldest daughter of Charles I of England. These dynastic moves were the work of Amalia.\nExile and resurgence.\nFrederick Henry died in 1647 and his son succeeded him. As the Treaty of Munster was about to be signed, thereby ending the Eighty Years' War, William tried to maintain the powers he had in wartime as military commander. These would necessarily be diminished in peacetime as the army would be reduced, along with his income. This met with great opposition from the regents. When Andries Bicker and Cornelis de Graeff, the great regents of the city of Amsterdam refused some mayors he appointed, he besieged Amsterdam. The siege provoked the wrath of the regents. William died of smallpox on November 6, 1650, leaving only a posthumous son, William III (*November 14, 1650). Since the Prince of Orange upon the death of William II, William III, was an infant, the regents used this opportunity to leave the stadtholdership vacant. This inaugurated the era in Dutch history that is known as the First Stadtholderless Period. A quarrel about the education of the young prince arose between his mother and his grandmother Amalia (who outlived her husband by 28 years). Amalia wanted an education which was pointed at the resurgence of the House of Orange to power, but Mary wanted a pure English education. The Estates of Holland, under Jan de Witt and Cornelis de Graeff, meddled in the education and made William a \"child of state\" to be educated by the state. The doctrine used in this education was keeping William from the throne. William became indeed very docile to the wishes of the regents and the Estates.\nThe Dutch Republic was attacked by France and England in 1672. The military function of stadtholder was no longer superfluous, and with the support of the Orangists, William was restored, and he became the stadtholder. William successfully repelled the invasion and seized royal power. He became more powerful than his predecessors from the Eighty Years' War. In 1677, William married his cousin Mary Stuart, the daughter of the future king James II of England. In 1688, William embarked on a mission to depose his Catholic father-in-law from the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. He and his wife were crowned the King and Queen of England on April 11, 1689. With the accession to the thrones of the three kingdoms, he became one of the most powerful sovereigns in Europe, and the only one to defeat Louis XIV of France. William III died childless after a riding accident on March 8, 1702, leaving the main male line of the House of Orange extinct, and leaving Scotland, England and Ireland to his sister-in-law Queen Anne.\nPosition in the Dutch Republic in the 17th century.\nThe house of Orange-Nassau was relatively unlucky in establishing a hereditary dynasty in an age that favoured hereditary rule. The Stuarts and the Bourbons came to power at the same time as the Oranges, the Vasas and Oldenburgs were able to establish a hereditary kingship in Sweden and Denmark, and the Hohenzollerns were able to set themselves on a course to the rule of Germany. The House of Orange was no less gifted than those houses, in fact, some might argue more so, as their ranks included some the foremost statesmen and captains of the time. A 104 years separated the death of William the Silent from the accession of his great-grandson, William III, as King of England. Although the institutions of the United Provinces became more republican and entrenched as time went on, William the Silent had been offered the countship of Holland and Zealand, and only his assassination prevented his accession to those offices. This fact did not go unforgotten by his successors.\nThe Prince of Orange was also not just another noble among equals in the Netherlands. First, he was the traditional leader of the nation in war and in rebellion against Spain. He was uniquely able to transcend the local issues of the cities, towns and provinces. He was also a sovereign ruler in his own right (see Prince of Orange article). This gave him a great deal of prestige, even in a republic. He was the center of a real court like the Stuarts and Bourbons, French speaking, and extravagant to a scale. It was natural for foreign ambassadors and dignitaries to present themselves to him and consult with him as well as to the States General to which they were officially credited. The marriage policy of the princes, allying themselves twice with the Royal Stuarts, also gave them acceptance into the royal caste of rulers.\nBesides showing the relationships among the family, the family tree below also points out an extraordinary run of bad luck. In the 211 years from the death of William the Silent to the conquest by France, there was only one time that a son directly succeeded his father as Prince of Orange, Stadholder and Captain-General without a minority (William II). When the Oranges were in power, they also tended to settle for the actualities of power, rather than the appearances, which increasingly tended to upset the ruling regents of the towns and cities. On being offered the dukedom of Gelderland by the States of that province, William III let the offer lapse as liable to raise too much opposition in the other provinces.\nThe house of Orange was also related by marriage to several of these key European dynasties of the time, Stuart, Bourbon, and Palatine, Hannover and Hohenzollern. These alliances had consequences for all of them. William III used his double relationship with the Stuarts to justify his co-equal status with his wife on the English throne after the Glorious Revolution. As an arri\u00e8re petit fils de France, albeit in the female line, he felt doubly insulted by his cousin Louis XIV's occupation and seizure of his sovereign principality of Orange. His death without children of his own ensured the passing of Orange to a Dutch cousin and years of squabbles over the same, while securing the British throne to the more distantly related House of Hanover.\n18th century.\nSecond Stadtholderless period.\nThe regents found that they had suffered under the powerful leadership of William III as the ruler of the Netherlands and king in the British Isles and they left the stadtholdership vacant for the second time. As William III died childless in 1702 the principality became a matter of dispute between Prince John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz of the Frisian Nassaus and King Frederick I of Prussia, who both claimed the title Prince of Orange. Both descended from Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. The King of Prussia was his grandson through his mother, Countess Luise Henriette of Nassau. Frederick Henry in his will had appointed this line as successor in case the main House of Orange-Nassau were to die out. John William Friso was a great-grandson of Frederick Henry (through Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau, another daughter) and was appointed heir in William III's will. The principality was captured by the forces of King Louis XIV of France under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil, Count of Grignan, in the Franco-Dutch War in 1672, and again in August 1682. With the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the wars of Louis XIV, the territory was formally ceded to France by Frederick I in 1713. John William Friso drowned in 1711 in the Hollands Diep near Moerdijk, and he left his posthumously born son William IV, Prince of Orange. That son succeeded at that time his father as stadtholder in Friesland (as the stadtholdership had been hereditary in that province since 1664), and Groningen. William IV was also proclaimed the stadtholder of Guelders in 1722. When the French invaded Holland in 1747, William IV was appointed stadtholder in Holland, Zeeland, Overijssel and Utrecht as well in the Orangist revolution. The position of stadtholder was made hereditary in both the male and the female lines in all provinces at the same time.\nHereditary territories in Germany.\nAfter the Nassau-Dietz branch took over, the House of Orange-Nassau had acquired the following territories by the end of the 18th century in the Holy Roman Empire, located in present-day Germany:\nAround 1742, William IV of Orange established the Hochdeutsche Hofdepartement, an administrative centre located in The Hague inside the Dutch Republic, which looked after the family's possessions in Germany.\nEnd of the stadtholdership.\nWilliam IV died in 1751, leaving his three-year-old son, William V, as the stadtholder. Since William V was still a minor, the regents reigned for him. He grew up to be an indecisive person, a character defect which would come to haunt William V his whole life.\nHis marriage to Wilhelmina of Prussia relieved this defect to some degree. In 1787, Willem V survived an attempt to depose him by the Patriots (anti-Orangist revolutionaries) after the Kingdom of Prussia intervened. When the French invaded Holland in 1795, William V was forced into exile, and he was never to return alive to Holland.\nAfter 1795, the House of Orange-Nassau faced a difficult period, surviving in exile at other European courts, especially those of Prussia and Britain. Following the recognition of the Batavian Republic by the 1801 Oranienstein Letters, William V's son William VI renounced the stadtholdership in 1802. In return, he received a few territories like the Free Imperial City of Dortmund, Corvey Abbey and Diocese of Fulda from First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte of the French Republic (Treaty of Amiens), which was established as the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. William V died in 1806.\nMonarchy since 1813.\nUnited Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter a repressed Dutch rebel action, Prussian and Cossack troops drove out the French in 1813. A provisional government was formed, some of those members had helped drive out William V 18 years earlier. However, they were realistic enough to accept that any new government would have to be headed by William V's son, William Frederick (William VI). All agreed that it would be better in the long term for the Dutch to restore William themselves rather than have him imposed by the allies.\nAt the invitation of the provisional government, William Frederick returned to the Netherlands on November 30. This move was strongly supported by the United Kingdom, which sought ways to strengthen the Netherlands and deny future French aggressors easy access to the Low Countries' Channel ports. The provisional government offered William the crown. He refused, believing that a stadholdership would give him more power. Thus, on December 6, William proclaimed himself hereditary sovereign prince of the Netherlands\u2014something between a kingship and a stadholdership. In 1814, he was awarded sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge as well. On March 15, 1815, with the support of the powers gathered at the Congress of Vienna, William proclaimed himself King William I. He was also made grand duke of Luxembourg, and (to assuage French sensitivity by distancing the title from the now-defunct principality) the title 'Prince of Orange' was changed to 'Prince of Oranje'.\nThe two countries remained separate, though they shared a common monarch via a personal union. William had thus fulfilled the House of Orange's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries.\nThe institution of the monarch in the Netherlands is considered an office under the Constitution of the Netherlands. There are none of the religious connotations to the office as in some other monarchies. A Dutch sovereign is inaugurated rather than crowned in a coronation ceremony. It was initially more of a crowned/hereditary presidency, and a continuation of the status quo ante of the pre-1795 hereditary stadholderate in the Republic. In practice, the current monarch has considerably less power than the stadtholder.\nAs king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, William tried to establish one common culture. This provoked resistance in the southern parts of the country, which had been culturally separate from the north since 1581. He was considered an enlightened despot.\nThe Prince of Orange held rights to Nassau lands (Dillenburg, Dietz, Beilstein, Hadamar, Siegen) in central Germany. On the other hand, the King of Prussia, Frederick William III\u2014brother-in-law and first cousin of William I, had beginning from 1813 managed to establish his rule in Luxembourg, which he regarded as his inheritance from Anne, Duchess of Luxembourg who had died over three centuries earlier. At the Congress of Vienna, the two brothers-in-law agreed to a trade\u2014Frederick William received William I's ancestral lands while William I received Luxembourg. Both got what was geographically nearer to their centre of power.\nIn 1830, most of the southern portion of William's realm\u2014the former Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric\u2014declared independence as Belgium. William fought a disastrous war until 1839 when he was forced to settle for peace. With his realm halved, he decided to abdicate in 1840 in favour of his son, William II. Although William II shared his father's conservative inclinations, in 1848 he accepted an amended constitution that significantly curbed his own authority and transferred the real power to the States General. He took this step to prevent the Revolutions of 1848 from spreading to his country.\nWilliam III and the risk of extinction.\nWilliam II died in 1849. He was succeeded by his son, William III. A rather conservative, even reactionary man, William III was sharply opposed to the new 1848 constitution. He continually tried to form governments that were dependent on his support, even though it was prohibitively difficult for a government to stay in office against the will of Parliament. In 1868, he tried to sell Luxembourg to France, which was the source of a quarrel between Prussia and France.\nWilliam III had a rather unhappy marriage with Sophie of W\u00fcrttemberg, and his heirs died young. This raised the possibility of the extinction of the House of Orange-Nassau. After the death of Queen Sophie in 1877, William remarried to 20-year-old Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1879; he was 41 years older than her. On 31 August 1880, Queen Emma gave birth to their daughter and the royal heiress, Wilhelmina. There were considerably more concerns over the royal dynasty's future, when Wilhelmina's marriage with Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1901) repeatedly resulted in miscarriages. Had the House of Orange died out, the throne would likely have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of K\u00f6stritz, leading the Netherlands into an undesirably strong influence from the German Empire that would threaten Dutch independence. Not just Socialists, but now also Anti-Revolutionary politicians including Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper and Liberals such as Samuel van Houten advocated the restoration of the Republic in Parliament in case the marriage remained childless. The birth of Princess Juliana in 1909 put the question to rest.\nMonarchy in modern times.\nWilhelmina was queen of the Netherlands for 58 years, from 1890 to 1948. Because she was only 10 years old in 1890, her mother, Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, was the regent until Wilhelmina's 18th birthday in 1898. Since females were not allowed to hold power in Luxembourg, due to Salic law, Luxembourg passed to the House of Nassau-Weilburg, a collateral line to the House of Orange-Nassau. For a time, it appeared that the Dutch royal family would die with Wilhelmina. Her half-brother, Prince Alexander, had died in 1884, and no royal babies were born from then until Wilhelmina gave birth to her only child, Juliana, in 1909. The Dutch royal house remained quite small until the later 1930s and the early 1940s, during which time Juliana gave birth to four daughters. Although the House of Orange died out in its male line with the death of Queen Wilhelmina, it continued in the female line as can be seen in other modern European monarchies, the name \"Orange\" continues to be used by the Dutch royalty and as evidenced in many patriotic songs, such as \"Oranje boven\".\nThe Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, during her reign, and the country was not invaded by Germany, as neighbouring Belgium was.\nNevertheless, Queen Wilhelmina became a symbol of the Dutch resistance during World War II. The moral authority of the Monarchy was restored because of her rule. After 58 years on the throne as the Queen, Wilhelmina decided to abdicate in favour of her daughter, Juliana. Juliana had the reputation of making the monarchy less \"aloof\", and under her reign the Monarchy became known as the \"cycling monarchy\". Members of the royal family were often seen riding bicycles through the cities and the countryside under Juliana.\nA royal marriage controversy occurred in 1966 when Juliana's eldest daughter, the future Queen Beatrix, decided to marry Claus von Amsberg, a German diplomat. The marriage of a member of the royal family to a German was quite controversial in the Netherlands, which had suffered under Nazi German occupation in 1940\u201345. This reluctance to accept a German consort probably was exacerbated by von Amsberg's former membership in the Hitler Youth under the Nazi regime in his native country, and also his following service in the German Wehrmacht. Beatrix needed permission from the government to marry anyone if she wanted to remain heiress to the throne, but after some argument, it was granted. As the years went by, Prince Claus was fully accepted by the Dutch people. In time, he became one of the most popular members of the Dutch monarchy, and his death in 2002 was widely mourned.\nOn April 30, 1980, Queen Juliana abdicated in favour of her daughter, Beatrix. In the early years of the twenty-first century, the Dutch monarchy remained popular with a large part of the population. Beatrix's eldest son, Willem-Alexander, was born on April 27, 1967; the first immediate male heir to the Dutch throne since the death of his great-granduncle, Prince Alexander, in 1884. Willem-Alexander married M\u00e1xima Zorreguieta, an Argentine banker, in 2002; the first commoner ever to marry an heir apparent to the Dutch throne. They are parents of three daughters: Catharina-Amalia, Alexia, and Ariane. After a long struggle with neurological illness, Queen Juliana died on March 20, 2004, and her husband, Prince Bernhard, died on December 1 of that same year.\nUpon Beatrix's abdication on April 30, 2013, the Prince of Orange was inaugurated as King Willem-Alexander, becoming the Netherlands' first male ruler since 1890. His eldest daughter, Catharina-Amalia, as heiress apparent to the throne, became Princess of Orange in her own right.\nNet worth.\nUnlike other royal houses, there has always been a separation in the Netherlands between what was owned by the state and used by the House of Orange in their offices as monarch, or previously, stadtholder, and the personal investments and fortune of the House of Orange.\nAs monarch, the King or Queen has use of, but not ownership of, the Huis ten Bosch as a residence and Noordeinde Palace as a work palace. In addition, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam is also at the disposal of the monarch (although it is only used for state visits and is open to the public when not in use for that purpose). Soestdijk Palace was sold to private investors in 2017.\nThe crown jewels, comprising the crown, orb and sceptre, Sword of State, royal banner, and ermine mantle have been placed in the Crown Property Trust. The trust also holds the items used on ceremonial occasions, such as the carriages, table silver, and dinner services. The Royal House is also exempt from income, inheritance, and personal tax.\nThe House of Orange has long had the reputation of being one of the wealthier royal houses in the world, largely due to their business investments in Royal Dutch Shell, Philips electronics company, KLM-Royal Dutch Airlines, and the Holland-America Line. How significant these investments are is a matter of conjecture, as their private finances, unlike their public stipends as monarch, are not open to public scrutiny.\nAs late as 2001, the fortune of the Royal Family was estimated by various sources (\"Forbes\" magazine) at $3.2 billion. Most of the wealth was reported to come from the family's longstanding stake in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. At one time, the Oranges reportedly owned as much as 25% of the oil company; their stake is in 2001 was estimated at a minimum of 2%, worth $2.7 billion on the May 21 cutoff date for the Billionaires issue. The family also was estimated to have a 1% stake in financial services firm ABN-AMRO.\nThe royal family's fortune seems to have been hit by declines in real estate and equities after 2008. They were also rumored to have lost up to $100 million when Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme collapsed, though the royal house denies the allegations. In 2009, \"Forbes\" estimated Queen Beatrix's wealth at US$300 million. This could also have been due to splitting the fortune between Queen Beatrix and her 3 sisters, as there is no right of the eldest to inherit the whole property. A surge in export revenue, recovery in real estate and strong stock market have helped steady the royal family's fortunes, but uncertainty over the new government and future austerity measures needed to bring budget deficits in line may dampen future prospects. In July 2010, \"Forbes\" magazine estimated her net worth at $200 million This estimate was unchanged in April 2011.\nList of rulers.\nStadtholderate under the House of Orange-Nassau.\n&lt;section begin=\"Stadtholderate under the House of Orange-Nassau\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Stadtholderate under the House of Orange-Nassau\" /&gt;\nStadtholderate under the Houses of Nassau-Dillenburg and Nassau-Dietz.\nNote:\n&lt;section begin=\"Stadtholderate under the House of Nassau\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Stadtholderate under the House of Nassau\" /&gt;\nRoyal family versus royal house.\n \nUnder Dutch law, there is a distinction between the royal family and the Dutch royal house. Whereas 'royal family' refers to the entire Orange-Nassau family, only a small subgroup of it constitutes the royal house. By the Royal House Membership Act 2002, membership of the royal house is limited to:\nThe royal house and family is the Orange-Nassau family.\nMembers of the Royal House lose their membership (and thereby, designation as prince or princess of the Netherlands) if they lose the membership of the Royal House on the succession of a new monarch (not being in the second degree of sanguinity to the monarch anymore, Article 1a), or by royal decree approved by the Council of State (Article 5). This last scenario could happen, for example, if a royal house member marries without the consent of the Dutch Parliament. For example, this happened with Prince Friso in 2004, when he married Mabel Wisse Smit.\nFamily tree.\nOrigins of the Nassaus.\nThe lineage of the House of Nassau can be traced back to the 10th century.\nA detailed family tree can be found here. A detailed from the 15th century can be found on the Dutch Wikipedia at Dutch monarchs family tree.\nOrange and Nassau Family Tree.\nThe main house of Orange-Nassau also spawned several illegitimate branches. These branches contributed to the political and economic history of England and the Netherlands. Justinus van Nassau was the only extramarital child of William of Orange. He was a Dutch army commander known for unsuccessfully defending Breda against the Spanish, and the depiction of his surrender on the famous picture by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, \"The Surrender of Breda\". Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd was a younger illegitimate son of Prince Maurice and Margaretha van Mechelen. His descendants were later created Counts of Nassau-LaLecq. One of his sons was the famous general Henry de Nassau, Lord of Overkirk, King William III's Master of the Horse, and one of the most trusted generals of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. His descendants became the Earls of Grantham in England. Frederick van Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein, an illegitimate son of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, gave rise to the Earls of Rochford in England. The 4th earl of Rochford was a famous English diplomat and a statesman.\nRoyal House of Orange-Nassau.\nIn 1815, William VI of Orange became King of the Netherlands. This summary genealogical tree shows how the current Royal house of Orange-Nassau is related:\n&lt;section begin=FamilyTree /&gt;&lt;section end=FamilyTree /&gt;\nCoats of Arms.\nThe gallery below show the coats of arms used by members of the house of Orange-Nassau. Their growing complexity and use of crowns shows how arms are used to reflect the growing political position and royal aspirations of the family. A much more complete armorial is given at the Armorial of the House of Nassau, and another one at at the Dutch Wikipedia.\nThe ancestral coat of arms of the Ottonian line of the house of Nassau is shown right. Their distant cousins of the Walramian line added a red coronet to distinguish them. There is no specific documentation in the literature on the origin of the arms. The lion was always a popular noble symbol, originating as a symbol of nobility, power, and royal aspirations in western culture going all the way back to Hercules. The lion was also heavily used as a heraldic symbol in border territories and neighbouring countries of the Holy Roman Empire and France. It was in all likelihood a way of showing independence from the Holy Roman Emperor, who used an eagle in his personal arms and the King of France, who used the famous Fleur-de-lis. The lion was so heavily used in the Netherlands for various provinces and families (see Leo Belgicus) that it became the national arms of the Dutch Republic, its successor Kingdom of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Blue, because of its nearness to purple, which in the northern climes tended to fade (red was the other choice), was also a popular color for those with royal aspirations. The billets could have been anything from blocks of wood to abstractions of the reenforcements holding the shield together. The fact that these were arms were very similar to those of the counts of Burgundy (Franche-Comt\u00e9) did not seem to cause too much confusion.\nHenry III of Nassau-Breda came to the Netherlands in 1499 as heir to his uncle, Engelbrecht II of Nassau-Breda. His and his uncle's arms are shown below. When Philbert, prince of Orange died in 1530, his sister's son Ren\u00e9 of Breda inherited the Princedom of Orange on condition that he used the name and coat of arms of the Chalon-Orange family. History knows him therefore as Ren\u00e9 of Chalon instead of as \"Ren\u00e9 of Nassau-Breda.\" The 1st and 4th grand quarters show the arms of the Chalons-Arlay (the gold bend) princes of Orange (the bugle). The blue and gold cross is the arms of Jeanne of Geneva, who married one of the Chalons princes. The 2nd and 3rd show the quarterings of Brittany and Luxembourg-St. Pol. The inescutcheon overall is his paternal arms quartered of Nassau and Breda. William the Silent's father, William the Rich, was rich only in children. He bore the arms shown below. Clockwise from upper left they displayed the arms of Nassau (1st quarter), Katzenelenbogen (3rd quarter), Dietz (2nd quarter), Vianden (4th quarter).\nThe princes of Orange in the 16th and 17th century used the following sets of arms. On becoming prince of Orange, William placed the Chalon-Arlay arms in the center (\"as an inescutcheon\") of his father's arms. He used these arms until 1582 when he purchased the marquisate of Veere and Vlissingen. It had been the property of Philip II since 1567, but had fallen into arrears to the province. In 1580 the Court of Holland ordered it sold. William bought it as it gave him two more votes in the States of Zeeland. He owned the government of the two towns, and so could appoint their magistrates. He already had one as First Noble for Philip William, who had inherited Maartensdijk. This made William the predominant member of the States of Zeeland. It was a smaller version of the countship of Zeeland (&amp; Holland) promised to William, and was a potent political base for his descendants. William then added the shield of Veere and Buren to his arms as shown in the arms of Frederick Henry, William II and William III with the arms of the marquisate in the top center, and the arms of the county of Buren in the bottom center. William also started the tradition of keeping the number of billets in the upper left quarter for Nassau at 17 to symbolize the original 17 provinces of the Burgundian/Habsburg Netherlands, which he always hoped would form one united nation.\nWhen John William Friso became Prince of Orange, he used the arms below. However, he was never recognized outside of Holland and areas friendly to Holland as Prince of Orange. His son, William IV, recognized as Prince of Orange, seems to have used the original arms of William the Silent. When the princes of Orange fled the Netherlands during the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland, and when France occupied the Netherlands, they were compensated by Napoleon with the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. These principalities were confiscated when Napoleon invaded Germany (1806) and William VI supported his Prussian relatives. He succeeded his father as prince of Orange later that year, after William V's death. The house of Orange-Nassau also had several illegitimate lines (see below) who based their arms on the arms of Nassau-Dillenburg.\nWhen William VI of Orange returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and was proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands, he quartered the former Arms of the Dutch Republic (1st and 4th quarter) with the \"Chalon-Orange\" arms (2nd and 3rd quarter), which had come to symbolize Orange. As an in escutcheon he placed his ancestral arms of Nassau. When he became King in 1815, he combined the Dutch Republic Lion with the billets of the Nassau arms and added a royal crown to form the Coat of arms of the Netherlands. In 1907, Queen Wilhelmina replaced the royal crown on the lion and the shield bearers of the arms with a coronet.\nWilhelmina further decreed that in perpetuity her descendants should be styled \"princes and princesses of Orange-Nassau\" and that the name of the house would be \"Orange-Nassau\" (in Dutch \"Oranje-Nassau\"). Only those members of the members of the Dutch Royal Family that are designated to the smaller \"Royal House\" can use the title of prince or princess of the Netherlands. Since then, individual members of the House of Orange-Nassau are also given their own arms by the reigning monarch, similar to the United Kingdom. This is usually the royal arms, quartered with the arms of the principality of Orange, and an in escutcheon of their paternal arms.\nAs sovereign Princes, the princes of Orange used an independent prince's or the . Sometimes, only the coronet part was used (, and ). After the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and as the principality of Orange had been incorporated into France by Louis XIV, they used the Dutch Royal Crowns. The full coats of arms of the princes of Orange, later Kings of the Netherlands, incorporated the arms above, the crown, 2 lions as supporters and the motto \"Je maintiendrai\" (\"I will maintain\"), the latter taken from the Chalons princes of Orange, who used \"Je maintiendrai Chalons\".\nLands and titles.\nTitles.\n&lt;section begin=titles /&gt; \nBesides being sovereign over the principality of Orange , this is a partial listing of larger estates and titles that William the Silent and his heirs possessed, most enfeoffed to some other sovereign, either the King of France, the Habsburgs, or the States of the provinces of the Netherlands\nStyle of the Dutch sovereign:\nVianden , \nBuren , \nLeerdam , and \nCulemborg (1748) \nCranendonck , \nLands of Cuijk , \nEindhoven , \nCity of Grave , \nLek , \nIJsselstein ,\nAcquoy , \nDiest , \nGrimbergen /, \nHerstal , \nWarneton () , \nBentheim-Lingen , \nArlay , \nNozeroy , and\nOrpierre ; \nBredevoort , \nDasburg , \nGeertruidenberg, \nHooge en Lage Zwaluwe , \nKlundert, \n't Loo , \nMontfort, \nNaaldwijk , \nNiervaart, \nPolanen/lands of Polanen , \nSteenbergen , \nSint-Maartensdijk , \nTurnhout &amp; Zevenbergen ,\nWillemstad , \nB\u00fctgenbach, \nSankt Vith , and \nBesan\u00e7on\n&lt;section end=titles /&gt; \nA fuller listing with maps of the territories are in the Maps of the Lands of the House of Orange.\nStandards.\nThe Dutch Royal Family also makes extensive use of royal standards that are based on their coats of arms, but not identical to them (as the British Royal Family does). Some examples from the Royal Family's website are:\nThe standards of the ruling king or queen:\nThe standards of the current sons of the former Queen, now Princess Beatrix and their wives and the Queen's husband:\nA fuller listing can be found at the at the French Wikipedia.\nSee also.\nFor further about the Dutch Monarchy and the Dutch Royal House:\nTraditionally, members of the Nassau family were buried in Breda; but because that city was in Spanish hands when William died, he was buried in a new crypt in the New Church, Delft. The monument on his tomb was originally very modest, but it was replaced in 1623 by a new one, made by Hendrik de Keyser and his son Pieter. Since then, most of the members of the House of Orange-Nassau, including all Dutch monarchs, have been buried in that church. His great-grandson William the Third, King of England and Scotland and Stadtholder in the Netherlands, was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nIn Robert A. Heinlein's 1956 science fiction novel \"Double Star\", the House of Orange reigns over \u2013 but does not rule over \u2013 an empire of humanity that spans the entire Solar System.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71925", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71925", "title": "Image", "text": "Visual artifact that depicts or records perception\nAn image or picture is a visual representation. An image can be two-dimensional, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or three-dimensional, such as a carving or sculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including a projection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means, such as photography, printmaking, or photocopying. Images can also be animated through digital or physical processes.\nIn the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s). In optics, the term \"image\" (or \"optical image\") refers specifically to the reproduction of an object formed by light waves coming from the object.\nA \"volatile image\" exists or is perceived only for a short period. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode-ray tube. A \"fixed image\", also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile.\nA mental image exists in an individual's mind as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image does not need to be real; it may be an abstract concept such as a graph or function or an imaginary entity. For a mental image to be understood outside of an individual's mind, however, there must be a way of conveying that mental image through the words or visual productions of the subject.\nCharacteristics.\nTwo-dimensional images.\nThe broader sense of the word 'image' also encompasses any two-dimensional figure, such as a map, graph, pie chart, painting, or banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, or the graphic arts (such as lithography or etching). Additionally, images can be rendered automatically through printing, computer graphics technology, or a combination of both methods.\nA two-dimensional image does not need to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. An example of this is a grayscale (\"black and white\") image, which uses the visual system's sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths without taking into account different colors. A black-and-white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not fully use the visual system's capabilities.\nOn the other hand, some processes can be used to create visual representations of objects that are otherwise inaccessible to the human visual system. These include microscopy for the magnification of minute objects, telescopes that can observe objects at great distances, X-rays that can visually represent the interior structures of the human body (among other objects), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET scans), and others. Such processes often rely on detecting electromagnetic radiation that occurs beyond the light spectrum visible to the human eye and converting such signals into recognizable images.\nThree-dimensional images.\nAside from sculpture and other physical activities that can create three-dimensional images from solid material, some modern techniques, such as holography, can create three-dimensional images that are reproducible but intangible to human touch. Some photographic processes can now render the illusion of depth in an otherwise \"flat\" image, but \"3-D photography\" (stereoscopy) or \"3-D film\" are optical illusions that require special devices such as eyeglasses to create the illusion of depth.\nMoving images.\n\"Moving\" two-dimensional images are actually illusions of movement perceived when still images are displayed in sequence, each image lasting less, and sometimes much less, than a fraction of a second. The traditional standard for the display of individual frames by a motion picture projector has been 24 frames per second (FPS) since at least the commercial introduction of \"talking pictures\" in the late 1920s, which necessitated a standard for synchronizing images and sounds. Even in electronic formats such as television and digital image displays, the apparent \"motion\" is actually the result of many individual lines giving the impression of continuous movement.\nThis phenomenon has often been described as \"persistence of vision\": a physiological effect of light impressions remaining on the retina of the eye for very brief periods. Even though the term is still sometimes used in popular discussions of movies, it is not a scientifically valid explanation. Other terms emphasize the complex cognitive operations of the brain and the human visual system. \"Flicker fusion\", the \"phi phenomenon\", and \"beta movement\" are among the terms that have replaced \"persistence of vision\", though no one term seems adequate to describe the process.\nCultural and other uses.\nImage-making seems to have been common to virtually all human cultures since at least the Paleolithic era. Prehistoric examples of rock art\u2014including cave paintings, petroglyphs, rock reliefs, and geoglyphs\u2014have been found on every inhabited continent. Many of these images seem to have served various purposes: as a form of record-keeping; as an element of spiritual, religious, or magical practice; or even as a form of communication. Early writing systems, including hieroglyphics, ideographic writing, and even the Roman alphabet, owe their origins in some respects to pictorial representations.\nMeaning and signification.\nImages of any type may convey different meanings and sensations for individual viewers, regardless of whether the image's creator intended them. An image may be taken simply as a more or less \"accurate\" copy of a person, place, thing, or event. It may represent an abstract concept, such as the political power of a ruler or ruling class, a practical or moral lesson, an object for spiritual or religious veneration, or an object\u2014human or otherwise\u2014to be desired. It may also be regarded for its purely aesthetic qualities, rarity, or monetary value. Such reactions can depend on the viewer's context. A religious image in a church may be regarded differently than the same image mounted in a museum. Some might view it simply as an object to be bought or sold. Viewers' reactions will also be guided or shaped by their education, class, race, and other contexts.\nThe study of emotional sensations and their relationship to any given image falls into the categories of aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While such studies inevitably deal with issues of meaning, another approach to signification was suggested by the American philosopher, logician, and semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\"Images\" are one type of the broad category of \"signs\" proposed by Peirce. Although his ideas are complex and have changed over time, the three categories of signs that he distinguished stand out:\nA single image may exist in all three categories at the same time. The Statue of Liberty provides an example. While there have been countless two-dimensional and three-dimensional \"reproductions\" of the statue (i.e., \"icons\" themselves), the statue itself exists as\nCritiques of imagery.\nThe nature of images, whether three-dimensional or two-dimensional, created for a specific purpose or only for aesthetic pleasure, has continued to provoke questions and even condemnation at different times and places. In his dialogue, \"The Republic\", the Greek philosopher Plato described our apparent reality as a copy of a higher order of universal forms. As copies of a higher reality, the things we perceive in the world, tangible or abstract, are inevitably imperfect. Book 7 of \"The Republic\" offers Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave,\" where ordinary human life is compared to being a prisoner in a darkened cave who believes that shadows projected onto the cave's wall comprise actual reality. Since art is itself an imitation, it is a copy of that copy and all the more imperfect. Artistic images, then, not only misdirect human reason away from understanding the higher forms of true reality, but in imitating the bad behaviors of humans in depictions of the gods, they can corrupt individuals and society.\nEchoes of such criticism have persisted across time, accelerating as image-making technologies have developed and expanded immensely since the invention of the daguerreotype and other photographic processes in the mid-19th century. By the late 20th century, works like John Berger's \"Ways of Seeing\" and Susan Sontag's \"On Photography\" questioned the hidden assumptions of power, race, sex, and class encoded in even realistic images, and how those assumptions and such images may implicate the viewer in the voyeuristic position of a (usually) male viewer. The documentary film scholar Bill Nichols has also studied how apparently \"objective\" photographs and films still encode assumptions about their subjects.\nImages perpetuated in public education, media, and popular culture have a profound impact on the formation of such mental images:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What makes them so powerful is that they circumvent the faculties of the conscious mind but, instead, directly target the subconscious and affective, thus evading direct inquiry through contemplative reasoning. By doing so such axiomatic images let us know what we shall desire (liberalism, in a snapshot: the crunchy honey-flavored cereals and the freshly-pressed orange juice in the back of a suburban one-family home) and from what we shall obstain (communism, in a snapshot: lifeless crowds of men and machinery marching towards certain perdition accompanied by the tunes of Soviet Russian songs). What makes those images so powerful is that it is only of relative minor relevance for the stabilization of such images whether they actually capture and correspond with the multiple layers of reality, or not.\u2014\u200a\nReligious critiques.\nDespite, or perhaps because of, the widespread use of religious and spiritual imagery worldwide, the making of images and the depiction of gods or religious subjects has been subject to criticism, censorship, and criminal penalties. The Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) all have had admonitions against the making of images, even though the extent of that proscription has varied with time, place, and sect or denomination of a given religion. In Judaism, one of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai forbids the making of \"any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under earth.\" In Christian history, periods of iconoclasm (the destruction of images, especially those with religious meanings or connotations) have broken out from time to time, and some sects and denominations have rejected or severely limited the use of religious imagery. Islam tends to discourage religious depictions, sometimes quite rigorously, and often extends that to other forms of realistic imagery, favoring calligraphy or geometric designs instead. Depending on time and place, photographs and broadcast images in Islamic societies may be less subject to outright prohibition. In any religion, restrictions on image-making are especially targeted to avoid depictions of \"false gods\" in the form of idols. In recent years, militant extremist groups such as the Taliban and ISIS have destroyed centuries-old artifacts, especially those associated with other religions.\nIn culture.\nVirtually all cultures have produced images and applied different meanings or applications to them. The loss of knowledge about the context and connection of an image to its object is likely to result in different perceptions and interpretations of the image and even of the original object itself.\nThrough human history, one dominant form of imagery has been in relation to religion and spirituality. Such images, whether in the form of idols that are objects of worship or that represent some other spiritual state or quality, have a different status as artifacts when copies of such images sever links to the spiritual or supernatural. The German philosopher and essayist Walter Benjamin brought particular attention to this point in his 1935 essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\"\nBenjamin argues that the mechanical reproduction of images, which had accelerated through photographic processes in the previous one hundred years or so, inevitably degrades the \"authenticity\" or quasi-religious \"aura\" of the original object. One example is Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\", originally painted as a portrait, but much later, with its display as an art object, it developed a \"cult\" value as an example of artistic beauty. Following years of various reproductions of the painting, the portrait's \"cult\" status has little to do with its original subject or the artistry. It has become famous for being famous, while at the same time, its recognizability has made it a subject to be copied, manipulated, satirized, or otherwise altered in forms ranging from Marcel Duchamp's \"L.H.O.O.Q\". to Andy Warhol's multiple silk-screened reproductions of the image.\nIn modern times, the development of \"non-fungible tokens\" (NFTs) has been touted as an attempt to create \"authentic\" or \"unique\" images that have a monetary value, existing only in digital format. This assumption has been widely debated.\nOther considerations.\nThe development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of sound art have led to considering the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.\nStill or moving.\nA \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;still image\" is a single static image. This phrase is used in photography, visual media, and the computer industry to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a standard.\nA \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;moving image\" is typically a movie (film) or video, including digital video. It could also be an animated display, such as a zoetrope.\nA still frame is a still image derived from one frame of a moving one. In contrast, a film still is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes.\nIn image processing, a picture function is a mathematical representation of a two-dimensional image as a function of two spatial variables. The function f(x,y) describes the intensity of the point at coordinates (x,y).\nLiterature.\nIn literature, a \"mental image\" may be developed through words and phrases to which the senses respond. It involves picturing an image mentally, also called imagining, hence imagery. It can both be figurative and literal. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital and most populated municipality of the Province of Segovia. Segovia is located in the Inner Plateau of the Iberian Peninsula, near the northern slopes of the Sistema Central mountain range. Housing is nestled on a bend of the Eresma river.\nThe city is famous for its historic buildings including three main landmarks: its midtown Roman aqueduct, its cathedral (one of the last ones to be built in Europe following a Gothic style), and the Alc\u00e1zar of Segovia (a fortress). The city center was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\nEtymology.\nThe name of Segovia is of Celtiberian origin. Although historians have linked its old name to \"\", the discovery of the original Roman city of Segobriga near Saelices discarded this possibility. The name of \"Segovia\" is mentioned by Livy in the context of the Sertorian War.\nUnder the Romans and Moors, the city was called Sego([u])via (, Ptolomeo ii. 6. \u00a7 56) and () respectively.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nSegovia is located near the Eresma rivercourse (a second-order tributary of the Douro), close to the northwestern slope of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains, a subrange of the Sistema Central.\nThe main route of the Camino de Santiago de Madrid passes through the city.\nClimate.\nSegovia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification) bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\"), resulting from the high altitude and the distance from the coast. The average annual temperature is , with an average low in January of and an average high in July of . The annual precipitation range from 400 to 500\u00a0mm per year in the lower plains, and can reach above 1000\u00a0mm in the nearby mountainous area of Sierra de Guadarrama, as rainfall and snowfall is more frequent up the mountains. Decent showers coming from summer thunderstorms help the mountainous area of the province to be rainier than average than most of the central Spanish plateau, which gives the area lush vegetation. All of this make the province a damp corner in the context of the region. The predominant forms of vegetation in the mountainous areas include pine, evergreen, oak, beech and juniper.\nPopulation centers.\nAside from the main city, there are a number of other villages within the municipality of Segovia.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded mention of a settlement in what is today Segovia was a Celtic possession. Control later passed into the hands of the Romans. The city is a possible site of the battle in 75 BC where Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius was victorious over Quintus Sertorius and Hirtuleius. Hirtuleius died in the fighting. During the late Roman period, the settlement belonged to one of numerous contemporary Latin convents.\nLater records traditionally indicate that the townsite was uninhabited at the height of the 11th century. The circumstances behind the resettlement of the northern Meseta beyond the Douro (vis-\u00e0-vis the pre-Reconquesta population) under the advancing Christian kingdoms in the middle ages is, however, a moot point in historiography. Short of the existence of any verified urban layout in the townsite, possible early eleventh century Berber or Mozarab settlements in the area seem likely.\nAfter the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile, Segovia was resettled with Christians from the north of the Iberian peninsula and beyond the Pyrenees, providing it with a significant sphere of influence whose boundaries crossed the Sierra de Guadarrama and the Tagus.\nSegovia's position on trading routes made it an important centre of trade in wool and textiles. The end of the Middle Ages saw something of a golden age for Segovia, with a growing Jewish population and the creation of a foundation for a powerful cloth industry. Several splendid works of Gothic architecture were also completed during this period. Notably, Isabella I was proclaimed queen of Castile in the church of San Miguel de Segovia on December 13, 1474.\nSegovienne was a local flannel cloth used for upholstery in the 14th to 17th centuries. It was a twilled weave structure with a hairy surface produced by using Spanish wool.\nLike most Castilian textile centres, Segovia joined the Revolt of the Comuneros under the command of Juan Bravo. Despite the defeat of the Communities, the city's resultant economic boom continued into the sixteenth century, its population rising to 27,000 in 1594. Then, as well as almost all the cities of Castile, Segovia entered a period of decline. Only a century later in 1694, the population had been reduced to only 8,000 inhabitants. In the early eighteenth century, Segovia attempted to revitalize its textile industry, with little success. In the second half of the century, Charles III made another attempt to revive the region's commerce; it took the form of the Royal Segovian Wool Manufacturing Company (1763). However, the lack of competitiveness of production caused the crown withdraw its sponsorship in 1779. In 1764, the Royal School of Artillery, the first military academy in Spain, was opened. This academy remains present in the city today. In 1808, Segovia was sacked by French troops during the War of Independence. During the First Carlist War, troops under the command of Don Carlos, Count of Molina unsuccessfully attacked the city. During the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, Segovia experienced a demographic recovery that was the result of relative economic stability.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;The population growth experienced during the nineteenth century accelerated steadily beginning around 1920: 16,013 inhabitants recorded that year, 33,360 in 1960, and 53,237 in 1981. Since the 1980s growth has slowed markedly: 55,586 in 2004 and 56,047 in 2007.\nAs of 1 January 2019, there were 11% of inhabitants who were foreigners \u2013 4.478% coming from other countries in Europe, 2.37% being Africans, 3.7% being from the Americas, and 0.435% being Asians.\nHeritage.\nWorld Heritage City.\nIn 1985 the old city of Segovia and its Aqueduct were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The old city contains a multitude of historic buildings both civil and religious, including a large number of buildings of Jewish origin, notably within the old Jewish Quarter. One of the most historically important Jewish sites is the Jewish cemetery, .\nAmong the most important monuments in the city are:\nReligious architecture.\nChurches and chapels.\nThe city maintains an important collection of Romanesque churches of both stone and brick, which include the churches of San Esteban, San Mill\u00e1n, San Mart\u00edn, la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad, San Andr\u00e9s, San Clemente, Santos Justo y Pastor, Iglesia de la Vera Cruz (Order of Malta), and San Salvador.\nThe old main synagogue is a former synagogue, converted into a convent after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.\nMonasteries and convents.\nThe city of Segovia preserved also several monasteries and convents with active religious life:\nUrban sculpture.\nUrban sculpture in Segovia feature works depicting illustrious figures linked to the city, but there are also several works of a religious nature. One of the most iconic sculptures of the Loba Capitolina sits in front of the aqueduct. A copy of the Capitoline wolf is preserved in the Capitoline Museum and was a gift that Rome gave to the city in 1974 during the events of the bimillennial anniversary of the aqueduct.\nUntil a few decades ago, a monument dedicated to the artist Daniel Zuloaga, which was installed in 1924, could be seen in the Plaza de la Merced, but it was relocated to the Plaza de Colmenares. Currently located in the center of the Plaza de la Merced, looking towards the church of San Andr\u00e9s is a bust of the poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, sculptor Santiago de Santiago, which was donated by the Nicaragua government to the city in 1973. Letters related to the bust are also found in the Promenade Lounge, the famous poet Jos\u00e9 Rodas was first installed in 1927 in the plaza of the gardens, and moved to its present site in 1960 by the Segovian sculptor Aniceto Marinas. There is also a tribute to Antonio Machado; the poet Segovia also took refuge here from 1919 to 1932, a sculpture honoring him is located in the garden of his home museum, and was done by Emiliano Barral.\nReligious figures such as Domingo de Soto, Pius XII, Saint Anthony Mary Claret, Saint John of the Cross have their own urban sculptures, including the first work of Ortega and several from Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Moro, a prosperous Segovia sculptor who also created the Monument to the Youth located on the Plaza del Conde de Cheste. A few peasants have been recognized on the streets or town squares, as is the case for Aniceto Marinas, who dedicated a monument in 1943 to his friend and partner Mariano Benlliure.\nIn the field of arms is the monument to Dao\u00edz and Velarde, Aniceto Marina's work. By the same artist is the sculpture dedicated to the list of people associated with the comunero Juan Bravo, made in 1921 and located in the heart of the city at the Square of the Sirens, the name given to two statues that top the stairs representing the mythological beings, which were made by Francisco Bellver in 1852. Other sculptures in the city include one devoted to physician Andr\u00e9s Laguna made by the Segovian Florentino Trapero and located at Plaza de los Huertos, the bust of Lope de la Calle Mart\u00edn, president of the provincial council, that was made by Emiliano Barral and can be seen in the square of San Facundo, or the monument \"El Favorito\" by Toribio Garc\u00eda de Andr\u00e9s in the early 20th century.\nIn addition to this series of monuments and sculptures some other religious images worth mentioning can be found in the quieter corners of the city. The most significant of these is the Virgin of the Aqueduct, located in the central niche of the monument at the Plaza del Azoguejo since the 16th century; it memorializes Colmenares. A series of virgins can also be found at the Fuencisla on Velarde Street, the los Remedios in front of San Juan Gate, the Socorro at the San Andr\u00e9s Gate and the del Carmen on the street of its own name, among others.\nSegovia also has a work by Luis Sanguino, who lives in the city. It is \"El Mesonero Mayor de Castilla\" (\"The Elder Hotelkeeper of Castile\"), at the Plaza del Santo Esp\u00edritu.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Segovia revolves around metallurgy, agriculture, furniture, construction and tourism. The town itself plays host to thousands of day trippers from Madrid each year due to its popular attractions.\nTransport.\nSegovia is served by the Autopista AP-61 which opened in 2004. Segovia-Guiomar railway station provides a rail connection to Madrid Chamart\u00edn and Valladolid-Campo Grande via the AVE network's Madrid\u2013Le\u00f3n high-speed rail line. Direct train travel from Madrid stations to Segovia is approximately 30 minutes. There is no airport in the city, the nearest airport is Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport, located south east of Segovia.\nEducation.\nThe city of Segovia is home to a large number of primary schools and secondary schools, the oldest of which (IES Andr\u00e9s Laguna, founded in 1841) having been officially declared \"of cultural interest.\" A high proportion of the student population attends state primary and secondary schools, while private schooling in Segovia is mostly religious in nature.\nSegovia's premier higher education institution is IE University, a business-oriented undergraduate university, building upon Instituto Empresa's successful MBA program at Madrid-based IE Business School. Also present is the Segovia campus of the University of Valladolid, offering studies for careers in computer engineering, law, journalism, advertising and education.\nCulture.\nMUCES.\nMUCES (Muestra de Cine Europeo Ciudad de Segovia) is the Spanish acronym to The City of Segovia Festival of European Cinema, an annual film festival which takes place in the city since 2006, usually in November. It gives the wider public a chance to get to know quality European cinema and, above all, it offers the general public an opportunity to see European films which have not yet been commercially screened in Spain, but have been very successful with critics and audiences in their own countries. \"My Cat Lives in Segovia\" is one of the films presented to the audience.\nFestivities.\nHoly Week.\nThe Holy Week is one of the most important cultural and religious events in all of Segovia, it is officially considered as a Fiesta of National Tourist Interest. The earliests signs of a primitive Holy Week dates back to 1534, while the oldest brotherhood that currently marches through the city is the \"Real Cofrad\u00eda de la Santa y Venerable Esclavitud y del Santo Entierro del Cristo de los Gascones\" which was founded in 1647 and accompanies the float of the \"Cristo de los Gascones\", which is dated around the 11th century.\nThe most important procession of the event is the \"Procesi\u00f3n de los Pasos\", in which all of the brotherhoods of Segovia march together from the cathedral to de acueduct in a way so that the floats represent chronologically the Passion and Death of Christ. The brotherhoods that participate in the Holy Week are the following and march in the \"Procesi\u00f3n de los Pasos\" following the order in which they are mentioned:\nLegends.\nThere are many due to the longevity of the city, among the main ones are:\nThere are also other different legends in the incorporated neighborhoods.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSegovia is twinned with:\nAntipode.\nSegovia is the Antipode of Masterton, New Zealand.\nFootnotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many professional classical guitarists were either students of Segovia or students of Segovia's students.\nSegovia's contribution to the modern-romantic repertoire included not only commissions but also his own transcriptions of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive musical personality, phrasing and style.\nEarly life.\nSegovia was born on 21 February 1893 in Linares, Ja\u00e9n. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle Eduardo and aunt Mar\u00eda. Eduardo arranged for Segovia's first music lessons with a violin teacher after he had recognised that Segovia had an aptitude for music. That proved to be an unhappy introduction to music for the young Segovia because of the teacher's strict methods, and Eduardo stopped the lessons. His uncle decided to move to Granada to allow Segovia to obtain a better education. After arriving in Granada, Segovia recommenced his musical studies. Segovia was aware of flamenco during his formative years as a musician but stated that he \"did not have a taste\" for the form and chose instead the works of Fernando Sor, Francisco T\u00e1rrega, and other classical composers. T\u00e1rrega agreed to give the self-taught Segovia some lessons but died before they could meet, and Segovia states that his early musical education involved the \"double function of professor and pupil in the same body\".\nCareer.\nSegovia's first public performance was in Granada at the age of 16 in 1909. A few years later he played his first professional concert in Madrid, which included works by Francisco T\u00e1rrega and his own guitar transcriptions of Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite the discouragement of his family, who wanted him to become a lawyer, and criticism by some of T\u00e1rrega's pupils for his idiosyncratic technique, he continued to pursue his studies of the guitar diligently.\nHe played again in Madrid in 1912, at the Paris Conservatory in 1915 and in Barcelona in 1916 and made a successful tour of South America in 1919. Segovia's arrival on the international stage coincided with a time when the guitar's fortunes as a concert instrument were being revived, largely through the efforts of Miguel Llobet. It was in that changing milieu that Segovia, thanks to his strength of personality and artistry, coupled with developments in recording and broadcasting, succeeded in making the guitar more popular again.\nIn 1921 in Paris, Segovia met Alexandre Tansman, who later wrote a number of guitar works for Segovia, among them Cavatina, which won a prize at the Siena International Composition contest in 1952. In 1921, he also met Agust\u00edn Barrios in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Segovia was impressed by Barrios's Bach-inspired and arguably magnum opus \"La Catedral\".\nAt Granada in 1922, he became associated with the Concurso de Cante Jondo, promoted by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The aim of the \"classicising\" \"Concurso\" was to preserve flamenco in its purity from being distorted by modern popular music. Segovia had already developed as a fine \"tocador\" of flamenco guitar, yet his direction was now classical. Invited to open the \"Concurso\" held at the Alhambra, he played \"Homenaje a Debussy\" by Falla.\nIn 1923, Segovia visited Mexico for the first time. There Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in \"El Universal\". Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia, including numerous sonatas.\nIn 1924, Segovia, visited the German luthier Hermann Hauser Sr. after Segovia heard some of Hauser's instruments played in a concert in Munich. In 1928, Hauser provided Segovia with one of the guitars, which Segovia used during his tour of the United States and in other concerts up to 1933. Segovia ordered a further guitar from Hauser and after receiving it passed on the 1928 model to his American representative and close friend Sophocles Papas, who in his turn gave it to his student, the famous jazz and classical guitarist Charlie Byrd, who used it on several records.\nSegovia's first American tour was arranged in 1928 when Fritz Kreisler, the Viennese violinist who privately played the guitar, persuaded Francis Charles Coppicus from the Metropolitan Musical Bureau to present the guitarist in New York.\nAfter Segovia's debut tour in the US in 1928 the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos composed his now well-known Twelve \u00c9tudes (Portuguese: \"Doze estudos\"; French: \"Douze \u00e9tudes\"; German: \"Zw\u00f6lf Studien\") and later dedicated them to Segovia. Their relationship proved to be lasting, and Villa-Lobos continued to write for Segovia. He also transcribed numerous classical pieces himself and revived the pieces transcribed by predecessors like T\u00e1rrega.\nIn 1932, Segovia met and befriended the composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco in Venice. Since Castelnuovo-Tedesco did not play the guitar, Segovia provided him with guitar compositions (Ponce's \"Folias\" variations and Sor's \"Mozart Variations\"), which he could study. Castelnuovo-Tedesco composed a large number of works for the guitar, many of them dedicated to Segovia. The Concerto Op. 99 of 1939 was the first guitar concerto of the 20th century and Castelnuovo-Tedesco's last work in Italy before he emigrated to the United States. It was premiered by Segovia in Uruguay in 1939.\nIn 1935, he gave his first public performance of Bach's \"Chaconne\", a difficult piece for any instrument. He moved to Montevideo and performed many concerts in South America in the 1930s and the early 1940s.\nAfter World War II, Segovia began to record more frequently and performed regular tours of Europe and America and would maintain that schedule for 30 years. In 1954, Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo dedicated \"Fantas\u00eda para un gentilhombre\" (\"Fantasy for a Gentleman\") to Segovia. Segovia won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance, Instrumentalist for his recording \"Segovia Golden Jubilee\".\nJohn W. Duarte dedicated his English Suite Op.\u00a031 to Segovia and his wife, Emilia Magdalena del Corral Sancho, on the occasion of their marriage in 1962. Segovia told the composer \"You will be astonished at the success it will have\".\nIn recognition of his contributions to music and the arts, Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981 by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of \"Marqu\u00e9s de Salobre\u00f1a\" (English: Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a) in the nobility of Spain.\nSegovia continued performing into his old age, and lived in semi-retirement during his seventies and eighties on the Costa del Sol. Two films were made of his life and work, one when he was 75 and the other when he was 84. They are available on DVD under the titles \"Andr\u00e9s Segovia\u2014in Portrait\". His final RCA LP (ARL1-1602), \"Reveries\", was recorded in Madrid in June 1977.\nIn 1984, Segovia was the subject of a 13-part series broadcast on National Public Radio, \"Segovia!\" The series was recorded on location in Spain, France and the United States. Hosted by Oscar Brand, the series was produced by Jim Anderson, Robert Malesky and Larry Snitzler.\nSegovia died on 2 June 1987 in Madrid of a heart attack at the age of 94. He is buried at Casa Museo Andr\u00e9s Segovia in Linares.\nTechnique.\nThe right hand is responsible for the guitar's musical sound and so in examining the technique, the way the right hand is placed in relation to the strings is most important. For several years, it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of fingertip and nail, as stated by Christopher Parkening, but Segovia plucked the strings only with the nails. When asked which technique he used, he replied that it was \"the only one there is: nails. Because they bring timbre differences and colour variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar.\" His right hand was placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings. That way, the nail alone would press the string. At the same time, it was thought that was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings (E, A and D) of the guitar when they were plucked.\nSegovia created a strong bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique, largely because of the flexibility that he had in his thumb, which helped to create a very strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes.\nAnother innovation that separated Segovia from the T\u00e1rrega school was the search for the tension in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side. That way, he could obtain colour variation but also an especially strong, round and voluminous sound, which was very helpful for giving concerts in big halls (the technique was later used by Narciso Yepes). Before Segovia, guitarists from the T\u00e1rrega school played the guitar with the hand right over the soundhole and thus created a mellow sound but could not fill the whole space of a large concert hall.\nAfter World War II, Segovia became among the first to endorse nylon strings, instead of catgut strings. That advancement allowed for greater tonal stability and was the final ingredient in the standardization of the instrument.\nRepertoire.\nSegovia's repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships, notably Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo, the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself, of classical works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord, piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, Enrique Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco T\u00e1rrega. Segovia's influence enlarged the repertoire, mainly as a commissioner or dedicatee of new works, as a transcriber, and as a composer with such works as his \"Estudio sin luz\".\nSegovia's main musical aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century (and turn of the century) especially in the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist style. That is perhaps best typified by Segovia's own work \"Estudio sin Luz\". Many works of that and similar styles were written especially for him and formed part of his core repertoire: particularly the guitar works of Federico Moreno Torroba (1891\u20131982), such as the \"Sonatina\", which was first performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925.\nSegovia was selective and performed only works with which he identified personally. He was known to reject atonal works or those that he considered too radical even if they were dedicated to him; he rejected Frank Martin's \"Quatre pi\u00e8ces br\u00e8ves\", Darius Milhaud's \"Segoviana\", etc. Even though rejected by Segovia, all of those works are today published and available.\nTeaching.\nSegovia viewed teaching as vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at \"M\u00fasica en Compostela\", in the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela.\nSegovia also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for numerous years, where he was aided by Alirio D\u00edaz.\nHis teaching style is a source of controversy among some of his former students, who considered it to be dogmatically authoritarian. One of Segovia's most celebrated former students of the classical guitar, John Williams, has said that Segovia bullied students into playing only his style and stifled the development of their own styles. Williams has also said that Segovia was dismissive of music that did not have what Segovia considered the correct classical origins, such as South American music with popular roots. He was also critical of Williams' work with the group Sky for the same reasons.\nLegacy.\nSegovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. Federico Moreno Torroba said, \"The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\" He can be credited to have dignified the classical guitar as a legitimate concert instrument before the discerning music public, which had hitherto viewed the guitar merely as a limited if sonorous parlour instrument.\nIn Linares, the Segovia Museum \"Fundaci\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Segovia\" was established in May 1995, and Linares (Segovia's birthplace) also has a bronze statue in his honour, created by Julio L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez and unveiled on 25 May 1984.\nSegovia influenced a generation of classical guitarists who built on his technique and musical sensibility, including Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, John Williams and Oscar Ghiglia, all of whom have acknowledged their debt to him. Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of Bach, particularly an extraordinarily-demanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004). During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia, who suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed. He once said, \"All over the world I have 'pupils' I have never met.\"\nHis editions of works originally written for guitar include newly-fingered and occasionally-revised versions of works from the standard repertoire (most famously, his edition of a selection of twenty \"estudios\" by Fernando Sor, the \"cornerstone\" of every serious student's technique since its publication in 1945 although somewhat ironically, Segovia, in the preface to that work, disparaged Sor as \"not among the vigorous talents\") as well as compositions written for him, including by Heitor Villa-Lobos, Federico Mompou, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.\nAwards.\nSegovia was awarded many prizes and honours, including doctorates \"honoris causa\", from ten universities. On 24 June 1981, he was ennobled by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of \"Marqu\u00e9s de Salobre\u00f1a\" (English: Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a) in the nobility of Spain in recognition of his contributions to music and the arts. He received the Danish Sonning Award in 1974, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1985, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986.\nPersonal life.\nSegovia's first wife was Adelaida Portillo (marriage in 1918). Segovia's second wife (marriage in 1935) was the pianist Paquita Madriguera, who also made some piano roll recordings. From 1944, he maintained a romantic relationship with Brazilian singer and guitarist Olga Praguer Coelho, which was to last for over a decade. In 1962 Segovia married Emilia Magdalena Corral Sancho. They had one son, Carlos Andr\u00e9s Segovia, the current Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a.\nStudents.\nSegovia had several notable students throughout his career:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears. Unlike most Disney characters, Pluto is not anthropomorphic beyond some characteristics such as facial expression. He is Mickey Mouse's pet. Officially a mixed-breed dog, he made his debut as a bloodhound in the Mickey Mouse cartoon \"The Chain Gang\". Together with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and Goofy, Pluto is one of the \"Sensational Six\"\u2014the biggest stars in the Disney universe. Though all six are non-human animals, Pluto alone is not dressed as a human.\nPluto debuted in animated cartoons and appeared in 24 \"Mickey Mouse\" films before receiving his own series in 1937. All together Pluto appeared in 89 short films between 1930 and 1953. Several of these were nominated for an Academy Award, including \"The Pointer\" (1939), \"Squatter's Rights\" (1946), \"Pluto's Blue Note\" (1947), and \"Mickey and the Seal\" (1948). One film starring him, \"Lend a Paw\" (1941), won the award in 1942. Because Pluto does not speak, his presence relies on physical humor. This made him a pioneering figure in character animation, by expressing personality through animation rather than dialogue.\nLike all of Pluto's co-stars, he appears extensively in comics, first in 1931. He returned to theatrical animation in 1990 with \"The Prince and the Pauper\" and is in several direct-to-video films. Pluto is in countless television series, video games, and all other \"Mickey Mouse\" media.\nIn 1998, Disney's copyright on Pluto, set to expire at the end of 2005, was extended by the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Disney, along with other rights holders, lobbied for passage of the act to preserve their copyrights on characters such as Pluto for 20 additional years. Under current American copyright law, Pluto's earliest appearances will become public domain at the start of 2026. However, Pluto, like all widely-merchandised Disney characters, will remain trademarked by Disney, and trademarks do not expire unless the rights holder stops using it.\nOrigin.\nThe character of Pluto originated with animator Norm Ferguson, who came to the Disney Studio in 1929. Ferguson is credited with introducing the animation principle of \"follow through and overlapping action\": where different parts of the body move at different times and speeds compared to the main action. Ferguson first introduced this technique in the Silly Symphony short \"Frolicking Fish\" (released May 8, 1930): where he animated a trio of dancing fish, and offset the movement of their fins, having them \"drag\" along with the main body's movement. This gave the characters a more flowing and natural movement than in most other animation of that time. Walt Disney was so impressed with Ferguson's work on \"Frolicking Fish\", that he ordered all of his animators study the scene.\nShortly after completing his work on \"Frolicking Fish\", Disney assigned Ferguson to work on the Mickey Mouse cartoon \"The Chain Gang\" (released on September 5, 1930); where Mickey is portrayed as a prisoner who escapes from jail, and is pursued by two nameless bloodhounds. Ferguson was tasked with animating a scene where Mickey runs towards the camera and is followed by the two bloodhounds, who sniff Mickey's trail, look up, snort, and bark at the camera. According to Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, when describing this scene to Ferguson, Disney reminisced about different dogs he grew up with as a child, and acted out their mannerisms (much to the staff's amusement), which Ferguson would then translate into his animation.\nWhen animating the scene, Ferguson applied his principle of \"follow through and overlapping action\" to the jowls of the dogs, which gave them surprisingly lifelike movement for the time. Animation historian Michael Barrier wrote about the scene: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The dogs were among the very first Disney characters whose design broke with the prevailing formula that put white masks on virtually interchangeable black bodies... their jowls hang loosely, their nostrils wrinkle and flair, their movements echo those of real dogs. When the dogs appear, there is a sense, however faint and fleeting, of solid flesh on a screen otherwise occupied by phantoms.\"\nUpon reviewing the scene, Disney was so impressed by Ferguson's animation on the dogs, he decided to develop one of them into a recurring character. Ferguson's dog character next appeared in \"The Picnic\" (released on October 23 of that same year), however he was portrayed as Minnie's dog, and was named \"Rover\". In his third appearance, \"The Moose Hunt\" (released on May 3, 1931), he appeared as Mickey's pet, and was finally given the name \"Pluto\". Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen claimed they changed the name to Pluto because: \"We thought the name [Rover] was too common, so we had to look for something else. ... We changed it to \"Pluto the Pup\" ... but I don't honestly remember why.\" Some Disney animators reportedly believed that Disney chose the name \"Pluto\" to capitalize on the then-newly-named ninth planet of Pluto. However, animation historian John Canemaker states that Disney chose the name simply because he once had a dog named Pluto.\nOther animators handled the character, but Ferguson became the Pluto specialist at the Disney Studio. Over the next few years, Ferguson continued to develop and refine the character, ultimately crystalizing with \"Playful Pluto\" (1934), in which Ferguson animated a scene where Pluto gets a piece of flypaper stuck to his rear end. The sequence was storyboarded by Webb Smith, and Ferguson padded the scene and added extra bits of comic business. The scene was considered a major landmark in the development of character animation. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston described the scene as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"...a milestone in personality animation. From the time he [Pluto] accidently sits on a sheet of the sticky flypaper, Pluto's problems seem to become ever worse as he tries to extricate himself. Through it all, his reaction to his predicament and his thoughts of what to try next are shared with the audience. It was the first time a character seemed to be thinking on screen, and, though it lasted only 65 seconds, it opened [up] the way for animation of real characters with real problems.\"\nFollowing the circulation of Art Babbitt's \"Character Analysis of the Goof\" around the Disney studio, Ferguson wrote a 4-Page character bible on Pluto that was published on Jan 4, 1936, and detailed Pluto's body construction, facial expressions, mannerisms and personality.\nCharacterization.\nUnlike Mickey's other animal friends, such as Goofy (who is also a dog), Pluto is a relatively normal animal, with few anthropomorphic traits apart from his facial expressions. Pluto usually doesn't speak in English, walk upright or wear clothing.\nAppearances.\nPluto first and most often appears in the \"Mickey Mouse\" series of cartoons. His solo star debut is in two \"Silly Symphony\" shorts, \"Just Dogs\" (1932) and \"Mother Pluto\" (1936). In 1937, Pluto appeared in \"Pluto's Quin-Puplets\" which was the first installment of his own film series, then headlined \"Pluto the Pup\".\nHis first comics appearance was in the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip on July 1, 1931, two months after the release of \"The Moose Hunt\". In 1938, Pluto headlined in the \"Silly Symphony\" Sunday comic strip, in an adaptation of his \"Silly Symphony\" short, \"Mother Pluto\". Pluto was later featured in several sequences of the \"Silly Symphony\" strip in 1939 and 1940.\nIn the various Disney theme park resorts worldwide, Pluto is an interactive character just like many of his film co-stars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange, green, white, and purple. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped with less pungent chili varieties as \"sweet peppers\". While they are botanically fruits\u2014classified as berries\u2014they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish. Other varieties of the genus \"Capsicum\" are categorized as \"chili peppers\" when they are cultivated for their pungency, including some varieties of \"Capsicum annuum\".\nPeppers are native to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. Pepper seeds were imported to Spain in 1493 and then spread through Europe and Asia. Preferred growing conditions for bell peppers include warm, moist soil in a temperature range of .\nNomenclature.\nThe name \"pepper\" was given by Europeans when Christopher Columbus brought the plant back to Europe. At that time, black pepper (peppercorns), from the unrelated plant \"Piper nigrum\" originating from India, was a highly prized condiment. The name \"pepper\" was applied in Europe to all known spices with a hot and pungent taste and was therefore extended to genus \"Capsicum\" when it was introduced from the Americas. The most commonly used name of the plant family \"chile\" is of Mexican origin, from the Nahuatl word \"chilli\".\nThe terms \"bell pepper\" (US, Canada, Philippines, UK), \"pepper\" or \"sweet pepper\" (UK, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Zimbabwe), and \"capsicum\" (Australia, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) are often used for any of the large bell-shaped peppers, regardless of their color. The fruit is simply referred to as a \"pepper\", or additionally by color (\"green pepper\" or red, yellow, orange, purple, brown, black). In the Midland region of the U.S., bell peppers, either fresh or when stuffed and pickled, are sometimes called mangoes.\nIn some languages, the term \"paprika\", which has its roots in the word for pepper, is used for both the spice and the fruit \u2013 sometimes referred to by their color (for example \"groene paprika\", \"gele paprika\", in Dutch, which are green and yellow, respectively). The bell pepper is called \"\u30d1\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\" (\"papurika\") or \"\u30d4\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\" (\"p\u012bman\", from French \"piment\" pronounced with a silent 't') in Japan. In Switzerland, the fruit is mostly called \"peperone\", which is the Italian name of the fruit. In France, it is called \"poivron\", with the same root as \"poivre\" (meaning \"pepper\") or \"piment\". In Spain it is called \"pimiento morr\u00f3n\", the masculine form of the traditional spice, \"pimienta\" and \"morr\u00f3n\" (snouted) referring to its general shape. In South Korea, the word \"\ud53c\ub9dd\" (\"pimang\" from the French \"piment\") refers to green bell peppers, whereas \"\ud30c\ud504\ub9ac\uce74\" (\"papeurika\", from \"paprika\") refers to bell peppers of other colors. In Sri Lanka, both the bell pepper and the banana pepper are referred to as a \"capsicum\" since the bell pepper has no Sinhalese translation. In Argentina and Chile, it is called \"morr\u00f3n\". In Russia, it is called \"Bulgarian pepper\"; during the Soviet era, Bulgaria was its largest supplier.\nRed, yellow, and green bell peppers are sometimes packaged and sold together in grocery stores under names like \"tricolor\" or \"stoplight mix\".\nColors.\nThe most common colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. Other colors include brown, white, lavender, and dark purple, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the 'Permagreen' variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. Therefore, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nLike the tomato, bell peppers are botanical fruits and culinary vegetables. Pieces of bell pepper are commonly used in garden salads and as toppings on pizza. There are many varieties of stuffed peppers prepared using hollowed or halved bell peppers. Bell peppers (and other cultivars of \"Capsicum annuum\") may be used in the production of the spice paprika.\nNutrition.\nA raw red bell pepper is 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat. A 100 gram (3.5 ounce) reference amount supplies 26 calories, and is a rich source of vitamin C \u2013 containing 158% of the Daily Value (DV) \u2013 vitamin A (20%), and vitamin B6 (23% DV), with moderate contents of riboflavin (12%), folate (12% DV), and vitamin E (11% DV). A red bell pepper supplies twice the vitamin C and eight times the vitamin A content of a green bell pepper.\nThe bell pepper is the only member of the genus \"Capsicum\" that does not produce capsaicin, a lipophilic chemical that can cause a strong burning sensation when it comes in contact with mucous membranes. Bell peppers are thus scored in the lowest level of the Scoville scale, meaning that they are not spicy. This absence of capsaicin is due to a recessive form of a gene that eliminates the compound and, consequently, the \"hot\" taste usually associated with the rest of the genus \"Capsicum\". This recessive gene is overwritten in the Mexibelle pepper, a hybrid variety of bell pepper that produces small amounts of capsaicin (and is thus mildly pungent). Conversely, a mutant strain of habanero has been bred to create a heatless version called the 'Habanada'. Sweet pepper cultivars produce non-pungent capsaicinoids.\nProduction.\nIn 2020, global production of bell peppers was 36 million tonnes, led by China with 46% of the total, and secondary production by Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a 100-gram reference amount, cooked kidney beans provide of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, folate (33% DV), iron (22% DV), and phosphorus (20% DV), with moderate amounts (10\u201319% DV) of thiamine, copper, magnesium, and zinc (11\u201314% DV).\nDishes.\nRed kidney beans are used in the cuisine of India, where the beans are known as \"rajma\" and Pakistan where they are called surkh lobia. Red kidney beans are commonly used in chili con carne and used in southern Louisiana for the classic Monday Creole dish of red beans and rice. The smaller, darker red beans are also used, particularly in Louisiana families with a recent Caribbean heritage. In Jamaica, they are referred to as red peas. Small kidney beans used in La Rioja, Spain, are called \"caparrones\". In the Netherlands and Indonesia, kidney beans are usually served as a soup called \"brenebon\". In the Levant, a common dish consisting of kidney bean stew usually served with rice is known as \"fasoulia\". To make bean paste, kidney beans are generally prepared from dried beans and boiled until they are soft, at which point the dark red beans are pulverized into a dry paste.\nToxicity.\nRaw red kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of phytohemagglutinin and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not soaked and then boiled for at least 10 minutes. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Cooking at the lower temperature of , such as in a slow cooker, is insufficient to denature the toxin and has been reported to cause food poisoning. As few as five raw beans or a single undercooked kidney bean (as cooking them at insufficient temperatures increases the level of toxic compounds) can cause severe nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pains. Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to eat straight from the can, as they are cooked prior to being shipped.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an official language of Papua New Guinea and the most widely used language in the country. In parts of the southern provinces of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro, and Milne Bay, the use of Tok Pisin has a shorter history and is less universal, especially among older people. \nBetween five and six million people use Tok Pisin to some degree, though not all speak it fluently. Many now learn it as a first language, in particular the children of parents or grandparents who originally spoke different languages (for example, a mother from Madang and a father from Rabaul). Urban families in particular, and those of police and defence force members, often communicate among themselves in Tok Pisin, either never gaining fluency in a local language () or learning a local language as a second (or third) language after Tok Pisin (and possibly English). Over the decades, Tok Pisin has increasingly overtaken Hiri Motu as the dominant lingua franca among town-dwellers. Perhaps one million people now use Tok Pisin as a primary language. Tok Pisin is slowly \"crowding out\" other languages of Papua New Guinea.\nName.\n originates from English \"talk\", but has a wider application, also meaning 'word, speech, language'. derives from the English word \"pidgin\"; the latter, in turn, may originate in the word \"business\", due to the typical development and use of pidgins as inter-ethnic trade languages.\nWhile Tok Pisin's name in the language is , it is also called \"New Guinea Pidgin\" in English. Papua New Guinean anglophones often call Tok Pisin \"Pidgin\" when speaking English. This usage of \"Pidgin\" (with capital P) differs from the term \"pidgin (language)\" as used in linguistics. In spite of its name, \"Tok Pisin\" is not a pidgin in the latter sense, because it has become a first language for many people (rather than simply a \"lingua franca\" to facilitate communication with speakers of other languages). As such, it is considered a creole in linguistic terminology.\nClassification.\nThe Tok Pisin language is a result of Pacific Islanders intermixing, when people speaking numerous different languages were sent to work on plantations in Queensland and various islands (see South Sea Islander and blackbirding). The labourers began to develop a pidgin, drawing vocabulary primarily from English, but also from German, Malay, Portuguese, and their own Austronesian languages (perhaps especially Kuanua, that of the Tolai people of East New Britain).\nThis English-based pidgin evolved into Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (where the German-based creole Unserdeutsch was also spoken). It became a widely used lingua franca and language of interaction between rulers and ruled, and among the ruled themselves who did not share a common vernacular. Tok Pisin and the closely related Bislama in Vanuatu and Pijin in the Solomon Islands, which developed in parallel, have traditionally been treated as varieties of a single Melanesian Pidgin English or \"Neo-Melanesian\" language. The flourishing of the mainly English-based Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (despite the language of the metropolitan power being German) contrasts with Hiri Motu, the lingua franca of Papua, which was derived not from English but from Motu, the vernacular of the indigenous people of the Port Moresby area.\nOfficial status.\nAlong with English and Hiri Motu, Tok Pisin is one of Papua New Guinea's three official languages. It is frequently the language of debate in the national parliament. Most government documents are produced in English, but public information campaigns are often partially or entirely in Tok Pisin. While English is the main language in the education system, some schools use Tok Pisin in the first three years of elementary education to promote early literacy.\nRegional variations.\nThere are considerable variations in vocabulary and grammar in various parts of Papua New Guinea, with distinct dialects in the New Guinea Highlands, the north coast of Papua New Guinea, and islands outside of New Guinea. For example, Pidgin speakers from Finschhafen speak rather quickly and often have difficulty making themselves understood elsewhere. The variant spoken on Bougainville and Buka is moderately distinct from that of New Ireland and East New Britain but is much closer to that than it is to the Pijin spoken in the rest of the Solomon Islands. \nThere are 4 sociolects of Tok Pisin:\nAlphabet.\nTok Pisin's alphabet has 21 letters, five of which are vowels, and four digraphs. The letters are (vowels in \"italics\"):\n\"a\", b, d, \"e\", f, g, h, \"i\", k, l, m, n, \"o\", p, r, s, t, \"u\", v, w, y\nThree of the digraphs (\u27e8ai\u27e9, \u27e8au\u27e9, and \u27e8oi\u27e9) denote diphthongs, while the fourth, \u27e8ng\u27e9, is used for both and .\nPhonology.\nTok Pisin has a smaller number of phonemes than its lexifier language, English. It has around 24 core phonemes: 5 vowels and around 19 consonants. This varies with the local substrate languages and the speaker's level of education. More educated speakers, and/or those where the substrate language(s) have larger phoneme inventories, may have as many as 10 distinct vowels.\nNasal plus plosive offsets lose the plosive element in Tok Pisin; e.g., English \"hand\" becomes Tok Pisin . Furthermore, voiced plosives become voiceless at the ends of words, so that English \"pig\" is rendered as in Tok Pisin.\nVowels.\nTok Pisin has five pure vowels:\nGrammar.\nThe verb has a suffix, (&lt; Eng. \"him\") to indicate transitivity (, \"look\"; , \"see\"). But some verbs, such as \"eat\", can be transitive without it. Tense is indicated by the separate words (future) (&lt; Eng. \"by and by\") and (past) (&lt; Eng. \"been\"). The present progressive tense is indicated by the word ; e.g., \"He is eating\".\nThe noun does not indicate number, though pronouns do.\nAdjectives usually take the suffix (now often pronounced , though more so for pronouns, and for adjectives; from \"fellow\") when modifying nouns; an exception is \"little\". It is also found on numerals and determiners:\nTok Pisin: \u2192 Eng. \"one\"\nTok Pisin: \u2192 Eng. \"two\"\nTok Pisin: \u2192 Eng. \"this bloke\"\nPronouns show person, number, and clusivity. The paradigm varies depending on the local languages; dual number is common, while the trial is less so. The largest Tok Pisin pronoun inventory is:\nReduplication is very common in Tok Pisin. Sometimes it is used as a method of derivation; sometimes words just have it. Some words are distinguished only by reduplication: \"ship\", \"sheep\".\nThere are only two proper prepositions: \nSome phrases are used as prepositions, such as ', \"in the middle of\".\nSeveral of these features derive from the common grammatical norms of Austronesian languages, usually in a simplified form. Other features, such as word order, are closer to English.\nSentences with a 3rd-person subject often put the word immediately before the verb. This may or may not be written separate from the verb, occasionally written as a prefix. Although the word is thought to be derived from \"he\" or \"is\", it is not itself a pronoun or a verb but a grammatical marker used in particular constructions, e.g., is \"car forbidden here\", i.e., \"no parking\".\nTense and aspect.\nPast tense: marked by (&lt; Eng. \"been\"):\n Tok Pisin: \n English: \"And the prime minister spoke thus.\"\nContinuative same tense is expressed through: verb + .\n Tok Pisin: .\n English: \"He/She is sleeping.\"\nCompletive or perfective aspect expressed through the word (&lt; Eng. \"finish\"):\n Tok Pisin: \n English: \"He had got out of the boat.\"\nTransitive words are expressed through (&lt; Eng. \"him\"):\n Tok Pisin: \n English: \"Finish your story now!\"\nFuture is expressed through the word \"\" (&lt; Eng. \"by and by\"):\n Tok Pisin: \n English: \"If you take just any nails that happen to be around, those will rust.\"\nDevelopment of Tok Pisin.\nTok Pisin developed out of regional dialects of the local inhabitants' languages and English, brought into the country when English speakers arrived. Four phases in Tok Pisin's development were laid out by Loreto Todd.\nTok Pisin is also known as a \"mixed\" language. This means that it consists of characteristics of different languages. Tok Pisin obtained most of its vocabulary from English (i.e., English is its lexifier). The origin of the syntax is a matter of debate. Edward Wolfers claimed that the syntax is from the substratum languages\u2014the languages of the local peoples. Derek Bickerton's analysis of creoles, on the other hand, claims that the syntax of creoles is imposed on the grammarless pidgin by its first native speakers: the children who grow up exposed to only a pidgin rather than a more developed language such as one of the local languages or English. In this analysis, the original syntax of creoles is in some sense the default grammar humans are born with.\nPidgins are less elaborated than non-Pidgin languages. Their typical characteristics found in Tok Pisin are:\nCircumlocution and synonyms.\nThe use of circumlocutions to compensate for limited vocabulary is a familiar process in pidgin languages. Tok Pisin is no different: consider \"bel i no laikim kaikai\" \"food intolerance\" (literally \"the belly does not like the food\"). In other cases, Tok Pisin speakers borrow words from other languages (most often English) to express unfamiliar concepts. \nThis frequent use of circumlocutions and borrowing of words for English has led to less frequently used words often possessing a large number of synonyms; toilet paper has three Tok Pisin terms: \"pepa bilong toilet\" (literally \"paper for the toilet\")\", pekpek pepa\" (literally \"feces paper\"), and \"toilet pepa\" (from English \"toilet paper\"). \nHowever, Tok Pisin has become especially known for its supposed use of very lengthy circumlocutions. Two commonly-cited examples relate to the piano and the helicopter. \nThe following Tok Pisin \"names\" for the piano were recorded by early 20th-century writers:\nLinguists observe that these circumlocutions are unstable \"ad hoc\" descriptions of an object, rather than set \"words\" or names. The situation is comparable to a Tok Pisin-English dictionary's definition of a Tok Pisin word with no English equivalent, such as \"milis\" being defined as \"coconut milk made from shedding coconut meat in the water of a ripe nut\"; nobody would suggest that this lengthy expression is the \"English name\" for this drink.225\nSecondly, it is often claimed that \"mixmaster bilong Jesus Christ\" is the Tok Pisin word for \"helicopter\" (the Sunbeam Mixmaster was an electric food processor popular in the United States and Australia). This factoid appeared as early as 1965 and still circulates online today. However, the phrase appears to be a fabrication by expatriates working in New Guinea.231 Linguists point out that helicopters, introduced to New Guinea by oil search teams, would have been far more familiar to early Tok Pisin speakers than electric food processors.\nVocabulary.\nMany words in the Tok Pisin language are derived from English (with Australian influences), indigenous Melanesian languages, and German (part of the country was under German rule until 1919). Some examples:\nExample text.\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in Tok Pisin:\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in English:\n\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The words \"Volk\" and \"v\u00f6lkisch\" conveyed the meanings of \"folk\".\nEthnic Germans living outside Germany shed their identity as \"Auslandsdeutsche\" (Germans abroad), and morphed into the in a process of self-radicalisation. This process gave the Nazi regime the nucleus around which the new Volksgemeinschaft was established across the German borders.\n were further divided into \"racial\" groups\u00a0\u2013 minorities within a state minority\u00a0\u2013 based on special cultural, social, and historic criteria elaborated by the Nazis.\nOrigin of the term \"Volksdeutsche\".\nAccording to the historian Doris Bergen, Adolf Hitler coined the definition of which appeared in a 1938 memorandum of the German Reich Chancellery. That document defined as \"people whose language and culture had German origins but who did not hold German citizenship\". After 1945, the Nazi citizenship laws of 1935 (Reichsb\u00fcrgergesetz)\u00a0\u2013 and the associated regulations that referred to the National Socialist concepts of blood and race in connection with the concept of \"volksdeutsch\"\u00a0\u2013 were rescinded in Germany.\nFor Adolf Hitler and the other ethnic Germans of his time, the term \"\" also carried overtones of blood and race not captured in the common English translation \"ethnic Germans\". According to German estimates in the 1930s, about 30 million and Auslandsdeutsche (German citizens residing abroad) lived outside the Reich. A significant proportion of them were in Eastern Europe \u2013 i.e., Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, where many were located in villages along the Danube and in Russia.\nThe Nazi goal of expansion assigned the a special role in German plans, to bring them back to German citizenship and to elevate them to power over the native populations in those areas. The Nazis detailed such goals in .\nIn some areas, such as in Poland, Nazi authorities compiled specific lists and registered people as ethnic Germans in the \"Deutsche Volksliste\".\nHistorical background.\nIn the sixteenth century Vasili III invited small numbers of craftsmen, traders and professionals to settle in Russia from areas that would later become Germany so that Muscovy could exploit their skills. These settlers (many of whom intended to stay only temporarily) were generally confined to the German Quarter in Moscow (which also included Dutch, British and other western or northern European settlers whom the Russians came to indiscriminately refer to as \"Germans\"). They were only gradually allowed in other cities, so as to prevent the spread of alien ideas to the general population.\nIn his youth, Peter the Great spent much time in the 'German' quarter. When he became Tsar, he brought more German experts (and other foreigners) into Russia, and particularly into government service, in his attempts to westernise the empire. He also brought in German engineers to supervise the construction of the new city of Saint Petersburg. Catherine the Great, herself ethnically German, invited Germanic farmers to immigrate and settle in Russian lands along the Volga River. She guaranteed them the right to retain their language, religion and culture.\nAlso in other areas with an ethnic German minority people of other than German descent assimilated with the ethnic German culture and formed then a part of the minority. Examples are people of Baltic and Scandinavian descent, who assimilated into the minority of the Baltic Germans. Jews of Posen province, Galicia, Bukovina and Bohemia, with their Yiddish culture derived in part from their German heritage, often mingled into the ethnic German culture, thus forming part of the various ethnic German minorities. But anti-Semitic Nazis later rejected Jewish ethnic Germans and all Jewish German citizens as \"racially\" German.\nEthnic Germans were also sent in organised colonisation attempts aiming at Germanisation of conquered Polish areas. Frederick the Great (reigned 1740\u20131786) settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia, acquired in the First Partition of Poland of 1772, with the intention of replacing the Polish nobility. He treated the Poles with contempt and likened the \"slovenly Polish trash\" in newly occupied West Prussia to Iroquois, the historic Native American confederacy based in what is now the state of New York.\nPrussia encouraged a second round of colonisation with the goal of Germanisation after 1832. Prussia passed laws to encourage Germanisation of the Prussian Partition including the provinces of Posen and West Prussia in the late 19th century. The Prussian Settlement Commission relocated 154,000 colonists, including locals.\nTreaty of Versailles.\nThe reconstitution of Poland following the Treaty of Versailles (1919) made ethnic German minorities of some Prussian provinces of the German Empire citizens of the Polish nation state. Ethnic German inhabitants of provinces of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Bukovina Germans, Danube Swabians, Sudeten Germans and Transylvanian Saxons, became citizens of newly established Slavic or Magyar nation-states and of Romania. Tensions between the new administration and the ethnic German minority arose in the Polish Corridor. The Austrian Germans also found themselves not allowed to join Germany as German Austria was strictly forbidden to join Germany as well as the name \"German Austria\" was forbidden so the name was changed back to just \"Austria\" and the First Austrian Republic was created in 1919.\nThe Nazi era before World War II.\nDuring the Nazi years, the German Nazis used the term \"Volksdeutsche\", by which they meant racially German since they believed in a German 'race' or 'Volk', to refer to foreign nationals of some German ethnicity living in countries newly occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Prior to World War II, more than 10 million ethnic Germans lived in Central and Eastern Europe. They constituted an important minority far into Russia. Because of widespread assimilation some people whom the Nazis called Volksdeutsche could no longer speak German and in fact were culturally regionalized as Poles, Hungarians, Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, etc.\nPre-war relations with the Nazis.\nIn 1931, prior to its rise to power, the Nazi party established the Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP/AO (Foreign Organisation of the Nazi Party), whose task it was to disseminate Nazi propaganda among the ethnic German minorities viewed as Volksdeutsche in Nazi ideology. In 1936, the government set up the \"Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle\" (Ethnic Germans' Liaison Office), commonly known as VoMi, under the jurisdiction of the SS as the liaison bureau. It was headed by SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Werner Lorenz.\nAccording to the historian Valdis Lumans,\n\"[one of Himmler's goals was] centralising control over the myriad of groups and individuals inside the Reich promoting the Volksdeutsche cause. Himmler did not initiate the process but rather discovered it in progress and directed it to its conclusion and to his advantage. His principal instrument in this effort was an office from outside the SS, a Nazi party organ, the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi), translated as the Ethnic German Liaison Office.\"\nInternal propaganda.\nNazi propaganda used the existence of ethnic Germans who they called in foreign lands before and during the war, to help justify the aggression of Nazi Germany. The annexation of Poland was presented as necessary to protect the ethnic German minorities there. Massacres of ethnic Germans, such as Bloody Sunday, or alleged atrocities, were used in such propaganda, and the film \"Heimkehr\" drew on such putative events as the rescue of by the arrival of German tanks. \"Heimkehr\"'s introduction explicitly states that hundreds of thousands of Poles of German ethnicity suffered as the characters in the film did.\n\"Menschen im Sturm\" reprised \"Heimkehr\"'s effort to justify the invasion of Slavonia, using many of the same atrocities. In \"The Red Terror\", a Baltic German is able to avenge her family's deaths, but commits suicide after, unable to live with meaning in the Soviet Union. \"Fl\u00fcchtlinge\" depicted the sufferings of Volga German refugees in Manchuria, and how a heroic blond leader saved them; it was the first movie to win the state prize. \"Frisians in Peril\" depicted the suffering of a village of Volga Germans in the Soviet Union; it also depicted the murder of a young woman for an affair with a Russian\u00a0\u2013 in accordance with Nazi principle of \"Rassenschande\"\u00a0\u2013 as an ancient German custom.\nSexual contact between what the Nazis viewed as different 'races' followed by remorse and guilt was also featured in \"Die goldene Stadt\", where the Sudeten German heroine faces not persecution but the allure of the big city; when she succumbs, in defiance of blood and soil, she is seduced and abandoned by a Czech, and such a relationship leads to her drowning herself.\nCollaboration with the Nazis.\nBefore and during World War II, some ethnic Germans gathered around local Nazi organizations (sponsored financially by the German Foreign Office), actively supported the Nazis in countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. During the social and economic tensions of the Great Depression, some had begun to feel aggrieved with their minority status. They participated in espionage, sabotage and other fifth column means in their countries of origin, trained and commanded by Abwehr. In November 1938 Nazi Germany organized German paramilitary units made out German minority members in Polish Pomerania that were to engage in diversion, sabotage as well as political murder and ethnic cleansing upon German invasion of Poland.\nReich intelligence actively recruited ethnic Germans, and the Nazi secret service \"SicherheitsDienst\" (SD) formed them as early as October 1938 into armed unit that were to serve Nazi Germany.\nHistorian Matthias Fiedler typified ethnic German collaborationists as former \"nobodies\" whose major occupation was the expropriation of Jewish property. Heinrich Himmler remarked that whatever objections ethnic Germans might have against serving in the Waffen-SS, they would be conscripted in any case. According to head of recruitment for the Waffen SS, Gottlob Berger, no one in Germany or elsewhere cared for what happened to the ethnic Germans anyway, which made recruitment easy forced upon ethnic German communities.\nAmong the indigenous populations in the Nazi-occupied lands, became a term of ignominy.\nDuring the early years of the Second World War, before the US entered the war, a small number of Americans of German origin returned to Germany; generally they were immigrants or children of immigrants, rather than descendants of migrations more distant in time. Some of these enlisted and fought in the German army. \nDuring World War II.\nEthnic Germans throughout Europe benefited financially during World War II from the Nazi policies of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and profited from the expulsion and murder of their non-German neighbors throughout Eastern Europe. For example, in Ukraine the directly participated in the Holocaust and were involved in deportation of local farmers and their families; figures like Arthur Boss from Odessa (Blobel's right-hand man) or the Becker brothers became an integral part of the Nazi Holocaust machine.\n'Volksdeutsche' in German-occupied western Poland.\nIn September 1939 in German occupied Poland, an armed ethnic German militia called \"Selbstschutz\" (Self-Defence) was created. It organised the mass murder of Polish elites in Operation Tannenberg. At the beginning of 1940, the \"Selbstschutz\" organization was disbanded, and its members transferred to various units of the SS, Gestapo and the German police. Throughout the invasion of Poland, some ethnic German minority groups assisted Nazi Germany in the war effort: they committed sabotage, diverted regular forces and committed numerous atrocities against civilian population.\nAfter Germany occupied western Poland, it established a central registration bureau, called the German People's List (\"Deutsche Volksliste\", DVL), whereby Poles of German ethnicity were registered as . The German occupants encouraged such registration, in many cases forcing it or subjecting Poles of German ethnicity to terror assaults if they refused. Those who joined this group were given benefits including better food, as well as a better social status.\nThe Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle organised large-scale looting of property and redistributed goods to the Volksdeutsche. They were given apartments, workshops, farms, furniture, and clothing confiscated from Jews and Poles. In turn, hundreds of thousands of the Volksdeutsche joined the German forces, either willingly or under compulsion.\nDuring World War II, the Polish citizens of German ancestry that identified with the Polish nation faced the dilemma whether to register in the Deutsche Volksliste. Many families had lived in Poland for centuries and more-recent immigrants had arrived over 30 years before the war. They faced the choice of registering and being regarded as traitors by the Poles, or not signing and being treated by the Nazi occupation as traitors to the Germanic race. Polish Silesian Catholic Church authorities, led by bishop Stanis\u0142aw Adamski and with agreement from the Polish Government in Exile, advised Poles to sign up to the Volksliste in order to avoid atrocities and mass murder that happened in other parts of the country.\nIn occupied Poland, \"Volksdeutscher\" enjoyed privileges and were subject to conscription, or draft, into the German army. In occupied Pomerania, the Gauleiter of the Danzig-West Prussia region Albert Forster ordered a list of people considered of German ethnicity to be made in 1941. Due to insignificant voluntary registrations by February 1942, Forster made signing the \"Volksliste\" mandatory and empowered local authorities to use force and threats to implement the decree. Consequently, the number of signatories rose to almost a million, or about 55% of the 1944 population.\nThe special case of Polish Pomerania, where terror against civilians was particularly intense, and where, unlike in rest of occupied Poland, signing of the list was mandatory for many people, was recognised by the Polish Underground State and other anti-Nazi resistance movements, which tried to explain the situation to other Poles in underground publications.\nThe Deutsche Volksliste categorised non-Jewish Poles of German ethnicity into one of four categories:\nVolksdeutsche of statuses 1 and 2 in the Polish areas annexed by Germany numbered 1 million, and Nos. 3 and 4 numbered 1.7 million. In the General Government there were 120,000 Volksdeutsche. Volksdeutsche of Polish ethnic origins were treated by the Poles with special contempt.\nBecause of actions by some and particularly the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, after the end of the war, the Polish authorities tried many for high treason. In the postwar period, many other ethnic Germans were expelled to the west and forced to leave everything. In post-war Poland, the word is regarded as an insult, synonymous with \"traitor\".\nIn some cases, individuals consulted the Polish resistance first, before signing the Volksliste. There were who played important roles in intelligence activities of the Polish resistance, and were at times the primary source of information for the Allies. Particularly in Polish Pomerania and Polish Silesia, many of the people who were forced to sign the Volksliste played crucial roles in the anti-Nazi underground, which was noted in a memo to the Polish Government in Exile which stated \"In Wielkopolska there's bitter hatred of the while in Silesia and Polish Pomerania it's the opposite, the secret organization depends in large measure on the \" (the memo referred to those of Category III, not I and II). In the turmoil of the postwar years, the Communist government did not consider this sufficient mitigation. It prosecuted many double-agent and sentenced some to death.\nVolksdeutsche in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939\u20131940.\nThe secret protocols of Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact created domestic problems for Hitler. Supporting the Soviet invasion became one of the most ideologically difficult aspects of the countries' relationship. The secret protocols caused Hitler to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, who had lived in the Baltic countries for centuries and now classified as Volksdeutsche, while officially condoning the invasions. When the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them.\nIn August 1940, Soviet Foreign minister Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them North Bukovina. Germany wanted guarantees of the safety of property of ethnic Germans, security for the 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and North Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.\nIn October 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union negotiated about the Volksdeutsche in Soviet-occupied territories and their property. Instead of permitting full indemnification, the Soviets put restrictions on the wealth that the Volksdeutsche could take with them and limited the totals that the Soviets would apply to the Reich's clearing accounts. The parties discussed total compensation of between 200 million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 and 350 million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 for the Volksdeutsche, while the Soviets requested 50 million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 for their property claims in German-occupied territories. The two nations reached general agreement on German shipments of 10.5-cm flak cannons, gold, machinery and other items.\nOn 10 January 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the German\u2013Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement to settle all of the open disputes which the Soviets had argued. The agreement covered protected migration to Germany within two and a half months of Volksdeutsche, and similar migration to the Soviet Union of ethnic Russians, Baltic and \"White Russian\" \"nationals\" from German-held territories. In many cases, the resulting population transfers resulted in resettlement of Volksdeutsche on land previously held by ethnic Poles or Jews in now German-occupied territories. The agreement formally defined the border between Germany and the Soviet Union areas between the Igorka River and the Baltic Sea.\nAfter the German invasion of the USSR.\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the government granted the Volga Germans an autonomous republic. Joseph Stalin abolished the Volga German ASSR after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR. Most of Soviet Germans in the USSR were to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia by Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of August 28, 1941, and from the beginning of 1942 those Soviet Germans who were deemed suitable for hard work (men aged from 15 to 55 and women from 16 to 45) were mobilised for forced labour into \"Working columns\" where they lived in a prison-like environment, and sometimes, together with regular inmates, were put in prison camps. Hundreds of thousands died or became incapacitated due to the harsh conditions.\nVolksdeutsche in Hungary.\nA significant portion of in Hungary joined the SS, which was a pattern repeated also in Romania (with 54,000 locals serving in the SS by the end of 1943). The majority of 200,000 from the area of Danube who served with the SS were from Hungary. As early as 1942, some 18,000 Hungarian Germans joined the SS. they have been called Danube Swabians. After World War II, approximately 185,000 in the Volksbund fled from the region. They were called 'Svabo' by their Serbian, Hungarian, Croatian, and Romanian neighbors. Most of the Danube Swabians who were not members in the so-called \"Volksbund\" were expelled to Allied-occupied Germany and Allied-occupied Austria in 1946\u20131948, following the Potsdam Agreement.\nVolksdeutsche in Romania.\nAfter Romania acquired parts of Soviet Ukraine, the Germans there came under the authority of the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, which deployed SS personnel to several settlements. They eventually contained German mayors, farms, schools and ethnic German paramilitary groups functioning as police called \"Selbstschutz\" (\"Self-protection\"). German colonists and \"Selbstschutz\" forces engaged in extensive acts of ethnic cleansing, massacring Jewish and Roma populations.\nIn the German colony of Shonfeld, Romas were burned in farms. During the winter of 1941/1942, German \"Selbstschutz\" units participated in the shooting, together with Ukrainian People's Militia and Romanian gendarmes, of some 18,000 Jews. In the camp of Bogdanovka, tens of thousands of Jews were subject to mass shootings, barn burnings and killing by hand grenades.\nHeinrich Himmler was sufficiently impressed by the Volksdeutsche communities and the work of the Selbstschutz to order that these methods be copied in Ukraine.\n'Volksdeutsche' in Serbia and Croatia.\nIn the former Yugoslavia, the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen was formed with about 50,000 ethnic Germans from the Banat region of Serbia. It was conspicuous in its operations against the Yugoslav Partisans and civilian population. About 100,000 ethnic Germans from the Nazi-conquered former Yugoslavia joined the German Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, the majority conscripted involuntarily as judged by the Nuremberg Trials. Yet \"[a]fter the initial rush of Volksdeutsche to join, voluntary enlistments tapered off, and the new unit did not reach division size. Therefore, in August 1941, the SS discarded the voluntary approach, and after a favourable judgement from the SS court in Belgrade, imposed a mandatory military obligation on all Volksdeutsche in Serbia-Banat, the first of its kind for non-Reich Germans.\"In the former Yugoslavia a majority of ethnic Germans became members of the \"Schw\u00e4bisch-Deutscher Kulturbund\" (Swabian German Cultural Association), and reprisals on this group by Tito's partisans resulted in many immediate revenge killings in 1944 and incarceration of approximately 150,000 ethnic Germans in 1945.\nExpulsion and exodus from Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the war.\nMost ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from European countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary) under the Potsdam Agreement from 1945 to 1948 towards the end and after the war. Those who became ethnic Germans, by registering in the Deutsche Volksliste and Reichsdeutsche, retained German citizenship during the years of Allied military occupation. Citizenship was further retained after the establishment of East Germany and West Germany in 1949, and later in the reunified Germany. In 1953 the Federal Republic of Germany \u2013 by its Federal Expellee Law \u2013 naturalised many more East European nationals of German ethnicity, who were neither German citizens nor had enrolled in any 'Volksliste', but had been stranded as refugees in West Germany and fled or were expelled due to their German or alleged German ethnicity.\nAn estimated 12 million people fled or were expelled from the Soviet Union and non-German-speaking Central Europe, many of them being 'Volksdeutsche'. Most left the Soviet-occupied territories of Central and Eastern Europe; they comprised the largest migration of any European people in modern history. The then three Allies had agreed to the expulsions during negotiations in the midst of war. The western powers hoped to avoid ethnic Germans being an issue again in Central and Eastern Europe. The three Allies at the Conference of Potsdam considered the \"transfer\" of \"German populations\" from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary an effort to be undertaken (see article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement), although they asked a halt because of the inflicted burden for the Allies to feed and house the destitute expellees and to share that burden among the Allies. France, which was not represented in Potsdam, rejected the decision of the Three of Potsdam and did not absorb expellees in its zone of occupation. The three Allies had to accept the reality on the ground, since expulsions of Volksdeutsche and Central and Eastern European nationals of German or alleged German ethnicity who never had enrolled as Volksdeutsche, were going on already.\nLocal authorities forced most of the remaining ethnic Germans to leave between 1945 and 1950. Remnants of the ethnic German community survive in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. A significant ethnic German community has continued in Siebenb\u00fcrgen (Transylvania) in Romania and in Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia) but most of it migrated to West Germany throughout the 1980s. There are also remnant German populations near Mukachevo in western Ukraine.\nLegacy.\nThe term Volksdeutsche is generally avoided today due to its usage by the Nazis.\nInstead, ethnic Germans of foreign citizenship living outside of Germany are called \"Deutsche Minderheit\" (meaning \"German minority\"), or names more closely associated with their earlier places of residence, such as \"Wolgadeutsche\" or Volga Germans, the ethnic Germans living in the Volga basin in Russia; and Baltic Germans, who generally called themselves Balts, and \"Estl\u00e4nder\" in Estonia. They were relocated to German-occupied Poland during World War II by an agreement between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and most were expelled to the West after the war, under the Potsdam Agreement.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71965", "revid": "50836593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71965", "title": "Jack Johnson (boxer)", "text": "American boxer (1878\u20131946)\nJohn Arthur Johnson (March 31, 1878 \u2013 June 10, 1946), nicknamed the \"Galveston Giant\", was an American boxer who, at the height of the Jim Crow era, became the first black world heavyweight boxing champion (1908\u20131915). His 1910 fight against James J. Jeffries was dubbed the \"fight of the century\". Johnson defeated Jeffries, who was white, triggering dozens of race riots across the U.S. According to filmmaker Ken Burns, \"for more than thirteen years, Jack Johnson was the most famous and the most notorious African American on Earth\". He is widely regarded as one of the most influential boxers in history.\nIn 1912, Johnson opened a successful and luxurious \"black and tan\" (desegregated) restaurant and nightclub in Chicago, which in part was run by his wife, a white woman. Major newspapers of the time soon claimed that Johnson was attacked by the Federal government only after he became famous as a black man married to a white woman, and was linked to other white women. Johnson was arrested on charges of violating the Federal Mann Act\u2014forbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for \"immoral purposes\"\u2014a racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships, including marriages. Sentenced to a year in prison, Johnson fled the country and fought boxing matches abroad for seven years until 1920, when he served his sentence at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth.\nJohnson continued taking paying fights for many years, and operated several other businesses, including lucrative endorsement deals. He died in a car crash in 1946 at the age of 68. In 2018, Johnson was posthumously pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born on March 31, 1878, the third child of nine born to Henry and Tina Johnson, former slaves who worked service jobs as a janitor and a dishwasher. His father had served as a civilian teamster of the Union's 38th Colored Infantry. He was described by his son as the \"most perfect physical specimen that he had ever seen\", although Henry had been left with an atrophied right leg from his service in the American Civil War. \nGrowing up in Galveston, Texas, Johnson attended five years of school. As a young man, Johnson was frail, though, like all of his siblings, he was expected to work.\nAlthough Johnson grew up in the South, he said that segregation was not an issue in the somewhat secluded city of Galveston, as everyone living in the 12th Ward was poor and went through the same struggles. Johnson remembers growing up with a \"gang\" of white boys, in which he never felt victimized or excluded. Remembering his childhood, Johnson said: \"As I grew up, the white boys were my friends and my pals. I ate with them, played with them and slept at their homes. Their mothers gave me cookies, and I ate at their tables. No one ever taught me that white men were superior to me.\"\n Jack Johnson's mother Tina was a huge influence in Jack's life. When Jack was younger he was known as a coward, and his sister Lucy would protect him. After Jack came home bruised and crying, his mom warned him that if he were to get beat at school, then she would whip him worse at home. Her method was to scare him and for him to learn the lesson that he needed to protect himself. The lesson was received by Jack, as he never lost a fight to a schoolboy again.\nAfter Johnson quit school, he began a job working at the local docks. He made several other attempts at working other jobs around town until one day he made his way to Dallas, finding work at the race track exercising horses. Jack stuck with this job until he found a new apprenticeship with a carriage painter by the name of Walter Lewis. Lewis enjoyed watching friends spar, and Johnson began to learn how to box. Johnson later declared that it was thanks to Lewis that he became a boxer. \nAt 16, Johnson moved to New York City and found living arrangements with Barbados Joe Walcott, a welterweight fighter from the West Indies. Johnson again found work exercising horses for the local stable, until he was fired for exhausting a horse. On his return to Galveston, he was hired as a janitor at a gym owned by German-born heavyweight fighter Herman Bernau. Johnson eventually saved enough money to buy boxing gloves, sparring every chance he got.\nAt one point, Johnson was arrested for brawling with a man named Davie Pearson, a \"grown and toughened\" man who accused Johnson of turning him in to the police over a game of craps. When both of them were released from jail, they met at the docks, and Johnson beat Pearson before a large crowd. Johnson then fought in a summer boxing league against a man named John \"Must Have It\" Lee. Because prizefighting was illegal in Texas, the fight was broken up and moved to the beach, where Johnson won his first fight and a prize of one dollar and fifty cents.\nBoxing career.\nJohnson made his debut as a professional boxer on November 1, 1898, in Galveston, when he knocked out Charley Brooks in the second round of a 15-round bout, billed for \"The Texas State Middleweight Title\". In his third pro fight on May 8, 1899, he faced John \"Klondike\" Haynes, an African American heavyweight known as \"The Black Hercules\", in Chicago. Klondike (so called as he was considered a rarity, like the gold in the Klondike), who had declared himself the \"Black Heavyweight Champ\", won on a technical knockout (TKO) in the fifth round of a scheduled six-rounder.\nJohnson vs. Choynski.\nOn February 25, 1901, Johnson fought Joe Choynski in Galveston. Choynski, a popular and experienced heavyweight, knocked out Johnson in the third round. Prizefighting was illegal in Texas at the time and they were both arrested. Bail was set at $5,000, nearly $200,000 in 2023, which neither could afford. The sheriff permitted both fighters to go home at night so long as they agreed to spar in the jail cell. Large crowds gathered to watch the sessions. After 23 days in jail, their bail was reduced to an affordable level and a grand jury refused to indict either man. Johnson later stated that he learned his boxing skills during that jail time. The two would remain friends.\nJohnson attested that his success in boxing came from the coaching he received from Choynski. The aging Choynski saw natural talent and determination in Johnson and taught him the nuances of defense, stating: \"A man who can move like you should never have to take a punch\".\nWorld colored heavyweight champ.\nBy 1903, though Johnson's official record showed him with nine wins against three losses, five draws and two no contests, he had won at least 50 fights against both white and black opponents. Johnson won his first title on February 3, 1903, beating Denver Ed Martin on points in a 20-round match for the World Colored Heavyweight Championship. Johnson held the title until it was vacated when he won the world heavyweight title from Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia on Boxing Day 1908. His reign of 2,151 days was the third longest in the 60-year-long history of the colored heavyweight title. Only Harry Wills at 3,103 days and Peter Jackson at 3,041 days held the title longer. A three-time colored heavyweight champion, Wills held the title for a total of 3,351 days.\nJohnson defended the colored heavyweight title 12 times, which was second only to the 26 times Wills defended the title. While colored champ, he defeated colored ex-champs Denver Ed Martin and Frank Childs again and beat future colored heavyweight champs Sam McVey three times and Sam Langford once. He beat Langford on points in a 15-rounder and never gave him another shot at the title, when he was either colored champ or the world heavyweight champ.\nJohnson vs. Jeanette &amp; Langford.\nJohnson fought Joe Jeanette a total of seven times, all during his reign as colored champion before he became the world's heavyweight champion, winning four times and drawing twice (three of the victories and one draw were newspaper decisions).\nAfter Johnson became the first African-American Heavyweight Champion of the World on December\u00a026, 1908, his World Colored Heavyweight Championship was vacated. Jeanette fought Sam McVey for the title in Paris on February 20, 1909, and was beaten, but he later took the title from McVey in a 49-round bout on April 17 of that year in Paris for a $6,000 purse. \nDuring his reign as world champion, Johnson never again fought Jeanette, despite numerous challenges, and avoided Langford, who won the colored title a record five times. In 1906 Jack Johnson fought Sam Langford. Langford took severe punishment and was knocked down 3 times; however, he lasted the 15-round distance.\nOn November 27, 1945, Johnson finally stepped back into the ring with Joe Jeanette. \nWorld heavyweight champion.\nJohnson's efforts to win the world heavyweight title were initially thwarted, as at the time world heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries refused to face him, and retired instead. However, Johnson did fight former champion Bob Fitzsimmons in July 1907, and knocked him out in two rounds.\nJohnson finally won the world heavyweight title on December 26, 1908, a full six years after lightweight champion Joe Gans became the first African American boxing champion. Johnson's victory over the reigning world champion, Canadian Tommy Burns, at the Sydney Stadium in Australia, came after following Burns around the world for two years and taunting him in the press for a match. Burns agreed to fight Johnson only after promoters guaranteed him $30,000. The fight lasted fourteen rounds before being stopped by the police in front of over 20,000 spectators, and Johnson was named the winner.\nAfter Johnson's victory over Burns, racial animosity among whites ran so deep that some, including renowned American author Jack London, called for a \"Great White Hope\" to take the title away from Johnson. While Johnson was heavyweight champion, he was covered more in the press than all other notable black men combined. The lead-up to the bout was peppered with racist press against Johnson. An editorial in the \"New York Times\" (\"Pugilists as Race Champions\") expressed a concern that the fight would \"have the deplorable effect of intensifying racial antagonisms and of making race problems more difficult of solution\": If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbors. If the negro loses, the members of his race will be taunted and irritated [provoked] because of their champion's downfall.As title holder, Johnson thus had to face a series of fighters each billed by boxing promoters as a \"great white hope\", often in exhibition matches. In 1909, he beat Tony Ross, Al Kaufman, and the middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel.\nKetchel and Johnson were friends. The match with Ketchel was originally thought to have been an exhibition, and in fact it was fought by both men that way, until the 12th round, when Ketchel threw a right to Johnson's head, knocking him down. Quickly regaining his feet, and very annoyed, Johnson immediately dashed straight at Ketchell and threw a single punch, an uppercut, a punch for which he was famous, to Ketchel's jaw, knocking him out. The punch knocked out Ketchell's front teeth; Johnson can be seen on film removing them from his glove, where they had been embedded.\n\"Fight of the Century\".\nIn 1910, former undefeated heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries came out of retirement to challenge Johnson, saying \"I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a Negro\". He had not fought in six years and he also had to lose well over 100 pounds to get back to his championship fighting weight. Efforts to persuade Jeffries to \"retrieve the honor of the white race\" began immediately after the Burns\u2013Johnson fight. Initially Jeffries had no interest in the fight, being quite happy as an alfalfa farmer. On October 29, 1909, Johnson and Jeffries signed an agreement to \"box for the heavyweight championship of the world\" and called promoters to bid for the right to orchestrate the event.\nIn early December 1909, Johnson and Jeffries selected a bid from the nation's top boxing promoters\u2014Tex Rickard and John Gleason. The bid guaranteed a purse of $101,000 () to be divided 75 percent to the winner and 25 percent to the loser, as well as two-thirds of the revenues collected from the sales of the right to film the fight (each boxer received one third of the equity rights). Although it was well understood that a victory for Jeffries was likely to be more profitable than a victory for Johnson, there were no doubts that either way the event would produce record profits. Legal historian Barak Orbach argues that in \"an industry that promoted events through the dramatization of rivalries, a championship contest between an iconic representative of the white race and the most notorious [black fighter] was a gold mine\".\nJeffries mostly remained hidden from media attention until the day of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he would only lose if he had a lack of skill on the day of the fight. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, \"It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible.\" While his wife added, \"I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight.\" Johnson's words were \"May the best man win.\"\nRacial tension was brewing in the lead up to the fight and to prevent any harm from coming to either boxer, guns were prohibited within the arena along with the sale of alcohol and anyone who was under the effects of alcohol. Apples and all other potential weapons were barred. Behind the racial attitudes which were being instigated by the media was a major investment in gambling for the fight, with 10\u20137 odds in favor of Jeffries.\nThe fight took place on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 people, at a ring which was built just for the occasion in downtown Reno, Nevada. Jeffries proved unable to impose his will on the younger champion and Johnson dominated the fight. By the 15th round, after Jeffries had been knocked down twice for the first time in his career, Jeffries' corner threw in the towel to end the fight and prevent Jeffries from having a knockout on his record.\nJohnson later remarked he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut and saw the look on Jeffries face, stating, \"I knew what that look meant. The old ship was sinking.\" Afterwards, Jeffries was humbled by the loss and what he had seen of Johnson in their match. \"I could never have whipped Johnson at my best,\" Jeffries said. \"I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years.\"\nThe \"Fight of the Century\" earned Johnson $65,000 (over $ million in 2024 dollars) and silenced the critics, who had belittled Johnson's previous victory over Tommy Burns as \"empty\", claiming that Burns was a false champion since Jeffries had retired undefeated. John L. Sullivan commented after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly and convincingly,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fight of the century is over and a black man is the undisputed champion of the world. It was a poor fight as fights go, this less than 15-round affair between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Scarcely has there ever been a championship contest that was so one-sided. All of Jeffries much-vaunted condition amounted to nothing. He wasn't in it from the first bell tap to the last\u00a0... The negro had few friends, but there was little demonstration against him. (Spectators) could not help but admire Johnson because he is the type of prizefighter that is admired by sportsmen. He played fairly at all times and fought fairly.\u00a0... What a crafty, powerful, cunning left hand (Johnson) has. He is one of the craftiest, cunningest boxers that ever stepped into the ring.\u00a0... They both fought closely all during the 15 rounds. It was just the sort of fight that Jeffries wanted. There was no running or ducking like Corbett did with me in New Orleans (1892). Jeffries did not miss so many blows, because he hardly started any. Johnson was on top of him all the time... (Johnson) didn't get gay at all with Jeffries in the beginning, and it was always the white man who clinched, but Johnson was very careful, and he backed away and took no chances, and was good-natured with it all\u00a0... The best man won, and I was one of the first to congratulate him, and also one of the first to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the beaten man.\nRiots and aftermath.\nThe outcome of the fight triggered race riots that evening\u2014the Fourth of July\u2014all across the United States, from Texas and Colorado to New York and Washington, D.C. Johnson's victory over Jeffries had dashed white dreams of finding a \"great white hope\" to defeat him. Many whites felt humiliated by the defeat of Jeffries.\nBlack Americans, on the other hand, were jubilant and celebrated Johnson's great victory as a victory for racial advancement. Black poet William Waring Cuney later highlighted the black reaction to the fight in his poem \"My Lord, What a Morning\".\nRace riots erupted in New York, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlanta, St. Louis, Little Rock and Houston. In all, riots occurred in more than 25 states and 50 cities. At least twenty people were killed in the riots and hundreds more were injured.\nFilm of the bout.\n\"The Johnson\u2013Jeffries Fight\" film received more public attention in the United States than any other film to date and for the next five years, until the release of \"The Birth of a Nation\". In the United States, many states and cities banned the exhibition of the Johnson\u2013Jeffries film. The movement to censor Johnson's victory took over the country within three days after the fight.\nTwo weeks after the match former President Theodore Roosevelt, an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for \"The Outlook\" in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in the US. He cited the \"crookedness\" and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have \"introduced a new method of money getting and of demoralization\". \nIn 2005, the film of the Jeffries\u2013Johnson \"Fight of the Century\" was entered into the United States National Film Registry as being worthy of preservation.\nThe six fights for which the major films were made, starring Johnson, were\nMaintaining the Color Bar.\nThe color bar remained in effect even under Johnson. Once he was the world's heavyweight champ, Johnson did not fight a black opponent for the first five years of his reign. He denied matches to black heavyweights Joe Jeanette, one of his successors as colored heavyweight champ, Sam Langford, who beat Jeanette for the colored title and the young Harry Wills, who was colored heavyweight champ during the last year of Johnson's reign as world's heavyweight champ.\nBlack fighters were not given a chance at the title because Johnson maintained that he could make more money fighting White boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared the end of his reign as world heavyweight champ, there were rumors that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it did not happen. Johnson alleged that Langford was unable to raise the $30,000 for his guarantee.\nBecause Black boxers, with the exception of Johnson, had been barred from fighting for the heavyweight championship, Johnson's refusal to fight African-Americans offended the African-American community, since the opportunity to fight top white boxers was rare. Jeanette criticized Johnson, saying, \"Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.\"\nJohnson v. Johnson.\nWhen Johnson finally agreed to take on a Black opponent in late 1913, it was not Sam Langford the current colored heavyweight champion that he gave the title shot to. Instead, Johnson chose to take on Battling Jim Johnson, a lesser-known boxer who in 1910 had lost to Langford and had a draw and loss via KO to Sam McVey, the former colored champ. Battling Jim fought former colored champ Joe Jeanette four times between July 19, 1912, and January 21, 1913, and lost all four fights. The only fighter of note who he did beat during that period was the future Colored champ Big Bill Tate, whom he KO-ed in the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout. It was Tate's third pro fight.\nIn November 1913, the International Boxing Union had declared the world heavyweight title held by Jack Johnson to be vacant. The fight, scheduled for 10 rounds, was held on December 19, 1913, in Paris. It was the first time in history that two black people had fought for the world heavyweight championship\nJack Johnson, the heavyweight champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, met in a 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested throughout that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that it was observed that he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over, he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.\nBecause of the draw, Jack Johnson kept his championship. After the fight, he explained that his left arm was injured in the third round and he could not use it.\nTitle loss.\nOn April 5, 1915, Johnson lost his title to Jess Willard, a working cowboy from Kansas who started boxing when he was 27 years old. With a crowd of 25,000 at Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba, Johnson was knocked out in the 26th round of the scheduled 45 round fight. \nJohnson is said by many a year after the fight to have spread rumors that he took a dive, but Willard is widely regarded as having won the fight outright. Many people thought Johnson purposely threw the fight because Willard was white, in an effort to have his Mann Act charges dropped. Willard ironically responded, \"If he was going to throw the fight, I wish he'd done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there.\"\nPost-championship.\nAfter losing his world heavyweight championship, Johnson never again fought for the world or colored heavyweight crowns. His popularity remained strong enough that he recorded for Ajax Records in the 1920s. Johnson continued fighting, but age was catching up with him. He fought professionally until 1938 at age 60 when he lost 7 of his last 9 bouts, losing his final fight to Walter Price by a 7th-round TKO. It is often suggested that any bouts after the age of 40\u2014which was a very venerable age for boxing in those days\u2014not be counted on his actual record, since he was performing in order to make a living.\nHe also indulged in what was known as \"cellar\" fighting, where the bouts, unadvertised, were fought for private audiences, usually in cellars or other unrecognized places. There are surviving photographs of one of these fights. Johnson made his final ring appearance at age 67 on November 27, 1945, fighting three one-minute exhibition rounds against two opponents, Joe Jeanette and John Ballcort, in a benefit fight card for U.S. War Bonds.\nBoxing style.\nThroughout his career, Johnson built a unique fighting style of his own, which was not customary in boxing during this time. Though he would typically strike first, he would fight defensively, waiting for his opponents to tire out, becoming more aggressive as the rounds went on. He often fought to punish his opponents over the course of the bout rather than going for the knockout, and would continuously dodge their punches. He would then quickly strike back with a blow of his own. Johnson often made his fights look effortless, and as if he had much more to offer, but when pushed he could also display some powerful moves and punches. There are films of his fights in which he can be seen holding up his opponent, who otherwise might have fallen, until he recovered. Johnson was also known for his use of the mummy guard which was later adopted by boxers such as Sandy Saddler and George Foreman.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and had several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to an auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn dirt track. Oldfield easily defeated Johnson. Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket, he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he could not make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change as he was going to make his return trip at the same speed. In 1920, Johnson opened the Club Deluxe, a Black and Tan night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.\nJohnson's behavior was looked down upon by some in the African-American community, especially by the black scholar Booker T. Washington, who said it \"is unfortunate that a man with money should use it in a way to injure his own people, in the eyes of those who are seeking to uplift his race and improve its conditions, I wish to say emphatically that Jack Johnson's actions did not meet my personal approval and I am sure they do not meet with the approval of the colored race.\"\nJohnson flouted conventions regarding the social and economic \"place\" of blacks in American society. As a black man, he broke a powerful taboo in consorting with white women and would verbally taunt men (both white and black) inside and outside the ring. When asked the secret of his staying power by a reporter who had watched a succession of women parade into, and out of, the champion's hotel room, Johnson supposedly said \"Eat jellied eels and think distant thoughts\".\nIn 1911, Johnson, through an acquaintance, attempted to become a Freemason in Dundee, Scotland. He was initiated as an Entered Apprentice at Forfar and Kincardine Lodge No 225 in the city. However, there was some opposition to his membership from within the lodge, but mainly from the Grand Lodge who tried to stop the initiation from going ahead due to most Grand Lodges in the USA threatening to withdraw their Scottish Grand Lodge representation if it did. The Forfarshire Lodge was suspended by the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and Johnson's fees were returned to him and his admission was ruled illegal.\nIn July 1912, Johnson opened an interracial nightclub in Chicago called Caf\u00e9 de Champion.\nJohnson wrote two memoirs of his life: \"Mes combats\" in 1914 and \"Jack Johnson in the Ring and Out\" in 1927.\nIn 1943, Johnson attended at least one service at the Pentecostal Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California. In a public conversion, while Detroit, Michigan, burned in race riots, he professed his faith to Christ in a service conducted by evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. She embraced him as \"he raised his hand in worship\".\nMarriages.\nJohnson engaged in various relationships, including three documented marriages. All of his documented wives were white. At the height of his career, Johnson was excoriated by the press for his flashy lifestyle and for having married white women.\nAccording to Johnson's 1927 autobiography, he married Mary Austin, a black woman from Galveston, Texas. No record exists of this marriage.\nWhile in Philadelphia in 1903, Johnson met Clara Kerr, a black prostitute. According to Johnson's autobiography, Kerr left him for Johnson's friend, a racehorse trainer named William Bryant. They stole Johnson's jewelry and clothing when they left. Johnson tracked the couple down and had Kerr arrested on burglary charges. Johnson and Kerr reconciled for a while before she left him again.\nDuring a three-month tour of Australia in 1907, Johnson had a brief affair with Alma \"Lola\" Toy, a white woman from Sydney. Johnson confirmed to an American journalist that he intended to marry Toy. When \"The Referee\" printed Johnson's plans to marry Toy, it caused controversy in Sydney. Toy demanded a retraction and later won a libel lawsuit from the newspaper.\nAfter returning from Australia, Johnson said that \"the heartaches which Mary Austin and Clara Kerr caused me led me to forswear colored women and to determine that my lot henceforth would be cast only with white women.\"\nJohnson met Etta Terry Duryea, a Brooklyn socialite and former wife of Clarence Duryea, at a car race in 1909. In 1910, Johnson hired a private investigator to follow Duryea after suspecting she was having an affair with his chauffeur. On Christmas Day, Johnson confronted Duryea and beat her to the point of hospitalization. They reconciled and were married on January 18, 1911. Prone to depression, her condition worsened due to Johnson's abuse and infidelity in addition to the hostile reaction to their interracial relationship. Duryea attempted suicide twice before she died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on September 11, 1912.\nIn the summer of 1912, Johnson met Lucille Cameron, an 18-year-old prostitute from Minneapolis who relocated to Chicago, at his nightclub Caf\u00e9 de Champion. Johnson hired her as his stenographer, but shortly after Duryea's funeral, they were out in public as a couple. They married on December 3, 1912, at 3:00\u00a0p.m. Cameron filed for divorce in 1924 due to his infidelity.\nJohnson met Irene Pineau at the race track in Aurora, Illinois, in 1924. After she divorced her husband the following year, they were married in Waukegan in August 1925. Johnson and Pineau were together until his death in 1946. When asked by a reporter at Johnson's funeral what she had loved about him, she replied: \"I loved him because of his courage. He faced the world unafraid. There wasn't anybody or anything he feared.\"\nPrison sentence.\nOn October 18, 1912, Johnson was arrested on the grounds that his relationship with Lucille Cameron violated the Mann Act against \"transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes\" due to her being an alleged prostitute. Her mother also swore that her daughter was insane. Cameron, soon to become his second wife, refused to cooperate and the case fell apart.\nLess than a month later, Johnson was arrested again on similar charges. This time, the woman, another alleged prostitute named Belle Schreiber, with whom he had been involved in 1909 and 1910, testified against him. In the courtroom of Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the future Commissioner of Baseball who perpetuated the baseball color line until his death, Johnson was convicted by an all-white jury in June 1913, although the incidents used to convict him took place before passage of the Mann Act. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.\nJohnson skipped bail and left the country, joining Lucille in Montreal on June 25, before fleeing to France. To flee to Canada, Johnson posed as a member of a black baseball team. They lived in exile in Europe, South America, and Mexico for the next seven years. Johnson returned to the U.S. on July 20, 1920. He surrendered to federal agents at the Mexican border and was sent to the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, to serve his sentence in September 1920. He was released on July 9, 1921.\nPresidential pardon.\nPresident Donald Trump granted Johnson a posthumous presidential pardon after recurring proposals to grant one had not been acted on by previous administrations. In April 2018, Trump announced that he was considering granting a full pardon to Johnson on the advice of actor Sylvester Stallone. Trump pardoned Johnson on May 24, 2018, 105 years after his conviction, during a ceremony which included special guests Sylvester Stallone (actor), Deontay Wilder (then current WBC Champion), Lennox Lewis (WBC Former Champion), Mauricio Sulaiman (WBC President), Linda Bell Haywood (Johnson's great-great niece), and Hector Sulaiman (President of the Board of Advisors of Scholas Occurrentes).\nA bill which requested that President George W. Bush pardon Johnson passed the House in 2008, but failed to pass in the Senate. In April 2009, Senator John McCain, along with Representative Peter King, film maker Ken Burns, and Johnson's great-niece, Linda Haywood, requested a presidential pardon for Johnson from President Barack Obama. In July of that year, Congress passed a resolution calling on President Obama to issue a pardon.\nIn 2016, another petition for Johnson's pardon was issued by McCain, King, Senator Harry Reid, and Congressman Gregory Meeks to President Obama, marking the 70th anniversary since the boxer's death. This time, the petitioners cited a provision of the Every Student Succeeds Act, signed by the president in December 2015, in which Congress expressed that this boxing great should receive a posthumous pardon, and a vote by the United States Commission on Civil Rights passed unanimously a week earlier in June 2016 to \"right this century-old wrong.\"\nMike Tyson, Harry Reid, and John McCain lent their support to the campaign, starting a Change.org petition asking President Obama to posthumously pardon the world's first African American heavyweight boxing champion for his racially motivated 1913 felony conviction.\nMonkey wrench.\nA persistent hoax on social media claims that Johnson invented the monkey wrench and it was named a \"monkey\" wrench as a racial slur. Johnson did receive a patent for improvements which he made to the monkey wrench, but the name \"monkey wrench\" and the first patent for it predate his birth by over 35 years.\nDeath.\nOn June 10, 1946, Johnson and a friend were en route to New York from Texas and visited a segregated diner; when the diner refused to serve him, Johnson drove away angrily with his friend in the passenger seat. The car collided with a telegraph pole on U.S. Highway 1 near Franklinton, North Carolina. While his friend survived the crash, Johnson suffered fatal injuries and died later that day at St. Agnes Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina, which was the nearest black hospital, at 6:10 pm. He was 68 years old.\nJohnson was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago next to his first wife, Etta Duryea Johnson, who committed suicide in 1912. His grave was initially unmarked, but was later marked with a large tombstone which says only \"Johnson\". An additional marker was added after filmmaker Ken Burns released a film about Johnson's life in 2005. Johnson's new, smaller gravestone reads: \"Jack / John A. Johnson. 1878\u20131946. First black heavyweight champion of the world.\" Johnson's signature is on the back of the stone.\nLegacy.\nJohnson was an inaugural 1954 inductee to \"The Ring\" magazine's Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987), and was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2005, the United States National Film Preservation Board deemed the film of the 1910 Johnson-Jeffries fight \"historically significant\" and put it in the National Film Registry.\nDuring his boxing career, Jack Johnson fought 114 fights, winning 80 matches, 45 by knockouts. He also had the longest professional career of any world heavyweight boxing champion, having boxed for over 33 years from 1897 to 1931 (12,231 days). This record was beaten by Roy Jones Jr. in 2023, who has boxed for more than 33 years since 1989 (12,384 days).\nMuhammad Ali often spoke of how he was influenced by Jack Johnson. Ali identified with Johnson because he felt America ostracized him in the same manner because of his opposition to the Vietnam War and affiliation with the Nation of Islam.\nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Jack Johnson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. In 2012, the City of Galveston dedicated a park in Johnson's memory as Galveston Island's most famous native son. The park, called Jack Johnson Park, includes a life-size, bronze statue of Johnson.\nActor and professional wrestler Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's surname is an homage to Jack Johnson; his father, professional wrestler Rocky Johnson, was born with the surname \"Bowles\" and chose his ring name in honor of the boxer before making it his legal name.\nJack Johnson\u2019s personal life and relationships also shaped his public legacy. His open romantic involvement and marriages with white women provoked outrage in early twentieth-century America, where segregation and anti-miscegenation laws reinforced strict racial boundaries. Many newspapers portrayed him as dangerous or immoral, framing his confidence and success as a cultural threat to white supremacy. Still, his decision to live on his own terms inspired many African Americans, who saw in him a rare example of pride and independence during an era of racial violence. His success as a Black champion during the height of Jim Crow challenged the racial hierarchy that linked whiteness to physical and moral superiority. His victories, especially over white opponents like Jim Jeffries, provoked racial violence across the country, showing how sport could reflect and even intensify racial conflict. Later African American athletes, from Joe Louis to Muhammad Ali, would look to Johnson\u2019s defiance as both an inspiration and a warning about the costs of challenging racial boundaries in sport.\nPopular culture.\nThe first filmed fight of Johnson's career was his bout with Tommy Burns, which was turned into a contemporary documentary, \"The Burns-Johnson Fight\", in 1908.\nFolksinger and blues singer Lead Belly referenced Johnson in a song about the \"Titanic\": \"Jack Johnson wanna get on board, Captain said I ain't hauling no coal. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well. When Jack Johnson heard that mighty shock, mighta seen the man do the Eagle rock. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well\" (The Eagle Rock was a popular dance at the time). In 1969, American folk singer Jaime Brockett reworked the Lead Belly song into a satirical talking blues called \"The Legend of the S.S. Titanic.\" \nIn the trenches of World War One, Johnson's name was used by British troops to describe the impact of German 150\u00a0mm heavy artillery shells which had a black color. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863\u20131916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert:\n We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue at the top of the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there's a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.\nJohnson's story is the basis of the play \"The Great White Hope\" and its 1970 film adaptation, starring James Earl Jones as \"Jack Jefferson\" and Jane Alexander as his love interest. Both Jones and Alexander won Tonys and were nominated for Oscars.\nAlso in 1970, Jimmy Jacobs and Bill Cayton brought together much of the rare archive footage of Johnson which they had saved and restored, and made the film \"Jack Johnson\", with Johnson's words voiced by Brock Peters, and music by Miles Davis. Davis' score later became the 1971 album named after the boxer. It features the actor Peters (as Johnson) saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nI'm Jack Johnson. Heavyweight champion of the world.\nI'm black. They never let me forget it.\nI'm black all right! I'll never let them forget it!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn 2005, filmmaker Ken Burns produced a two-part documentary about Johnson's life, \",\" based on the 2004 nonfiction book of the same name by Geoffrey C. Ward, and with music by Wynton Marsalis. The book won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year (2006).\nSeveral Hip Hop activists have also reflected on Johnson's legacy, most notably in the album \"The New Danger,\" by Mos Def, in which songs like \"Zimzallabim\" and \"Blue Black Jack\" are devoted to the artist's pugilistic hero. In the closing track of the album \"Run the Jewels 3\", \"A Report to the Shareholders / Kill Your Masters,\" Killer Mike of the Hip Hop duo Run the Jewels reinvokes Johnson's image with the line: \"\"I'm Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth\".\" Additionally, both Southern punk rock band This Bike is a Pipe Bomb and alternative country performer Tom Russell have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell's piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: \"here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there's a lot of white Americans like to see a man go down\u00a0... like to see a black man drown.\"\nIn Joe R. Lansdale's 1997 short story \"The Big Blow,\" Johnson is featured fighting a white boxer brought in by Galveston, Texas's boxing fans to defeat the African American fighter during the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. The story won a Bram Stoker Award and was expanded into a 2000 novel.\nThe book of poetry, \"The Big Smoke\" by Adrian Matejka, is inspired by Johnson's voice and life and written in forms ranging from sonnets to prose poetry. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Poetry in 2013.\n\"The Royale\", a play by Marco Ramirez, uses the life of Jack Johnson as inspiration for its main character, Jay Jackson. It premiered in March 2016 at Lincoln Center Theater directed by Rachel Chavkin, and was nominated for a Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Play, Outstanding Director of a Play, and a Special Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Ensemble.\nThe book \"Crossing the Color Line: Stanley Ketchel's Challenge for Jack Johnson's Heavyweight Crown\", written by Vernon Gravely and released in 2021, details Johnson's fight with middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel.\nThe graphic novel \"The Original Johnson\" was written and drawn by Trevor Von Eeden, the first black artist ever hired by DC Comics, in 1976, and co-creator of their first original black super-hero, Black Lightning. \"The Original Johnson\" details Jack Johnson's life from childhood up to his death, and was generally well received. A favorable quote from the NY Times graces the cover of both volumes.\nThe graphic novel \"Last On His Feet: Jack Johnson and the Battle of the Century\" by Adrian Matejka and Youssef Daoudi, released in 2023, chronicles Johnson vs. Jeffries, interspersing the fight with flashbacks to Johnson's youth.\nProfessional boxing record.\nAll information in this section is derived from BoxRec, unless otherwise stated.\nOfficial record.\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Newspaper decisions/draws\nAll newspaper decisions are officially regarded as \"no decision\" bouts and are not counted in the win/loss/draw column.\nUnofficial record.\nRecord with the inclusion of newspaper decisions in the win/loss/draw column.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71966", "revid": "543434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71966", "title": "Nine Inch Nails", "text": "American industrial rock band\nNine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN, is an American industrial rock band formed by singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio. Reznor was the sole permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, English musician Atticus Ross, became an official member in 2016. The band's debut album, \"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreements with TVT over how the album would be promoted, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP \"Broken\" (1992), followed by the albums \"The Downward Spiral\" (1994) and \"The Fragile\" (1999).\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring and released their fourth album \"With Teeth\" (2005). Following the release of the next album \"Year Zero\" (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" (2008) and \"The Slip\" (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, \"Hesitation Marks\" (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs \"Not the Actual Events\" (2016) and \"Add Violence\" (2017) and their ninth album \"Bad Witch\" (2018). The band simultaneously released two further installments of the \"Ghosts\" series in 2020: ' and '. In 2024, Nine Inch Nails announced a number of new projects through their multimedia company With Teeth; the following year, they embarked on the Peel It Back Tour and released the .\nWhen touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the current lineup consists of Reznor and Ross alongside Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini, and Josh Freese (both of whom initially joined in 2005). The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and the melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.\nNine Inch Nails has sold over 20 million records worldwide and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs \"Wish\" in 1992 and \"Happiness in Slavery\" in 1996. \"Time\" magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while \"Spin\" magazine has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Nine Inch Nails No. 94 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, having first been nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.\nHistory.\nFormation (1987\u20131988).\nWhile living in Cleveland in 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synth-pop band managed by John Malm Jr. Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than \"a little wear on [his] tape heads\". Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, Reznor was inspired by Prince to play all instruments himself except drums, which he programmed electronically. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since.\nThe first Nine Inch Nails live performance took place at Graffiti in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 27, 1988. Soon after, following their live support of Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as \"Purest Feeling\", were released in revised form on the first studio album, \"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1989). The overall sound on \"Purest Feeling\" is lighter than that of \"Pretty Hate Machine\"; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples.\nReznor chose the name \"Nine Inch Nails\" because it \"abbreviated easily\" rather than for \"any literal meaning\". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to refer to Jesus's crucifixion with nine-inch spikes, or Freddy Krueger's nine-inch fingernails. The Nine Inch Nails logo first appeared on the music video for their debut single, \"Down in It\". Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the logo, inspired by Tibor Kalman's typography on the Talking Heads album \"Remain in Light\". The logo features the band's initials, with the second N mirrored. Talpas, a native of Cleveland, continued to design Nine Inch Nails packaging until 1997.\n\"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1988\u20131991).\nWritten, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album \"Pretty Hate Machine\" debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with Adrian Sherwood (who produced the lead single \"Down in It\" in London without meeting Reznor face-to-face) and Mark \"Flood\" Ellis. Reznor asked Sean Beavan to mix the demos of \"Pretty Hate Machine\", which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles \"Head Like a Hole\" and \"Sin\". \"Rolling Stone\"'s Michael Azerrad described the album as \"industrial-strength noise over a pop framework\" and \"harrowing but catchy music\"; Reznor proclaimed this combination \"a sincere statement\" of \"what was in [his] head at the time\". In fact, the song \"Down in It\" spent over two months on \"Billboard\"'s club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200, \"Pretty Hate Machine\" became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification.\nThree music videos were created in promotion of the album. MTV aired the videos for \"Down in It\" and \"Head Like a Hole\", but an explicit video for \"Sin\" was only released in partial form for \"Closure\". The original version of the \"Down in It\" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the FBI.\nIn 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked on what shows they would like to appear. They jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on \"Dance Party USA\", since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.\nIn 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the \"Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series\", in which it toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and the Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; \"Rockbeat\" interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.\n\"Broken\" (1992\u20131993).\nAfter a poor European reception opening for Guns N' Roses, the band returned to the US amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to \"Pretty Hate Machine\". After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with Interscope Records and created Nothing Records:\nWe made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record \"Broken\" under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.\nIn 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed \"Le Pig\" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. The band used it to record \"Broken\", an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized \"Broken\" as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than \"Pretty Hate Machine\"\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from \"Broken\" earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only song to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.\nPeter Christopherson of the bands Coil and Throbbing Gristle directed a performance video for \"Wish\", but the EP's most controversial video accompanied \"Happiness in Slavery\". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of performance artist Bob Flanagan disrobed and lying on a machine that pleases, tortures, then (apparently) kills him. A third video for \"Pinion\", partially incorporated into MTV's \"Alternative Nation\" opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in bondage. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for \"Help Me I Am in Hell\" and \"Gave Up\" into a longform music video titled \"Broken\". It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for \"Gave Up\" featuring Richard Patrick and Marilyn Manson was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of \"Wish\" was also filmed, and both videos appeared in \"Closure\".\n\"Broken\" was followed by the companion remix EP \"Fixed\" in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of \"Last\", produced by Butch Vig (the outro of the \"Last\" remix is heard in \"Throw This Away\", which also includes Reznor's remix of \"Suck\"). The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11\u00a0kHz file, \"NIN_LAST.AIFF\", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256\u00a0kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying \"I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.\"\n\"The Downward Spiral\" (1993\u20131997).\nEarly ideas for \"The Downward Spiral\" arose after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival's concerts ended in September. Reznor elaborated the album's themes into lyrics. Despite initially choosing to record the album in New Orleans, Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, in Los Angeles (known as the Manson Murder House) renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, the start of the making of both \"Broken\" and \"The Downward Spiral\".\nNine Inch Nails' second studio album, \"The Downward Spiral\", entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number two, and is the band's highest seller in the US, over four million copies, among five million worldwide. Influenced by Pink Floyd and by David Bowie's music from the 1970s, \"The Downward Spiral\"'s diverse textures and moods depict a protagonist's mental progress. Flood co-produced several tracks, while Alan Moulder mixed most, and later found more extensive production duties on future albums. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on \"The Downward Spiral\". After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as \"Closer\", Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's \"Antichrist Superstar\" in 1996. \"The Downward Spiral\", like \"Broken\", was recorded at Le Pig Studios. \"March of the Pigs\" and \"Closer\" were singles. Two other tracks, \"Hurt\" and \"Piggy\", though not singles, were issued to radio. Also in 1994, the band released the promotional single \"Burn\", which Reznor produced, on the soundtrack of Oliver Stone film \"Natural Born Killers\". as well as a cover of the Joy Division song \"Dead Souls\" on the to the film \"The Crow\", which went to number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.\nThe music video for \"Closer\", directed by Mark Romanek, was in MTV's frequent rotation, although the network, deeming it too graphic, heavily censored the original. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&amp;M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.\nContemporary critics generally praised \"The Downward Spiral\", now classed among the most important albums of the 1990s. In 2005, Spin ranked it 25th among the \"100 Greatest Albums, 1985\u20132005\". In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it 200 among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". \"Blender\" named it the 80th \"Greatest American Album\". It was ranked No.\u00a0488 in the book \"The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\" by Martin Popoff. In 2001 \"Q\" named \"The Downward Spiral\" as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\"; in 2010 the album was ranked No.\u00a0102 on their \"250 Best Albums of Q's Lifetime (1986\u20132011)\" list. After \"The Downward Spiral\"'s release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled \"Further Down the Spiral\", the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States and among the best-selling remix albums of all time. It contained contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, among others.\nAfter \"The Downward Spiral\"'s 1994 release, the live band supported it by embarking on the Self Destruct Tour. The stage set-up featured dirty curtains, rising and lowering for visuals shown during songs such as \"Hurt\". The tour debuted the band's grungy, messy image as the members appeared in ragged attire slathered in corn starch. Performances were violent and chaotic, band members often injuring themselves by attacking each other, diving into the crowd, and destroying their instruments to close. The widest mainstream audience was a mud-soaked performance at Woodstock '94, and seen by Pay-Per-View in up to 24\u00a0million homes. Enjoying mainstream success thereafter, Nine Inch Nails then performed amid greater production values, adding theatrical visual elements. Supporting acts on tour included the Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the \"Closure\" video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of \"Eraser\", \"Hurt\" and a one-take \"March of the Pigs\" clip directed by Peter Christopherson. In 1997 Reznor also produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film \"Lost Highway\", which featured one new Nine Inch Nails song, \"The Perfect Drug\". Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of \"The Fragile\".\n\"The Fragile\" (1998\u20132002).\nFive years elapsed between \"The Downward Spiral\" and Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, \"The Fragile\", which arrived as a double album in September 1999. \"The Fragile\" was conceived by making \"songwriting and arranging and production and sound design\u00a0... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song.\" Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he \"provided final continuity and flow.\"\nOn the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded \"The Fragile\" more than a year before its release, when it was already described as \"oft-delayed\". The album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. \"Spin\" hailed \"The Fragile\" as the \"album of the year\", whereas Pitchfork Media panned its \"melodramatic\" lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: \"The Day the World Went Away\" in North America; \"We're in This Together\" in the EU and Japan (on three separate discs); and \"Into the Void\" in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the \"Billboard\" Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the biggest drop from number one, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.\nBefore the album's release, the song \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. Cinesexuality critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a \"scathing attack on the alternative music scene,\" particularly Reznor's former friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled \"Starsuckers, Inc.\" and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden in 2000.\nReznor followed \"The Fragile\" with another remix album, \"Things Falling Apart\", released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 \"Fragility\" tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as \"And All That Could Have Been\". A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc \"Still\", containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.\nDuring the \"Fragility 2.0\" tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober.\nIn 2002, Johnny Cash covered the Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" for his album, \"\", to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition:\nI pop the video in, and wow\u00a0... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps\u00a0... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore\u00a0... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning\u2014different, but every bit as pure.\n\"With Teeth\" (2004\u20132006).\nA further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album. \"With Teeth\" was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. \"With Teeth\" debuted on top of the \"Billboard\" 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date. Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: \"Rolling Stone\"'s Rob Sheffield described the album as \"vintage Nine Inch Nails\". PopMatters condemned the album, claiming Reznor \"ran out of ideas.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI think, fundamentally, music is something inherently people love and need and relate to, and a lot of what's out right now feels like McDonalds. It's quick-fix. You kind of have a stomachache afterwards.\n Trent Reznor, \"Salt Lake Tribune\" interview (2005)\nA music video for the song \"The Hand That Feeds\" premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in GarageBand format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album's second single \"Only\" in a wider range of formats, including Pro Tools and ACID Pro. David Fincher directed a video for \"Only\" with primarily computer-generated imagery. The planned music video for its third single, \"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\", was directed by Francis Lawrence but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart.\nNine Inch Nails launched a North American arena tour in Autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux and Death from Above 1979. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist Saul Williams, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The \"Beside You in Time\" tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The home video release debuted at number one on both the \"Billboard\" Top Music Videos and \"Billboard\" Comprehensive Music Videos charts in the United States.\n\"Year Zero\" (2007\u20132008).\nNine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, \"Year Zero\", was released on April 17, 2007, only two years after \"With Teeth\", a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, \"Year Zero\" is a concept album criticizing the United States government's policies and their effect on the world fifteen years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on Metacritic.\nThe story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed \"Year 0\", by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.\nAn alternate reality game emerged parallel to the \"Year Zero\" concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an \"Orwellian picture of the United States circa the year 2022\". Before \"Year Zero\"'s release, unreleased songs from the album were found on USB drives hidden at Nine Inch Nails concert venues in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the alternate reality game caught the attention of media outlets such as \"USA Today\" and \"Billboard\", who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries.\nThe album's first single, \"Survivalism\", and other tracks from \"Year Zero\" were released as multitrack audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled \"Year Zero Remixed\" was later released, containing remixes from \"Year Zero\" by other artists. The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes.\nReznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted \"Year Zero\" as \"part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.\" The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for \"Year Zero\" as a film, then Reznor found American film producer Lawrence Bender and met with writers.\nOn August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: \"We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens.\" Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the 2007\u20132008 Writer's Guild strike, but it nevertheless continued. In 2010, the resultant miniseries, also named \"Year Zero\", was reported to be in development with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and \"Carniv\u00e0le\" writer Daniel Knauf, but at the end of 2012 Reznor said that the project was \"in a holding state\".\n\"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" and \"The Slip\" (2008\u20132012).\nIn February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled \"2 weeks\". On March 2, \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" (the first release on The Null Corporation label), a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band's official website. \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days. The album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike licence. The album was created improvisationally over a ten-week period and contributors included Atticus Ross, Alan Moulder, Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione.\nSimilar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\", a post on the band's website in April 2008 read \"2 weeks!\" On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released \"The Slip\" via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, \"this one's on me,\" protected under the same Creative Commons licence as \"Ghosts\", and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4\u00a0million. \"The Slip\" has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000.\nFollowing the release of \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" and \"The Slip\", a 25-date tour titled \"Lights in the Sky\", was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of Ilan Rubin on drums.\nOn January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 GB via BitTorrent. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional three-part digital film, followed by a physical release created \"by fans for fans\". This tour documentary became collectively known as \"Another Version of the Truth\" and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as \"USA Today\", \"Rolling Stone\", Techdirt and Pitchfork TV, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster Rob Sheridan noted on the band's official website:\nThis is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.\n\"Nine Inch Nails Revenge\", an iPhone/iPod Touch-exclusive rhythm game developed by Tapulous, was released on March 8, 2009 (five months after the company announced the development of the game). This installment in the \"Tap Tap\" video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" and \"The Slip\". Portions of the album \"Ghosts I-IV\" were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary \"Citizenfour.\"\nIn February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that \"I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while.\" Reznor since clarified that he \"isn't done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future.\" The \"Wave Goodbye\" tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film \"\", and a cover of U2's \"Zoo Station\", included in the \"Achtung Baby\" tribute album \"AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered\".\nIn 2009 Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig, and formed a project with Maandig and Atticus Ross dubbed How to Destroy Angels. Its first release, a six-track self-titled EP, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor's next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the official score for David Fincher's 2010 film, \"The Social Network\". Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture, and a 2010 Oscar for Best Original Score. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher's 2014 film \"Gone Girl\".\nIn July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer Treyarch to compose the theme music for \"\". Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with Alessandro Cortini on a remix of the song \"Destroyer\" by Telepathe. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called \"Sound City\" directed by Dave Grohl, in addition to co-writing and performing the song \"Mantra\" with Grohl and Josh Homme. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from Queens of the Stone Age titled \"...Like Clockwork\". Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song \"Kalopsia\" and vocals on \"Fairweather Friends\" along with Elton John on piano and vocals. In October a project with Dr. Dre and Beats Electronics was announced that Reznor wrote was \"probably not what you're expecting [from me]\". The project was named \"Daisy\"; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer.\n\"Hesitation Marks\" (2012\u20132014).\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails \"in mind\". Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the Twenty Thirteen Tour. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction, Adrian Belew of King Crimson, and Josh Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place.\nBy May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, \"Hesitation Marks\" incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist Pino Palladino along with Todd Rundgren and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham to achieve various art-rock elements.\nThe album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. \"Came Back Haunted\" was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an epileptic seizure warning. The second single, \"Copy of A\", was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK Amazon.com account holders. \"Everything\" was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album.\nIn July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the Fuji Rock Festival, and the Pukkelpop, Hockenheim, Germany's Rock'n'Heim and the Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky as opening acts. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as \"Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013\".\nIn 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by Queens of the Stone Age for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act Cold Cave. After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks prior to the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, the Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the tour.\nIn 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted.\nIn June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of \"The Fragile\" and \"With Teeth\" to stream exclusively on Apple Music, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started \"messing around with some things\" in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating \"It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting\". In December 2015, Reznor reported that \"Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016\".\n\"The Trilogy (Not the Actual Events / Add Violence / Bad Witch)\" (2016\u20132019).\nIn October 2016, in response to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with \"2016 is not over yet\". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: \"Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? ... Just wait and see what happens.\" Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled \"Not the Actual Events\", along with reissues of \"Broken\", \"The Downward Spiral\", and \"The Fragile,\" with subsequent reissues of \"With Teeth\", \"Year Zero\", and \"The Slip\" to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was \"The Fragile: Deviations 1\", which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. \"Not the Actual Events\" was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.\nIn early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the Panorama Music Festival in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official Facebook page that it would be headlining Day 3 of FYF Fest in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced their 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band's 2014 touring lineup, Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. The band appeared in Part 8 of the third season of Twin Peaks, performing their song, \"She's Gone Away\".\nIn June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that \"Not the Actual Events\" would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment \"Add Violence\" being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single \"Less Than\" was released a week prior to the second EP's release.\nAlso in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming Ken Burns series \"The Vietnam War\", and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for\u00a0\"The Social Network\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\".\u00a0\nThe band released their ninth studio album, \"Bad Witch\", on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the \"Cold and Black and Infinite 2018 North America Tour\", where it toured with the Jesus and Mary Chain. To prevent ticket scalping, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision, \"The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We've decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way.\"\nIn October 2019, Nine Inch Nails was again nominated for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.\n\"Ghosts V\u2013VI\" (2020\u20132022).\nOn January 15, 2020, Nine Inch Nails was officially named as members of the Class of 2020 for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the induction ceremony was postponed indefinitely. Originally, only Trent Reznor was to be inducted as the sole full-time member of the group for most of its history. After holding discussions with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Reznor announced that former live band members Chris Vrenna and Danny Lohner, as well as current members Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin (the youngest person ever inducted into the Hall of Fame), longtime guitarist Robin Finck, and the only other full time member of the band, Atticus Ross, would all be inducted as members of Nine Inch Nails.\nOn March 26, 2020, Nine Inch Nails released ' and ', its tenth and eleventh studio albums and the sequels to their 2008 instrumental album \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\". The albums were released for free as a show of solidarity with the band's fans during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the pandemic, the live induction ceremony for the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction was cancelled on July 15, 2020, and simultaneously, an induction special was announced to be broadcast and available for streaming through HBO and HBO Max, respectively, on November 7, 2020. In the interim, a special display was created to represent Nine Inch Nails' presence in the Hall of Fame that celebrated their popular, muddy performance at Woodstock '94; opened on the 26th anniversary of the concert. On November 6, 2020, Trent Reznor and the other to-be-inducted members of Nine Inch Nails were interviewed by journalist David Farrier about the history of the band and their feelings on being inducted. Then on November 7, Nine Inch Nails was formally inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, by punk icon Iggy Pop. Reznor thanked the fans, his family, and all of his many Nine Inch Nails collaborators in his acceptance speech, recorded from his home in Beverly Hills, CA.\nOn May 6, 2021, Nine Inch Nails released a new track, \"Isn't Everyone\" in collaboration with noise rock group HEALTH, who had previously been an opening act on their Lights In The Sky and Wave Goodbye tours. On May 7, they announced they would be playing two shows in Cleveland (September 21 and 23, 2021) with the Pixies to commemorate their inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which, according to the band, would be \"the only NIN headline shows in 2021\". Those shows were cancelled on August 19, 2021, due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. Also in 2021, Reznor and Ross produced Halsey's album \"If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power\". It was later nominated for the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.\nIn February 2022, Nine Inch Nails announced a short tour of the United States for 2022, the group's first performances in nearly four years. A tour of the United Kingdom was announced shortly afterwards.\nOn September 24, 2022, Nine Inch Nails performed in their native Cleveland for the first time since 2013 after a \"Nine Inch Nails Fan Day\" at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame the previous day. Over the course of the performance, all the other six inductees, as well as former members Richard Patrick and Charlie Clouser, joined Reznor on stage and even covered Patrick's Filter hit, \"Hey Man Nice Shot\". Reznor posted on his Discord after the show, \"When/If we tour again, it will be different. Not like [2018\u2032s \"Cold Black Infinite\" tour] era \u2013 It's over.\"\n\"Tron: Ares\" and Peel It Back Tour (2024\u2013present).\nOn April 4, 2024, Nine Inch Nails revealed plans to create a project with Epic Games that they described as \"something that is not exactly a video game, in the UEFN ecosystem Epic has built around \"Fortnite\", to develop a TV series with Christopher Storer, and create a film with Mike Flanagan. The projects were being created from a newly established multimedia company With Teeth, run in partnership with the band's art director John Crawford and producer Jonathan Pavesi. The band is also working on a short film with artist Susanne Deeken, a clothing line called Memory Fade, as well as a music festival and a new record label set to launch alongside it.\nOn August 10, 2024, Reznor and Ross appeared at Disney's D23 fan event to announce Nine Inch Nails was producing the film score for \". It was reported that the soundtrack would feature \"new original songs\" by the band. Previously, soundtracks were credited to simply Ross and Reznor, whereas the score for \"Tron: Ares\" specifically credited the Nine Inch Nails entity.\nPlans for a tour titled Peel It Back leaked on January 13, 2025. Details indicated August and September shows in the United States, Canada, and Europe, as well as a Facebook post for a September 10 event in Tampa, Florida, and an associated Ticketmaster listing. On January 14, the band confirmed they were touring, with further details to follow, but their announcement was paused due to the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires. The band later announced the summer tour on January 22.\nOn July 17, 2025, the band released \"As Alive as You Need Me to Be\" as the lead single from the . The song would later be nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards. On July 30, the band announced that Freese would rejoin the touring lineup after Rubin's departure to join the Foo Fighters, who had released Freese earlier that year. This marked the band's first lineup change in nine years, the longest timespan to date.\nOn September 16, 2025, it was announced that Nine Inch Nails and Boys Noize will perform at Coachella 2026 as a supergroup called Nine Inch Noize. Boys Noize had previously opened for the Peel It Back Tour, and would join the band on stage during the third act of every performance, with the Coachella performances acting as an extension of the third act. On October 1, a second North American leg of the Peel It Back tour was revealed, scheduled for February and March 2026.\nArtistry.\nMusical style.\nNine Inch Nails has been described as incorporating alternative rock, industrial rock, industrial dance, industrial, electro-industrial, industrial metal, electronic rock, and alternative metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that \"Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience\". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term \"industrial\" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in \"Spin\" magazine that \"Down in It\" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song \"Dig It\"; other songs from \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and \"With Teeth\" have been described as synth-pop. Reviewing \"The Fragile\", critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in \"The Frail\" and drum and bass elements in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" (which is specifically dark ambient), \"Hesitation Marks\", \"The Downward Spiral\", \"The Slip\", and \"The Fragile\".\nSongs such as \"Wish\" and \"The Day the World Went Away\" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and \"Burn\". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in \"The Collector\" from \"With Teeth\" and concert favorite \"March of the Pigs\". Reznor uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song \"Hurt\", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word \"I\" every time the B/E# dyad is played. \"Closer\" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: the melody is debuted during the second verse of \"Piggy\" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of \"Heresy\", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout \"A Warm Place\", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on \"The Downward Spiral\".\nOn \"The Fragile\", Reznor revisits the technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on \"Year Zero\" contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". AllMusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"Guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\"\nLyrical themes.\nLyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, and nihilism. Occasionally, the lyrics depart from their introspective nature to deal with a topic like politics, which is the focus of \"Year Zero\". Three Nine Inch Nails albums are concept albums: \"The Downward Spiral\", \"The Fragile\", and \"Year Zero\". The album \"With Teeth\" was originally set to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.\nInfluences.\nReznor's earliest influence was the Eagles, whom he has cited as inspiring him to form a band. He would later recall, \"The first concert I ever saw was the Eagles in 1976. The excitement of the night struck a chord with me and I remember thinking, 'Someday I'd love to be up on that stage.'\" Another major inspiration for the band is Gary Numan; Reznor has said that \"after hearing 'Cars' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers\". Other influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, which helped shape 1989's \"Pretty Hate Machine\". The album's liner notes also paid tribute to Public Enemy and Prince. The 2005 single \"Only\" exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails include acts such as Depeche Mode, Queen, King Crimson, Devo, the Cure, Joy Division, U2, Bauhaus, Adam Ant, Coil, and Soft Cell. Reznor and Vrenna saw Jane's Addiction in 1988 during the making of \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and were influenced by the live presentation and raw rock sound of the band.\nReznor has toured with some of his influences, including a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1988. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who, along with Pink Floyd, had been a significant influence on \"The Downward Spiral\". In 2006, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with Bauhaus, on their Summer Amphitheatre Tour.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the release of \"The Downward Spiral\", mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared Reznor's influence to that of The Velvet Underground. Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose was influenced heavily by Nine Inch Nails in changing his band's sound to an industrial style in the mid-90s. Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a \"true visionary\" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. Nine Inch Nails has been credited by music journalists for popularizing industrial music, despite ambivalence from Reznor.\nThe act has received four awards from 25 nominations, including two Grammy Awards for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\" in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Nine Inch Nails have received two \"Kerrang!\" Awards; one of them being the \"Kerrang!\" Icon in 2006, honoring the band's overall contributions since 1988 and long-standing influence on rock music. The band has also received nine nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards for several of its videos, including two nominations for the \"Closer\" music video and five nominations for \"The Perfect Drug\" music video, including Video of the Year.\nIn 1997, Reznor appeared in \"Time\" magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and \"Spin\" described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". The Recording Industry Association of America certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States, which accounted for roughly half of the band's reported sales worldwide at that time. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine placed \"The Downward Spiral\" at No.\u00a0200 in a 2003 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and by the following year ranked Nine Inch Nails at No.\u00a094 in their \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list.\nIn 2019, Reznor and Ross received songwriting and production credits for the number-one single \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X, which sampled their track \"34 Ghosts IV\" from \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\". \"Old Town Road\" broke the record for most consecutive weeks at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. As producers for the song, Reznor and Ross won a CMA Award for the 'Musical Event of the Year', along with Lil Nas X, featured artist Billy Ray Cyrus and producer YoungKio.\nIn January 2020, after previous nominations in 2014 and 2015, Nine Inch Nails (Alessandro Cortini, Robin Finck, Danny Lohner, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, Ilan Rubin and Chris Vrenna) were named as inductees of the 2020 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nNine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from \"generic imitations\" dating from his initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a \"truer, less imitative way\". Many artists and bands cite Nine Inch Nails as an influence, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCorporate disputes.\nTVT Records.\nIn the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.\nAt the behest of Prudential Securities bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including \"Pretty Hate Machine\", and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. Rykodisc, which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print \"Pretty Hate Machine\" CD on November 22, 2005. Ryko also reissued the \"Head Like a Hole\" CD and a vinyl edition of \"Pretty Hate Machine\" in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for \"The Downward Spiral\". They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.\nUniversal Music Group.\nIn May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of Universal Music Group (parent company of Nine Inch Nails' record label, Interscope Records) for its pricing and distribution plans for \"Year Zero.\" He labeled the company's retail pricing of \"Year Zero\" in Australia as \"ABSURD\", concluding that \"as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off\". Reznor went on to say that he hated Interscope, and in later years the \"climate\" of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to \"steal\" his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to \"steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealing\".\nReznor announced on October 8, 2007, that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a \"totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label\". Reznor also speculated that he would release the next Nine Inch Nails album online in a similar fashion to \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!\", which he produced. Reznor later released the first nine tracks of \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" and the entirety of \"The Slip\" in 2008 for free download.\nIn another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential \"accusation\", in Reznor's words, \"that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for\". Reznor wrote in response that he was \"challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other's feet\". Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched in November 2007.\nOther corporations.\nNine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of \"The Hand That Feeds\". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: \"Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me.\" MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was \"uncomfortable\" with the performance being \"built around partisan political statements\". A performance by Foo Fighters replaced Nine Inch Nails' time slot on the show.\nAnother ceremony incident had occurred at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014. The band performed \"Copy of A\" and \"My God Is the Sun\" with Queens of the Stone Age, Lindsey Buckingham, and Dave Grohl towards the end of the broadcast; however, the performance was not shown in full to the audience at home as advertisements had cut-in midway through the second song. Despite an apology from producer Kenneth Ehrlich, Reznor later heavily criticized the situation.\nIn 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a cease and desist to Fox News Channel for using three songs from \"The Fragile\" on air without permission. The songs \"La Mer\", \"The Great Below\", and \"The Mark Has Been Made\" appeared in an episode of \"War Stories with Oliver North\" detailing the battle of Iwo Jima. A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: \"Thanks for the Fox News heads-up. A cease and desist has been issued. FUCK Fox Fucking News.\"\nAs part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of \"Year Zero\", three tracks from the album (\"My Violent Heart\", \"Survivalism\", and \"Me, I'm Not\") were intentionally \"leaked\" prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on USB flash drives. The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the Recording Industry Association of America, despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label. The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, \"These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on.\"\nThe music of Nine Inch Nails has reportedly been used by the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message on the front page of the Nine Inch Nails website: \"It's difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration's reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us.\"\nAside from disagreements over the usage of Nine Inch Nails material, some corporations have dismissed content due to perceived obscenity. In 2009, Apple rejected an update to Nine Inch Nails' iPhone application, \"NIN: Access\", because it found \"The Downward Spiral\" to contain \"offensive or obscene content\", referring to the lyrical content. Reznor criticized their decision, citing the audio was also available through the iTunes application.\nA similar incident involving digital content distribution occurred in 2013 when Nine Inch Nails re-released the original 1993 film \"Broken\" on Vimeo. Within hours of launch, the video was removed due to terms of service violation on material that \"harass, incite hatred or depict excessive violence\".\nLive performances.\nUntil Atticus Ross joined in 2016, Reznor was the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, Reznor tours with a group of musicians.\nThe lineup of the live band often changes between major tours. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music. Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor.\nThe Tapeworm project was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more \"democratic\" creative environment. The band initially included live band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser, but eventually expanded to include other frequent Nine Inch Nails contributors Josh Freese, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder. However, after 9 years of studio sessions, no material was ever officially released from the group, and it was confirmed to be no longer active in 2005.\nAwards.\nNine Inch Nails has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards and has won awards on two occasions\u2014for \"Wish\" in 1992 and \"Happiness in Slavery\" in 1995:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2024, EPFL enrolled 14,012 students from over 130 countries.\nEPFL has an urban campus that extends alongside Lake Geneva, and includes the EPFL Innovation Park as well as university research centers and affiliated laboratories.\nHistory.\nThe roots of modern-day EPFL can be traced back to the foundation of a private school under the name \"\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale de Lausanne\" in 1853 at the initiative of Louis Rivier, a graduate of the and John Gay, the then professor and rector of the \"Acad\u00e9mie de Lausanne\". At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne.\nIn 1869, it became the technical department of the \"Acad\u00e9mie de Lausanne\". When the Acad\u00e9mie was reorganized and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to \u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de l'Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the \u00c9cole polytechnique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss Federal Council.\nIn contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008.\nIn 1946, there were 360 students at EPFL. In 1969, the university had grown to 1,400 students and 55 faculty members.\nIn the past two decades, EPFL has grown rapidly in reputation and size. As of 2023, EPFL has more than 13,000 full-time students.\nThe environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school attracting students and researchers from all over the world. More than 125 countries are represented on the campus and the university has two official languages, French and English.\nAcademics.\nAdmission.\nHolders of a Swiss \"maturit\u00e9 gymnasiale\" are directly accepted with no other condition in the first year of their Bachelor's program of choice.\nHolders of a Swiss Professional \"Maturit\u00e9\" or a Swiss specialised \"Maturit\u00e9\" are accepted in the \"Cours de math\u00e9matiques sp\u00e9ciales\" within the places available.\nAs such, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedure for Swiss residents.\nHowever, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system.\nThe real selection process happens during the first year of undergraduate studies. This period is called the \"propaedeutic cycle\" and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle.\nIf the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies at EPFL. Roughly 60% of students fail the first year at EPFL all majors combined, and many choose to drop out rather than to repeat the \"propaedeutic cycle\".\nThe failure rate differs between majors, it is higher for Life Sciences Engineering, Physics, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering where only 30\u201340% of students pass the first year.\nFor foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency in French as measured on the CEFR scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended.\nThe usual time till graduation is six semesters (3 years) for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters (2 years) for the Master of Science degree with the final semester dedicated to writing a thesis. Though only 58% of the students who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period.\nThe possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of studies as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France.\nEntrepreneurship is actively encouraged at EPFL, as evident by the EPFL Innovation Park being an integral part of the campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start-ups.\nRankings.\nIn 2023, the \"QS World University Rankings\" ranks EPFL 16th worldwide across all fields, and among the 10 best universities in several engineering disciplines. \"Times Higher Education\" ranks EPFL as the world's 19th best school in the world for Engineering and Technology.\nEPFL typically scores high on faculty to student ratio, international outlook and scientific impact. The CWTS Leiden Ranking that \"aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities\" ranks EPFL world 13th, and 1st in Europe in the 2013 rankings for all the sciences. \nThe \"Times\" 100 Under 50 Rankings is a ranking of the top 100 universities in the world under 50 years old. Since EPFL in its current form was formed in 1969, it is included in this ranking, and was ranked 1st in the world for three years in a row in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and 2nd in the world in 2018 and 2019.\n\"Times Higher Education\" also ranked EPFL as the most international university in the world two years in a row 2014 and 2015.\nCampus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe \"\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de l'Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne\", from which EPFL in its modern-day form originates, was located in the center of Lausanne. In 1974, five years after EPFL was separated from University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name, the construction of a new campus at Dorigny in \u00c9cublens, began. The inauguration of the first EPFL buildings of the new campus took place in 1978.\nThe EPFL campus has been evolving ever since. The first stage of development, with a total budget of 462 million Swiss francs, was completed in 1984; the second in 1990.\nConstruction of the northern parts of campus began in 1995 with the Microtechnology building (BM), completed in 1998, and the architecture building (SG), completed in 2000. In 2002, the department of architecture also moved to the campus in \u00c9cublens, uniting all departments of EPFL on the same site. The latest addition to the EPFL campus is the Rolex Learning Center completed in February 2010. The Rolex Learning Center is the main campus library and includes areas for work, leisure and services and is located at the center of the campus. The campus has also been expanded with the construction of the SwissTech Convention Center inaugurated in March 2014. As of 2022, RTS began the construction of a regional production center on campus in collaboration with EPFL.\nTogether with the University of Lausanne, EPFL forms a vast campus complex at the shores of Lake Geneva with about 20,000 students combined.\nThe campus is served by the Lausanne Metro Line 1 (M1) and is equipped with an electric bicycle sharing system. Since 2012, only electricity from certified hydroelectric generation is being bought by EPFL to power its campus. The university was the first campus to receive the \"International Sustainable Campus Excellence Award\" by the \"International Sustainable Campus Network\".\nOf the 14,000 people that work and study at the campus, roughly 9.300 are students in either Bachelor, Master or Doctoral programs, the remaining 4,700 being administrative staff, scientists, technical staff, professors and the entrepreneurs located in the Science Park EPFL7. More than 125 nationalities are represented on campus with 48% of the student population being foreign nationals.\nAlmost all of the structures are on its main campus. However, it also has branches in Neuch\u00e2tel (\"Microcity\"), in Sion (\"P\u00f4le EPFL Valais\"), in Geneva (Campus Biotech, including the Wyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-engineering) and in Fribourg (\"Smart Living Lab\"). There was also a research centre in Ras al-Khaimah (United Arab Emirates), EPFL Middle East, between 2009 and 2022.\nBuildings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe campus consists of about 65 buildings on . Built according to the growth of the school, the campus includes different types of architectures:\nThe EPFL and the University of Lausanne share an active sports centre on the shores of Lake Geneva, away from EPFL, about five minutes by car.\nAssociated campuses.\nBeyond its main campus, EPFL operates a network of associated campuses in Western Switzerland, often sharing these spaces with partner academic institutions and hospitals:\nLanguage Centre.\nThe Language Centre offers language and communication modules for French, German, Italian and English (CEFR levels A1 to C2) to enable learners to participate more effectively in academic, professional and social situations in an internationalized multilingual and multicultural context. These modules are reserved for EPFL students, staff members and for their spouses.\nTandems are also organized and set up within the framework of the Tandem Program of the Faculty of Arts/EFLE of the University of Lausanne. This concept includes two people of different first languages meeting regularly to teach each other their respective language.\nStudents and traditions.\nStudent body.\nThe number of students attending studying at EPFL has been rising heavily since EPFL was formed in 1969 under its current name. In 1969 EPFL had roughly 1400 students; that number had grown to 2367 by 1982, 4302 by 1997, 9921 students in 2014, and 10,536 students at the end of 2016. Within the student body, 112 different nationalities are represented. In the period from 1982 to 2014 the female proportion of the student body has increased from 12% to 27%. The proportion of female students is lowest at the School of Computer Science and Communication (15%) and highest at the School of Life Sciences (49%).\nClubs.\nThe school encourages the formation of associations and sports activities on campus. As of 2023, there are nearly a hundred clubs and associations on campus for recreational and social purposes. In addition, the school has its own monthly newspaper, \"Flash\". Included in the 79 associations are\nMusic festivals.\nSeveral music festivals are held yearly. The largest one is the Bal\u00e9lec Festival, organized in May each year since 1981. The festival welcomes 15,000 visitors to around 30 concerts.\nArchimedean Oath.\nEPFL was the birthplace of the Archimedean Oath, proposed by students in 1990. The Archimedean Oath has since spread to a number of European engineering schools. The Archimedean Oath is an ethical code of practice for engineers and technicians, similar to the Hippocratic Oath used in the medical world.\nHarassment and sexism.\nIn 2020, the student association Polyquity published numerous testimonies from students via an Instagram account @payetonepfl denouncing cases of sexual, homophobic and racist harassment as well as cases of rape within the associations present on campus but also within the teaching staff. The student association denounces serious failings of the institution that is supposed to manage harassment.\nSchools &amp; Colleges.\nEPFL is organised into eight schools and colleges, themselves formed of institutes that group research units (laboratories or chairs) around common themes:\nIn addition to the eight schools there are seven closely related institutions:\nNotable people.\nPresidents.\nThe school had directors from 1853 to 1969. In 1969, the school was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute.

It was approximately A4 paper sized and lightweight at , running on four AA batteries for 20 hours of use.\nIt was packaged with a built-in combined word processing/spreadsheet/database application called \"PipeDream\" (functionally equivalent to a 1987 BBC Micro ROM called Acornsoft View Professional), along with several other applications and utilities, such as a Z80-version of the BBC BASIC programming language.\nHistory.\nThe Z88 evolved from Sir Clive Sinclair's \"Pandora\" portable computer project which had been under development at Sinclair Research during the mid-1980s. Following the sale of Sinclair Research to Amstrad, Sinclair released the Z88 through his Cambridge Computer mail-order company, as he was no longer permitted to use the Sinclair name after the sale. The machine was launched at the \"Which Computer?\" Show on 17 February 1987. Early models were contract-manufactured by Thorn EMI but production later switched to SCI Systems in Irvine, Scotland.\nDesign.\nThe Z88 is a notebook computer weighing , based on a low-power CMOS version of the popular Zilog Z80 microprocessor. It comes with 32\u00a0kB of internal pseudo-static RAM and 128\u00a0kB of ROM containing the operating system (called \"OZ\"). The memory can be expanded up to 3.5\u00a0MB of RAM, the contents of which are preserved across sessions. An integrated capacitor prevents the Z88 from losing its data for the limited time it takes to change the batteries.\nThe machine uses a membrane keyboard, which is almost silent in use; an optional electronic \"click\" can be turned on to indicate keystrokes. The Z88 is powered by four AA batteries, giving up to 20 hours of use. It has three memory card slots, which accommodate proprietary RAM, EPROM or flash cards, the third slot being equipped with a built-in EPROM programmer. Card capacities range from 32\u00a0kB to 1\u00a0MB.\nThe Z88 has a built-in eight-line, 64 \u00d7 640 pixel super-twisted nematic display which has greater contrast than conventional twisted nematic LCDs.\nThe 64\u00a0kB addressable by the Z80 processor are divided in four banks of 16\u00a0kB each. The maximum memory of 4\u00a0MiB for the system is also divided in 256 segments of 16\u00a0kB each. The hardware can map any of the 16\u00a0kB blocks to any of the four banks. The first 512\u00a0kB are reserved for ROM; the next 512\u00a0kB are reserved for internal RAM. The next 3\u00a0MB are assigned to each one of the three memory slots.\nPostmarket upgrades.\nSince 1998, a 1\u00a0MiB flash memory card has been available which provides convenient non-volatile storage. Once written to the card, files are safe and not reliant on a power supply. Unlike traditional EPROM cards (erased with an external ultraviolet light), this one can be electrically erased in the computer's slot. The first generation of card only worked in slot 3 where a 12\u00a0V signal (Vpp) is available. The later generation is based on AMD chips and runs with 5\u00a0V for erasure. It is possible to read, write and erase flash cards in the three slots and the internal one.\nIt is also possible for an experienced user to replace the built-in 32\u00a0kB RAM chip with a bigger 128 or 512\u00a0kB static RAM chip. However, the latter requires some extra board modifications, and 512\u00a0kB is the biggest size that can be addressed by the Z88 for the internal RAM. A similar modification is possible for the internal ROM slot. A 512\u00a0kB flash chip can replace the original ROM, allowing an upgrade of the operating system.\nReception.\nJerry Pournelle in February 1989 described the Z88 as \"the most portable computer I've ever seen\", much more so than his Zenith SupersPort 286. He said that the screen was small but readable, and thought that his $894 estimate for a minimum configuration was \"not a \"lot\" of money for good hardware\". Pournelle said that Pipedream was \"disappointingly hard to use\", reported that all of his notes in the software from COMDEX had vanished because he did not explicitly save them to memory card, and suggested that the Z88 was best suited as a second computer for students and reporters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Cherokee removal in 1838 was the last forced removal east of the Mississippi and was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush. The relocated peoples suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their newly designated Indian reserve. Thousands died from disease before reaching their destinations or shortly after. A variety of scholars have classified the Trail of Tears as an example of the genocide of Native Americans; others categorize it as ethnic cleansing.\nOverview.\nIn 1830, a group of Indian nations collectively referred to as the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" (the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole nations), were living autonomously in what would later be termed the American Deep South. The process of cultural transformation from their traditional way of life towards a white American way of life as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw.\nAmerican settlers had been pressuring the federal government to remove Indians from the Southeast; many settlers were encroaching on Indian lands, while others wanted more land made available to the settlers. Although the effort was vehemently opposed by some, including U.S. Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee, President Andrew Jackson was able to gain Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to extinguish any Indian title to land claims in the Southeast.\nIn 1831, the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed, and their removal served as the model for all future relocations. After two wars, many Seminoles were removed in 1832. The Creek removal followed in 1834, the Chickasaw in 1837, and lastly the Cherokee in 1838. Some managed to evade the removals, however, and remained in their ancestral homelands; some Choctaw still reside in Mississippi, Creek in Alabama and Florida, Cherokee in North Carolina, and Seminole in Florida. A small group of Seminole, fewer than 500, evaded forced removal; the modern Seminole Nation of Florida is descended from these individuals. A number of non-Indians who lived with the nations, including over 4,000 slaves and others of African descent such as spouses or Freedmen, also accompanied the Indians on the trek westward. By 1837, 46,000 Indians from the southeastern states had been removed from their homelands, thereby opening for white settlement. When the \"Five Tribes\" arrived in Indian Territory, \"they followed their physical appropriation of Plains Indians' land with an erasure of their predecessor's history\", and \"perpetuated the idea that they had found an undeveloped 'wilderness\" when they arrived\" in an attempt to appeal to white American values by participating in the settler colonial process themselves. Other Indian nations, such as the Quapaws and Osages had moved to Indian Territory before the \"Five Tribes\" and saw them as intruders.\nHistorical background.\nBefore 1838, the fixed boundaries of these autonomous Indian nations, comprising large areas of the United States, were subject to continual cession and annexation, in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force in the newly declared U.S. territories\u2014federally administered regions whose boundaries supervened upon the Indian treaty claims. As these territories became U.S. states, state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders, which were independent of state jurisdiction, and to expropriate the land therein. These pressures were exacerbated by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South, with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands after the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney.\nMany people of the southeastern Indian nations had become economically integrated into the economy of the region. This included the plantation economy and the possession of slaves, who were also forcibly relocated during the removal.\nPrior to Jackson's presidency, removal policy was already in place and justified by the myth of the \"Vanishing Indian\". Historian Jeffrey Ostler explains that \"Scholars have exposed how the discourse of the vanishing Indian was an ideology that made declining Indigenous American populations seem to be an inevitable consequence of natural processes and so allowed Americans to evade moral responsibility for their destructive choices\". Despite the common association of Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears, ideas for Removal began prior to Jackson's presidency. Ostler explains,\u00a0\"A singular focus on Jackson obscures the fact that he did not invent the idea of removal...Months after the passage of the Removal Act, Jackson described the legislation as the 'happy consummation' of a policy 'pursued for nearly 30 years'\". James Fenimore Cooper was also a key component of the maintenance of the \"vanishing Indian\" myth. This vanishing narrative can be seen as existing prior to the Trail of Tears through Cooper's novel \"The Last of the Mohicans\". Scholar and author Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz shows that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cooper has the last of the 'noble' and 'pure' Natives die off as nature would have it, with the 'last Mohican' handing the continent over to Hawkeye, the nativized settler, his adopted son\u00a0... Cooper had much to do with creating the US origin myth to which generations of historians have dedicated themselves, fortifying what historian Francis Jennings has described as \"exclusion from the process of formation of American society and culture\".\nJackson's role.\nAlthough Jackson was not the sole, or original, architect of Removal policy, his contributions were influential in its trajectory. Jackson's support for the removal of the Indians began at least a decade before his presidency. Indian removal was Jackson's top legislative priority upon taking office. After being elected president, he wrote in his first address to Congress: \"The emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry\". The prioritization of American Indian removal and his violent past created a sense of restlessness among U.S. territories. During his presidency, \"the United States made eighty-six treaties with twenty-six American Indian nations between New York and the Mississippi, all of them forcing land cessions, including removals\".\nIn a speech regarding Indian removal, Jackson said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay, which is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them gradually, under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels, to cast off their savage habits and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community.\nThe removals, conducted under both Presidents Jackson and Van Buren, followed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which provided the president with powers to exchange land with Indian nations and provide infrastructure improvements on the existing lands. The law also gave the president power to pay for transportation costs to the West, should the nations willingly choose to relocate. The law did not, however, allow the president to force Indian nations to move west without a mutually agreed-upon treaty. Referring to the Indian Removal Act, Martin Van Buren, Jackson's vice president and successor, is quoted as saying \"There was no measure, in the whole course of [Jackson's] administration, of which he was more exclusively the author than this.\"\nAccording to historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Jackson's intentions were outwardly violent. Dunbar-Ortiz claims that Jackson believed in \"bleeding enemies to give them their senses\" on his quest to \"serve the goal of U.S. expansion\". According to her, American Indians presented an obstacle to the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny, in his mind. Throughout his military career, according to historian Amy H. Sturgis, \"Jackson earned and emphasized his reputation as an 'Indian fighter', a man who believed creating fear in the native population was more desirable than cultivating friendship\". In a message to Congress on the eve of Indian Removal, December 6, 1830, Jackson wrote that removal \"will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of Alabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly in population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites.\" In this way, Sturgis has argued that Jackson demarcated the Indian population as an \"obstacle\" to national success. Sturgis writes that Jackson's removal policies were met with pushback from respectable social figures and that \"many leaders of Jacksonian reform movements were particularly disturbed by U.S policy toward American Indians\". Among these opponents were women's advocate and founder of the American Woman's Educational Association Catherine Beecher and politician Davy Crockett.\nHistorian Francis Paul Prucha, on the other hand, writes that these assessments were put forward by Jackson's political opponents and that Jackson had benevolent intentions. According to him, Jackson's critics have been too harsh, if not wrong. He states that Jackson never developed a doctrinaire anti-Indian attitude and that his dominant goal was to preserve the security and well-being of the United States and its Indian and white inhabitants. Corroborating Prucha's interpretation, historian Robert V. Remini argues that Jackson never intended the \"monstrous result\" of his policy. Remini argues further that had Jackson not orchestrated the removal of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" from their ancestral homelands, they would have been totally wiped out.\nTreaty of New Echota.\nJackson chose to continue with Indian removal, and negotiated the Treaty of New Echota, on December 29, 1835, which granted the Cherokee two years to move to Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). The Chickasaws and Choctaws had readily accepted and signed treaties with the U.S. government, while the Creeks did so under coercion.\nThe negotiation of the Treaty of New Echota was largely encouraged by Jackson, and it was signed by a minority Cherokee political faction, the Treaty Party, led by Cherokee leader Elias Boudinot. However, the treaty was opposed by most of the Cherokee people, as it was not approved by the Cherokee National Council, and it was not signed by Principal Chief John Ross. The Cherokee National Council submitted a petition, signed by thousands of Cherokee citizens, urging Congress to void the agreement in February 1836. Despite this opposition, the Senate ratified the treaty in March 1836, and the Treaty of New Echota thus became the legal basis for the Trail of Tears. Only a fraction of the Cherokees left voluntarily. The U.S. government, with assistance from state militias, forced most of the remaining Cherokees west in 1838.\nThe Cherokees were temporarily remanded in camps in eastern Tennessee. In November, the Cherokee were broken into groups of around 1,000 each and began the journey west. They endured heavy rains, snow, and freezing temperatures. When the Cherokee negotiated the Treaty of New Echota, they exchanged all their land east of the Mississippi for land in modern Oklahoma and a $5 million payment from the federal government. Many Cherokee felt betrayed that their leadership accepted the deal, and over 16,000 Cherokee signed a petition to prevent the passage of the treaty.\nBy the end of the decade in 1840, tens of thousands of Cherokee and other Indian nations had been removed from their land east of the Mississippi River. The Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chicksaw were also relocated under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. One Choctaw leader portrayed the removal as \"A Trail of Tears and Deaths\", a devastating event that removed most of the Indian population of the southeastern United States from their traditional homelands.\nLegal background.\nThe establishment of the Indian Territory and the extinguishing of Indian land claims east of the Mississippi by the Indian Removal Act anticipated the U.S. Indian reservation system, which was imposed on remaining Indian lands later in the 19th century. The statutory argument for Indian sovereignty persisted until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\" (1831), that the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore not entitled to a hearing before the court. In the years after the Indian Removal Act, the Cherokee filed several lawsuits regarding conflicts with the state of Georgia. Some of these cases reached the Supreme Court, the most influential being \"Worcester v. Georgia\" (1832). Samuel Worcester and the group of white Christian missionaries he was in were convicted by Georgia law for living in Cherokee territory in the state of Georgia without a license in 1831. Worcester was sentenced to prison for four years and appealed the ruling, arguing that this sentence violated treaties made between Indian nations and the United States federal government by imposing state laws on Cherokee lands. The Court ruled in Worcester's favor, declaring that the Cherokee Nation was subject only to federal law and that the Supremacy Clause barred legislative interference by the state of Georgia.\nChief Justice Marshall argued, \"The Cherokee nation, then, is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force. The whole intercourse between the United States and this Nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.\"\nThe Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision. \"Worcester\" thus imposed no obligations on Jackson; there was nothing for him to enforce, although Jackson's' political enemies conspired to find evidence, to be used in the forthcoming political election, to claim that he would refuse to enforce the \"Worcester\" decision. He feared that enforcement would lead to open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, which would compound the ongoing crisis in South Carolina and lead to a broader civil war. Instead, he vigorously negotiated a land exchange treaty with the Cherokee.\nAfter this, Jackson's political opponents Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams, who supported the \"Worcester\" decision, became outraged by Jackson's alleged refusal to uphold Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia. Author and political activist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an account of Cherokee assimilation into the American culture, declaring his support of the \"Worcester\" decision.\nAt the time, members of individual Indian nations were not considered United States citizens. While citizenship tests existed for Indians living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation, individual U.S. states did not recognize the Indian nations' land claims, only individual title under State law, and distinguished between the rights of white and non-white citizens, who often had limited standing in court; and Indian removal was carried out under U.S. military jurisdiction, often by state militias. As a result, individual Indians who could prove U.S. citizenship were nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas.\nChoctaw removal.\nThe Choctaw nation resided in large portions of what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. After a series of treaties starting in 1801, the Choctaw nation was reduced to . The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early 1831. The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain. The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty presented by the federal government. President Jackson wanted strong negotiations with the Choctaws in Mississippi, and the Choctaws seemed much more cooperative than Andrew Jackson had imagined. The treaty provided that the United States would bear the expense of moving their homes and that they had to be removed within two and a half years of the signed treaty. The chief of the Choctaw nation, George W. Harkins, wrote to the citizens of the United States before the removals were to commence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is with considerable diffidence that I attempt to address the American people, knowing and feeling sensibly my incompetency; and believing that your highly and well-improved minds would not be well entertained by the address of a Choctaw. But having determined to emigrate west of the Mississippi river this fall, I have thought proper in bidding you farewell to make a few remarks expressive of my views, and the feelings that actuate me on the subject of our removal... We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free, than live under the degrading influence of laws, which our voice could not be heard in their formation.\u2014\u200a\nUnited States Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals. Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in November 1831 and ending in 1833. The first groups met at Memphis and Vicksburg, where a harsh winter battered the emigrants with flash floods, sleet, and snow. Initially, the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon but floods halted them. With food running out, the residents of Vicksburg and Memphis were concerned. Five steamboats (the \"Walter Scott\", the \"Brandywine\", the \"Reindeer\", the \"Talma\", and the \"Cleopatra\") would ferry Choctaws to their river-based destinations. The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about to Arkansas Post. There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week with the rivers clogged with ice, so there could be no travel for weeks. Food rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn, one turnip, and two cups of heated water per day. Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to transport them to Little Rock. When they reached Little Rock, a Choctaw chief referred to their trek as a \"trail of tears and death\". The Vicksburg group was led by an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps.\nAlexis de Tocqueville, the French philosopher, witnessed the Choctaw removals while in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1831:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction, something which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu; one couldn't watch without feeling one's heart wrung. The Indians were tranquil but somber and taciturn. There was one who could speak English and of whom I asked why the Chactas were leaving their country. \"To be free,\" he answered, could never get any other reason out of him. We ... watch the expulsion ... of one of the most celebrated and ancient American peoples.\u2014\u200a\nNearly 17,000 Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma. About 2,500\u20136,000 died along the trail of tears. Approximately 5,000\u20136,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts. The Choctaws who chose to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict, harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaws \"have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died\". The Choctaws in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.\nSeminole resistance.\nThe U.S. acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty and took possession in 1821. In 1832 the Seminoles were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the Ocklawaha River. The Treaty of Payne's Landing called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek nation, who considered them deserters; some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek bands but also from other Indian nations. Those among the nation who once were members of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28, 1833, that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the Indian nations and bands that resided on the reservation. The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834. On December 28, 1835, a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U.S. Army company marching from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala, killing all but three of the 110 army troops. This came to be known as the Dade Massacre.\nAs the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.\nOther war chiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee, Jumper, and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole resistance against the army. The war ended, after a full decade of fighting, in 1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent about $20,000,000 on the war, ($ today). Many Indians were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi; others retreated into the Everglades. In the end, the government gave up trying to subjugate the Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than 500 Seminoles in peace. Other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars.\nAs a result of the Seminole Wars, the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only federally recognized Indian nation which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a peace treaty with the United States.\nIn general the American people tended to view the Indian resistance as unwarranted. An article published by the Virginia \"Enquirer\" on January 26, 1836, called the \"Hostilities of the Seminoles\", assigned all the blame for the violence that came from the Seminole's resistance to the Seminoles themselves. The article accuses the Indians of not staying true to their word\u2014the promises they supposedly made in the treaties and negotiations from the Indian Removal Act.\nCreek dissolution.\nAfter the War of 1812, some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh and Chief Shelocta signed treaties that ceded more land to Georgia. The 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South. Friendly Creek leaders, like Shelocta and Big Warrior, addressed Sharp Knife (the Indian nickname for Andrew Jackson) and reminded him that they keep the peace. Nevertheless, Jackson retorted that they did not \"cut (Tecumseh's) throat\" when they had the chance, so they must now cede Creek lands. Jackson also ignored Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their nations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Jackson opened this first peace session by faintly acknowledging the help of the friendly Creeks. That done, he turned to the Red Sticks and admonished them for listening to evil counsel. For their crime, he said, the entire Creek Nation must pay. He demanded the equivalent of all expenses incurred by the United States in prosecuting the war, which by his calculation came to of land.\u2014\u200a\nEventually, the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense. Nevertheless, on February 12, 1825, McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs, which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia. After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, McIntosh was assassinated on April 30, 1825, by Creeks led by Menawa.\nThe Creek National Council, led by Opothle Yohola, protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was fraudulent. President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic, and eventually, the treaty was nullified in a new agreement, the Treaty of Washington (1826). The historian R. Douglas Hurt wrote: \"The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian nation had ever done or would do again\u2014achieve the annulment of a ratified treaty.\" However, Governor George Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty. At first, President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops, but Troup called out the militia, and Adams, fearful of a civil war, conceded. As he explained to his intimates, \"The Indians are not worth going to war over.\"\nAlthough the Creeks had been forced from Georgia, with many Lower Creeks moving to the Indian Territory, there were still about 20,000 Upper Creeks living in Alabama. However, the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creeks. Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama; when none was forthcoming, the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24, 1832, which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments. Creeks could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to the west, or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws. The Creeks were never given a fair chance to comply with the terms of the treaty, however. Rampant illegal settlement of their lands by Americans continued unabated with federal and state authorities unable or unwilling to do much to halt it. Further, as recently detailed by historian Billy Winn in his thorough chronicle of the events leading to removal, a variety of fraudulent schemes designed to cheat the Creeks out of their allotments, many of them organized by speculators operating out of Columbus, Georgia and Montgomery, Alabama, were perpetrated after the signing of the Treaty of Cusseta. A portion of the beleaguered Creeks, many desperately poor and feeling abused and oppressed by their American neighbors, struck back by carrying out occasional raids on area farms and committing other isolated acts of violence. Escalating tensions erupted into open war with the United States after the destruction of the village of Roanoke, Georgia, located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory, in May 1836. During the so-called \"Creek War of 1836\" Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830 it continued into 1835 and after as in 1836 over 15,000 Creeks were driven from their land for the last time. 3,500 of those 15,000 Creeks did not survive the trip to Oklahoma where they eventually settled.\nChickasaw monetary removal.\nThe Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five-year debate. They paid the Choctaws $530,000 (equal to $ today) for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land. The first group of Chickasaws moved in 1837 and was led by John M. Millard. The Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July 4, 1837, with all of their assets\u2014belongings, livestock, and slaves. Once across the Mississippi River, they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks. Once in Indian Territory, the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation.\nCherokee forced relocation.\nBy 1838, about 2,000 Cherokee had voluntarily relocated from Georgia to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Forcible removals began in May 1838 when General Winfield Scott received a final order from President Martin Van Buren to relocate the remaining Cherokees. On 17 May 1838, General Scott issued Order No. 25, in the text he stated \" Every possible kindness, compatible with the necessity of removal, must, therefore, be shown by the troops, and, if, in the ranks, a despicable individual should be found, capable of inflicting a wanton injury or insult on any Cherokee man, woman or child, it is hereby made the special duty of the nearest good officer or man, instantly to interpose, and to seize and consign the guilty wretch to the severest penalty of the laws. The Major General is fully persuaded that this injunction will not be neglected by the brave men under his command, who cannot be otherwise than jealous of their own honor and that of their country.\" Approximately 4,000 Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma. In the Cherokee language, the event is called ('the place where they cried') or ('the trail where they cried'). The Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota, an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which exchanged Indian land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River, but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people.\nThere were significant changes in gender relations within the Cherokee Nation during the implementation of the Indian Removal Act during the 1830s. Cherokee historically operated on a matrilineal kinship system, where children belonged to the clan of their mother and their only relatives were those who could be traced through her. In addition to being matrilineal, Cherokees were also matrilocal. According to the naturalist William Bartram, \"Marriage gives no right to the husband over the property of his wife; and when they part, she keeps the children and property belonging to them.\" In this way, the typical Cherokee family was structured in a way where the wife held possession to the property, house, and children. However, during the 1820s and 1830s, \"Cherokees [began adopting] the Anglo-American concept of power\u2014a political system dominated by wealthy, highly acculturated men and supported by an ideology that made women ... subordinate\".\nThe Treaty of New Echota was largely signed by men. While women were present at the rump council negotiating the treaty, they did not have a seat at the table to participate in the proceedings. Historian Theda Perdue explains that \"Cherokee women met in their own councils to discuss their own opinions\" despite not being able to participate. The inability for women to join in on the negotiation and signing of the Treaty of New Echota shows how the role of women changed dramatically within Cherokee Nation following colonial encroachment. For instance, Cherokee women played a significant role in the negotiation of land transactions as late as 1785, where they spoke at a treaty conference held at Hopewell, South Carolina to clarify land cessions to the U.S. forced on the Cherokee due to their alliance with Britain during the American Revolutionary War.\nThe sparsely inhabited Cherokee lands were highly attractive to Georgian farmers experiencing population pressure, and illegal settlements resulted. Long-simmering tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1829, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the second gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure mounted to fulfill the \"Compact of 1802\" in which the US Government promised to extinguish Indian land claims in the state of Georgia.\nWhen Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\" (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in \"Worcester v. Georgia\" (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government\u2014not state governments\u2014had authority in Indian affairs. \"Worcester v Georgia\" is associated with Andrew Jackson's famous, though apocryphal, quote \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\" In reality, this quote did not appear until 30 years after the incident and was first printed in a textbook authored by Jackson critic Horace Greeley.\nFearing open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, Jackson decided not to enforce Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia. He was already embroiled in a constitutional crisis with South Carolina (i.e. the nullification crisis) and favored Cherokee relocation over civil war. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty.\nThe final treaty, passed in Congress by a single vote, and signed by President Andrew Jackson, was imposed by his successor President Martin Van Buren. Van Buren allowed Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama an armed force of 7,000 militiamen, army regulars, and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to relocate about 13,000 Cherokees to Cleveland, Tennessee. After the initial roundup, the U.S. military oversaw the emigration to Oklahoma. Former Cherokee lands were immediately opened to settlement. Most of the deaths during the journey were caused by disease, malnutrition, and exposure during an unusually cold winter.\nThe U.S. Army, under General Scott, initially rounded up and brought the Cherokee to several staging camps, after which Scott halted operations due to high numbers of deaths. The rest of the overland journey was subsequently conducted under the auspices of Chief John Ross, with government funding.\nIn the winter of 1838 the Cherokee began the march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or moccasins. The march began in Red Clay, Tennessee, the location of the last Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation. Because of the diseases, the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way; many times this meant traveling much farther to go around them. After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky, they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda in southern Illinois about the 3rd of December 1838. Here the starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $ today) to cross the river on \"Berry's Ferry\" which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $ today. They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under \"Mantle Rock\", a shelter bluff on the Kentucky side, until \"Berry had nothing better to do\". Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross. Several Cherokee were murdered by locals. The Cherokee filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the courthouse in Vienna, suing the government for $35 a head (equal to $ today) to bury the murdered Cherokee.\nAs they crossed southern Illinois, on December 26, Martin Davis, commissary agent for Moses Daniel's detachment, wrote:\nThere is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever experienced anywhere. The streams are all frozen over something like thick. We are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals. It snows here every two or three days at the fartherest. We are now camped in Mississippi [River] swamp from the river, and there is no possible chance of crossing the river for the numerous quantity of ice that comes floating down the river every day. We have only traveled on the last month, including the time spent at this place, which has been about three weeks. It is unknown when we shall cross the river...\nA volunteer soldier from Georgia who participated in the removal recounted:\nI fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.\nIt eventually took almost three months to cross the on land between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The trek through southern Illinois is where the Cherokee suffered most of their deaths. However a few years before forced removal, some Cherokee who opted to leave their homes voluntarily chose a water-based route through the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It took only 21 days, but the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated were wary of water travel.\nEnvironmental researchers David Gaines and Jere Krakow outline the \"context of the tragic Cherokee relocation\" as one predicated on the difference between \"Indian regard for the land, and its contrast with the Euro-Americans view of land as property\". This divergence in perspective on land, according to sociologists Gregory Hooks and Chad L. Smith, led to the homes of American Indian people \"being donated and sold off\" by the United States government to \"promote the settlement and development of the West,\" with railroad developers, white settlers, land developers, and mining companies assuming ownership. In American Indian society, according to Colville scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, it caused \"the loss of ancient connections to homelands and sacred sites,\" \"the deaths of upward of 25 percent of those on the trail\" and \"the loss of life-sustaining livestock and crops.\"\nDina Gilio-Whitaker draws on research by Choctaw and Chippewa historian Clara Sue Kidwell to show the relationship between the Trail of Tears and a negative impact on the environment. In tracking the environmental changes of the southeastern tribes who relocated to new lands across the Trail of Tears, Kidwell finds that \"prior to removal the tribes had already begun adapting to a cash-based, private property economic system with their adoption of many European customs (including the practice of slave owning), after their move west they had become more deeply entrenched into the American economic system with the discovery of coal deposits and the western expansion of the railroads on and through their lands. So while they adapted to their new environments, their relationship to land would change to fit the needs of an imposed capitalist system\". Cherokee ethnobotanist Clint Carroll illustrates how this imposed capitalist system altered Cherokee efforts to protect traditional medicinal plants during relocation, saying that \"these changes have resulted in contrasting land management paradigms, rooted in the language of 'resource-based' versus 'relationship-based' approaches, a binary imposed on tribal governments by the Bureau of Indian Affairs through their historically paternalistic relationship\". This shift in land management as a function of removal had negative environmental ramifications such as solidifying \"a deeply entrenched bureaucratic structure that still drives much of the federal-tribal relationship and determines how tribal governments use their lands, sometimes in ways that contribute to climate change and, in extreme cases, ways that lead to human rights abuses\".\nIn addition to a physical relocation, American Indian removal and the Trail of Tears had social and cultural effects as American Indians were forced \"to contemplate abandonment of their native land. To the Cherokees life was a part of the land. Every rock, every tree, every place had a spirit. And the spirit was central to the tribal lifeway. To many, the thought of loss of place was a thought of loss of self, loss of Cherokeeness, and a loss of life- way\". This cultural shift is characterized by Gilio-Whitaker as \"environmental deprivation,\" a concept that \"relates to historical processes of land and resource dispossession calculated to bring about the destruction of Indigenous Americans' lives and cultures. Environmental deprivation in this sense refers to actions by settlers and settler governments that are designed to block Native peoples' access to life-giving and culture-affirming resources\". The separation of American Indian people from their land lead to the loss of cultural knowledge and practices, as described by scholar Rachel Robison-Greene, who finds the \"legacy of fifteenth-century European colonial domination\" led to \"Indigenous knowledge and perspectives\" being \"ignored and denigrated by the vast majority of social, physical, biological and agricultural scientists, and governments using colonial powers to exploit Indigenous resources\". Indigenous cultural and intellectual contribution to \"environmental issues\" in the form of a \"rich history, cultural customs, and practical wisdom regarding sustainable environmental practices\" can be lost because of Indigenous removal and the Trail of Tears, according to Greene.\nRemoved Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. When signing the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 Major Ridge said \"I have signed my death warrant.\" The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of the leaders of the Treaty Party, only Stand Watie escaped death. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States.\nThere were some exceptions to removal. Approximately 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states. Those Cherokees who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokees, sometimes referred to as the Oconaluftee Cherokee due to their settlement near to the river of the same name, lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal. Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet, Tsali, who was executed by a firing squad as were most of his family. These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.\nA local newspaper, the \"Highland Messenger\", said July 24, 1840, \"that between nine hundred and a thousand of these deluded beings ... are still hovering about the homes of their fathers, in the counties of Macon and Cherokee\" and \"that they are a great annoyance to the citizens\" who wanted to buy land there believing the Cherokee were gone; the newspaper reported that President Martin Van Buren said \"they ... are, in his opinion, free to go or stay.'\nSeveral Cherokee speakers throughout history offered first-hand accounts of the events of the Trail of Tears as well as provided insight into its lasting effects. Elias Budinot, Major Ridge, Speckled Snake, John Ross, and Richard Taylor were all notable Cherokee orators during the 19th century who used the speech as a form of resistance against the U.S. government. John Ross, the Cherokee Chief from 1828 to 1866, and Major Ridge embarked on a speaking tour within the Cherokee Nation itself in hopes of strengthening a sense of unity amongst the tribal members. Tribal unity was a central tenet to Cherokee resistance, with Ross stating in his council address: \"'Much...depends on our unity of sentiment and firmness of action, in maintaining those sacred rights which we have ever enjoyed'\". Cherokee speeches like this were made even more important because the state of Georgia made it illegal for members of American Indian tribes to both speak to an all-white court and convince other Indian tribal members not to move.\nAnother influential Cherokee figure was Cherokee writer John Ridge, son of Major Ridge, who wrote four articles using the pseudonym \"Socrates\". His works were published in the Cherokee Phoenix, the nation's newspaper. The choice of pseudonym, according to literary scholar Kelly Wisecup, \"...facilitated a rhetorical structure that created not only a public persona recognizable to the Phoenix's multiple readerships but also a public character who argued forcefully that white readers should respect Cherokee rights and claims\". The main focal points of Ridge's articles critiqued the perceived hypocrisy of the U.S. government, colonial history, and the events leading up to the Trail of Tears, using excerpts from American and European history and literature.\nEastern Cherokee Restitution.\nThe United States Court of Claims ruled in favor of the Eastern Cherokee Nation's claim against the U.S. on May 18, 1905. This resulted in the appropriation of $1 million (equal to $27,438,023.04 today) to the Nation's eligible individuals and families. Interior Department employee Guion Miller created a list using several rolls and applications to verify tribal enrollment for the distribution of funds, known as the Guion Miller Roll. The applications received documented over 125,000 individuals; the court approved more than 30,000 individuals to share in the funds.\nLegacy.\nTerminology.\nThe events have sometimes been referred to as \"death marches\", in particular when referring to the Cherokee march across Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri in 1838.\nIndians who had the means initially provided for their own removal. Contingents that were led by conductors from the U.S. Army included those led by Edward Deas, who was claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight. The largest death toll from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May 23, 1838 deadline. This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded up into camps and placed into large groups, often over 700 in size. Communicable diseases spread quickly through these closely quartered groups, killing many. These groups were among the last to move, but following the same routes the others had taken; the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to the vast numbers that had gone before them. The marchers were subject to extortion and violence along the route. In addition, these final contingents were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year, killing many. Exposure to the elements, disease, starvation, harassment by local frontiersmen, and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one-third of the Choctaw and other nations on the march. There exists some debate among historians and the affected nations as to whether the term \"Trail of Tears\" should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the Eastern United States into Indian Territory, to the relocations of specifically the Five Civilized Tribes, to the route of the march, or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from each area were rounded up.\nClassification debate.\nThere is debate among historians about how the Trail of Tears should be classified. Some historians classify the events as a form of ethnic cleansing; others refer to it as genocide.\nHistorian and biographer Robert V. Remini wrote that Jackson's policy on Native Americans was based on good intentions. He writes: \"Jackson fully expected the Indians to thrive in their new surroundings, educate their children, acquire the skills of white civilization so as to improve their living conditions, and become citizens of the United States. Removal, in his mind, would provide all these blessings...Jackson genuinely believed that what he had accomplished rescued these people from inevitable annihilation.\" Historian Sean Wilentz writes that some critics who label Indian removal as genocide view Jacksonian democracy as a \"momentous transition from the ethical community upheld by antiremoval men\", and says this view is a caricature of US history that \"turns tragedy into melodrama, exaggerates parts at the expense of the whole, and sacrifices nuance for sharpness\". Historian Donald B. Cole, too, argues that it is difficult to find evidence of a conscious desire for genocide in Jackson's policy on Native Americans, but dismisses the idea that Jackson was motivated by the welfare of Native Americans. Colonial historian Daniel Blake Smith disagrees with the usage of the term genocide, adding that \"no one wanted, let alone planned for, Cherokees to die in the forced removal out West\".\nHistorian Justin D. Murphy argues that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although the \"Trail of Tears\" was tragic, it does not quite meet the standard of genocide, and the extent to which tribes were allowed to retain their identity, albeit by removal, does not quite meet the standard of cultural genocide\".\nIn contrast, some scholars have debated that the Trail of Tears was a genocidal act. Historian Jeffrey Ostler argues that the threat of genocide was used to ensure Natives' compliance with removal policies,1 and concludes that, \"In its outcome and in the means used to gain compliance, the policy had genocidal dimensions.\" Patrick Wolfe argues that settler colonialism and genocide are interrelated but should be distinguished from each other, writing that settler colonialism is \"more than the summary liquidation of Indigenous people, though it includes that.\" Wolfe describes the assimilation of Indigenous people who escaped relocation (and particularly their abandonment of collectivity) as a form of cultural genocide, though he emphasises that cultural genocide is \"the real thing\" in that it resulted in large numbers of deaths. The Trail of Tears was thus a settler-colonial \"replacement\" of Indigenous people and culture in addition to a genocidal mass-killing according to Wolfe.12 Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz describes the policy as genocide, saying: \"The fledgling United States government's method of dealing with native people\u2014a process which then included systematic genocide, property theft, and total subjugation\u2014reached its nadir in 1830 under the federal policy of President Andrew Jackson.\" Mankiller emphasises that Jackson's policies were the natural extension of much earlier genocidal policies toward Native Americans established through territorial expansion during the Jefferson administration.\nDina Gilio-Whitaker, in \"As Long as Grass Grows\", describes the Trail of Tears and the Din\u00e9 long walk as structural genocide, because they destroyed Native relations to land, one another, and nonhuman beings which imperiled their culture, life, and history. According to her, these are ongoing actions that constitute both cultural and physical genocide.\nLandmarks and commemorations.\nIn 1987, about of trails were authorized by federal law to mark the removal of 17 detachments of the Cherokee people. Called the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, it traverses portions of nine states and includes land and water routes.\nTrail of Tears outdoor historical drama, \"Unto These Hills\".\nA historical drama based on the Trail of Tears, \"Unto These Hills\" written by Kermit Hunter, has sold over five million tickets for its performances since its opening on July 1, 1950, both touring and at the outdoor Mountainside Theater of the Cherokee Historical Association in Cherokee, North Carolina.\nRemember the Removal bike ride.\nA regular event, the \"Remember the Removal Bike Ride,\" entails six cyclists from the Cherokee Nation to ride over 950 miles while retracing the same path that their ancestors took. The cyclists, who average about 60 miles a day, start their journey in the former capital of the Cherokee Nation, New Echota, Georgia, and finish in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. In June 2024, Shawna Baker, justice of the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court was a mentor cyclist on the 40th commemorative ride.\nCommemorative medallion.\nCherokee artist Troy Anderson was commissioned to design the \"Cherokee Trail of Tears Sesquicentennial Commemorative Medallion\". The falling-tear medallion shows a seven-pointed star, the symbol of the seven clans of the Cherokees.\nIn literature and oral history.\nFrom the homes their fathers made // From the graves the tall trees shade // For the sake of greed and gold, // The Cherokees were forced to go // To a land they did not know; // And Father Time or wisdom old // Cannot erase, through endless years // The memory of the trail of tears.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Based on Barker's 1986 novella \"The Hellbound Heart\", the film's plot concerns a mystical puzzle box that summons the Cenobites, a group of extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic beings who cannot differentiate between pain and pleasure. It stars Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence, and Doug Bradley as the leader of the Cenobites.\nDevelopment of the film began before Barker's novella was published. Disappointed by previous adaptations of his work, Barker elected to direct himself, appropriating several actors and crew from his earlier career as a playwright. With the backing of independent producer Christopher Figg and financing from New World Pictures, filming took place in London in autumn 1986.\n\"Hellraiser\" had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. It was widely released in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors, and was a considerable commercial success, grossing $30 million from its $1 million production budget. Critical reception was initially divided, but the film has since been evaluated as a classic of the horror genre.\nThe film launched the \"Hellraiser\" franchise which includes nine sequels, the first seven of which featuring Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. A reboot, also titled \"Hellraiser\" and executive produced by Barker, was released in 2022.\nPlot.\nIn Morocco, a hedonist named Frank Cotton buys a puzzle box (referred to in the script as the Lament Configuration) said to open the door to a realm of otherworldly pleasure. At home in his bare attic, Frank solves the puzzle and hooked chains emerge, tearing him apart. \nLater, Frank's brother Larry moves into the same house. He intends to rebuild his relationship with his second wife, Julia. Larry is unaware that Julia had an affair with his brother Frank before her marriage to him. When Larry accidentally cuts his hand moving furniture, his blood drips on the attic floor and resurrects Frank in a ghoulish form. Julia later finds Frank; still obsessed with him, she agrees to help restore his body, so they can run away together. Julia picks up men in bars and brings them back to the attic, where she mortally wounds them. Frank then drains their life, which regenerates his body. Frank explains to Julia that, having exhausted all sensory experiences, he sought out the puzzle box, which was supposed to provide access to a realm of new carnal pleasures. When the puzzle was solved, the \"Cenobites\" came to subject him to extreme sadomasochism.\nKirsty, Larry's teenage daughter and Frank's niece, sees Julia bringing a man to the house and follows her to the attic, where she finds Frank. She evades Frank and escapes with the puzzle box, collapsing shortly thereafter. Awakening in a hospital, Kirsty solves the box out of curiosity, unknowingly summoning the Cenobites and a monster called the Engineer, from which she narrowly escapes. The Cenobites' leader explains that although they have been perceived as both angels and demons, they are simply \"explorers\" from another dimension seeking carnal experiences, and they can no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure. When they attempt to force Kirsty to return to their realm with them, she informs Pinhead that Frank has escaped them. The Cenobites agree to spare Kirsty and recapture Frank instead, with the condition that Frank must confess to escaping them.\nKirsty returns home, where Frank has killed Larry and has taken on his identity by wearing his skin. Julia shows her what is purported to be Frank's flayed corpse in the attic. Julia then leaves the attic, locking the door behind her. The Cenobites appear and, not fooled by the deception, demand the man who \"did this\". Kirsty tries to escape, but is held by Julia and Frank. Frank reveals his true identity to Kirsty and, when his sexual advances are rejected, he decides to kill her to complete his rejuvenation. He accidentally stabs Julia instead and drains her without remorse. Frank chases Kirsty to the attic and, when he is about to kill her, the Cenobites appear after hearing him confess to killing her father. Now certain he is the one they are looking for, they ensnare him with chains with hooks and tear him to pieces. When the Cenobites double-cross Kirsty and attempt to take her, she grabs the puzzle box from Julia's dead hands and banishes them by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box. Kirsty's boyfriend Steve arrives and they both escape the collapsing house.\nAfterwards, Kirsty throws the puzzle box onto a burning pyre. A vagrant who has been stalking Kirsty walks into the fire and retrieves the box before transforming into a winged skeletal creature and flying away. The box ends up with the same merchant who sold it to Frank, where he offers it to another customer.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nHaving been dismayed at prior cinematic adaptations of his work, Barker, who had experience from writing, directing and starring in plays and had made two short films, decided to attempt to direct a film himself. He asked Christopher Figg, who became his producer, how small the budget would have to be for someone being willing to hire him as a first time director. Figg said the budget had to be less than a million dollars, which could be done if the film was just about a house and some monsters, and if he used more or less unknown actors. Barker decided to adapt \"The Hellbound Heart\", as the story fit those parameters. New World Pictures agreed to fund the film for $900,000.\n\"Hellraiser\" was filmed at the end of 1986 and was set to be made in seven weeks, but was extended over a nine- to ten-week period by New World. The film was originally made under the working title of \"Sadomasochists from Beyond the Grave\". Barker also wanted to call the film \"Hellbound\" but producer Christopher Figg suggested \"Hellraiser\" instead. Barker spoke fondly in \"The Hellraiser Chronicles\" about the filming, stating that his memories of production were of \"unalloyed fondness ... The cast treated my ineptitudes kindly, and the crew were no less forgiving\". Barker admitted his own lack of knowledge on filmmaking, stating that he \"didn't know the difference between a 10-millimetre lens and a 35-millimetre lens. If you'd shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you\". After filming, New World convinced Barker to relocate the story to the United States which required overdubbing to remove some English accents.\nDuring production, Doug Bradley had trouble hitting his marks during his takes in make-up as he could not see through his black contact lenses and was afraid of tripping over Pinhead's skirts. The special effects of the unnamed creature, known as \"The Engineer\" in the novels, proved challenging as the creature was difficult to maneuver. Other issues included a rushed shoot of the Chinese restaurant scene with Kirsty and Larry, due to the lateness of the person responsible for letting the cast and crew into the establishment. Numerous props of the Lament Configuration, which were constructed from wood and cut-out brass, were produced by special effects designer and maker Simon Sayce; due to the box's delicate construction, Sayce would lie on the floor under the Cenobites during some takes in case it was dropped, to save himself the eight hours it took to create another.\nAbout seven or eight weeks after principal photography had finished, the executive producers saw the footage and liked the film enough to invest more into it. Because of this, a few scenes were redone with a higher budget, like the scene near the end where Frank's body is ripped apart. To produce Frank's resurrection, effects like reverse motion were used to give his skeleton flesh and inner organs.\nThe film had two editors: Richard Marden and an uncredited Tony Randel.\nCensorship.\nClive Barker had to make some cuts on the film after the MPAA originally gave it an X rating. Two and a half shots were excised from the first hammer murder, including a closeup of the hammer lodged in the victim's head. In the scene where Julia murders another man, the actor playing the victim felt that it made sense for him to do so naked. The nude murder scene was shot, but was ultimately replaced with a semi-clothed version. Close-ups of Kirsty sticking her hand into Frank's stomach, exposing his guts, a longer version of the scene where Frank is being torn into pieces, and the final shot where his head explodes were also cut.\nIn an interview for \"Samhain\" magazine in July 1987, Barker mentioned some problems that censors had with more erotic scenes in the film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well, we did have a slight problem with the eroticism. I shot a much hotter flashback sequence than they would allow us to cut in... Mine was more explicit and less violent. They wanted to substitute one kind of undertow for another. I had a much more explicit sexual encounter between Frank and Julia, but they said no, let's take out the sodomy and put in the flick knife.\nBarker also said that the seduction scene between Julia and Frank was initially a lot more explicit: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSoundtrack.\nBarker originally wanted the electronic music group Coil to perform the music for the film, but that notion was rejected by New World. Editor Tony Randel then suggested Christopher Young as a replacement for Coil for the film's score. Young had previously composed scores for other horror films such as the 1985 slasher \"\" and the 1986 Tobe Hooper film \"Invaders from Mars\".\nThe score for \"Hellraiser\" was released in 1987. AllMusic stated that the score proved that Christopher Young \"hadn't used up all of his ideas for the horror genre\" and that Young had matched \"Barker's stylish look with a gothic score that mixed in exciting synthesizer effects\". The music that Coil had recorded as a demo for their version of the score was later released as \"The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser\".\nRelease.\n\"Hellraiser\" had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 18 September.\n\"Hellraiser\" was initially banned in Ontario by the Ontario Film and Video Review Board. By a 3\u20132 majority vote, the film was deemed \"not approved in its entirety as it contravenes community standards\". It was banned because of its \"brutal, graphic violence with blood-letting throughout, horror, degradation and torture\". In August 1987, \"Hellraiser\" was passed by the Ontario Film Review Board, but only after several cuts were made to the film. New World Mutual Pictures of Canada cut about 40 seconds to get the film passed with an R rating. Thirty-five seconds of an extended torture scene featuring hooks pulling apart a body and face were removed, as well as a scene of squirming rats nailed to a wall.\n\"Hellraiser\" received a wide theatrical re-release in the United States on 5 and 6 February 2025, accompanied by featurette \"Under the Skin: Doug Bradley on Hellraiser\".\nHome media.\nIn North America, \"Hellraiser\" has been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment three times, all of which are the original 93-minute version of the film (this is the only version to ever be released on DVD). The original DVD release was a \"barebones\" release and is now out of print. It was reissued in 2000 with a new 5.1 mix mastered in THX. Finally, it was packaged along with \"\" in a Limited Edition tin case which included a 48-page colour booklet and a reproduction theatrical poster for both films. Anchor Bay released the film on Blu-ray in 2009. This version retains all of the special features found on the 20th anniversary special edition DVD. In 2011, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Image Entertainment under the \"Midnight Madness\" series label. This version contains no special features. However, various Blu-ray releases have since emerged with a highly variable selection of special features, although most of these are recycled from previous DVD releases.\nIn October 2015, Arrow Films released the film on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom along with \"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" and \"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth\" in a Scarlet Box edition featuring new 2K restorations and extensive list of bonus features including feature-length documentaries on the first 2 films and a bonus disc containing additional content such as two short films by Clive Barker. The Scarlet Box is now out of print in the UK and replaced by a three-film edition of the set without the bonus disc.\nA US version of the Scarlet Box (with the same material) was released by Arrow on 20 December 2016.\nIn celebration of the 30th anniversary of the film, Clive Barker has adapted his early \"Hell Priest\" concept designs for the Lead Cenobite into an officially licensed mask for Composite Effects. Only a limited quantity of thirty of these masks were made and then released to the public on 24 March 2017. As part of the Anniversary, \"Hellraiser\" was re-released via Blu-Ray in a SteelBook edition on 30 October. It additionally received a theatrical screening at the Prince Charles Cinema, where it made its world premiere in 1987. A remixed and remastered version of Christopher Young's score was also made available, debuting at the Anniversary screening.\nReception.\nBox-office.\n\"Hellraiser\" grossed $14,564,000 in the United States and Canada, \u00a3763,412 in the United Kingdom and $30 million worldwide.\nCritical response.\nFor contemporary reviews in the United Kingdom, \"Time Out London\" referred to the film as \"Barker's dazzling debut\" that \"creates such an atmosphere of dread that the astonishing set-pieces simply detonate in a chain reaction of cumulative intensity\" and concluded that the film was \"a serious, intelligent and disturbing horror film\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" stated that \"Barker has achieved a fine degree of menace\". \"Melody Maker\" described it as \"the best horror film ever to be made in Britain\". Kim Newman writing for the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" noted that the most immediately striking aspect of the movie is its seriousness of tone in an era when horror films (the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" or \"Evil Dead\" films in particular) tend to be broadly comic\". Newman stated that the film \"suffers from a few minor compromises: notably a decision made fairly late in shooting to change the specifically English setting for an ambiguous (and unbelievable) mid-Atlantic one\". Newman also noted that the Cenobites were \"well used suggestive figures\" but \"their monster companion is a more blunderingly obvious concession to the gross-out tastes of the teenage drive-in audience\". Newman concluded that the film was \"a return to the cutting edge of horror cinema\" and that in more gruesome moments the film \"is a reminder of the grand guignol intensity that has recently tended to disintegrate into lazy splatter\". \"Q\" stated that \"\"Hellraiser\" does have its share of problems: the re-dubbing of peripheral character with a mid-Atlantic twang, the relocation of the film in a geographical limbo [...] The film, however, cannot be faulted for the ambitiousness of its themes [...] Sadly the moral and emotional complexity that is the film's greatest strength is likely to be deemed its greatest weakness by an audience weaned on the misplaced jocularity of \"House\" or \"Fright Night\"\".\nIn the United States, \"The New York Times\" stated that Barker cast \"singularly uninteresting actors\" while \"the special effects aren't bad \u2013 only damp\". \"The Washington Post\" referred to the film as a \"dark, frequently disturbing and occasionally terrifying film\" but also argued that \"Barker's vision hasn't quite made the conversion from paper to celluloid [...] There are some weaknesses, particularly the framing of close-ups and the generic score, but there are some moments of genuinely inventive gore [...] the film falls apart at its climax, degenerating to a surprisingly lame ending full of special effects and triumphant good\". Roger Ebert gave the film one-half of a star out of four and deemed it \"as dreary a piece of goods as has masqueraded as horror in many a long, cold night. This is one of those movies you sit through with mounting dread, as the fear grows inside of you that it will indeed turn out to be feature length\" and that \"this is a movie without wit, style or reason, and the true horror is that actors were made to portray, and technicians to realize, its bankruptcy of imagination\". \"Variety\" stated that \"Hellraiser\" is \"well made, well acted, and the visual effects are generally handled with skill\".\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 71% of 55 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Elevated by writer-director Clive Barker's fiendishly unique vision, \"Hellraiser\" offers a disquieting \u2013 and sadistically smart \u2013 alternative to mindless gore.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nIn the early 2010s, \"Time Out London\" conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"Hellraiser\" placed at number 80 on their top 100 list.\nSequels and remake.\n\"Hellraiser\" was followed by nine sequels, the first seven of which featured Doug Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. Clive Barker has stated that he signed away the story and character rights to the production company prior to the release of the first film, not realizing the critical and financial success it would be.\nPlans for a \"Hellraiser\" remake were publicized in October 2007, when Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury were reported to be directing, with Barker producing and Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton writing the script. After Maury and Bustillo left the project, Todd Farmer and Patrick Lussier were attached, with production slated for an early 2012 release. However, following the release of \"\" (2011) to secure continuing rights, Farmer and Lussier were no longer involved. By 2018, after the critical and commercial success of \"Halloween\", Miramax Films had confirmed plans for new \"Hellraiser\" installments. The film was green-lit in early 2019, with David Bruckner directing from a script written by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski. It was released on Hulu in October 2022. A \"Hellraiser\" television series is in development at HBO.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He joined the armed forces during World War II at the age of eighteen.\nCareer.\nDuring World War II, on a trans-Atlantic crossing, Acorn suffered a wound from depth charges. The wound was severe enough for him to receive a disability pension from Veterans Affairs for most of his life. He returned to Prince Edward Island and moved to Montreal, Quebec in 1956 and was for a time a member of the Labor-Progressive Party. He spent several years living at the Hotel Waverly in Toronto, Ontario.\nIn Montreal, he published some of his early poems in the political magazine, \"New Frontiers\". In 1956 he self-published a mimeographed chapbook, \"In Love and Anger,\" his first collection of poems. In the 1950s some of his poetry was published in the magazine \"Canadian Forum\".\nHe was for a short time married to poet Gwendolyn MacEwen.\nIn the mid-1960s, he moved to Vancouver and joined the League for Socialist Action. In 1967, Acorn helped found the \"underground\" newspaper \"The Georgia Straight\" in Vancouver, BC. In 1969 he published his poetry collection \"I've Tasted My Blood\".\nAcorn was awarded the \"Canadian Poets Award\" in 1970 and the Governor General's Award in 1976 for his collection of poems, \"The Island Means Minago\". In 1977, Acorn introduced the Jackpine sonnet, a form designed to be as irregular and spikey (and Canadian) as a jack pine tree, but with internal structure and integrity. Without a fixed number of lines and with varied line lengths, the Jackpine sonnet depends on interweaving internal rhymes, assonance and occasional end-rhymes.\nIn July 1986, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital. Acorn died in his home town of Charlottetown on August 20, 1986, due to complications associated with his heart condition and diabetes. According to fellow poet and friend Jim Deahl, he had \"lost his will to live after the death of a younger sister.\"\nMilton Acorn People's Poetry Award.\nIn 1987, the Milton Acorn People's Poetry Award was established in his memory by Ted Plantos. It is presented annually to an outstanding \"people's poet.\" The award was initially $250 (since raised to $500) and a medallion, modelled after the one given to Milton Acorn.\nAcorn on film.\nIn 1971 Acorn was the subject of a documentary, \"Milton Acorn: The People\u2019s Poet\", which was aired on the CBC program \"Thirty Minutes\". The National Film Board of Canada produced two films on Acorn's life and works. The first is entitled \"In Love and Anger: Milton Acorn - Poet,\" and came out in 1984. The second is called \"A Wake for Milton\". It was produced in 1988."}
{"id": "71978", "revid": "144047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71978", "title": "Chatsworth House", "text": "Country house in Derbyshire, England\nChatsworth House is a stately home in the Derbyshire Dales, north-east of Bakewell and west of Chesterfield, England. The seat of the Duke of Devonshire, it has belonged to the Cavendish family since 1549. It stands on the east bank of the River Derwent, across from hills between the Derwent and Wye valleys, amid parkland backed by wooded hills that rise to heather moorland.\nBess of Hardwick began to build the new Chatsworth House in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. During the Stuart Restoration, William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe. William Cavendish, 4th Earl of Devonshire started rebuilding the house in 1687. Cavendish aimed initially to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments and so decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, although its layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. In the 18th century, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west. He had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house, and replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Capability Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\nThe house holds major collections of paintings, furniture, Old Master drawings, neoclassical sculptures and books. Chosen several times as Britain's favourite country house, it is a Grade I listed property from the 17th century, altered in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 2011\u20132012 it underwent a \u00a314-million restoration. The owner is the Chatsworth House Trust, an independent charitable foundation formed in 1981, on behalf of the Cavendish family.\nHistory.\n11th\u201316th centuries.\nThe name 'Chatsworth' is a corruption of \"Chetel's-worth\", meaning \"the Court of Chetel\". In the reign of Edward the Confessor, a man of Norse origin named Chetel (Danish-Norwegian: Ketil) held lands jointly with a Saxon named Leotnoth in three townships: Ednesoure to the west of the Derwent, and Langoleie and Chetesuorde to the east. Chetel was deposed after the Norman Conquest, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 the Manor of Chetesuorde is listed as the property of the Crown in the custody of William de Peverel. Chatsworth ceased to be a large estate, until the 15th century when it was acquired by the Leche family who owned property nearby. They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir William Cavendish, Treasurer of the King's Chamber and the husband of Bess of Hardwick, who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.\nBess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished needlewoman, Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the Oxburgh Hangings. Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, Henry. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, for \u00a310,000.\n17th century.\nFew changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, a staunch Royalist, was expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestered. Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until The Restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.\nThe famed political philosopher Thomas Hobbes spent the last four or five years of his life at Chatsworth Hall, then owned by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire. He had been a friend of the family for nearly 70 years, having taken a job tutoring the 2nd Earl shortly after graduating from St John's College, Cambridge in 1608. Hobbes died at another Cavendish family estate, Hardwick Hall, in December 1679. After his death, many of Hobbes' manuscripts were found at Chatsworth House.\nWilliam Cavendish, 4th Earl of Devonshire, who became the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced Whig. He was forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of King James II. This called for rebuilding the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish aimed initially to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments and so decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, although its layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large parterre gardens designed by George London and Henry Wise, who was later appointed by Queen Anne as Royal Gardener at Kensington Palace.\n18th century.\nWilliam Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire, and William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, made no changes to the house or gardens, but both contributed much to the collection found at Chatsworth at the time. Connoisseurs of the arts, they included in the collection paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by William Kent was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had Devonshire House in London rebuilt after a fire in 1733. When Devonshire House was sold and demolished in 1924, the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.\nThe 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west. He had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house, and replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Capability Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\nIn 1748, the 4th Duke married Lady Charlotte Boyle, the sole surviving heiress of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including Chiswick House. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent-designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.\nIn 1774, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, married Georgiana Spencer, famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. The film \"The Duchess\" portrayed their life together. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales; their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.\n19th century.\nThe 6th Duke (known as \"the Bachelor Duke\") was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector, who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates: Chatsworth and Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, Burlington House and Chiswick House in London, Bolton Abbey and Londesborough Hall in Yorkshire, and Lismore Castle in Ireland. These covered of land in England and Ireland.\nThe Duke was a collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, it included a purpose-built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection. He took over several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he was purchasing at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country-house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set from the period to survive with their original furnishings. There is much eastern influence in the decoration, including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics typical of Regency taste, which developed in the reign of George IV (1762\u20131830). Those who stayed at Chatsworth included Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens.\nIn October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, visited Chatsworth, where the Princess had her first formal adult dinner at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another chance to welcome Victoria in 1843, when the Queen and Prince Albert returned to enjoy an array of illumination in the gardens, in the conservatory and on the fountains, forming a scene of \"unparalleled display and grandeur\", according to one guest.\nThe Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A Latin inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates, \"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840.\" The year 1688 was that of the Glorious Revolution, supported by the Whig dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 brought the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future 7th Duke.\nIn 1844, the 6th Duke privately printed and published a book called \"Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick\", giving a history of the Cavendish family's two main estates. It was praised by Charles Dickens.\nIn 1888, the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Chatsworth, California, was named after the estate.\n20th century.\nSocial change and taxes in the early 20th century began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the 8th Duke died in 1908 over \u00a3500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared with that of 42 years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at Barrow-in-Furness, and the depression in British agriculture apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by William Caxton and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four Shakespeare folios and 39 Shakespeare quartos, to the Huntington Library in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in Somerset, Sussex and Derbyshire were also sold during or just after the First World War.\nIn December 1904, King Charles I of Portugal and Queen Maria Am\u00e9lia stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to Britain. It snowed almost constantly while they were there and the King reportedly started a snowball fight, in which the assembled ladies joined enthusiastically, when he met the Marquis of Soveral, the Portuguese Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St James's.\nIn 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a site in Piccadilly, was sold to developers and demolished. Much of its contents went to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near The Mall was acquired. The Great Conservatory in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished, as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it and all the plants had died during the war, when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To reduce running costs further, there was talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then seen as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House \u2013 the celebrated Palladian villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the 4th Duke married Lord Burlington's daughter \u2013 was sold in 1929 for \u00a380,000 to Middlesex County Council and Brentford and Chiswick Urban District Council.\nNonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a comptroller and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the countryside than the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at the time consisted of a butler, an under-butler, a groom of the chambers, a valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two still-room maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, an upholsterer, a scullery maid, two scrubbing women, a laundry porter, a steam boiler man, a coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, a night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between 80 in the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so in the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook.\nMost of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use in the Second World War. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the 10th Duke, thinking that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by Penrhos College, a girls' public school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. The contents were packed away in 11 days, and in September 1939, 300 girls and their mistresses moved in for a six-year stay. The whole house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort. During this period Deneys Reitz, on an official trip to Britain in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister of South Africa, reported being hosted by the 10th Duke in a factor's cottage on the estate because the main house was in use as a school.\nIn May 1944 Kathleen Kennedy, sister of John F. Kennedy, married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, elder son of the 10th Duke. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944 and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the 11th Duke in 1950. He was married to Deborah Mitford, one of the Mitford girls, sister to Nancy Mitford, Diana Mitford, Pamela Mitford, Unity Mitford and Jessica Mitford.\nThe modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had yet to move back after the war. Although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding death duties, the Duke died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply and tax was charged at 80 per cent on the estate. The amount due was \u00a37\u00a0million (equivalent to \u00a3 as of 2023). Some of the family's advisors considered the situation irretrievable and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a Victoria and Albert Museum of Northern England. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school.\nThe effect of the death duties was mitigated to an extent by the historically low value of art in the post-war years and the increase in land values after 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and so on the face of it the losses were much less than 80 per cent in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire were retained out of . The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. It took 17 years to complete negotiations with the Inland Revenue, interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, established in 1946.\nThe 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945, the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948\u20131949 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women, who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London, and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951 after the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947.\nIn the mid-1950s, the 11th Duke and Duchess began to think about moving in. The pre-war house had relied wholly on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.\nIn 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new Chatsworth House Trust. The aim was to preserve the house and its setting for \"the benefit of the public\". The new trust was granted a 99-year lease of the house, its main contents, its grounds, its precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of . To legalise this, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of \u00a31 a year. To facilitate the arrangement and build up a sufficient multi-million-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old masters' drawings, which had not been on regular display. The Cavendish family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but most of the directors are not family members. The Duke pays a market rent for use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is about \u00a34\u00a0million a year.\nFilm of Chatsworth in 1945 is held by the Cinema Museum in London. Ref HM0365.\n21st century.\nThe 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire. The 11th Duke's widow, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, died on 24 September 2014. Until then she was active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She made many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. As Deborah Mitford, she wrote seven books on various aspects of Chatsworth and its massive property.\nA structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation was required. A \u00a332\u00a0million programme of works was undertaken, including restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.\nAccording to the Estate website, Chatsworth remains home to the 12th Duke and Duchess. They are involved in the operation through the Charitable Trust.\nThe Devonshire Collection Archives stored at Chatsworth include 450 years of documents about the family and their two main estates. In 2019, the Duke and Duchess visited Sotheby's to view \"Treasures From Chatsworth: art and artifacts from Chatsworth House\" that would be displayed in New York.\nDuring the 2022 European heatwaves, a section of the Great Parterre that formerly occupied Chatsworth's South Lawn was revealed as the grass and soil dried out, showing the patterns of earthworks that had been used to construct it. As the lawn's grass has shorter roots, it dried out faster, creating a contrast that allows the structure to be viewed with the naked eye.\nArchitecture.\nChatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by Bess of Hardwick in a quadrangle layout, about from north to south and from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the great hall in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.\nThe south and east fronts were rebuilt to the designs of William Talman and completed by 1696 for William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of English Baroque architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir John Summerson, \"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a rustic basement. The fa\u00e7ade is dramatic and sculptural with ionic pilasters and a heavy entablature and balustrade. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in having an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.\nThe west and north fronts may have been the work of Thomas Archer, possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and pilasters to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site, this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey fa\u00e7ades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected further than the north end of the east front. The problem was overcome by building a slightly curved fa\u00e7ade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main fa\u00e7ade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century, when William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the architect Jeffry Wyatville, built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of the wing has only two storeys, as opposed to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house and around long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an Italianate style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.\nThe 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central, largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, while the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance again.\nThe fa\u00e7ades of the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor, with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque fa\u00e7ade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by Samuel Watson, a Derbyshire craftsman who did much work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.\nInteriors.\nThe 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamental layout, which in this way is unique, full of irregularities, and the interiors are decorated by a diverse centuries-old collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable as of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.\nState apartments.\nThe 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of state rooms across the south front when expecting a visit from King William III and Queen Mary II, which never occurred. The State Apartments are approached from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals of scenes from the life of Julius Caesar by Louis Laguerre, and ascend by the cantilevered Great Stairs to an enfilade of rooms that controlled how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.\nThe Great Chamber is the largest in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet, each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber has a painted ceiling of a classical scene by Antonio Verrio. The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room when the 6th Duke brought the violin door from Devonshire House in London. It has a convincing \"trompe-l'\u0153il\" of a violin and bow \"hanging\" on a silver knob, painted about 1723 by Jan van der Vaart.\nAbout the time Queen Victoria decided that Hampton Court, with state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than changing the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider, shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they had looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n18th-century alterations.\nIn the 1760s, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall, from which guests walked through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs, and into the Painted Hall. He then built a neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that was a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls moved, but there are few traces of the mid and late 18th century in the public rooms.\n19th-century alterations.\nThe 6th Duke modified much of Chatsworth to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, suiting a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors round the courtyard were enclosed and given a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and there were more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome and built at the north end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along the staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke made a library of the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room, before the 6th Duke used it for his growing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms where the Duke installed a single-pane window, which he saw as the \"greatest ornament of modern decoration\". The window in the Ante-Library is the only one preserved. Much of the scientific library of Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville-designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun, but later abandoned.\nThe entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called \"California\" and \"The Birds\". The main rooms in the new wing face east and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the belvedere itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.\nPrivate rooms.\nChatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, described the family rooms in detail in her book \"Chatsworth: The House\". She lived at Edensor until her death in 2014; the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the north-east corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.\nThe main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the south-east corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little over a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the Great Chamber, which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that to his knowledge, it had never been used.\nThe yellow drawing room is next to the dining room and directly beneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess wrote that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase. Three corridors called the Tapestry Gallery, Burlington Corridor and Book Passage are wrapped round the south, west and north passages at this level and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner \u2014 one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is why they are sometimes available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes not. This suite now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the chapel.\nThe private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right on entering is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room with walls of leather. Its great many books make it one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris\". The corner room on the ground floor is the former \"little dining room\". These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors round the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.\nThe other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front. They are reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now a pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and made out of the steward's room and linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.\nPark and landscape.\nThe garden attracts about 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of features from six different centuries, covering . It is surrounded by a wall long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the Derwent River and blends into the surrounding park, which covers . The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of some 20 full-time gardeners. Average rainfall is some a year, with an annual average of 1,160 hours of sunshine. Most of the main features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.\nElizabethan garden.\nThe house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the garden today. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of the time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that Mary, Queen of Scots was allowed to take the air there while a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date from this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.\n1st Duke's garden (1684\u20131707).\nWhile rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created Baroque gardens. It featured numerous parterres cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The main surviving features of that time are:\n4th Duke's garden (1755\u201364).\nThe 4th Duke commissioned the landscape architect, Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were turned into lawns, but as detailed above several features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species imported from Philadelphia in 1759. The main aim of the work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.\n6th Duke's garden (1826\u201358).\nIn 1826 a 23-year-old named Joseph Paxton, who had trained at Kew Gardens, was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth 15 years earlier and till then shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include:\nTwo significant features from the period have been lost:\nModern garden (1950\u2013present).\nThe 7th\u201310th Dukes made few changes to the garden, which suffered in the Second World War, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival. Gardening personality Alan Titchmarsh wrote in 2003, \"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\" Many historical features have been immaculately restored, and unusually for a modern country-house garden, many new features have been added, including:\nStables.\nThe stable block at Chatsworth is prominent on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rustic banding, a pediment with a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a cupola. This was designed by James Paine for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758\u20131767. It is about square and two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners and one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses and all necessary equine facilities including a blacksmiths shop. The first floor was taken by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess's \"Chatsworth: The House\", one room still has \"Third Postillion\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.\nThe last horses left the stables in 1939, when the building became a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was turned into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners. When the house reopened after the war, \"catering\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \"water for dogs\". In 1975 a tea bar was set up with an investment of \u00a3120. The first attempt at a caf\u00e9 opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was unsatisfactory to customers and from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B\u00e9raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge. After a failed attempt to gain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop, and three rooms for hire. The stables cater for 30,000 people a month in the visitor season.\nPark, woods and farmyard.\nChatsworth park of about is open to free of charge all year round, except for the south-east section, the Old Park, which is used for breeding by herds of red and fallow deer. The stance of the Dukes on wider access rights has changed much. On the 11th Duke's death in 2004, the Ramblers Association praised him for enlightened championing of open access and his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even under the 11th Duke, disputes arose: when the definitive rights of way were being compiled in the 1960s and 1970s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by a lake in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the High Court, making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.\nFarm stock also graze in the park, many belonging to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use it for summer grazing. Bess of Hardwick's park was wholly on the east side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large flat area is used now for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, typically held near the end of August. The bridge over the river was at the south end of the park and crossed to the old village of Edensor, which was by the river in full sight of the house.\nCapability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river and put a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms; weeds and scrub are kept under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. Meanwhile James Paine designed a new bridge to the north of the house, set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps, so that a screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to cater to a growing number of well-to-do travellers coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.\nIn 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the Duke of Rutland's land around Baslow to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for land elsewhere. He extended the park about north to its present limits. He had the remaining cottages of Edensor inside the park demolished, apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the 7th Duke had St Peter's Church, Edensor, enlarged by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park. Inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is where the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Dukes and their wives are buried, not in a vault inside the church, but in individual graves marked by simple headstones, in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.\nOn the hills of the eastern side of the park is Stand Wood. The Hunting Tower there was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top is a plateau of several square miles of lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. The area is the water source for the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.\nThe late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life. In 1973 a Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables at explaining how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983. A venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by the television gardener Alan Titchmarsh in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks, in which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.\nIn 2001, the ashes of \nAir Vice Marshal James Edgar Johnson , DL, a Second World War flying ace, were scattered on the Chatsworth estate. There is a bench dedicated to his memory at his favourite fishing spot on the estate; the inscription reads \"In Memory of a Fisherman\".\nEstate.\nChatsworth is the hub of a agricultural estate. This, together with around Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in Eastbourne and Carlisle belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's Lismore Castle estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:\nThe Chatsworth Settlement has a range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. Several properties can be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.\nThe 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for a \"theme park\" approach to modernising a country estate. They eschewed the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a large enterprise employing over a hundred. A 90-seat restaurant opened at the Farm Shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of Belgravia, but it was unsuccessful and closed down.\nThe Settlement runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel &amp; Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow, on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the Caravan Club; a paddock at the south end of the park where bucks were fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent.\nThere is a line of Chatsworth branded foods endorsed with the Dowager Duchess's signature and available by mail order. She also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.\nIn popular culture.\nChatsworth House has been referenced in literature and used as a location set for books, films, television and for music videos including: \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813); \"Maiden Voyage\" (1943); \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975); \"The Bounty\" (1984); \"Interceptor\" (1989); \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1995); \"Pride &amp; Prejudice\" (2005); \"Face to Face\"; \"The Duchess\" (2008); \"The Wolfman\" (2009); \"Rivers with Griff Rhys Jones\" (2009); \"Chatsworth\" (2012); \"Death Comes to Pemberley\" (2013); \"Austenland\" (2013); \"Secrets of The Manor House\" (2014); \"Breathless Beauty, Broken Beauty\" (2014); \"The Crown\" (2016) and \"Peaky Blinders\".\nSee also.\nOther properties owned by the Dukes of Devonshire, currently or in the past, include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

V\u00e1zquez de Coronado had hoped to reach the Cities of C\u00edbola, often referred to now as the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. His expedition marked the first European sightings of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, among other landmarks. His name is often Anglicized as Vasquez de Coronado or just Coronado. \nEarly life.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado was born into a noble family in Salamanca, Spain, in 1510 as the second son of Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and Isabel de Luj\u00e1n. Juan V\u00e1zquez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured Emirate of Granada under \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, its first Christian governor.\nFrancisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado went to New Spain (present-day Mexico) in 1535 at about age 25, in the entourage of its first Viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the son of his father's patron and V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's personal friend. In New Spain, he married twelve-year-old Beatriz de Estrada, called \"the Saint\" (\"la Santa\"), sister of Leonor de Estrada, ancestor of the de Alvarado family and daughter of Treasurer and Governor Alonso de Estrada y Hidalgo, Lord of Pic\u00f3n, and his wife Marina Flores Guti\u00e9rrez de la Caballer\u00eda, from a converso Jewish family. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado inherited a large portion of a Mexican \"encomendero\" estate through Beatriz and had eight children with her. \nExpedition.\nPreparation.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado was the Governor of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia), a province of New Spain located northwest of Mexico and comprising the contemporary Mexican states of Jalisco, Sinaloa and Nayarit. In 1539, he dispatched Friar Marcos de Niza and Estevanico (more properly known as Estevan), one of only four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, on an expedition north from Compostela toward present-day New Mexico. When de Niza returned, he told of a city of vast wealth, a golden city called C\u00edbola, whose Zuni residents were assumed to have murdered Estevan. Though he did not claim to have entered the city of C\u00edbola, he mentioned that it stood on a high hill and that it appeared wealthy and as large as Mexico City.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado assembled an expedition with two components. One component carried the bulk of the expedition's supplies, traveling via the Guadalupe River and Gulf of California under the leadership of Hernando de Alarc\u00f3n. The other component traveled by land, along the trail on which Friar Marcos de Niza had followed Esteban. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza invested large sums of their own money in the venture. Mendoza appointed V\u00e1zquez de Coronado the commander of the expedition, with the mission to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. This is the reason he pawned his wife's estates and was lent 70,000 pesos.\nIn the autumn of 1539, Mendoza ordered Melchior D\u00edaz, commander of the Spanish outpost at San Miguel de Culiac\u00e1n, to investigate Friar de Niza's findings, and on November 17, 1539, D\u00edaz departed for C\u00edbola with fifteen horsemen. At the ruins of Chichilticalli, he turned around because of \"snows and fierce winds from across the wilderness\". D\u00edaz had encountered V\u00e1zquez de Coronado before he had departed San Miguel de Culiac\u00e1n, and reported that initial investigations into Friar de Niza's report disproved the existence of the bountiful land he had described. D\u00edaz's report was delivered to Viceroy Mendoza on March 20, 1540.\nExpedition.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado set out from Compostela on February 23, 1540, at the head of a much larger expedition composed of about 400 European men-at-arms (mostly Spaniards), 1,300 to 2,000 Mexican Indian allies, four Franciscan friars (the most notable of whom were Juan de Padilla and the newly appointed provincial superior of the Franciscan order in the New World, Marcos de Niza), and several slaves, both natives and Africans. Many other family members and servants also joined the party.\nHe followed the Sinaloan coast northward, keeping the Gulf of California on his left to the west until he reached the northernmost Spanish settlement in Mexico, San Miguel de Culiac\u00e1n, about March 28, 1540, whereupon he rested his expedition before they began trekking the inland trail. Aside from his mission to verify Friar de Niza's report, Melchior D\u00edaz had also taken notice of the forage and food situation along the trail, and reported that the land along the route would not be able to support a large concentrated body of soldiers and animals. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, therefore, decided to divide his expedition into small groups and time their departures so that grazing lands and water holes along the trail could recover. At intervals along the trail, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado established camps and stationed garrisons of soldiers to keep the supply route open. For example, in September 1540, Melchior D\u00edaz, along with \"seventy or eighty of the weakest and least reliable men\" in V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's army, remained at the town of San Jer\u00f3nimo, in the valley of Corazones, or \"Hearts\". Once the scouting and planning was done, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado led the first group of soldiers up the trail. They were horsemen and foot soldiers who were able to travel quickly, while the main bulk of the expedition would set out later.\nAfter leaving Culiac\u00e1n on April 22, 1540, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado followed the coast, \"bearing off to the left\", as Mota Padilla says, by an extremely rough way, to the Sinaloa River. The configuration of the country made it necessary to follow the river valley until he could find a passage across the mountains to the course of the Yaqui River. He traveled alongside this stream for some distance, then crossed to the Rio Sonora, which he followed nearly to its source before a pass (now known as Montezuma Pass) was discovered. On the southern side of the Huachuca Mountains he found a stream he called the \"Nexpa\", which may have been either the Santa Cruz or the San Pedro in modern Arizona of modern maps, most likely the northward-flowing San Pedro River. The party followed this river valley until they reached the edge of the wilderness, where, as Friar Marcos had described it to them, they found Chichilticalli. Chichilticalli is in southern Arizona in the Sulphur Springs Valley, within the bend of the Dos Cabezas and Chiricahua Mountains. This fits the chronicle of Laus Deo description, which reports that \"at Chichilticalli the country changes its character again and the spiky vegetation ceases. The reason is that ... the mountain chain changes its direction at the same time that the coast does. Here they had to cross and pass the mountains in order to get into the level country.\" There V\u00e1zquez de Coronado met a crushing disappointment: C\u00edbola was nothing like the great golden city that de Niza had described. Instead, it was just a village of nondescript pueblos constructed by the Zuni. The soldiers were upset with de Niza for his mendacious imagination, so V\u00e1zquez de Coronado sent him back south to New Spain in disgrace.\nDespite what is shown in the accompanying map, on-the-ground research by Nugent Brasher beginning in 2005 revealed evidence that V\u00e1zquez de Coronado traveled north between Chichilticalli and Zuni primarily on the future New Mexico side of the state line, not the Arizona side as has been thought by historians since the 1940s. Also, most scholars believe Quivira was about thirty miles east of the great bend of the Arkansas River, ending about twenty miles west-southwest of the location depicted on the map, with Quivira being mostly on tributaries of the Arkansas River instead of directly on the Kansas River. For details, see the heading below, \"Location of Quivira...\"\nConquest of C\u00edbola.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado traveled north on one side or the other of today's Arizona\u2013New Mexico state line, and from the headwaters of the Little Colorado River, he continued on until he came to the Zuni River. He followed the river until he entered the territory controlled by the Zuni. The members of the expedition were almost starving and demanded entrance into the community of Hawikuh (of which the preferred Zuni word is Hawikku). The residents refused, denying the expedition entrance to the community. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and his expeditionaries attacked the Zunis. The ensuing skirmish constituted the extent of what can be called the Spanish Conquest of C\u00edbola. He never personally led his men-at-arms in any subsequent battles. During the battle, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado was injured. During the weeks that the expedition stayed at Zuni, he sent out several scouting expeditions.\nThe first scouting expedition was led by Pedro de Tovar. This expedition headed northwest to the Hopi communities they recorded as Tusayan. Upon arrival, the Spanish were also denied entrance to the village that they came across and, once again, resorted to using force to enter. Materially, Hopi territory was just as poor as that of the Zuni in precious metals, but the Spaniards did learn that a large river (the Colorado) lay to the west.\nExploration of the Colorado River.\nThree leaders affiliated with the V\u00e1zquez de Coronado expedition were able to reach the Colorado River. The first was Hernando de Alarc\u00f3n, then Melchior D\u00edaz and lastly Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas. Alarc\u00f3n's fleet was tasked to carry supplies and to establish contact with the main body of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's expedition but was unable to do so because of the extreme distance to Cibola. He traveled up the Sea of Cort\u00e9s and then the Colorado River. In this exploration, he hauled some supplies for V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, but eventually, he buried them with a note in a bottle. Melchior D\u00edaz was sent down from C\u00edbola by V\u00e1zquez de Coronado to take charge of the camp of Corazones and to establish contact with the fleet. Soon after arriving at the camp he set out from the valley of Corazones in Sonora and traveled overland in a north/northwesterly direction until he arrived at the junction of the Colorado River and Gila River. There, indigenous informants, probably the Cocomaricopa (see Seymour 2007b), told him that Alarc\u00f3n's sailors had buried supplies and left a note in a bottle. The supplies were retrieved, and the note stated that Alarc\u00f3n's men had rowed up the river as far as they could, searching in vain for the V\u00e1zquez de Coronado expedition. They had given up and decided to return to their departure point because worms were eating holes in their boats. D\u00edaz named the river the \"Firebrand (Tiz\u00f3n) River\" because the indigenous people of the area used firebrands to keep their bodies warm in the winter. D\u00edaz died on the trip back to the camp in the valley of the Corazones.\nWhile at Hawikuh, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado sent another scouting expedition overland to find the Colorado River, led by Don Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas. The expedition returned to Hopi territory to acquire scouts and supplies. Members of C\u00e1rdenas's party eventually reached the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, where they could see the Colorado River thousands of feet below, becoming the first non-Native Americans to do so. After trying and failing to climb down into the canyon to reach the river, the expedition reported that they would not be able to use the Colorado River to link up with Hernando de Alarc\u00f3n's fleet. After this, the main body of the expedition began its journey to the next populated center of pueblos, along another large river to the east, the Rio Grande in New Mexico.\nTiguex War.\nHernando de Alvarado was sent to the east, and found several villages around the Rio Grande. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado had one commandeered for his winter quarters, Coofor, which is across the river from present-day Bernalillo near Albuquerque, New Mexico. During the winter of 1540\u201341, his army found themselves in conflict with the Rio Grande natives, which led to the brutal Tiguex War. This war resulted in the destruction of the Tiguex pueblos and the deaths of hundreds of Native Americans. The Spaniards also captured a Wichita woman, Big Eyes, who had been enslaved by the Tiguex, and who would become a guide for the expedition.\nSearch for Quivira.\nFrom an indigenous informant the Spanish called \"The Turk\" (\"el turco\"), V\u00e1zquez de Coronado heard of a wealthy nation called Quivira far to the east. In spring 1541, he led his army and priests and indigenous allies onto the Great Plains to search for Quivira. The Turk was probably either Wichita or Pawnee and his intention seems to have been to lead V\u00e1zquez de Coronado astray and hope that he got lost in the Great Plains. Alternately, it is possible that the Turk was leading Coronado to the large mound-building kingdoms of the southeast.\nWith the Turk guiding him, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and his army might have crossed the flat and featureless steppe called the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle and Eastern New Mexico, passing through the present-day communities of Hereford and Canadian. The Spanish were awed by the Llano. \"The country they [the buffalo] traveled over was so smooth that if one looked at them the sky could be seen between their legs.\" Men and horses became lost in the featureless plain and V\u00e1zquez de Coronado felt like he had been swallowed up by the sea.\nOn the Llano, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado encountered vast herds of bison\u2014the American buffalo. \"I found such a quantity of cows ... that it is impossible to number them, for while I was journeying through these plains ... there was not a day that I lost sight of them.\"\nQuerechos and Teyas.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado found a community of people he called Querechos. The Querechos were not awed or impressed by the Spanish, their weapons, and their \"big dogs\" (horses). \"They did nothing unusual when they saw our army, except to come out of their tents to look at us, after which they came to talk to the advance guard, and asked who we were.\" As V\u00e1zquez de Coronado described them, the Querechos were nomads, following the buffalo herds on the plains. The Querechos were numerous. Chroniclers mentioned one settlement of two hundred tipis\u2014which implies a population of more than one thousand people living together for at least part of the year. Authorities agree that the Querechos (Becquerel's) were Apache Indians.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado left the Querechos behind and continued southeast in the direction in which the Turk told him that Quivira was located. He and his army descended off the tabletop of the Llano Estacado into the caprock canyon country. He soon met with another group of Indians, the Teyas, enemies of the Querechos.\nThe Teyas, like the Querechos, were numerous and buffalo hunters, although they had additional resources. The canyons they inhabited had trees and flowing streams and they grew or foraged for beans, but not corn. The Spanish, however, did note the presence of mulberries, roses, grapes, walnuts, and plums.\nAn intriguing event was V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's meeting among the Teyas an old blind bearded man who said that he had met many days before \"four others like us\". He was probably talking about Cabeza de Vaca, who with Esteban and two other Spanish survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition to Florida made his way across southern Texas six years before V\u00e1zquez de Coronado.\nScholars differ in their opinions as to which historical Indian group were the Teyas. A plurality believe they were Caddoan speakers and related to the Wichita. The place where V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the Teyas has also been debated. The mystery may have been cleared up\u2014to the satisfaction of some\u2014by the discovery of a likely V\u00e1zquez de Coronado campsite. While V\u00e1zquez de Coronado was in the canyon country, his army suffered one of the violent climatic events so common on the plains. \"A tempest came up one afternoon with a very high wind and hail ... The hail broke many tents and tattered many helmets, and wounded many of the horses, and broke all the crockery of the army, and the gourds which was no small loss.\"\nIn 1993, Jimmy Owens found crossbow points in Blanco Canyon in Crosby County, Texas, near the town of Floydada in Floyd County. Archaeologists subsequently searched the site and found pottery sherds, more than forty crossbow points, and dozens of horseshoe nails of Spanish manufacture, plus a Mexican-style stone blade. This find strengthens the evidence that V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the Teyas in Blanco Canyon.\nQuivira.\nAnother guide, probably Pawnee and named Ysopete, and probably Teyas as well told V\u00e1zquez de Coronado that he was going in the wrong direction, saying Quivira lay to the north. By this time, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado seems to have lost his confidence that fortune awaited him. He sent most of his expedition back to New Mexico and continued with only forty Spanish soldiers and priests and an unknown number of Indian soldiers, servants, and guides. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, thus, dedicated himself to a reconnaissance rather than a mission of conquest.\nAfter more than thirty days journey, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the Arkansas, probably a few miles east of present-day Dodge City, Kansas. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear but calmed down when one of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling, on July 29, 1541. He found Quivira \"well settled ... along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another\". V\u00e1zquez de Coronado believed that there were twenty-five settlements in Quivira. Both men and women Quivirans were nearly naked. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado was impressed with the size of the Quivirans and all the other Indians he met. They were \"large people of very good build\". V\u00e1zquez de Coronado spent twenty-five days among the Quivirans trying to learn of richer kingdoms just over the horizon. He found nothing but straw-thatched villages of up to two hundred houses and fields containing corn, beans, and squash. A copper pendant was the only evidence of wealth he discovered. The Quivirans were almost certainly the ancestors of the Wichita people.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado was escorted to the further edge of Quivira, called Tabas, where the neighboring land of Harahey began. He summoned the \"Lord of Harahey\" who, with two hundred followers, came to meet with the Spanish. He was disappointed. The Harahey Indians were \"all naked \u2013 with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered\". They were not the wealthy people V\u00e1zquez de Coronado sought. Disappointed, he returned to New Mexico. Before leaving Quivira, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado ordered the Turk garroted (executed). The Turk is regarded as an Indian hero in a display at Albuquerque's Indian Pueblo Cultural Center because his disinformation led V\u00e1zquez de Coronado onto the Great Plains and thus relieved the beleaguered pueblos of Spanish depredations for at least a few months.\nLocation of Quivira, Tabas, and Harahey.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Quivira was in central Kansas with the westernmost village near the small town of Lyons on Cow Creek, extending twenty miles east to the Little Arkansas River, and north another twenty miles to the town of Lindsborg on a tributary of the Smoky Hill River. Tabas was likely on the Smoky Hill River. Archaeologists have found numerous 16th-century sites in these areas that probably include some of the settlements visited by V\u00e1zquez de Coronado.\nAt Harahey \"was a river, with more water and more inhabitants than the other\". This sounds as if V\u00e1zquez de Coronado may have reached the Smoky Hill River near Salina or Abilene. It is a larger river than either Cow Creek or the Little Arkansas and is located at roughly the 25 league distance from Lyons that V\u00e1zquez de Coronado said he traveled in Quivira. The people of Harahey seem Caddoan, because \"it was the same sort of a place, with settlements like these, and of about the same size\" as Quivira. They were probably the ancestors of the Pawnee.\nExpedition end.\nV\u00e1zquez de Coronado returned to the Tiguex Province in New Mexico from Quivira and was badly injured in a fall from his horse \"after the winter was over\", according to the chronicler Casta\u00f1eda\u2014probably in March 1542. During a long convalescence, he and his expeditionaries decided to return to New Spain (Mexico). V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and his expedition departed New Mexico in early April 1542, leaving behind two friars. His expedition had been a failure. Although he remained governor of Nueva Galicia until 1544, the expedition forced him into bankruptcy and resulted in charges of war crimes being brought against him and his field master, C\u00e1rdenas. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado was cleared by his friends on the Audiencia, but C\u00e1rdenas was convicted in Spain of basically the same charges by the Council of the Indies. V\u00e1zquez de Coronado remained in Mexico City, where he died of an infectious disease on September 22, 1554. He was buried under the altar of the Church of Santo Domingo in Mexico City.\nFamily.\nWithin a year of arriving in New Spain, he married Beatriz de Estrada, called \"the saint\".\nBeatriz was the second daughter of Alonso de Estrada and Marina de la Caballer\u00eda; niece of Diego de Caballeria. The Estrada-Coronado union was a carefully calculated political union that Francisco and Marina orchestrated. Through this marriage, Francisco became a wealthy man. Beatriz brought to the marriage the encomienda of Tlapa, the third largest encomienda in New Spain. This marriage was an important source of funding for Francisco's expedition.\nBeatriz and Francisco have been reported, through different sources, to have had at least four sons (Ger\u00f3nimo, Salvador, Juan, and Alonso) and five daughters (Isabel, Mar\u00eda, Luisa, Mariana, and Mayor).\nAfter Alonso's death, Beatriz ensured that three of their daughters were married into prominent families of New Spain. She never remarried.\nBeatriz reported that her husband had died in great poverty, since their encomiendas had been taken away from them due to the New Laws, and that she and her daughters lived in misery too, a shame for the widow of a conqueror that had provided such valuable service to his majesty. This, as most reports from the early days of New Spain, both positive and negative and regarding all things, have been proven to be false, part of the power struggles among settlers and attempts to exploit the budding new system that tried to find a way to administer justice in land the king could not see nor the army reach. Francisco, Beatriz and their children actually ended their days comfortably.\nCommemoration.\nIn 1939, United States 76th Congress passes the Coronado Exposition Commission Act of 1939 authorizing the erection of a monument at the nearest point of the international boundary between the United States and Mexico where the Coronado expedition first crossed into North America.\nIn 1952, the United States established Coronado National Memorial near Sierra Vista, Arizona to commemorate his expedition. The nearby Coronado National Forest is also named in his honor.\nIn 1908, Coronado Butte, a summit in the Grand Canyon, was officially named to commemorate him.\nA large hill northwest of Lindsborg, Kansas, is called Coronado Heights.\nCoronado High Schools in Lubbock, Texas; El Paso, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Scottsdale, Arizona were named for V\u00e1zquez de Coronado.\nCoronado Road in Phoenix, Arizona, was named after V\u00e1zquez de Coronado. Similarly, Interstate 40 through Albuquerque has been named the Coronado Freeway.\nCoronado, California is not named after Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, but is named after Coronado Islands, which were named in 1602 by Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno who called them \"Los Cuatro Coronados\" (the four crowned ones) to honor four martyrs.\nThe mineral Coronadite is named after him.\nPopular culture.\n\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" references the \"Cross of Coronado\". According to the film, this gold cross, discovered in a Utah cave system, was given to V\u00e1zquez de Coronado by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in 1521. Such an event never happened because V\u00e1zquez de Coronado would have been 11 or 12 years old in 1521 and still living in Spain. In addition, when Indy captures the cross from robbers aboard a ship off the coast of Portugal, the ship can be seen to be named \"The Coronado\".\nIn the classic young adult novel, \"The King's Fifth\" by Scott O'Dell, the main characters, Est\u00e9ban de Sandoval and Blas de Mendoza, seek Coronado's expedition and temporarily join it. It is there that they meet the third main character, Zia Troyano, a teenage Zuni Native American. Sandoval and Mendoza participate in the battle of Hawikuh (during which Sandoval is wounded) and describe the injury sustained by Coronado during that battle. \nThe song \"Hitchin' to Quivira\" from independent singer-songwriter Tyler Jakes's 2016 album \"Mojo Suicide\" is based on the story of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's expedition.\nThe song \"Coronado And The Turk\" from singer-songwriter Steve Tilston's 1992 album \"Of Moor And Mesa\" is based on the story of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's expedition.\nThe 1995 film, \"Charlie's Ghost: The Secret of Coronado\" also known as \"Charlie's Ghost Story\" starring Cheech Marin, follows the story of a young boy who meets the ghost of Coronado and tries to help him by giving his remains a proper burial.\nIn 1992, underground found-footage filmmaker Craig Baldwin made the film \"O No Coronado!\" detailing the expedition of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado through the use of recycled images from Westerns, conquest films, and \"The Lone Ranger\" television series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71984", "revid": "1311724134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71984", "title": "Up Pompeii!", "text": "British TV sitcom (1969\u20131991)\nUp Pompeii! is a British television comedy series set in ancient Pompeii and broadcast between 1969 and 1970, starring Frankie Howerd. The first series was written by Talbot Rothwell, a scriptwriter for the \"Carry On\" films, and the second series by Rothwell and Sid Colin. Two later specials were transmitted in 1975 and 1991 and a film adaptation was released in 1971.\nBackground.\n\"Up Pompeii!\" first appeared in the \"Comedy Playhouse\" series, after Michael Mills and Tom Sloan from BBC Comedy and Light Entertainment visited the ruins of Pompeii. Since Mills had recently seen Frankie Howerd in the stage musical \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" he casually remarked to Sloan that he half expected Howerd to suddenly appear round the corner. Sloan had replied 'Why not?', and the idea took root. Talbot Rothwell was invited to write a script and the designer Sally Hulke visited Pompeii with a sketch book and camera to ensure realism and authenticity.\nA slight variation of this is related by Bill Cotton who, in a June 2000 interview with author Graham McCann, said the idea originated with Mills, then the BBC's Head of Comedy, after seeing Frankie Howerd in that same play.\nThere were concerns in the Corporation's copyright department that the parallels between the musical and the comedy series might lead to litigation over possible plagiarism, but Rothwell told the BBC that he had seen neither the stage musical nor its film adaptation.\nPlot.\nThe series is set in ancient, pre-eruption Pompeii, with the players bearing Latinised names suggestive of their character. Howerd is the slave Lurcio (pronounced \"Lurk-io\"); his bumbling old master Ludicrus Sextus (Max Adrian, then Wallas Eaton), the promiscuous wife is Ammonia (Elizabeth Larner), their daughter Erotica (Georgina Moon) and their virginal son Nausius (Kerry Gardner). Other regulars are Senna the Soothsayer (Jeanne Mockford) who constantly warns of impending death and destruction and, in series one, Plautus (Willie Rushton) a semi-godlike figure, making pithy comments from a location somewhere between the clouds and Mount Olympus. Guest stars included several actresses from the \"Carry On\" film series, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Valerie Leon.\nThe format was an exotic backdrop for an endless series of double entendres and risqu\u00e9 gags from Howerd, constantly breaking the fourth wall with asides to the live studio audience which go unheard by the other characters (a device harking back to classical theatre). He also bemoans the quality of his script, complaining the other players have the best lines. Each episode starts with a prologue from Howerd \u2013 which is invariably interrupted by the doom-laden warnings of Senna, or the demands of his master or mistress.\nThirteen 30-minute episodes were made, in two series (March \u2013 May and September \u2013 October 1970). In between there was also a 13 minute \"Up Pompeii\" segment in the 1970 \"Royal Television Gala Performance\".\nIn addition, it had been preceded by a pilot episode (1969) as part of Comedy Playhouse, and it was followed up with two later special episodes both called \"Further Up Pompeii\", one in 1975 and the other, written by Brian Leveson and Paul Minett, in 1991 (the former with, and the latter without exclamation mark). The latter sparked speculation that there could be a new series, but Howerd's death in 1992 put an end to any such prospect.\nApart from the change to the actor playing Ludicrus Sextus, there are some differences between the two series of \"Up Pompeii\", the second series using noticeably fewer sets than the previous. This may have been due to the second series being commissioned, filmed and broadcast within four months from the end of the first.\nFilms and sequels.\nThe show inspired three films. The first was also called \"Up Pompeii\" (1971) and added such characters as Bilius, Voluptua, Scrubba and Villanus. It ended with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which anachronistically (for AD79) included Nero (who added, \"Wait till you see what I've up for Rome!\"), and had a brief epilogue in which Howerd played a modern-day museum guide showing the petrified remains of the Pompeiian characters. It was produced by Ned Sherrin and retained only Frankie Howerd from the cast of the original series (Ludicrus, for example, was played by Michael Hordern in the film adaptation, Erotica by Madeline Smith and Nausius by Royce Mills). However, Aubrey Woods appeared in the TV series and the film, playing different roles.\nThe two sequels were \"Up the Chastity Belt\" (1971) and \"Up the Front\" (1972) which transported Howerd's servile, cowardly character to Medieval times (as Lurkalot) and World War I (as Private Lurk). A few years later, the BBC made one final special called \"Further up Pompeii!\" (with exclamation mark) in 1975.\nThe format of \"Up Pompeii\" inspired two later TV series, \"Whoops Baghdad\" (1973) and \"Then Churchill Said to Me\" (1982), both starring Howerd. The later series was shelved due to the outbreak of the Falklands War and \u2013 thought politically insensitive \u2013 the series was aired in 1993, a year after Howerd's death. \nA pilot episode for a US version of \"Up Pompeii\" for ABC, initially called \"The Pompeii Way\" but later renamed \"Up the toga\", still starring Frankie Howerd and co-starring Foster Brooks, was recorded in 1971, but it did not proceed to a full series and was never shown. Publicity shots on Getty Images show that it involved the \"Olympia Theatre Company\", suggesting it may have been based on episode 5 of series 1 (\"The actors\"). The existence of this pilot was undocumented for a long time, until the publicity photographs were noticed online. For a long time, it was unclear if the program still existed, until a 16mm film copy was sold on eBay in late 2022.\nThe 1991 special \"Further up Pompeii\" (without exclamation mark) was made (by ITV/LWT) twenty years after the series had ended and by different writers. Lurcio is now a freedman with slaves of his own, but still has more than enough problems in his life. It could have served as a pilot episode for a revival of the series, but Howerd's death prevented that.\nStage play.\nIn 1988, Howerd asked one of his writers, Miles Tredinnick, to work on an updated stage version of \"Up Pompeii!\" for a proposed national UK tour, but the play was shelved when Howerd was offered a chance by Larry Gelbart to reprise his role as Pseudolus in \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" at the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End. The play was eventually revised and updated and had its premiere in Chesterfield in January 2011 and then embarked on a UK tour. Produced and directed by Bruce James, it starred Damian Williams, host of Sky One's \"Are You Smarter than a 10 Year Old?\", as Lurcio the slave. An acting edition of the play was published by Josef Weinberger Ltd in 2012.\nAudio revival.\nIn 2019, British production company Spiteful Puppet celebrated the 50th anniversary of the broadcast of the \"Comedy Playhouse\" pilot by releasing an audio adaptation based on the stage play by Miles Tredinnick. The script was adapted by Barnaby Eaton-Jones, Daniel McGachey and Iain McLaughlin, with Eaton-Jones serving as producer and director of the live recording sessions at London's Shaw Theatre on 12 October. The two staged performances starred Madeline Smith as Ammonia, Frazer Hines as Ludicrus, Rosa Coduri as Erotica, Jack Lane as Nausius, Jilly Breeze as Senna, Ben Perkins as Corneus and Barnaby Eaton-Jones as Kretinus, with guest stars Cleo Rocos as Suspenda, Camille Coduri as Voluptua, and Tim Brooke-Taylor as Trecherus. The lead role of Lurcio was played in the manner of Frankie Howerd by David Benson, who had previously played Howerd on stage and radio. A double CD was released on 29 November.\nDVD release.\nFor many years, no complete home video release had been undertaken due to the nature of the videotape master materials. Like many television series of this era, most of the original videotapes were wiped.\nIn the late 1970s, missing episodes of \"Up Pompeii!\" were found in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) archive. Because of the differences in international broadcasting, these copies had been converted to the North American NTSC television standard, and so one chunk of the series remained in its native PAL format, but the majority were found in a poorly-converted (dating long before digital conversion methods) NTSC state. The picture quality of some of the Canadian finds was not high, and so their marketability was severely limited. However, six episodes were released on VHS in 1991 by BBC Video. These tapes were re-released by Second Sight in 1999, with a small music edit made to the episode featuring Jamus Bondus.\nIn 2004\u201305, through the success of a group of BBC employees' restoration work on similar NTSC-only episodes of \"Doctor Who\", the BBC decided to convert all their NTSC-only productions (as reclaimed from various international stations) back to their original PAL format using a new computer-controlled process, Reverse Standards Conversion. A PAL-like, higher-quality image resulted in a more stable picture. The newly-restored masters made their debut on BBC FOUR in August 2006, and the BBC's DVD distribution arm 2entertain released a box-set of Series 1 and 2 - including the pilot episode - and the 1975 special as well as a brand new \"Frankie Howerd Collection\" set in mid-September.\n\u201cThe Frankie Howerd Collection\u201d set includes not only both original series of \"Up Pompeii!\", but also the 1975 BBC special \"Further Up Pompeii!\" (not to be confused with the 1991 ITV special \"Further Up Pompeii\"), \u201cThe Best of Frankie Howerd\u201d DVD, and another Howerd series along a similar vein, \"Then Churchill Said to Me\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In brief, this technique makes use of the Stark effect (or electrochromism) either to reveal information about the physiochemical or physical properties of a sample using a well-characterized electric field or to reveal information about an electric field using a reference sample with a well-characterized Stark effect.\nThe use of the term \"Stark effect\" differs between the disciplines of chemistry and physics. Physicists tend to use the more classical definition of the term (see Stark effect), while chemists usually use the term to refer to what is technically electrochromism. In the former case, the applied electric field splits the atomic energy levels and is the electric field analog of the Zeeman effect. However, in the latter case, the applied electric field changes the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, which can be measured using traditional absorption or emission spectroscopic methods. This effect is known as electrochromism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71989", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71989", "title": "Uncle Tom's Cabin", "text": "1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe\nUncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in two volumes in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward African Americans and slavery in the U.S., and is said to have \"helped lay the groundwork for the American Civil War\".\nStowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary, was part of the religious Beecher family and an active abolitionist. She wrote the sentimental novel to depict the horrors of slavery while also asserting that Christian love could overcome slavery. The novel focuses on the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of the other characters revolve.\nIn the United States, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel and the second best-selling book of the 19th century, following the Bible. It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. The influence attributed to the book was so great that a likely apocryphal story arose of Abraham Lincoln meeting Stowe at the start of the Civil War and declaring, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"\nThe book and the plays it inspired helped popularize a number of negative stereotypes about black people, including that of the namesake character \"Uncle Tom\". The term came to be associated with an excessively subservient person. These later associations with \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical effects of the book as a \"vital antislavery tool\". Nonetheless, the novel remains a \"landmark\" in protest literature, with later books such as \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair and \"Silent Spring\" by Rachel Carson owing a large debt to it.\nSources.\nStowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, wrote the novel as a response to the passage, in 1850, of the second Fugitive Slave Act. Much of the book was composed at her house in Brunswick, Maine, where her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, taught at his \"alma mater\", Bowdoin College.\nStowe was partly inspired to create \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by the slave narrative \"The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself\" (1849). Henson, a formerly enslaved black man, had lived and worked on a plantation in North Bethesda, Maryland, owned by Isaac Riley. Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the Province of Upper Canada (now Ontario), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient.\nStowe was also inspired by the posthumous biography of Phebe Ann Jacobs, a devout Congregationalist of Brunswick, Maine. Born on a slave plantation in Lake Hiawatha, New Jersey, Jacobs was enslaved for most of her life, including by the president of Bowdoin College. In her final years, Jacobs lived as a free woman, laundering clothes for Bowdoin students. She achieved respect from her community due to her devout religious beliefs, and her funeral was widely attended.\nAnother source Stowe used as research for \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was \"\", a volume co-authored by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimk\u00e9 sisters. Stowe also conducted interviews with people who escaped slavery. Stowe mentioned a number of these inspirations and sources in \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to not only verify Stowe's claims about slavery but also point readers to the many \"publicly available documents\" detailing the horrors of slavery.\nPublication.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" first appeared as a 40-week serial in \"The National Era\", an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run for only a few weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that protests were sent to the \"Era\" office when she missed an issue. The final installment was released in the April 1, 1852, issue of \"Era\". Stowe arranged for the story's copyright to be registered with the United States District Court for the District of Maine. She renewed her copyright in 1879 and the work entered the public domain on May 12, 1893.\nWhile the story was still being serialized, the publisher John P. Jewett contracted with Stowe to turn \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" into a book. Convinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved for the first printing. Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000\u00a0copies on that day alone, and soon sold out its complete print run. In the first year after it was published, 300,000\u00a0copies of the book were sold in the United States. Eight printing presses, running incessantly, could barely keep up with the demand.\nBy mid-1853, sales of the book dramatically decreased and Jewett went out of business during the Panic of 1857. In June 1860, the right to publish \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" passed to the Boston firm Ticknor and Fields, which put the book back in print in November 1862. After that demand began to yet again increase. Houghton Mifflin Company acquired the rights from Ticknor in 1878. In 1879, a new edition of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was released, repackaging the novel as an \"American classic\". Through the 1880s until its copyright expired, the book served as a mainstay and reliable source of income for Houghton Mifflin. By the end of the nineteenth century, the novel was widely available in a large number of editions and in the United States it became the second best-selling book of that century after the Bible.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" sold equally well in Britain; the first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000\u00a0copies. In a few years, over 1.5\u00a0million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were infringing copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States). By 1857, the novel had been translated into 20 languages. Translator Lin Shu published the first Chinese translation in 1901, making it the first American novel translated into that language.\nPlot.\nEliza escapes with her son; Tom sold \"down the river\".\nThe book opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them\u2014Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza\u2014to Mr. Haley, a coarse slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.\nWhen Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already miscarried two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress. She later makes a dangerous crossing over the ice of the Ohio River to escape her pursuers.\nAs Tom is sold, Mr. Haley takes him to a riverboat on the Mississippi River and from there Tom is to be transported to a slave market. While on board, Tom meets Eva, an angelic little white girl. They quickly become friends. Eva falls into the river and Tom dives into the river to save her life. Being grateful to Tom, Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys him from Haley and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.\nEliza's family hunted; Tom's life with St. Clare.\nDuring Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada but are tracked by Tom Loker, a slave hunter hired by Mr. Haley. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment.\nBack in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her prejudiced views against black people are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.\nAfter Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.\nTom sold to Simon Legree.\nBefore St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, he dies after being stabbed outside a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Tom is taken to rural Louisiana with other new slaves including Emmeline, whom Legree has purchased to use as a sex slave.\nLegree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another slave whom Legree used as a sex slave. Cassy tells her story to Tom. She was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold. She became pregnant again but killed the child because she could not tolerate having another child separated from her.\nTom Loker, changed after being healed by the Quakers, returns to the story. He has helped George, Eliza, and Harry enter Canada from Lake Erie and become free. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. He has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death.\nHe encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. George Shelby, Arthur Shelby's son, arrives to buy Tom's freedom, but Tom dies shortly after they meet.\nFinal section.\nOn their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister Madame de Thoux and accompany her to Canada. Madame de Thoux and George Harris were separated in their childhood. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually Liberia, the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm, where after his father's death, he frees all his slaves. George Shelby urges them to remember Tom's sacrifice every time they look at his cabin. He decides to lead a pious Christian life just as Uncle Tom did.\nLiterary themes and theories.\nMajor themes.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery. While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the power of Christian love, she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a \"homily\" on the destructive nature of slavery (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, \"The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections\u2014the separating of families, for example.\"). One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how this \"peculiar institution\" forcibly separated families from each other.\nOne of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she wove it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. Another example is the death of Prue, who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.\nBecause Stowe saw motherhood as the \"ethical and structural model for all of American life\" and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the \"ideal Christian\", Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. Though later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often domestic clich\u00e9s instead of realistic women, Stowe's novel \"reaffirmed the importance of women's influence\" and helped pave the way for the women's rights movement in the following decades.\nStowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme\u2014the exploration of the nature of Christian love and how she feels Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery. This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to \"look away to Jesus\" after the death of St. Clare's beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, \"What a thing it is to be a Christian.\" Because Christian themes play such a large role in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\u2014and because of Stowe's frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith\u2014the novel often takes the \"form of a sermon\".\nLiterary theories.\nOver the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the major theme of condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.\nScholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, and the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.\nFeminist theory can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.\nThe book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery. In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. To change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.\nStyle.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is written in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th-century sentimental novels and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and were \"written by, for, and about women\" along with featuring a writing style that evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has been called a \"representative\" example of a sentimental novel.\nThe power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: \"I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.\" Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.\nDespite this positive reaction from readers, for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured what one critic called \"women's sloppy emotions\". Another literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, \"it would be just another sentimental novel\", and another described the book as \"primarily a derivative piece of hack work\". In \"The Literary History of the United States\", George F. Whicher called \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" \"Sunday-school fiction\", full of \"broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos\".\nIn 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view with her famous defense of the book in \"Sentimental Power: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Politics of Literary History.\" Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", were remarkable for their \"intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness\"; and that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" offers a \"critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.\"\nReactions to the novel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Events leading to the American Civil War\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. The novel is considered an influential \"landmark\" of protest literature.\nContemporary reaction in United States and around the world.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" had an \"incalculable\" impact on the 19th-century world and captured the imagination of many Americans. In a likely apocryphal story that alludes to the novel's impact, when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe in 1862 he supposedly commented, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\" Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Many writers have also credited the novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.\nFrederick Douglass was \"convinced both of the social uses of the novel and of Stowe's humanitarianism\" and heavily promoted the novel in his newspaper during the book's initial release. Though Douglass said \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was \"a work of marvelous depth and power,\" he also published criticism of the novel, most prominently by Martin Delany. In a series of letters in the paper, Delany accused Stowe of \"borrowing (and thus profiting) from the work of black writers to compose her novel\" and chastised Stowe for her \"apparent support of black colonization to Africa.\" Delany was \"one of the most out-spoken black critics\" of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" at the time and later wrote \"Blake; or the Huts of America,\" a novel where an African American \"chooses violent rebellion over Tom's resignation.\"\nWhite people in the American South were outraged at the novel's release, with the book also roundly criticized by slavery supporters. Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms declared the work utterly false while also calling it slanderous. Reactions ranged from a bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling the novel to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.\nSome critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never been to a Southern plantation. Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that \"She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot.\"\nIn response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\", an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and cites \"real life equivalents\" to them while also mounting a more \"aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had\". Like the novel, \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was a best-seller, but although Stowe claimed \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was due to anti-Americanism in Britain. As English lawyer Nassau William Senior argued, \"The evil passions which \"Uncle Tom\" gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance, but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America\u2014we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system\u2014our Tories hate her democrats\u2014our Whigs hate her parvenus\u2014our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy... She taught us how to prove that democrats may be tyrants, that an aristocracy of caste is more oppressive than an aristocracy of station... Our pity for the victim is swallowed up by our hatred of the tyrant.\"\nStowe sent a copy of the book to Charles Dickens, who wrote her in response: \"I have read your book with the deepest interest and sympathy, and admire, more than I can express to you, both the generous feeling which inspired it, and the admirable power with which it is executed.\" The historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote in 1852 that \"it is the most valuable addition that America has made to English literature.\" Charles Francis Adams Sr., the American ambassador to Britain during the Civil War, argued later that \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"; or \"Life among the Lowly\", published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed.\" In 1852, a German translation was published in Germany. Sanders Isaac Bernstein, writing for the University of Southern California, wrote that it \"was immensely popular\" in that country resulting in both \"a fascination with the seemingly simpler life\" of someone enslaved while also stoking anti-slavery feelings, as well as \"a cottage industry\" of adaptations.\nLeo Tolstoy claimed that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was a greater work than any play written by Shakespeare because it flowed from the love of God and man.\n20th century and modern criticism.\nIn the 20th century, a number of writers attacked \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" not only for the stereotypes the novel had created about African-Americans but also because of \"the utter disdain of the Tom character by the black community\". These writers included Richard Wright with his collection \"Uncle Tom's Children\" (1938) and Chester Himes with his 1943 short story \"Heaven Has Changed\". Ralph Ellison also critiqued the book with his 1952 novel \"Invisible Man,\" with Ellison figuratively killing Uncle Tom in the opening chapter.\nIn 1945 James Baldwin published his influential and infamous critical essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\". In the essay, Baldwin described \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as \"a bad novel, having, in its self-righteousness, virtuous sentimentality\". He argued that the novel lacked psychological depth, and that Stowe, \"was not so much a novelist as an impassioned pamphleteer\". Edward Rothstein has claimed that Baldwin missed the point and that the purpose of the novel was \"to treat slavery not as a political issue but as an individually human one \u2013 and ultimately a challenge to Christianity itself.\"\nGeorge Orwell in his essay \"Good Bad Books\", first published in \"Tribune\" in November 1945, claims that \"perhaps the supreme example of the 'good bad' book is \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". It is an unintentionally ludicrous book, full of preposterous melodramatic incidents; it is also deeply moving and essentially true; it is hard to say which quality outweighs the other.\" But he concludes \"I would back \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" to outlive the complete works of Virginia Woolf or George Moore, though I know of no strictly literary test which would show where the superiority lies.\"\nThe negative associations related to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", in particular how the novel and associated plays created and popularized racial stereotypes, have to some extent obscured the book's historical impact as a \"vital antislavery tool\". After the turn of the millennium, scholars such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hollis Robbins have re-examined \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in what has been called a \"serious attempt to resurrect it as both a central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations.\"\nIn China, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" experienced a revival of interest in the early 1960s.55 In the Chinese communist view of the book, Uncle Tom was interpreted as having been betrayed by his \"Christian consciousness.\"55 In 1961, Sun Weishi directed a stage play adaptation of the book.55 The revival of interest in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" intersected with the translation and popularization of works by W. E. B. Du Bois, who was viewed as having developed a new spirit of Black resistance.\nLiterary significance.\nGenerally recognized as the first best-selling novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general. Later books that owe a large debt to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" include \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair and \"Silent Spring\" by Rachel Carson.\nDespite this undisputed significance, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has been called \"a blend of children's fable and propaganda\". The novel has also been dismissed by several literary critics as \"merely a sentimental novel\"; critic George Whicher stated in his \"Literary History of the United States\" that \"Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book.\"\nOther critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that \"To expose oneself in maturity to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" may therefore prove a startling experience. It is a much more impressive work than one has ever been allowed to suspect.\" Jane Tompkins stated that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day.\nCreation and popularization of stereotypes.\nMany modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for condescending racist descriptions of the black characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) played a major role in perpetuating and solidifying such stereotypes into the American psyche.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements attacked the novel, claiming that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in \"race betrayal\", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners.\nAmong the stereotypes of blacks in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" are the \"happy darky\" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); and the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people.\nStowe intended Tom to be a \"noble hero\" and a Christ-like figure who, like Jesus at his crucifixion, forgives the people responsible for his death. The false stereotype of Tom as a \"subservient fool who bows down to the white man\", and the resulting derogatory term \"Uncle Tom\", resulted from staged \"Tom Shows\", which sometimes replaced Tom's grim death with an upbeat ending where Tom causes his oppressors to see the error of their ways, and they all reconcile happily. Stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story.\nAnti-Tom literature.\nIn response to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was published in 1852, and very quickly seven Anti-Tom novels were published in 1852 and six more in 1853. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.\nAmong the most famous anti-Tom books are \"The Sword and the Distaff\" by William Gilmore Simms, \"Aunt Phillis's Cabin\" by Mary Henderson Eastman, and \"The Planter's Northern Bride\" by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a Northern woman\u2014the daughter of an abolitionist, no less\u2014who marries a Southern slave owner.\nIn the decade between the publication of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and the start of the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published (although others continued to be published after the war, including \"The Leopard's Spots\" in 1902 by \"professional racist\" Thomas Dixon Jr.). More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, Simms commenting at one point about the \"Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman.\"\nDramatic adaptations.\nPlays and Tom shows.\nEven though \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book. Historian Eric Lott estimated that \"for every one of the three hundred thousand who bought the novel in its first year, many more eventually saw the play.\" In 1902, it was reported that a quarter million of these presentations had already been performed in the United States.\nGiven the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\u2014\"Tom shows\"\u2014began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama, although she eventually saw George L. Aiken's version and, according to Francis Underwood, was \"delighted\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy. Aiken's stage production was the most popular play in the U.S. and Britain for 75 years. Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.\nNo international copyright laws existed at the time. The book and plays were translated into several languages. Stowe received no money, which could have meant as much as \"three-fourths of her just and legitimate wages\".\nAll the Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy. These plays varied tremendously in their politics\u2014some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of black people; some productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster, including \"My Old Kentucky Home\", \"Old Folks at Home\", and \"Massa's in the Cold Ground\". The best-known Tom shows were those of George Aiken and H. J. Conway.\nThe many stage variants of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" \"dominated northern popular culture... for several years\" during the 19th century, and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century.\nFilms.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has been adapted several times as a film. Most of these movies were created during the silent film era (\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the most-filmed book of that time period). Because of the continuing popularity of both the book and \"Tom\" shows, audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.\nThe first film version of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was one of the earliest full-length movies, although full-length at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes. This 1903 film, directed by Edwin S. Porter, used white actors in blackface in the major roles and black performers only as extras. This version was evidently similar to many of the \"Tom Shows\" of earlier decades and featured several stereotypes about blacks, such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction.\nIn 1910, a three-reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to \"The Dramatic Mirror\", this film was \"a decided innovation\" in motion pictures and \"the first time an American company\" released a dramatic film in three reels. Until then, full-length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred Florence Turner, Mary Fuller, Edwin R. Phillips, Flora Finch, Genevieve Tobin and Carlyle Blackwell, Sr.\nAt least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version was released in 1927. Directed by Harry A. Pollard, who played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", this two-hour movie was more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era, at a cost of $1.8\u00a0million. The black actor Charles Gilpin was originally cast in the title role, but he was fired after the studio decided his \"portrayal was too aggressive\".\nFor several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The story was adapted as a play within the musical film version of The King &amp; I. Within the main story, the character of Anna Leonowens gives Tuptim a copy of the book of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Tuptim relates to the anti-slavery themes of the book, and adapts it in to a traditional Siamese play for a state dinner. In this version, called \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\", the characters are re-written as Buddhists. This version eliminates most of the white slave owners as characters, and focuses only on Tom, Simon, Eliza, Eva, and Topsy. Film versions were created overseas in the following decades, including a 1965 German-language version and a TV soap opera in Brazil called \"A Cabana do Pai Tom\u00e1s,\" which ran for 205 episodes from July 1969 to March 1970. The final film version was a television broadcast in 1987, directed by Stan Lathan and adapted by John Gay. It starred Avery Brooks, Phylicia Rashad, Edward Woodward, Jenny Lewis, Samuel L. Jackson and Endyia Kinney.\nIn addition to film adaptations, versions of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" have been produced in other formats, including a number of animated cartoons. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" also influenced movies, including \"The Birth of a Nation\". This controversial 1915 film set the dramatic climax in a slave cabin similar to that of Uncle Tom, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend, according to the film's caption, their \"Aryan birthright\". According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar image of a slave cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first BlackBerry was a two-way pager, Inter@ctive Pager 950, launched in 1999 in North America, running on the Mobitex network (later also DataTAC) and became very popular because of its \"always on\" state and ability to send and receive email messages wirelessly. The BlackBerry pioneered push notifications and popularized the practice of \"thumb typing\" using its QWERTY keyboard, something that would become a trademark feature of the line.\nIn its early years, the BlackBerry proved to be a major advantage over the (typically) one-way communication of conventional pagers and it also removed the need for users to tether to personal computers. It became especially used in the corporate world in the US and Canada. RIM debuted the BlackBerry in Europe in September 2001, but it had less appeal there where text messaging using SMS was more established. With the advancement of cellular technology, RIM released in 2002 the first BlackBerry cell phone, the BlackBerry 5810, that ran on the GSM network and used GPRS for its email and web capabilities. RIM also gained a reputation for secure communications, which led to the US government becoming its biggest customer and making use of BlackBerry services.\nFollowing the release of the BlackBerry Pearl in September 2006, as well as BlackBerry Messenger software, BlackBerry began attracting many mainstream consumers outside its traditional enterprise userbase, and was influential in the development and advancement of smartphones in this era. The BlackBerry line was for some time also the leading smartphone platform in the US. At its peak in September 2011, there were 85 million BlackBerry services subscribers worldwide. In the following years it lost market mainly to the Android and iOS platforms; its numbers had fallen to 23 million in March 2016, a decline of almost three-quarters. In 2013, RIM replaced the existing proprietary operating system, BlackBerry OS, with a new revamped platform called BlackBerry 10, while in 2015, the company began releasing Android-based BlackBerry-branded smartphones, beginning with the BlackBerry Priv.\nOn September 28, 2016, BlackBerry Limited (formerly Research In Motion) announced it would cease designing its own BlackBerry devices in favor of licensing to partners to design, manufacture, and market. The original licensees were BB Merah Putih for the Indonesian market, Optiemus Infracom for the South Asian market, and BlackBerry Mobile (a trade name of TCL Technology) for all other markets. New BlackBerry-branded products did not manage to gain significant market impact and were last produced in 2020. A new American licensee planned to release a new BlackBerry before it shut down in 2022 without a product. On January 4, 2022, BlackBerry Limited discontinued its legacy BlackBerry software platform services, which included blackberry.net email, BlackBerry Messenger, BlackBerry World, BlackBerry Protect, and Voice Search; BlackBerry devices based on the Android platform were not affected. Following the discontinuation of BlackBerry smartphones and their related services, BlackBerry Limited transitioned to providing software and services and holds critical software application patents.\nHistory.\nResearch in Motion (RIM), founded in Waterloo, Ontario, first developed the Inter@ctive Pager 900, announced on September 18, 1996. The Inter@ctive Pager 900 was a clamshell-type device that allowed two-way paging. After the success of the 900, the Inter@ctive Pager 800 was created for IBM, which bought US$10 million worth of them on February 4, 1998. The next device to be released was the Inter@ctive Pager 950, on August 26, 1998. The first device to carry the BlackBerry name was the BlackBerry 850, an email pager, released January 19, 1999. Although identical in appearance to the 950, the 850 was the first device to integrate email and the name Inter@ctive Pager was no longer used to brand the device.\nThe first BlackBerry device, the 850, was introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager in Munich, Germany. BlackBerry was a solution devised by RIM for delivering e-mail over several different wireless networks. The name BlackBerry was coined by the marketing company Lexicon Branding. The name was chosen out of about 40 potential names, because of the resemblance of the keyboard's buttons to that of the drupelets that compose the blackberry fruit.\nThe original BlackBerry devices, the RIM 850 and 857, used the DataTAC network. In 2002, the more commonly known convergent BlackBerry 5810 smartphone was released, which supports push email, mobile telephone, text messaging, Internet faxing, Web browsing and other wireless information services.\nBlackBerry gained market share in the mobile industry by concentrating on email. BlackBerry began to offer email service on non-BlackBerry devices, such as the Palm Treo, through the proprietary BlackBerry Connect software.\nThe original BlackBerry device had a monochrome display while newer models installed color displays. All newer models have been optimized for \"thumbing\", the use of only the thumbs to type on a keyboard. The Storm and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing. Originally, system navigation was achieved with the use of a scroll wheel mounted on the right side of device models prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, which allowed four-way scrolling. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the 8500 series, the company's first entry-level device. Models made to use iDEN networks, such as Nextel, SouthernLINC, NII Holdings, and Mike also incorporate a push-to-talk (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio.\nOn January 30, 2013, BlackBerry announced the release of the Z10 and Q10 smartphones. Both models consisted of touch screens: the Z10 features an all-touch design and the Q10 combines a QWERTY keyboard with touchscreen features.\nOn March 5, 2013, BlackBerry announced the signature of a large contract to secure German government Data and Voice communications. Angela Merkel signed the contract publicly and https:// along with BlackBerry Europe Managing Director, Herve Liboureau.\nDuring the second financial quarter of 2013, BlackBerry sold 6.8 million handsets, but was eclipsed by the sales of competitor Nokia's Lumia model for the first time.\nOn August 12, 2013, BlackBerry announced the intention to sell the company due to their increasingly unfavorable financial position and competition in the mobile industry. Largely due to lower than expected sales on the Z10, BlackBerry announced on September 20, 2013, that 4,500 full- and part-time positions (an estimated 40% of its operating staff) have been terminated and its product line has been reduced from six to four models. On September 23, 2013, Fairfax Financial, which owns a 10% equity stake in BlackBerry, made an offer to acquire BlackBerry for $4.7 billion (at $9.00 per share). Following the announcement, BlackBerry announced an acceptance of the offer provisionally but it would continue to seek other offers until November 4, 2013.\nOn November 4, 2013, BlackBerry replaced Thorsten Heins with new interim CEO John S. Chen, the former CEO of Sybase. On November 8, the BlackBerry board rejected proposals from several technology companies for various BlackBerry assets on grounds that a break-up did not serve the interest of all stakeholders, which include employees, customers and suppliers in addition to shareholders, said the sources, who did not want to be identified as the discussions were confidential. On November 13, 2013, Chen released an open message: \"We are committed to reclaiming our success.\"\nOn December 17, 2013, BlackBerry announced a contract for more than https://.\nOn February 26, 2014, during Mobile World Congress, https:// Europe Managing Director, Herve Liboureau, for the BlackBerry 10 entire Mobility Management suite.\nIn early July 2014, the \"TechCrunch\" online publication published an article titled \"BlackBerry Is One Of The Hottest Stocks Of 2014, Seriously\", following a 50 percent rise in the company's stock, an increase that was greater than peer companies such as Apple and Google; however, an analysis of BlackBerry's financial results showed that neither revenue or profit margin were improved, but, instead, costs were markedly reduced. During the same period, BlackBerry also introduced the new Passport handset\u2014consisting of a square screen with \"Full HD-class\" (1,440 x 1,440) resolution and marketed to professional fields such as healthcare and architecture\u2014promoted its Messenger app and released minor updates for the BB10 mobile operating system.\nOn December 17, 2014, the BlackBerry Classic was introduced; it is meant to be more in line with the former Bold series, incorporating navigation buttons similar to the previous BlackBerry OS devices. When it was discontinued in June 2016, it was the last BlackBerry with a keyboard that dominates the front of the phone in the classic style.\nIn September 2015, BlackBerry officially unveiled the BlackBerry Priv, a slider, with a German made camera lens with 18 megapixels, phablet that utilizes the Android operating system with additional security and productivity-oriented features inspired by the BlackBerry operating systems. However, BlackBerry COO Marty Beard told Bloomberg that \"The company's never said that we would not build another BB10 device.\"\nOn July 26, 2016, the company hinted that another model with a physical keyboard was \"coming shortly\". The same day, BlackBerry unveiled a mid-range Android model with only an on-screen keyboard, the BlackBerry DTEK50, powered by the then latest version of Android Marshmallow (version 6.0). (The Priv could be upgraded to the same version of the\nAndroid operating system as well.) This device featured a 5.2-inch full high-definition (or in other words, a FHD), display. BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher stressed data security during the launch, indicating that this model included built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. Industry observers pointed out that the DTEK50 is a re-branded version of the Alcatel Idol 4 with additional security-oriented software customizations, manufactured and designed by TCL.\nIn September 2016, BlackBerry Limited agreed to a licensing partnership with an Indonesian company to set up a new joint venture company called BB Merah Putih to \"source, distribute, and market BlackBerry handsets in Indonesia\".\nOn October 25, 2016, BlackBerry released the BlackBerry DTEK60, the second device in the DTEK series, manufactured and designed by TCL. The device featured a 5.5-inch Quad-HD touch screen display running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor with support for Quick Charge 3.0, USB Type-C, and a fingerprint sensor.\nIn October 2016, it was announced that BlackBerry would be working with the Ford Motor Company of Canada to develop software for the car manufacturer's connected vehicles.\nIn February 2017, a $20m class action lawsuit against BlackBerry was announced by the former employees of the company.\nIn March 2017, BB Merah Putih announced the BlackBerry Aurora, an Indonesian-made and sold device, running an operating system based on Android 7.0 out of the box.\nIn March 2018, BlackBerry announced that it would be working with Jaguar Land Rover to develop software for the car manufacturer's vehicles. In June 2018, BlackBerry, in partnership with TCL Mobile and Optiemus Infracom, launched the KEY2 at a global launch in New York. This was the third device to sport a keyboard while running Google's Android OS.\nIn 2017, BlackBerry Mobile released the BlackBerry KeyOne, which was known for having a physical keyboard below its 4.5 inch touchscreen and a long battery life. It was the last device to be designed internally by BlackBerry. Also in 2017, BlackBerry Mobile, under their partner license agreements, released the BlackBerry Aurora, BlackBerry KeyOne L/E BLACK, and the BlackBerry Motion.\nIn June 2018, the BlackBerry Key2 was launched in international markets, and in India by licensee Optiemus Infracom. The Key2 sports a dual camera setup and incorporates features such as portrait mode and optical zoom. In August 2018, after the launch of the BlackBerry Key2, Optiemus Infracom announced the launch of the BlackBerry Evolve and Evolve X smartphones for the Indian market sold exclusively on Amazon India. The smartphones have been conceptualized, designed and manufactured in India.\nAs of 2019, BB Merah Putih's website had been repurposed, with BlackBerry Limited stating that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been any updates posted regarding BlackBerry products in India since 2018.\nOn January 4, 2022, BlackBerry Limited discontinued services for all non-Android BlackBerry devices.\nIn October 2023, it was announced that Blackberry Chief Operating Officer, John Chen would be leaving the company after ten years. Richard Lynch took over as interim CEO and chair of the board.\nIntellectual property litigation.\nNTP Inc case.\nIn 2000 NTP sent notice of its wireless email patents to a number of companies and offered to license the patents to them. NTP brought a patent-infringement lawsuit against one of the companies, Research In Motion, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. This court is well known for its strict adherence to timetables and deadlines, sometimes referred to as the \"rocket docket\", and is particularly efficient at trying patent cases.\nThe jury eventually found that the NTP patents were valid; furthermore, the jury established that RIM had infringed the patents in a \"willful\" manner, and the infringement had cost NTP US$33 million in damages (the greater of a reasonable royalty or lost profits). The judge, James R. Spencer, increased the damages to US$53 million as a punitive measure due to the willful nature of the infringement. He also instructed RIM to pay NTP's legal fees of US$4.5 million and issued an injunction ordering RIM to cease and desist infringing the patents\u2014this decision would have resulted in the closure of BlackBerry's systems in the US. RIM appealed all of the findings of the court. The injunction and other remedies were stayed pending the outcome of the appeals.\nIn March 2005 during appeal, RIM and NTP tried to negotiate a settlement of their dispute; the settlement was to be for $450 million. Negotiations broke down due to other issues. On June 10, 2005, the matter returned to the courts. In early November 2005 the US Department of Justice filed a brief requesting that RIM's service be allowed to continue because of the large number of BlackBerry users in the US Federal Government.\nIn January 2006 the US Supreme Court refused to hear RIM's appeal of the holding of liability for patent infringement, and the matter was returned to a lower court. The prior granted injunction preventing all RIM sales in the US and use of the BlackBerry device might have been enforced by the presiding district court judge had the two parties been unable to reach a settlement.\nOn February 9, 2006, the US Department of Defense (DOD) filed a brief stating that an injunction shutting down the BlackBerry service while excluding government users was unworkable. The DOD also stated that the BlackBerry was crucial for national security given the large number of government users.\nOn February 9, 2006, RIM announced that it had developed software workarounds that would not infringe the NTP patents, and would implement those if the injunction was enforced.\nOn March 3, 2006, after a stern warning from Judge Spencer, RIM and NTP announced that they had settled their dispute. Under the terms of the settlement, RIM has agreed to pay NTP $612.5 million (USD) in a \"full and final settlement of all claims.\" In a statement, RIM said that \"all terms of the agreement have been finalized and the litigation against RIM has been dismissed by a court order this afternoon. The agreement eliminates the need for any further court proceedings or decisions relating to damages or injunctive relief.\" The settlement amount is believed low by some analysts, because of the absence of any future royalties on the technology in question.\nOn May 26, 2017, BlackBerry announced that it had reached an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated resolving all amounts payable in connection with the interim arbitration decision announced on April 12, 2017. Following a joint stipulation by the parties, the arbitration panel has issued a final award providing for the payment by Qualcomm to BlackBerry of a total amount of U.S.$940,000,000 including interest and attorneys' fees, net of certain royalties due from BlackBerry for calendar 2016 and the first quarter of calendar 2017.\nIn summer 2020, the Texas-based startup OnwardMobility signed a new licensing agreement with BlackBerry Limited to develop a new 5G BlackBerry smartphone. OnwardMobility was cooperating with BlackBerry Limited and FIH Mobile (a subsidiary of Foxconn) as they \"sought to revitalize the iconic BlackBerry brand through an Android-based, next-gen Wi-Fi device.\" However, in a statement released on February 18, 2022, OnwardMobility said that not only would the development of the new BlackBerry device not be moving forward, but the company itself would be shutting down, as well.\nKIK.\nOn November 24, 2010, Research In Motion (RIM) removed Kik Messenger from BlackBerry App World and limited the functionality of the software for its users. RIM also sued Kik Interactive for patent infringement and misuse of trademarks. In October 2013, the companies settled the lawsuit, with the terms undisclosed.\nFacebook and Instagram.\nIn 2018 it was reported that BlackBerry would be filing legal action against Facebook over perceived intellectual property infringements within both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp as well as with Instagram. They settled for an undisclosed amount on January 15, 2021.\nService outages.\nAt various stages of the company's history it suffered occasional service outages that have been referred to in the media as \"embarrassing\".\nIn 2005 the company suffered a relatively short-term outage reportedly among a small handful of North America carriers. The service was restored after several hours.\nIn 2007 the e-mail service suffered an outage which led for calls by some questioning the integrity towards BlackBerry's perceived centralized system.\nIn 2009 the company had an outage reportedly covering the whole of North America.\nAt 2011-10-10 10:00 UTC began a multi-day outage in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, affecting millions of BlackBerry users. There was another outage the following day. By October 12, 2011, the BlackBerry Internet Service went down in North America. Research In Motion attributed data overload due to switch failures in their two data centres in Waterloo in Canada and Slough in England as the cause of the service disruptions. The outage intensified calls by shareholders for a shake-up in the company's leadership.\nSome estimates by BlackBerry are that the company lost between $50 million to $54 million due to global email service failure and outage in 2011.\nRetail stores.\nMany BlackBerry retail stores operated outside North America, such as in Thailand, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates. In December 2007 a BlackBerry Store opened in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The store offers BlackBerry device models from AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint, the major U.S. carriers which offer smartphones. There were three prior attempts at opening BlackBerry stores in Toronto (Canada) and London (United Kingdom), but they eventually folded. There are also BlackBerry Stores operated by Wireless Giant at airports in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, Philadelphia, Houston, and Newark, but several have been slated for closing.\nOn September 23, 2015, BlackBerry opened its first pop-up store in Frankfurt, Germany.\nCertification.\nThe BCESA, BlackBerry Certified Enterprise Sales Associate qualification, is the first of three levels of professional BlackBerry Certification.\nMore information on certifications is on the BlackBerry.com website.\nThe BlackBerry Technical Certifications available are:\nProducts.\nAndroid devices:\nBlackBerry 10 devices:\nBlackBerry 7 devices:\nBlackBerry 6 devices:\nBlackBerry 5 devices:\nBlackBerry 4 devices:\nBlackBerry 3 devices:\nBlackBerry 2 devices:\nBlackBerry 1 devices:\nHardware.\nModern LTE based phones such as the BlackBerry Z10 have a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus, a proprietary Qualcomm SOC which is based on ARMv7-A architecture, featuring two 1.5\u00a0GHz Qualcomm Krait CPU cores, and a 400\u00a0MHz Adreno 225 GPU. GSM-based BlackBerry phones incorporate an ARM 7, 9 or 11 processor. Some of the BlackBerry models (Torch 9850/9860, Torch 9810, and Bold 9900/9930) have a 1.2\u00a0GHz MSM8655 Snapdragon S2 SOC, 768 MB system memory, and 8 GB of on-board storage. Entry-level models, such as the Curve 9360, feature a Marvell PXA940 clocked at 800\u00a0MHz.\nSome previous BlackBerry devices, such as the Bold 9000, were equipped with Intel XScale 624\u00a0MHz processors. The Bold 9700 featured a newer version of the Bold 9000's processor but is clocked at the same speed. The Curve 8520 featured a 512\u00a0MHz processor, while BlackBerry 8000 series smartphones, such as the 8700 and the Pearl, are based on the 312\u00a0MHz ARM XScale ARMv5TE PXA900. An exception to this is the BlackBerry 8707 which is based on the 80\u00a0MHz Qualcomm 3250 chipset; this was due to the PXA900 chipset not supporting 3G networks. The 80\u00a0MHz processor in the BlackBerry 8707 meant the device was often slower to download and render web pages over 3G than the 8700 was over EDGE networks. Early BlackBerry devices, such as the BlackBerry 950, used Intel 80386-based processors.\nBlackBerry's latest Flagship phone the BlackBerry Z30 based on a 5-inch Super AMOLED, 1280\u00d7720 resolution, at 295 ppi 24-bit color depth and powered by Quad-Graphics and Qualcomm's Dual Core 1.7\u00a0GHz MSM8960T Pro.\nThe first BlackBerry with an Android operating system was released in late November 2015, the BlackBerry Priv. It launched with version 5.1.1 but was later upgraded to version 6.0 Android Marshmallow. It was first available in four countries but increased to 31 countries by February 28, 2016.\nEmploying a Qualcomm 8992 Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core, 64-bit, Adreno 418, 600\u00a0MHz GPU with 3 GB RAM processor, this unit is equipped with a curved 5.4-inch (2560 x 1440) OLED display and a sliding QWERTY keyboard which is hidden when not in use; Google's voice recognition that allows for dictating e-mails is also available. The Priv retained the best BlackBerry 10 features. Its 3,410 mAh battery is said to provide 22.5 hours of mixed use. The 18-megapixel camera, with a Schneider-Kreuznach lens, can also record 4K video; a secondary selfie camera is also provided. Several important apps unique to the Priv were available from Google Play by mid December.\nSoftware.\nA new operating system, BlackBerry 10, was released for two new BlackBerry models (Z10 and Q10) on January 30, 2013. At BlackBerry World 2012, RIM CEO Thorsten Heins demonstrated some of the new features of the OS, including a camera which is able to rewind frame-by-frame separately of individual faces in an image, to allow selection of the best of different shots, which is then stitched seamlessly to an optimal composite, an intelligent, predictive, and adapting keyboard, and a gesture based user interface designed around the idea of \"peek\" and \"flow\". Apps are available for BlackBerry 10 devices through the BlackBerry World storefront.\nThe previous operating system developed for older BlackBerry devices was BlackBerry OS, a proprietary multitasking environment developed by RIM. The operating system is designed for use of input devices such as the track wheel, track ball, and track pad. The OS provides support for Java MIDP 1.0 and WAP 1.2. Previous versions allowed wireless synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange Server email and calendar, as well as with Lotus Domino email. OS 5.0 provides a subset of MIDP 2.0, and allows complete wireless activation and synchronisation with Exchange email, calendar, tasks, notes and contacts, and adds support for Novell GroupWise and Lotus Notes. The BlackBerry Curve 9360, BlackBerry Torch 9810, Bold 9900/9930, Curve 9310/9320 and Torch 9850/9860 featured the 2011 BlackBerry OS 7. Apps are available for these devices through BlackBerry World (which before 2013 was called BlackBerry App World).\nThird-party developers can write software using these APIs, and proprietary BlackBerry APIs as well. Any application that makes use of certain restricted functionality must be digitally signed so that it can be associated to a developer account at RIM. This signing procedure guarantees the authorship of an application but does not guarantee the quality or security of the code. RIM provides tools for developing applications and themes for BlackBerry. Applications and themes can be loaded onto BlackBerry devices through BlackBerry World, Over The Air (OTA) through the BlackBerry mobile browser, or through BlackBerry Desktop Manager.\nBlackBerry devices, as well as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone platforms, have the ability to use the proprietary BlackBerry Messenger, also known as BBM, software for sending and receiving encrypted instant messages, voice notes, images and videos via BlackBerry PIN. As long as your cell phone has a data plan these messages are all free of charge. Some of the features of BBM include groups, bar-code scanning, lists, shared calendars, BBM Music and integration with apps and games using the BBM social platform.\nIn April 2013, BlackBerry announced that it was shutting down its streaming music service, BBM Music, which was active for almost two years since its launch. BlackBerry Messenger Music closed on June 2, 2013.\nIn July 2014, BlackBerry revealed BlackBerry Assistant, a new feature for BlackBerry OS 10.3, and BlackBerry Passport hardware. The feature is a digital personal assistant to help keep you \"organized, informed and productive.\"\nIn December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone.\nOn January 3, 2022, BlackBerry announced that they would discontinue their services on all BlackBerry phones not running on Android on January 4. According to BlackBerry, \"As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality\".\nPhones with BlackBerry email client.\nSeveral non-BlackBerry mobile phones have been released featuring the BlackBerry email client which connects to BlackBerry servers. Many of these phones have full QWERTY keyboards.\nThird-party software.\nThird-party software available for use on BlackBerry devices includes full-featured database management systems, which can be used to support customer relationship management clients and other applications that must manage large volumes of potentially complex data.\nIn March 2011, RIM announced an optional Android player that could play applications developed for the Android system would be available for the BlackBerry PlayBook, RIM's first entry in the tablet market.\nOn August 24, 2011 \"Bloomberg News\" reported unofficial rumors that BlackBerry devices would be able to run Android applications when RIM brings QNX and the Android App Player to BlackBerry.\nOn October 20, 2011, RIM officially announced that Android applications could run, unmodified, on the BlackBerry tablet and the newest BlackBerry phones, using the newest version of its operating system.\nConnectivity.\nBlackBerry smartphones can be integrated into an organization's email system through a software package called BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) through version 5, and BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) as of version 10. (There were no versions 6 through 9.) Versions of BES are available for Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, Novell GroupWise and Google Apps. While individual users may be able to use a wireless provider's email services without having to install BES themselves, organizations with multiple users usually run BES on their own network. BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry OS 10 or later can also be managed directly by a Microsoft Exchange Server, using Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) policies, in the same way that an iOS or Android device can. (EAS supports fewer management controls than BES does.) Some third-party companies provide hosted BES solutions. Every BlackBerry has a unique ID called a BlackBerry PIN, which is used to identify the device to the BES. BlackBerry at one time provided a free BES software called BES Express (BESX).\nThe primary BES feature is to relay email from a corporate mailbox to a BlackBerry phone. The BES monitors the user's mailbox, relaying new messages to the phone via BlackBerry's Network Operations Center (NOC) and user's wireless provider. This feature is known as push email, because all new emails, contacts, task entries, memopad entries, and calendar entries are pushed out to the BlackBerry device immediately (as opposed to the user synchronising the data manually or having the device poll the server at intervals).\nBlackBerry also supports polling email, through third-party applications. The messaging system built into the BlackBerry only understands how to receive messages from a BES or the BIS, these services handle the connections to the user's mail providers. Device storage also enables the mobile user to access all data off-line in areas without wireless service. When the user reconnects to wireless service, the BES sends the latest data.\nA feature of the newer models of the BlackBerry is their ability to quickly track the user's current location through trilateration without the use of GPS, thus saving battery life and time. Trilateration can be used as a quick, less battery intensive way to provide location-aware applications with the co-ordinates of the user. However, the accuracy of BlackBerry trilateration is less than that of GPS due to a number of factors, including cell tower blockage by large buildings, mountains, or distance.\nBES also provides phones with TCP/IP connectivity accessed through a component called MDS (Mobile Data System) Connection Service. This allows custom application development using data streams on BlackBerry devices based on the Sun Microsystems Java ME platform.\nIn addition, BES provides network security, in the form of Triple DES or, more recently, AES encryption of all data (both email and MDS traffic) that travels between the BlackBerry phone and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server.\nMost providers offer flat monthly pricing via special BlackBerry tariffs for unlimited data between BlackBerry units and BES. In addition to receiving email, organizations can make intranets or custom internal applications with unmetered traffic.\nWith more recent versions of the BlackBerry platform, the MDS is no longer a requirement for wireless data access. Starting with OS 3.8 or 4.0, BlackBerry phones can access the Internet (i.e. TCP/IP access) without an MDS \u2013 formerly only email and WAP access was possible without a BES/MDS. The BES/MDS is still required for secure email, data access, and applications that require WAP from carriers that do not allow WAP access.\nThe primary alternative to using BlackBerry Enterprise Server is to use the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS). BlackBerry Internet Service is available in 91 countries internationally. BlackBerry Internet Service was developed primarily for the average consumer rather than for the business consumer. The service allows users to access POP3, IMAP, and Outlook Web App (not via Exchange ActiveSync) email accounts without connecting through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). BlackBerry Internet Service allows up to 10 email accounts to be accessed, including proprietary as well as public email accounts (such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and AOL). BlackBerry Internet Service also supports the push capabilities of various other BlackBerry Applications. Various applications developed by RIM for BlackBerry utilise the push capabilities of BIS, such as the Instant Messaging clients (like Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger). The MMS, PIN, interactive gaming, mapping and trading applications require data plans like BIS (not just Wi-Fi) for use. The service is usually provisioned through a mobile phone service provider, though BlackBerry actually runs the service.\nBlackBerry PIN.\nThe BlackBerry PIN (Personal Identification Number) is an eight-character hexadecimal identification number assigned to each BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with the launch of the BlackBerry 10 platform.\nCompetition and financial results.\nThe BlackBerry grew swiftly in popularity during the early 2000s, and by 2005 had become highly popular and influential in North America. It then gained the nickname \"Crackberry\" due to its seemingly addictive nature. In 2006, the term CrackBerry was formally recognized by Webster's New World College Dictionary.\nAs of 2006, some of the BlackBerry's main competitors included offerings from Motorola (namely Motorola Q), Palm, Inc., the iPAQ and other Pocket PCs, and Nokia (namely Nokia E61).\nAs of 2009, RIM held 56 percent of the American smartphone market. While the iPhone from Apple Inc. quickly became popular after its launch, RIM remained market leaders and was growing too, with sales tripling between 2007 and 2009. In \"Fortune\"'s list of the Fastest Growing Companies of 2009, RIM ranked first, while the BlackBerry Curve became the best-selling smartphone in the U.S. in 2009.\nDespite market share loss, on a global basis, the number of active BlackBerry subscribers increased substantially through the years. For example, for the fiscal period during which the Apple iPhone was first released, RIM reported that they had a subscriber base of 10.5 million BlackBerry subscribers. At the end of 2008, when Android first hit the market, RIM reported that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had increased to 21 million. After the release of the Apple iPhone 5 in September 2012, RIM CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the current global subscribers was up to 80 million, which sparked a 7% jump in shares price.\nIn the year 2010, RIM and Apple continued to dominate the U.S. smartphone market, although the BlackBerry Curve had lost its spot as the single highest selling product to the iPhone 3GS.\nIn the early 2010s, BlackBerry struggled to compete against both the iPhone and the Android platform - after device sales peaking in 2011, its share plunged in the years after, leading to speculation that it would be unable to survive as an independent going concern. However, it managed to maintain significant positions in some markets. BlackBerry's global user base (meaning active accounts) declined dramatically since its peak of 80 million in June 2012, dropping to 46 million users in September 2014. Its market share globally had also declined to less than 1 percent.\nDuring the report of its third quarter 2015 results on December 18, 2015, the company said that approximately 700,000 handsets had been sold, down from 1.9 million in the same quarter in 2014, and down from 800,000 in Q2 of 2015. The average sale price per unit was up from $240 to $315, however. This should continue to increase with sales of the new Android Priv device which was selling at a premium price ($800 in Canada, for example). In Q3 of 2015, BlackBerry had a net loss of $89 million U.S. or 17 cents per share, but only a $15 million net loss, or three cents per share, when excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items.\nRevenue was up slightly from a year earlier, at $557 million U.S. vs. $548 million, primarily because of software sales. Chief executive officer John Chen said that he expects the company's software business to grow at (14 percent) or above the market. At the time, the company was not ready to provide sales figures for the Android-based Priv handset which had been released only weeks earlier, and in only four countries at that time, but Chen offered this comment to analysts: \"Depending on how Priv does\u00a0... there is a chance we could achieve or get closer to break-even operating profitability for our overall device business in the (fourth) quarter\".\nDue to a continuous reduction in BlackBerry users, in February 2016 the BlackBerry headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, slashed 35 percent of its workforce. By early 2016, BlackBerry market share dropped to 0.2%. In Q4 2016, reports indicate BlackBerry sold only 207,900 units\u2014equivalent to a 0.0% market share.\nIndonesian market.\nIn 2011, BlackBerry shipped 43% of all smartphones to Indonesia. By April 2014 this had fallen to 3%. The decline in the Indonesian market share mirrors a global trend for the company (0.6% of North America). The retail price of 2,199,000 Indonesian Rupiah ($189) failed to give BlackBerry the boost it needed in Indonesia. The company launched the device with a discounted offer to the first 1000 purchasers, which resulted in a stampede in the capital in which several people were injured. BlackBerry lost market share in Indonesia despite the launch of the Z3 on May 13, 2014. The new device was given a worldwide launch in the city of Jakarta and came on the back of the news that Research in Motion (RIM) was to cut hardware production costs by outsourcing this to Taiwan-based Foxconn Group.\nWorldwide user base numbers.\nThe number of active BlackBerry users since 2000 globally:\nSecurity agencies access.\nResearch in Motion agreed to give access to private communications to the governments of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in 2010, and India in 2012. The Saudi and UAE governments had threatened to ban certain services because their law enforcement agencies could not decrypt messages between people of interest.\nIt was revealed as a part of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) respectively, have access to the user data on BlackBerry devices. The agencies are able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, e-mails, and notes through BlackBerry Internet Service, which operates outside corporate networks, and which, in contrast to the data passing through internal BlackBerry services (BES), only compresses but does not encrypt data.\nDocuments stated that the NSA was able to access the BlackBerry e-mail system and that they could \"see and read SMS traffic\". There was a brief period in 2009 when the NSA was unable to access BlackBerry devices, after BlackBerry changed the way they compress their data. Access to the devices was re-established by GCHQ. GCHQ has a tool named SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE, with the capability of \"Perfect spoofing of emails from Blackberry targets\".\nIn response to the revelations BlackBerry officials stated that \"It is not for us to comment on media reports regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications traffic\" and added that a \"back door pipeline\" to their platform had not been established and did not exist.\nSimilar access by the intelligence agencies to many other mobile devices exists, using similar techniques to hack into them.\nThe BlackBerry software includes support for the Dual EC DRBG CSPRNG algorithm which, due to being probably backdoored by the NSA, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology \"strongly recommends\" no longer be used. BlackBerry Ltd. has however not issued an advisory to its customers, because they do not consider the probable backdoor a vulnerability. BlackBerry Ltd. also owns US patent 2007189527, which covers the technical design of the backdoor.\nUsage.\nInitially the BlackBerry was mostly popular by corporate and business users. By the late 2000s however, a growing number of other consumers were using it.\nThe (formerly) advanced encryption capabilities of the BlackBerry Smartphone made it eligible for use by government agencies and state forces. On January 4, 2022, BlackBerry announced that older phones running BlackBerry 10, 7.1 OS and earlier will no longer work.\nBarack Obama.\nFormer United States president Barack Obama became known for his dependence on a BlackBerry device for communication during his 2008 presidential campaign. Despite the security issues, he insisted on using it even after inauguration. This was seen by some as akin to a \"celebrity endorsement\", which marketing experts have estimated to be worth between $25 million and $50 million. His usage of BlackBerry continued until around the end of his presidency.\nHillary Clinton.\nThe Hillary Clinton email controversy is associated with Hillary Clinton continuing to use her black-colored BlackBerry after assuming the office of Secretary of State.\nUse by government forces.\nAn example is the West Yorkshire Police, which allowed the increase in the presence of police officers along the streets and a reduction in public spending, given that each officer could perform desk work directly via the mobile device, as well as in several other areas and situations. The US Federal Government was slow to move away from the BlackBerry platform, a State Department spokesperson saying in 2013 that BlackBerry devices were still the only mobile devices approved for U.S. missions abroad by the State Department. The high encryption standard that made BlackBerry smartphones and the PlayBook tablet unique, have since been implemented in other devices, including most Apple devices released after the iPhone 4.\nThe Bangalore City Police is one of the few police departments in India along with the Pune Police and Kochi Police to use BlackBerry devices.\nUse by transportation staff.\nIn the United Kingdom, South West Trains and Northern Rail issued BlackBerry devices to guards in order to improve the communication between control, guards and passengers.\nIn Canada, Toronto and many other municipalities within Canada issued BlackBerry devices to most of its employees including but not limited to transportation, technical, water and operations inspection staff and all management staff in order to improve the communication between contracted construction companies, its winter maintenance operations and to assist and successfully organize multimillion-dollar contracts. The devices were the standard mobile device to receive e-mail redirected from GroupWise.\nAs part of their Internet of Things endeavours, the company announced plans of moving into the shipping industry by adapting the smartphones devices to the communication necessities of freight containers.\nOther notable users.\nAs of 2024, Eminem uses a BlackBerry OS phone.\nKim Kardashian was also a BlackBerry user. In 2014, she reportedly said at the Code/Mobile conference that \"BlackBerry has my heart and soul. I love it. I'll never get rid of it\" and \"I have anxiety that I will run out and I won't be able to have a BlackBerry. I'm afraid it will go extinct.\" Kardashian also admitted to keeping a supply of BlackBerry phones with her because she was loyal to the BlackBerry Bold model. She has since been spotted using an iPhone instead.\nKaty Perry was also a BlackBerry user. She used the 8800 in her \"Part of Me\" music video, used the Bold 9780, Torch and other models in the documentary concert film \"\", was seen using the Curve 8900 and Bold 9900 and attended the launch of the Pearl Flip. In 2012, she switched to the IPhone 4s for 2 weeks and switched back to BlackBerry for the keyboard. She has since been spotted using an iPhone instead.\nE.\u00a0L. James wrote \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" on her BlackBerry.\nNigerian author Stephen Buoro wrote the first draft of his debut novel on his BlackBerry.\nEric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google from 2001 to 2011, was a longtime BlackBerry user. Although smartphones running Google's Android mobile operating system compete with BlackBerry, Schmidt said in a 2013 interview that he uses a BlackBerry because he prefers its keyboard.\nThe Italian criminal group known as the 'Ndrangheta was reported in February 2009 to have communicated overseas with the Gulf Cartel, a Mexican drug cartel, through the use of the BlackBerry Messenger, since the BBM Texts are \"very difficult to intercept\".\nIn popular culture.\n\"Blackberry\", a 2023 film directed by Matt Johnson, is a dramatized account of the history of the brand, loosely adapted from Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff's book \"Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry\".\nMarketing.\nBlackBerry paid these celebrities to promote its devices:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72000", "revid": "13892963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72000", "title": "Alachua County, Florida", "text": "County in Florida, United States\nAlachua County ( ) is a county in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 278,468. The county seat is Gainesville, the home of the University of Florida.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and early European settlements.\nThe first people known to have entered the area of Alachua County were Paleo-Indians, who left artifacts in the Santa Fe River basin before 8000 BC. Artifacts from the Archaic period (8000 - 2000 BC) have been found at several sites in Alachua County. Permanent settlements appeared in what is now Alachua County around 100 AD, as people of the wide-ranging Deptford culture developed the local Cades Pond culture. The Cades Pond culture gave way to the Alachua culture around 600 AD.\nThe Timucua-speaking Potano tribe lived in the Alachua culture area in the 16th century, when the Spanish entered Florida. The Potano were incorporated by the colonists in the Spanish mission system, but new infectious diseases, rebellion, and raids by tribes backed by the English led to severe population declines. What is now Alachua County had lost much of its indigenous population by the early 18th century.\nIn the 17th century, Francisco Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez, Royal Treasurer for Spanish Florida, established the La Chua ranch on the northern side of what is now known as Payne's Prairie, on a bluff overlooking the Alachua Sink. \"Chua\" may have been the Timucua language word for sinkhole. Lieutenant Diego Pe\u00f1a reported in 1716 that he passed by springs named Aquilachua, Usichua, Usiparachua, and Afanochua while traveling through what is now Suwannee County. In the twentieth-century, anthropologist J. Clarence Simpson assumed the named springs were in fact sinkholes. The Spanish later called the interior of Florida west of the St. Johns River \"Tierras de la Chua\", which became \"Alachua Country\" in English.\nAround 1740, a band of Oconee people led by Ahaya, who was called \"Cowkeeper\" by the English, settled on what is now Payne's Prairie. Ahaya's band became known as the Alachua Seminole. In 1774, botanist William Bartram visited Ahaya's town, \"Cuscowilla\", near what Bartram called the Alachua Savanna. King Payne, who succeeded Ahaya as chief of the Alachua Seminole, established a new town known as Payne's Town.\nIn 1812, during the Patriot War of East Florida, an attempt by American adventurers to seize Spanish Florida, a force of more than 100 volunteers from Georgia led by Colonel Daniel Newnan encountered a band of Alachua Seminole led by King Payne near Newnans Lake. After several days of intermittent fighting, Colonel Newnan's force withdrew. King Payne was wounded in the fight and died two months later. The Alachua Seminole then left Payne's Town and moved farther west and south, but other bands of Seminole moved in. A second American expedition in 1813 of U. S. Army troops and militia from Tennessee, led by Lt. Colonel Thomas Adams Smith, found some Seminoles, killing about 20, and burned every Seminole village they could find in the area.\nIn 1814, a group of more than 100 American settlers moved to a point believed to be near the abandoned Payne's Town (near present-day Micanopy) and declared the establishment of the District of Elotchaway of the Republic of East Florida. The settlement collapsed a few months later after its leader, Colonel Buckner Harris, was killed by Seminole. The remaining settlers returned to Georgia.\nEarly American settlements.\nIn 1817, F. M. Arredondo received the 20-mile square Arredondo Grant in the southern part of what is Alachua County. By the time Florida was formally transferred from Spain to the United States, people from the United States and from Europe were settling in the area. Wanton's Store, near the site of the abandoned King Payne's Town, attracted settlers, primarily from Europe, who founded Micanopy. The 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek required the Seminole to move a reservation south of what is now Ocala, and the flow of settlers into the area increased. Many settlers occupied former Seminole towns, such as Hogtown.\nAlachua County was created by the Florida territorial legislature in 1824. The new county stretched from the border with Georgia, south to Charlotte Harbor. The original county seat was Wanton's (per the store, as the name Micanopy had not been adopted). In 1828, the county seat was moved to Newnansville, near the current site of the city of Alachua.\nAs the area's population increased, Alachua County's size was reduced to organize new counties. In 1832, the county's northern part, including Newnansville, was separated to create Columbia County, forcing the county seat to move to various temporary locations, then to Spring Grove, from 1836 to 1839.\nIn 1834, Hillsborough County was created, which included the area around Tampa Bay down to Charlotte Harbor. In 1839, that part of Columbia County south of the Santa Fe River was returned to Alachua County, and Newnansville was restored as the county seat. Hernando County was created in 1843 from that part of Alachua County south of the Withlacoochee River; Marion County was created in 1844; and Levy County was created in 1846 from that part of Alachua County west of the Suwannee River. It would be another 80 years before Alachua County was again reduced in size.\nIn 1853, the residents of Alachua County realized that the route of the planned Florida Railroad connecting Fernandina to Cedar Key would bypass Newnansville. A general meeting at Boulware Springs was called to consider moving the county seat to a new town on the expected route of the railroad. The motion to move the county seat was hotly contested by the residents of Newnansville, but Tillman Ingram, a plantation owner in Hogtown who owned a sawmill there, offered to build a courthouse in the new town. The offer was for such as favorable price that the move was approved. At tha time, the name \"Gainesville\" was chosen for the new town. The county seat was moved to Gainesville in late 1856, upon completion of the new courthouse.\nLynchings and disenfranchisement.\nDuring the post-Reconstruction period, White Democrats regained control of the state legislature and worked to restore White supremacy. Violence against Blacks, including lynchings, rose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Whites imposed Jim Crow and discriminatory laws, disenfranchising most blacks, which forced them out of the political system. Alachua County was the site of 21 documented lynchings between 1891 and 1926. The first three documented lynchings, in Gainesville in 1891, involved two Black men and a White man, who were associated with the notorious Harmon Murray. Ten lynchings took place in Newberry, six of them in a mass lynching there in 1916. These lynchings were conducted outside the justice system, by mobs or small groups working alone. Nineteen of the victims were Black; two were White. (A 2015 report by the Equal Justice Initiative, based in Montgomery, Alabama, had identified 18 lynchings.

Alachua County is also home to the University of Florida and Santa Fe College.\nLibrary.\nThe Alachua County Library District is an independent special taxing district and the sole provider of public library service to approximately 250,000 citizens of Alachua County. This includes all of the incorporated municipalities in the county. It maintains a library headquarters and four branches in Gainesville. These locations include the Millhopper Branch in northwest Gainesville, the Tower Road Branch in unincorporated Alachua County southwest of Gainesville, the Library Partnership Branch in northeast Gainesville, and the Cone Park Branch in east Gainesville. The district also operates branches in the Alachua County municipalities of Alachua, Archer, Hawthorne, High Springs, Micanopy, Newberry, and Waldo, as well as a branch at the Alachua County Jail. The district's two bookmobiles visit more than 25 locations in the county from two to five times a month.\nLibrary history.\nThe Alachua County Library District traces its origins to 1905, when the Twentieth Century Club in Gainesville started a subscription library. The Gainesville Public Library, a subscription library operated by the Library Association, opened in 1906. The Twentieth Century Club donated the books from its subscription library, and the new library also received books from the library of the East Florida Seminary, which had been absorbed by the newly founded University of Florida.\nThe Gainesville Public Library became a free library in 1918, supported by funds from city taxes from all residents, but it was available only to whites. The building was constructed with the aid of a Carnegie library grant. The library became a department of the Gainesville municipal government in 1949. It was not until 1953 and opening of the Carver Branch Library that the city's African Americans had access to a library, as public facilities were still segregated. The Carver Branch closed in 1969, after the main library's desegregation.\nIn 1958, the city of Gainesville and Alachua County agreed to jointly operate the library for the county. Branch libraries opened in High Springs, Hawthorne, and Micanopy the next year, and a bookmobile was put into service. Alachua County joined with Bradford County to operate the Santa Fe Regional Library. After Bradford County withdrew from the Regional Library, the Alachua County Library District was formally established in 1986. The Millhopper and Tower Road branches opened in 1992, and the branches in Alachua, Archer, Newberry, and Waldo were all opened by 1997. The Library Partnership Branch opened in 2009, and the Cone Park Branch in 2011. A new, permanent location for the Cone Park Branch Library opened near the Eastside Community Center in Gainesville on December 14, 2013.\nTransportation.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics and government.\nStatewide elections.\nLike many other counties containing large state universities, Alachua County regularly supports the Democratic Party. It has voted for the Democratic candidate for president in the past nine elections. The county last supported a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, when it narrowly went for George H. W. Bush.\nVoter registration.\nAs of May 31, 2024, the county had a Democratic Party plurality, with large Republican and independent minorities.\nCounty offices.\nAlachua County is administered by the Alachua County Board of County Commissioners, a five-member legislative body. The constitutional county-wide elected officials include the clerk of the court, the supervisor of elections, the property appraiser, the sheriff, and the tax collector. The School Board and the Soil and Water Conservation District are also elected county-wide. Prior to 2024, county commissioners were elected at-large, but a ballot measure passed in 2022 created single-member district seats.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Alachua County Sheriff's Office is the chief law enforcement agency for unincorporated areas of Alachua County. As of 2025[ [update]], the current sheriff is Chad D. Scott, a Democrat who won the General election in November 2024.\nIn June 2007, ten employees in the sheriff's office, including the jail's director, were either fired or resigned while being investigated.\nAs of 2015[ [update]] the sheriff's office had at least one Lenco BearCat armored vehicle and two helicopters provided by the federal government under various programs. The office received criticism after the BearCat was used in a routine traffic stop.\nOn August 9, 2021, a prison inmate, Erica Thompson, gave birth while being held in Alachua County Jail. Her baby died. Despite the mother's screams, jail staff did not provide or call for medical assistance. An investigation held that law enforcement did not violate any law or policy.\nLandfills.\nAlachua County is the site of five closed landfills\u2014Southwest Landfill, Southeast Landfill, Northwest Landfill, Northeast Landfill, and Northeast Auxiliary Landfill. Since 1999, all solid waste from Alachua County has been hauled to the New River Solid Waste Facility in Raiford, which is in neighboring Union County.\nCommunities.\nUnincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistoric communities.\nAlachua County had a number of populated places, usually with a post office, established in the 19th century or early 20th century, but which were abandoned or had a much reduced population by the middle of the 20th century.

{"id": "72005", "revid": "38557371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72005", "title": "Westerwald", "text": "Mountain range in Germany\nThe Westerwald (; literally 'Western forest') is a low mountain range on the right bank of the river Rhine in the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is a part of the Rhenish Massif ( or Rhenish Slate Mountains). Its highest elevation, at 657\u00a0m above sea level, is the Fuchskaute in the High Westerwald.\nTourist attractions include the Dornburg (394 metres), site of some Celtic ruins from La T\u00e8ne times (5th to 1st century BC), found in the community of the same name, and Limburg an der Lahn, a town with a mediaeval centre.\nThe geologically old, heavily eroded range of the Westerwald is in its northern parts overlaid by a volcanic upland made of Neogene basalt layers. It covers an area of some , and therefore roughly , making the Westerwald one of Germany's biggest mountain ranges by area. In areas of subsidence, it has in its flatter western part (Lower Westerwald) the characteristics of rolling hills. Typical for the economy of the Upper Westerwald, some 40% of which is actually wooded, are traditional slate mining, clay quarrying, diabase and basalt mining, pottery and the iron ore industry, and among other things mining in the (roughly \"Siegerland Ore Grounds\"). Despite its relatively slight elevation, the Westerwald has for a low mountain range a typical agreeable climate. Economically and culturally, it belongs among Germany's best known mountain ranges.\nThe name \"Westerwald\" was first mentioned in 1048 in a document from the Electorate of Trier and described at that time the woodlands (\"Wald\" is German for \"forest\" or \"woods\") around the three churches in Bad Marienberg, Rennerod and Emmerichenhain, west of the royal court at Herborn. Only since the mid 19th century has the name come into common usage for the whole range.\nThe High Westerwald has since the Middle Ages formed the heart of the (also or ) (\"Lordship over the Westerwald\"). This comprised the three court districts of Marienberg, Emmerichenhain and Neukirch. The Lordship later fell under the governance of the Lordship or County of Beilstein.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe Westerwald lies mostly southwest of the three-state common point shared by Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia in the districts of Altenkirchen, Lahn-Dill, Limburg-Weilburg, Neuwied, Rhein-Lahn, Rhein-Sieg, Westerwaldkreis and partly in Siegen-Wittgenstein. It is found south of the Rothaargebirge, southwest of the Lahn-Dill-Bergland (another low mountain range), north of the Taunus and east of the Middle Rhine and stretches more or less southwards from Siegen and Burbach, southwestwards from Haiger, northwestwards from Weilburg, northwards from Limburg an der Lahn, northeastwards from Koblenz, eastwards from Linz am Rhein, southeastwards from Wissen and southwards from Betzdorf. In its centre lie Bad Marienberg and Hachenburg.\nClockwise, the Westerwald is bordered by the following river valleys: the Rhine between Koblenz and Linz, the Sieg as far as Betzdorf, the Heller, the Dill and from its mouth near Wetzlar, the Lahn up to Lahnstein.\nGeomorphologically, the Westerwald belongs to the Rhenish Massif, which forms the greater part of that range's eastern half on the Rhine's right bank. Likewise, the Gladenbach Uplands, lying east of the Dill, also belong to the Westerwald, whereas the mountains reaching up to near the Haiger Saddle () and east of Siegen are counted as part of the Rothaargebirge.\nThe Westerwald's regions.\nThe Westerwald is divided by elevation into these three regions:\n Translated here as Lower Westerwald, this region borders on the Rhine and Lahn river valley landscapes and manifests itself as the western and southwestern part of the Westerwald, a heavily truncated upland with elevations ranging from 200 to 400\u00a0m. The subsidence areas found within (\"Dierdorfer Senke\", \"Montabaurer Senke\") are known for their clay deposits. Indeed, the name for this small region is the Kannenb\u00e4ckerland, or \"Jug Bakers\u2019 Land\", a reference to the traditional ceramics industry here. In the southwest, in the richly wooded Montabaur Heights (\"Montabaurer H\u00f6he\") is found a monadnock made of quartzite, as well as the Malberg Conservation Area (\"Naturschutzgebiet Malberg\"). The Siebengebirge joining the range in the northwest near Bonn (reaching 464\u00a0m) is, however, regionally grouped with the Middle Rhine area.\n Translated here as Upper Westerwald, this is a partly wooded land of volcanic crests with major basalt layers, above all in the area of the Westerwald Lake Plateau (\"Westerw\u00e4lder Seenplatte\"), with elevations ranging from some 350 to 500\u00a0m. To the south, as part of the Lahn valley, the hilly Limburg Basin abuts the Upper Westerwald.\nThe High Westerwald is an undulating and basalt-rich tableland decked with woodlands, making for a highly moderated microclimate, especially against extreme warmth. It ranges from roughly 450 to 657\u00a0m in height. Here is found the Fuchskaute, the highest peak.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the region vastly qualifies as oceanic (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\"), while higher altitudes experience a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Dfb\"). \nIn the lowlands of the \"Unterwesterwald\" (Lower Westerwald), summers tend to be warm to hot. Erratic convective downpours are not uncommon, yet mostly brief. Winters are mild and see a lot of precipitation, which mostly falls as rain. Snowfall occurs multiple times a year, but usually melts within hours. Thermophilic fruits like figs and peaches are hardy in this area. \nThe mountainous areas of the \"Oberwesterwald\" (Upper Westerwald) and \"Hoher Westerwald\" (High Westerwald) feature a much colder climate and are more prone to extreme weather, such as extreme wind gusts during extratropical cyclones. Summer days are pleasantly warm and rarely become hot due to a cool breeze, while winters are cold and rich in snow. The area is home to a number of ski areas.\nPlaces.\nDistrict seats in the Westerwald are: Altenkirchen (Altenkirchen district), Montabaur (Westerwaldkreis) and Neuwied (Neuwied district). Furthermore, the Lahn-Dill-Kreis, the Mayen-Koblenz district, the Rhein-Lahn-Kreis and the Limburg-Weilburg district each have shares of the Westerwald. If Sieg is taken as the Westerwald's northernmost limit, then the Rhein-Sieg district likewise belongs here, at least in parts (for example the Siebengebirge and the communities of Eitorf and Windeck).\nTransport connections.\nThe Westerwald and its outer edges are crossed by stretches of 8, 42, 49, 54, 62, 255, 256, 277, 413 and 414, over which there are connections to the Autobahnen A\u00a03 (Cologne\u2013Frankfurt), A\u00a045 (Dortmund\u2013Aschaffenburg) and A\u00a048.\nThe most notable railway is the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line with minor stops at Montabaur and Limburg an der Lahn.\nThe High Westerwald is served by Siegerland Airport for private use and special touristic charters, south of Burbach.\nGeology.\nGeologically, the Westerwald is part of the Rhenish Massif, and likewise represents a heavily eroded remnant of a great Variscan mountain system which in the Mesozoic characterized a great deal of Europe.\nThe Devonian bedrock is covered by volcanic masses from the Tertiary, particularly basalt and tuffs. Economically important, besides slate, limestone and clay quarrying, were, and still are, iron and its processing industry between Rheintal (Unkel, Linz) and the lower Wied, pumice gravel in the Neuwied Basin, various mineral springs and, once, brown coal mining.\nThe whole Westerwald region lay under a tropically warm arm of the sea in the Palaeozoic (600 to 270 million years ago). This sea deposited layers of sediments many kilometres thick into the Variscan geosyncline, which were heavily folded in the orogeny that followed. The towns of Siegen and Koblenz on the Westerwald's north and southwest edges even gave two Lower Devonian layers, with their colourful slates, their names. The upper mountain layers are formed of volcanic strata made of basalt containing tuffs.\nIn a few areas, slate and clay have long been quarried, the latter notably in the so-called Kannenb\u00e4ckerland, but also in a few other places where the clay is worked into the salt-glazed grey Westerwald Pottery with cobalt blue decoration. The pottery industry is centred on H\u00f6hr-Grenzhausen. Exports, particularly to Italy, are also important (more than one million metric tons each year). In the mid 16th century, potters from Raeren in Belgium migrated into the Westerwald, bringing with them some of their moulds. This type of pottery was taken to the New World and was found in the early Chesapeake settlements. Today one finds not only highly crafted moulded vases and mugs but also a range of handcrafted utility ware, with hand-painted swirling floral motifs.\nIn the eastern Westerwald (the part lying in Hesse) are found interesting limestone deposits from the most varied of geological times. Erdbach limestone from the Lower Carboniferous gave one small time period the name \"Erdbachian\".\nNear Breitscheid are found the remnants of an atoll from the subtropical Devonian sea that was here 380,000,000 years ago. Parts of this limestone formation are worked in open-pit mining; near Enspel, a \"fossil conservation area\" has been instituted, in which institutes from several colleges conduct research and excursions. A few karst caves are of interest to spelaeology and bring about the temporary disappearance and reappearance of the Erdbach.\nMountains.\nThe Westerwald's highest mountain is the Fuchskaute in the High Westerwald, meaning \"fox hollow\". Many peaks and crests exceed the 600-metre level. Sorted by elevation above sea level, these are some of the Westerwald's highest elevations:\nWaterways.\nFlowing waters.\nThe following are the Westerwald's rivers and streams:\nStanding waters.\n\"Weiher\" is a German word meaning \"pond\".\nHistory.\nEarly times.\nThrough prehistoric finds it can be determined that the Celts settled in the Westerwald and were using the iron ore deposits in the so-called Hallstatt times (Iron Age, roughly 750 to 500 BC). In all likelihood they came into the area from the Hunsr\u00fcck. From La T\u00e8ne times come the Celtic ringwall-girded defensive and sheltering castles which may be found on, among other peaks, the Malberg. Already by La T\u00e8ne times, Germanic peoples were thrusting in from the east and from the Sieg valley. They came about 380 BC into the Upper Westerwald, bypassing the High Westerwald, seeing it as nothing more than a trackless wooded wilderness, after which they eventually came up against the Rhine in the 2nd century.\nRoman times.\nEven in the time when the Celts found themselves having to avoid the Germanic invaders by moving to the west, the Romans were also pushing in from the Rhine's left bank to the southwest. However, the Romans only managed to seize a strip of land on the Rhine's right bank and the so-called Rhine-Westerwald; the Westerwald itself lay outside the Roman-occupied area, for the Romans preferred to maintain a little-settled, most likely pathless wilderness as their border.\nChatti times.\nThe Westerwald's permanent settlement and thereby its territorial history began with the Chatti (Hessians) pushing their way into the area after the Romans were driven out in the 3rd century. Placename endings such as \" \u2013ar, \u2013mar \"and\" \u2013aha\" (\"Haigraha\" = Haiger) stemming from the Migration Period (\"V\u00f6lkerwanderung\") can still be found now. These lie around the forest's outer edges in basins and dales whose soils and climate were favourable to early settlers, and include, for instance, Hadamar, Lahr and Wetzlar. From the 4th to the 6th century, the settlements from the time of the taking of the land arose in formerly pathless areas, taking endings such as \"\u2013ingen\" and \"\u2013heim\", like Bellingen and Bladernheim; these lie on the broad, raised plains in the Upper Westerwald.\nFrankish times.\nThe Franks built their old settlements on the edge of the Westerwald in the central areas of their districts, to build up slowly and permanently strongholds in the interior. There arose places with names ending in \"\u2013rode, \u2013scheid, \u2013hahn, \u2013berg, \u2013tal\" and \"\u2013seifen\". Once clearing settlements had been established and logging for iron ore smelting was under way, the widespread destruction of the forest began. Between the 6th and 9th centuries came settlement expansion from the old settlements towards the edges, a process still witnessed in placename endings such as \"\u2013hausen, \u2013hofen, \u2013kirch, \u2013burg\" or \"\u2013tal\".\nMiddle Ages.\nThe last settlement period in the Westerwald began in the 10th century and ended about 1300. Through Carolingian policy and therefore the Trier and Cologne mission, this area underwent Christianization. Trier advanced up the Lahn, Cologne to the Rhine and Sieg. Trier-Lorrainian and Lower Rhine influences were nevertheless brought into the Westerwald. Among the witnesses to the art of building at that time is the monastery church at Limburg-Dietkirchen, in its oldest parts.\nAfter many changes in ownership between the Ottonian and Salian noble families, it was in the end the Counts of Sayn, Diez and Wied who managed to take hold of extensive landholdings. Particular importance was achieved by the Counts of Laurenburg, who later called themselves the Counts of Nassau. In the east, the Landgraves of Hesse put it about that they could beat the Archbishopric of Mainz on the battlefield. Moreover, the Counts of Wied, the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein and the Electorate of Trier were all prominent landlords.\nModern times.\nPolitical relations were simplified until the 16th century. Among the four greater powers' spheres of influence (Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Hesse), the House of Nassau managed to expand and strengthen its hold on its territory on the Dill between Siegen and Nassau. After the Napoleonic upheavals, Nassau had to share broad swathes of the Westerwald with the newly minted power Prussia. A sovereign Duchy of Nassau existed until it was annexed by Prussia in 1866.\nNowadays, the Westerwald is shared among three German federal states: Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate.\nWesterwaldlied.\nThe Westerwald is also internationally known in songs, above all in folksongs, and particularly the \"Westerwaldlied\" (\"Westerwald Song\"), as well as \"Westerwald-Marsch\" (\"Westerwald March\"), \"Westerwald, du bist so sch\u00f6n\" (\"Westerwald, you are so lovely\"), the \"Neues Westerwaldlied\" (\"New Westerwald Song\") by songwriter Ulrik Remy, \"Ich bin aus 'm Westerwald\" (\"I am from the Westerwald\") and \"Das sch\u00f6nste M\u00e4dchen vom Westerwald\" (\"The Loveliest Girl from the Westerwald\") by Karl-Eberhard Hain and J\u00fcrgen Hardeck, made well known by De H\u00f6hner, Die Schr\u00f6ders and other groups.\nThe \"Westerwaldlied\" is also sung by the Chilean Armed Forces and is known as \"Himno de la Secci\u00f3n\". It is also the inspiration for the South Korean military song, \"Our Nation Forever\". In recent years it has become somewhat controversial in Germany due to its origins during the National Socialist era, with the German military ceasing performances of it in 2017.\nOther.\nThe standard German term for a Westerwald dweller is \"Westerw\u00e4lder\" (; plural: same), but they are also popularly known as \"Basaltk\u00f6pp\" (\u201cBasalt Heads\u201d), as they are said to be thickheaded, and they live in a basalt-rich region. \"W\u00e4ller\" is another vernacular name for them.\nOne of the 12 best-rated hiking trails in Germany is the Westerwaldsteig. The Westerwaldsteig crosses the Westerwald from east (Herborn) to west (Rhine).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 28,303. Its county seat and largest city is Starke.\nHistory.\nNew River County, as it was known at the time, was created in 1858 from segments of Columbia and Alachua counties. It was renamed Bradford County in 1861 in honor of Confederate Captain Richard Bradford, who fought in the American Civil War and was killed in the Battle of Santa Rosa Island, becoming the first officer from Florida to die during the Civil War.\nDuring the county's early history, Lake Butler served as the county seat. However, the growth of Starke as an important city on the Fernandina to Cedar Key railroad led to an 1875 vote on the location of the county seat, with Starke winning by 46 votes. A successful legal challenge brought the county seat back to Lake Butler, and an 1885 referendum reaffirmed the move by 19 votes.\nYet another referendum was held in 1887, and saw the courthouse and county seat moved back to Starke, where it would remain. The dispute brought on the attention of the Florida Legislature, and in 1921, the western portion of Bradford County and Lake Butler were separated to form Union County.\nThe county was home to numerous citrus farms in its early days prior to the Great Freeze in the winter of 1894\u20131895. Even after the freeze, Starke and Lawtey continued to be major regional agricultural producers, with the primary exports being cotton, tobacco, and strawberries.\nSignificant growth would come to the county during the World War II era, with the construction of U.S. Route 301 and nearby Camp Blanding.\nPost-war, the county saw the construction of Florida State Prison on the Bradford-Union County line in Raiford, along with several moments in the national media spotlight. Ted Bundy was executed at the prison in 1989, while Starke and Bradford County faced a series lawsuits in the 2000s over a cross on the city's water tower and a Ten Commandments statue in front of the county courthouse.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.2%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in Florida by land area and second-smallest by total area.\nTransportation.\nBradford County does not have any interstate connections; the nearest connection is with I-75 to the west of the county.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBradford County's main railroad line is the CSX Wildwood Subdivision. Along this line within Starke, Wannee Junction serves as the northeastern terminus of the CSX Brooker Subdivision. One notable major rail trail is the Palatka-Lake Butler State Trail, which used to be the main line for the Georgia Southern and Florida Railway.\nThe county shares Keystone Heights Airport with neighboring Clay County. The nearest regional airport is Gainesville Regional Airport, and the nearest international airport is Jacksonville International Airport.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 28,303 people, 9,318 households, and 5,882 families residing in the county.\nAt the 2000 census there were 26,088 people, 8,497 households, and 6,194 families in the county.

It is on the Atlantic coast of eastern Central Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 606,612, making it the 10th-most populated county in Florida. The official county seat is located in Titusville. A secondary center of county administration, including a circuit courthouse, was built in 1989 in the planned community of Viera, Florida, the geographic center of the county.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe first Paleoindians arrived in the area near Brevard county between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. \nBefore the arrival of non-indigenous settlers in the 16th century, the area was inhabited by Native Americans. The county is the site of the Windover Archeological Site, which contained evidence of habitation over 7,000 years ago. Brevard County was established in 1855 and is named after Theodore Washington Brevard, an early Florida settler and state comptroller. The county's boundaries were changed and reduced numerous times, resulting in the current boundary since 1907.\nThe Paleoindians were semi-nomadic people who lived in smaller groups. After a few thousand years, a new group of settlers appeared known as \"the archaic people.\" These people were primarily fishermen, as opposed to the hunting and gathering way of life which characterized the Paleoindians. The Windover Archeological Site, discovered in 1982, was found during excavation to have the largest collection of human remains and artifacts of the early Archaic Period (6,000\u20135,000 BC), or more than 8,000 years ago. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. The Windover pond, which would have been a woody marsh at the time, was used by the Archaic Floridians as a burial ground, with the bodies being wrapped in fabric and submerged in the peaty soil. The pond was used for interments for around a thousand years (circa 8,000\u20137,000 BC).\nThe Ais and the Jaega were the dominant tribes in the area when it is thought that Ponce De Leon landed on the shores near Melbourne Beach in 1513. There were about 10,000 of these natives in the area. Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s gave an early account of the Ais people in 1570 when he was shipwrecked off of Cape Canaveral. He faced hostile natives but through the use of a bluff was able to escape from them and get back to St. Augustine. In 1605, Alvero Mexia was dispatched from St. Augustine to the Indian River area on a diplomatic mission to the Ais Indian Nation. He helped establish a \"Period of Friendship\" with the Ais Caciques(Chiefs) and made a color map of the area.\nDuring the 19th century, the state of Florida frequently changed the names and borders of counties. St. Lucie County was split off from Mosquito County in 1844. St. Lucie County was renamed Brevard County in 1855 after Theodore Washington Brevard, who served as Florida Comptroller from 1854 to 1860. This \"Brevard County\" contained very little of present-day Brevard County. Most of present-day Brevard north of Melbourne was part of either Volusia or Orange counties. Brevard County in 1856 extended as far west as Polk County and as far south as coastal Dade County. Complicating the discussion of Brevard County in the 19th century is that the boundaries have shifted such that the southernmost parts of present-day Brevard, were originally the northernmost parts. The original county seat was located at Susannah, an early name for present day Fort Pierce. Later the southern part of Brevard split off to form a new county, St. Lucie County in 1905. Gradually, the borders of Brevard County were shifted northward while the county got \"pinched\" eastward. The portions of Brevard County in present-day Broward and Palm Beach counties were given to Dade County, western areas of the county were given to Polk and Osceola County, and parts of Volusia and Orange Counties were given to Brevard including the eventual county seat of Titusville. Later, the southern portion of the county was cut off to form St. Lucie County, which in turn spawned Martin and Indian River County.\nThe first concerted development the area occurred with the extension of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad into the area. The railroad reached Titusville in 1886 and Melbourne in 1894. With the railroad came increased settlement and the first tourists. The first major land boom began in the 1920s after the end of World War I. People flooded into the state of Florida, both tourists from northern winters and new full-time residents, and land prices soared. The Great Depression temporarily stopped growth in Florida. Before the start of World War II, the largest industries in Brevard were commercial fishing, citrus, and tourism.\nBeginning in the 1930s, Harry T. Moore was a civil rights leader, teacher, and founder of the Brevard County NAACP. After the war he became president of the state NAACP. After the Supreme Court had ruled in 1944 that white primaries were unconstitutional, he conducted voter registration drives and succeeded in registering 31% of black voters in Florida, a higher percentage than in any other southern state. The white establishment resisted, firing both him and his wife Harriette in 1946 from their teaching positions. On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded under their home, fatally injuring both of them. Four separate investigations were conducted, including the first by the FBI in 1951\u20131952, and the last in 2005 by the state. No one was ever prosecuted.\nIn 1940, the United States federal government built Naval Air Station Banana River. Patrick Air Force Base was renamed to Patrick Space Force Base on December 9, 2020, as part of the establishment of the U.S. Space Force. This military installation was the first of major federal investment in projects to aid the development of Brevard County. In the late 1950s, the government opened the Long Range Proving Ground. This later became the Kennedy Space Center. The establishment of the Kennedy Space Center, originally known as Launch Operations Center, significantly impacted the area's identity and prominence, it attracted more educated workers and scientists associated with the program. In 1962, NASA acquired more than 200 square miles (518 square km) of land on Merritt Island to facilitate the recently announced lunar program of operations. The preceding year, U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy had pledged to get the first American astronaut on the Moon by 1970. The Launch Operations Center name was changed to honor President Kennedy following his assassination in 1963. Work immediately began on a new launch complex\u2014Launch Complex 39. In addition, the Vehicle Assembly Building, for the construction of spacecrafts, was built by 1966. The first launch from the new facility was the Saturn V rocket launch of the Apollo 4 mission on November 9, 1967. Twelve more Saturn V launches followed, including the historic Apollo 11 mission in 1969 that landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. The final Saturn V launch, in 1973, carried the Skylab space station to orbit. The launch complex was then adapted for the space shuttle program, and each shuttle, from 1981 until the final mission in 2011, launched from this complex [Britannica]. Beginning in the 1960s, new bridges were constructed across the waterways designed as high-rise steel, designed to be high enough to allow passage of boats underneath.\nBrevard County is known as the Space Coast due to the influence of the John F. Kennedy Space Center and the aerospace industry on its economy. As such, it was designated with the telephone area code 321, as in \"3, 2, 1 liftoff\". The county has several incorporated cities and towns, primarily along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and is mostly suburban west of Interstate 95. Brevard County comprises the Cities of Palm Bay\u2013Melbourne\u2013Titusville, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nAttributed to the length of the county, people in the southern portion of the county complained about being so distant from the county seat. The county seat of Titusville was from Palm Bay. Palm Bay is the largest city in Brevard County and the second largest in Central Florida, by population. The county decided to build a new county administration complex at Viera near the geographical center of the county. This complex was started in 1989 and completed in 1994. Residents in the north threatened secession. Their proposal to form a new county, to be called Playalinda, had some momentum in the early 90s. The county made a few concessions to the people in the northern part of the county, and agreed not to officially move the county seat. Since construction of the new center, Viera has been for all intents and purposes the de facto seat of Brevard County.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (34.8%) is water. Most of the water is the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Johns River and the Indian River Lagoon. The county is larger in area than the nation of Samoa and nearly the same size, and population, as Cape Verde.\nLocated halfway between Jacksonville and Miami, Brevard County extends from north to south, and averages wide. Emphasizing the position halfway down Florida are two state roads that have been numbered at the midpoint of Florida's numbering system, State Road 50 and State Road 500. Marshes in the western part of this county, together with those in neighboring Indian River country, are the source of the St. Johns River, which becomes navigable within the county.\nThe Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway along the eastern edge of Brevard County is the major waterway route in Brevard County. It includes the Indian River. Additional waterways include Lake Washington, Lake Poinsett, Lake Winder, Sawgrass Lake, the St. Johns River, and the Banana River. Dredging for the Intracoastal created 41 spoil islands in the Brevard portion of the Indian River.\nBrevard County is the sole county in the Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Palm Bay, Melbourne, and Titusville are designated as principal cities in the MSA. The MSA was created as the Melbourne-Titusville-Cocoa, Florida Standard MSA in 1972, renamed the Melbourne-Titusville-Palm Bay, Florida MSA in 1983, and given its current title in 2003.\nThe county is unofficially divided into three sections: North County, comprising Titusville, Mims and Port St. John; Central Brevard, which includes Cocoa, Rockledge, Merritt Island, and Cocoa Beach; and South County, which includes Melbourne, Palm Bay, Grant-Valkaria, and the South Beaches. There are also several beaches along the coast of the county. The North Reach includes of coastline from Cape Canaveral, through Cocoa Beach, to Patrick Space Force Base. The Patrick Space Force Base beach is long. South of Patrick SFB, the Mid Reach includes the of coastline in Satellite Beach. The South Reach includes of beach in the communities of Indialantic and Melbourne Beach. At the southern end of the county, the South Beaches are the final of beach south of Melbourne Beach to Sebastian.\nThe United States Board on Geographic Names considered two proposals in 2012 to officially name the barrier island extending from Port Canaveral to Sebastian Inlet. The island includes the cities of Cape Canaveral, Cocoa Beach, Indialantic, Melbourne Beach, Patrick Space Force Base, Indian Harbour Beach, and Satellite Beach. The American Indian Association of Florida submitted in October 2011 a proposal to name the island after the Ais people. In January 2012 the United Third Bridge and the Florida Puerto Rican/Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne submitted a proposal to name the island Ponce de Le\u00f3n Island, after Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. In December 2012, the island was ultimately not named.\nCommunities.\nBrevard County has 16 municipalities. The largest by population is Palm Bay and the smallest is Melbourne Village.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMetropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe United States Office of Management and Budget has designated Brevard County as the Palm Bay\u2013Melbourne\u2013Titusville, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. The United States Census Bureau ranked the Palm Bay\u2013Melbourne\u2013Titusville, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 90th most populous metropolitan statistical area and the 96th most populous primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.\nClimate.\nThe county has a K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Cfa, with a year-round distribution of rainfall. This means a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild winters. There are distinct wet and dry seasons. The dry lasts from December through May, the wet from June through November. During the dry season, periods of drought often occur, and can lead to a persistent and high wild land fire threat. In numerous instances these fires have caused property damage. Several fires in 2008 forced the evacuation of Bayside High School, in the town of Palm Bay. In that particular event, 162 homes were damaged.\nJanuary is the coldest month, with an average low of and an average high . The warmest months are July and August with average highs of and average lows of . The driest month is April with of rainfall; the wettest is September, with . Offshore ocean temperatures have averaged: January \u2013 , February \u2013 , March \u2013 and April \u2013 . In federal maps printed before 2012, nearly half of Brevard was classified as prone to flooding. Most of this was in the relatively undeveloped low-lying areas, west of Interstate 95, on the banks of the St. Johns River. About 18,900 homes out of 164,000 single-family homes were in that area.\nEnvironment.\nBrevard County works together with the federal and state government to control pollution and preserve wetlands and coastal areas through lands dedicated to conservation and wildlife protection. There are of federally protected wildlife refuges. These lands include Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, the Canaveral National Seashore, the St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge, the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, several conservation areas managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District, Brevard County's Environmentally Endangered Lands Program Sanctuaries, and lands dedicated by the State as conservation areas. The underlying limestone in the county is relatively young at 150,000 years old. This means that the ground will not develop the sinkholes that are prevalent in the spine of Florida, where limestone is from 15 to 25 million years old.\nFauna.\nThere are 4,000 species of animals locally. Common mammals include North American river otters, bobcats, white-tailed deer, raccoons, marsh rabbits, scrub lizards, rat snakes, and opossum. Feral pigs, introduced by Europeans, present an occasional traffic hazard. There are an estimated 3,500 endangered gopher tortoises in the county.\nThere were 1,677 manatees in Brevard County in 2015, out of a total of 6,063 in the state. This was an increase from 2014 when there was a total of 612 in Brevard County. Manatees experience numerous threats within Brevard, where 312 died in the first half of 2021. Bottlenose dolphin are commonly seen in the Intracoastal Waterway. Fish and reptiles include alligators, red snapper, sea turtles, North Atlantic right whales, a rare protected species, give birth near the coast of Brevard, among other places, from November 15 to April 15.\nThe venomous brown recluse spider is not native to the area but has found the environment congenial. The Florida Butterfly Monitoring Network has counted species of butterflies monthly for a year since 2007. In 2010, it counted 45 species. Included are zebra swallowtail butterflies. Lovebug season occurs twice annually in May and August\u2013September. Motorists encounter swarms of these while driving during a four-week period. Deer flies are particularly noticeable from April through June.\nAvian.\nLocal bird counts indicate that there are at least 163 species of birds in the county. Turkey vultures, a migrating species, are protected by federal law. They migrate north in the summer and return in September. The county's most common winter bird is the lesser scaup, a diving duck. In 2008, half a million were counted. In 2010, 15,000 were estimated. Other birds include the red-shouldered hawk, the loggerhead shrike, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, Cooper's hawks, pileated woodpeckers, Savannah sparrows, rails (which also includes coots), Florida scrub jays (an endangered species), wood storks, grackles, great horned owls, northern mockingbirds, brown thrashers, catbirds, green-winged teals, greater yellowlegs, western sandpipers, least sandpipers, dowitchers, and American white pelicans. Peak migration in the fall is from the last week in September through the first week in October. Fall migration tends to be stronger than spring because birds typically take different flyways.\nFlora.\nNative trees include cabbage palm (the state tree of Florida), fringetree, coral bean, sweet acacia, geiger tree, firebush, beautyberry, coral honeysuckle, and blanket flower. Other native plants include sea grape, red mulberry, purslane, dandelion, Spanish bayonet, blackberry, Jerusalem artichoke, dogwood, and gallberry. On the east coast of the state, mangroves have normally dominated the coast from Cocoa Beach southward. Northward these may compete with salt marshes moving in from the north, depending on the annual weather conditions. Live oak trees, various grasses, and juniper plants were sufficiently common to generate pollen noticeable by some people in February 2011.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 606,612\u00a0people, 236,005\u00a0households, and 148,934\u00a0families residing in the county.

{"id": "72009", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72009", "title": "Civil union", "text": "Legal union similar to marriage\nA civil union (also known as a civil partnership) is a legally recognized arrangement similar to marriage, primarily intended to provide legal recognition for same-sex couples. Civil unions grant some or all of the rights of marriage, with child adoption being a common exception.\nCivil unions have been established by law in several mostly developed countries in order to provide legal recognition of relationships formed by same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, tax breaks, and responsibilities. In 1989, Denmark was the first country to legalise civil unions; however, most other developed democracies did not begin establishing them until the 1990s and early 2000s. In Brazil, civil unions were first created for opposite-sex couples in 2002, and then expanded to include same-sex couples in 2011. In the majority of countries that established same-sex civil unions, they have since been either supplemented or replaced by same-sex marriage. Civil unions are viewed by LGBT rights campaigners as a \"first step\" towards establishing same-sex marriage, as civil unions are viewed by supporters of LGBT rights as a \"separate but equal\" status.\nMany jurisdictions with civil unions recognize foreign unions if those are essentially equivalent to their own; for example, the United Kingdom lists equivalent unions in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 Schedule 20. The marriages of same-sex couples performed abroad may be recognized as civil unions in jurisdictions that only have the latter.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOverview and terminology.\nThe terms used to designate civil unions are not standardised and vary widely from country to country. Government-sanctioned relationships that may be similar or equivalent to civil unions include civil partnerships, registered partnerships, domestic partnerships, significant relationships, reciprocal beneficiary relationships, common-law marriage, adult interdependent relationships, life partnerships, stable unions, civil solidarity pacts, and so on. The exact level of rights, benefits, obligations, and responsibilities also varies, depending on the laws of a particular country. Some jurisdictions allow same-sex couples to adopt, while others forbid them to do so, or allow adoption only in specified circumstances.\nIn the United States, the term \"civil union\" was introduced in the state of Vermont in 2000 to connote a status equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples; it was chosen by the state's legislators in preference to phrases such as \"domestic partner relationship\" or \"civil accord\".\n\"Domestic partnership\", offered by some states, counties, cities, and employers since as early as 1985, has generally connoted a lesser status with fewer benefits. However, the legislatures of the West Coast states of California, Oregon and Washington have preferred the term \"domestic partnership\" for enactments similar or equivalent to civil union laws in East Coast states.\nCivil unions are not seen as a replacement for marriage by many in the LGBT community. \"Marriage in the United States is a civil union; a civil union, as it has come to be called, is not marriage\", said Evan Wolfson of Freedom to Marry. \"It is a proposed hypothetical legal mechanism, since it doesn't exist in most places, to give some of the protections but also withhold something precious from gay people. There's no good reason to do that.\" However, some opponents of same-sex marriage claim that civil unions rob marriage of its unique status; Randy Thomasson, executive director of the Campaign for California Families, calls civil unions \"homosexual marriage by another name\" and contends that civil unions provide same-sex couples \"all the rights of marriage available under state law\". The California Supreme Court, in the In Re Marriage Cases decision, noted nine differences in state law.\nCivil unions are commonly criticised as being 'separate but equal'; critics such as former New Zealand MP and feminist Marilyn Waring note that same-sex couples remain excluded from the right to marry and are forced to use a separate institution. Supporters of same-sex marriage contend that treating same-sex couples differently from other couples under the law allows for inferior treatment and that if civil unions were the same as marriage there would be no reason for two separate laws. A New Jersey commission which reviewed the state's civil union law reported that the law \"invites and encourages unequal treatment of same-sex couples and their children\". Some have suggested that creating civil unions which are open to opposite-sex couples would avoid the accusations of apartheid.\nProponents of civil unions say that they provide practical equality for same-sex couples and solve the problems over areas such as hospital visitation rights and transfer of property caused by lack of legal recognition. Proponents also say that creating civil unions is a more pragmatic way to ensure that same-sex couples have legal rights as it avoids the more controversial issues surrounding marriage and the claim that the term has a religious source.\nMany supporters of same-sex marriage state that the word 'marriage' matters and that the term 'civil union' (and its equivalents) do not convey the emotional meaning or bring the respect that comes with marriage. Former US Solicitor General and attorney in the \"Perry v. Schwarzenegger\" case Theodore Olsen said that recognizing same-sex couples under the term 'domestic partnership' stigmatizes gay people's relationships, treating them as if they were \"something akin to a commercial venture, not a loving union\". Many also contend that the fact that civil unions are often not understood can cause difficulty for same-sex couples in emergency situations.\nList of jurisdictions recognizing same-sex unions but not same-sex marriage.\nAs of June 12, 2025, the states that provide civil unions but not marriage for same-sex couples are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nIn Israel, no national domestic authority performs same-sex marriage, though couples may marry abroad. In addition, same-sex couples may be considered to have a common-law marriage, which affords \"most\" of the rights of marriage.\nList of jurisdictions recognizing same-sex unions.\nThe following is a list of countries and other jurisdictions which have established civil unions for same-sex couples or opposite-sex couples, categorized by continent, with the year in which the law establishing civil unions in the listed country or other jurisdiction came into effect in brackets:\nAmericas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEurope.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOceania.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCountries with former civil unions.\nSeveral countries used to offer civil unions only for same-sex couples. The laws that allowed civil unions were repealed when same-sex marriage was legalized. The following is a list of countries and other jurisdictions that used to offer civil unions for same-sex couples with the years in which they were available in brackets:\nCase studies.\nArgentina.\nSince 2003, the Argentine province of R\u00edo Negro and the city of Buenos Aires allow domestic partnerships. The City of Villa Carlos Paz (C\u00f3rdoba) allowed it from 2007. Since 2009, the city of R\u00edo Cuarto (C\u00f3rdoba) allows Civil Unions.\nAustralia.\nAll levels of Australian Governments under nearly all Australian statutes do recognise same-sex couples as de facto couples as unregistered co-habitation or de facto status since 2009. From 1 July 2009 Centrelink recognised same-sex couples equally regarding social security \u2013 under the common-law marriage, de facto status or unregistered cohabitation.\nRegistered relationship recognition in state Governments:\nRegistered relationship recognition in 5 local government areas within Australia:\nBrazil.\nCohabitation grants 112 benefits as family entities in Brazil since 2002. It is known as when both parts are legally authorized to marry, and as when at least one party is legally prohibited from doing so. Cohabitation grants all rights marriage confers, with the exception of automatic opt-in for one of four systems of property share married couples have access to, and automatic right to inheritance. Potential confusion might arise regarding terminology, given how when Brazilian Portuguese refers to the term , it tends to be short for , or civil marriage.\nCouples that have at least one child registered as a descendant of both parties might also have access to or rights.\nSame-sex stable cohabitation in Brazil is legally recognized nationwide since May 5, 2011. Brazil's Supreme Court voted 10\u20130 with one abstention to allow same-sex couples the same legal rights as married couples, following pointed recognition of such relationships that dates as far back as 2004. The ruling gave same-sex couples in such relationships the same financial and social rights enjoyed by those in mixed-sex ones.\nA union between two women and one man was reported in August 2012, though its legality was doubted.\nCanada.\nIn Canada:\nwere extended to same-sex couples before the enactment of the federal \"Civil Marriage Act\" which legalized same-sex marriage in Canada nationally.\nThe 1994 proposed Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act in Ontario was a notable early attempt to introduce a status similar to civil unions. It was supported by the provincial government but was defeated in the legislature.\nSome provinces and territories amended their family law to extend statutory benefits to same-sex couples that were equivalent to those granted to unmarried cohabiting opposite-sex couples without establishing a specific name for the partnership. For example, Ontario was required to amend its family law legislation in 1999 in response to the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in \"M v H\".\nColombia.\nIn 2007, Colombia came close to passing a law granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, but the bill failed on final passage in one house of the national legislature. However, a court decision in October 2007 extended social security and health insurance rights to same-sex couples. On January 29, 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled that cohabitating same-sex couples must be given all rights offered to unmarried heterosexual couples, making Colombia the first Latin American country to fully grant this right to all its citizens. Couples can claim these rights after living together for two years. Colombia has since approved same-sex marriage.\nCosta Rica.\nThe Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica passed a bill in early July 2013 that \"confers social rights and benefits of a civil union, free from discrimination\", language inserted by lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Villalta Florez-Estrada of the Broad Front party. After the bill passed, several media outlets reported that conservative lawmakers realized the bill's implications for same-sex unions and urged President Laura Chinchilla, who is set to face Villalta in the 2014 presidential election, to use her veto power to stop the bill from becoming law. Chinchilla, who has suggested the courts should determine the legality of same-sex unions in Costa Rica, refused and signed the bill into law on 4 July. A gay couple has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica asking that their union be recognized under the new law. Gay rights activists reacting to the law said it needs to survive a constitutional challenge in court. Some constitutional lawyers stated that same-sex couples will \"still lack legal capacity\" to formalize their unions, despite passage of the bill.\nEcuador.\nThe 2008 Constitution of Ecuador enacted civil unions between two people without regard to gender, giving same-sex couples the same rights as legally married heterosexual couples except for the right to adopt.\nEurope.\nIn Europe:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAustria.\nIn 2018, Minister of Justice Josef Moser announced that both marriage and registered partnership would be open to homosexuals and heterosexuals. This occurred because Helga Ratzenb\u00f6ck and Martin Seydl have been appealing for years in court for a registered civil partnership in Austria. At the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg they attempted to sue Austria for discrimination against their sexuality, because they were a heterosexual couple and were excluded from the benefits of registered partnership, but this failed. Only when the Constitutional Court of Austria opened up marriage to homosexuals in December 2018 registered partnerships also become possible for heterosexuals. After 35 years of living together, the two entered into a registered partnership in 2019.\nDenmark.\nCivil unions were introduced in Denmark by law on 7 June 1989, the world's first such law, and came into effect on 1 October 1989. On 7 June 2012, the law was replaced by a new same-sex marriage law, which came into effect on 15 June 2012.\nRegistered partnership was by civil ceremony only, but the Church of Denmark allowed priests to perform blessings of same-sex couples, as it stated that the church blesses people, not institutions. The new law makes same-sex marriages in churches possible, but allows vicars to decline marriages of same-sex couples in their church.\nOn 17 March 2009, the Folketing introduced a bill that gave same-sex couples in registered partnerships the right to adopt jointly. This bill was approved on 4 May 2010 and took effect on 1 July 2010.\nEstonia.\nRegistered partnerships that provide some of the rights, benefits, and obligations of marriage have been available to same-sex couples since 1 January 2016.\nFrance.\nThe French law providing benefits to same-sex couples also applies to opposite-sex couples who choose this form of partnership over marriage. Known as the \"Pacte civil de solidarit\u00e9\" (PACS), it is more easily dissolved than the divorce process applying to marriage. Tax benefits accrue immediately (only from 2007 on), while immigration benefits accrue only after the contract has been in effect for one year. The partners are required to have a common address, making it difficult for foreigners to use this law as a means to a residence permit, and difficult for French citizens to gain the right to live with a foreign partner\u00a0\u2013 especially since the contract does not automatically give immigration rights, as marriage does.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the number of marriages decreased while the number of PACS strongly increased. In 2010, there were 3 PACS for every 4 marriages celebrated in France. Especially amongst heterosexual couples PACS is very popular, with 96 out of 100 PACS couples being heterosexual in the year 2019.\nGermany.\nCivil unions in Germany began in 2001.\nIn 2017, registered life partnership was replaced with marriage, with any couple regardless of sex allowed to marry.\nGreece.\nGreek parliament voted in favor of a Cohabitation Pact (Greek: \u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) giving almost the same rights as marriage to couples regardless of their sex. The draft was approved in the relevant Greek parliament committee and during voting on 22 December 2015, the law was passed with 194 positive votes (out of 300).\nHungary.\nCivil unions in Hungary began in 2009.\nIceland.\nIceland does not have a comprehensive legal act on civil unions (). Instead, various laws deal with civil unions and their meaning. When Iceland legalised same-sex marriages in 2010, the Act on Registered Partnerships (87/1996) was abolished. Registered partnerships () had been the principal legal unions for same-sex partners since the law was passed in 1996.\nIreland.\nIn 2010, the lower house of the Irish Parliament D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann passed the bill on Civil Partnerships unanimously. This bill allows civil partnerships of same-sex couples, and establishes an extensive package of rights, obligations and protections for same-sex couples who register as civil partners. The bill passed all stages of in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and came into effect on 1 January 2011. The first partnership between two men was registered on 7 February 2011.\nSame-sex marriage has been legal in Ireland since 2015 following a referendum.\nItaly.\nLegal recognition of same-sex civil unions in Italy began in 2016.I\nLiechtenstein.\nCivil unions in Liechtenstein began in 2011.\nMonaco.\nCivil unions in Monaco began in 2020.\nMontenegro.\nCivil unions in Montenegro began in 2020.\nNetherlands.\nIn 2001, the Netherlands passed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry, in addition to its 1998 \"registered partnership\" law (civil union) for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.\nPoland.\nIn 2003, Senator Maria Szyszkowska proposed a bill which would legalize same-sex civil unions in Poland. The project was approved by the Senate but was never voted upon by the Sejm, as W\u0142odzimierz Cimoszewicz (then the Marshal of the Sejm) did not bring it for the deliberation.\nIn 2008, when asked about same-sex civil unions, First Cabinet of Donald Tusk spokeswoman Agnieszka Liszka answered: \"Council of Ministers did not and would not take care of that matter.\"\nOn January 25, 2013, Sejm voted upon three separate bills regarding same-sex civil unions in Poland: by the centre-left Democratic Left Alliance, liberal Palikot's Movement and centre-right Civic Platform. The first bill had 283 against, 137 for, 30 abstaining. The second had 276 against, 150 for, 23 abstaining. The third had 228 against, 211 for, 10 abstaining. All three were rejected, mainly with the votes of centre-right, right-wing and conservative parties: Polish People's Party, Law and Justice and United Poland. A majority of deputies from the ruling centre-right Civic Platform also voted against the first two bills. The Roman Catholic Church in Poland, Polish Orthodox Church and Polish Muslims opposed all three bills.\nIn March 2013, Prime Minister Donald Tusk officially stated that a new project of civil unions bill would be presented to the parliament \"in two months time\" (in May 2013), but as of April\u00a02014[ [update]] no such initiatives took place.\nIn a 2013 opinion poll conducted by CBOS, 68% of Poles were against gays and lesbians publicly showing their way of life, 65% of Poles were against same-sex civil unions, 72% were against same-sex marriage and 88% were against adoption by same-sex couples.\nIn December 2014, the Sejm refused to deal with a civil partnership bill proposed by Your Movement, with 235 MPs voting against debating the bill, and 185 MPs voting for.\nIn May 2015, the Sejm again refused to deal with the topic, with 215 MPs voting against and only 146 for. The Prime Minister, Ewa Kopacz, said that civil partnerships are an issue for the next parliament to deal with.\nSan Marino.\nSan Marino has recognized civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples since December 2018.\nSlovenia.\nSlovenia recognized same-sex partnerships since 2006.\nSwitzerland.\nThe Canton of Geneva has a law on the cantonal level, the Partenariat cantonal (the Cantonal Domestic Partnership), since 2001. It grants unmarried couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, many of the rights, responsibilities and protections that married couples have. However, it does not allow benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums (unlike the federal law). Geneva was the first Canton to recognise same-sex couples through this law.\nOn September 22, 2002, voters in the Swiss canton of Zurich voted to extend a number of marriage rights to same-sex partners, including tax, inheritance, and social security benefits. The law is limited to same-sex couples, and both partners must have lived in the canton for six months and formally commit to running a household together and supporting and aiding each another.\nOn November 12, 2003, the Constituent assembly of the Canton of Fribourg granted Registered Partnership as a constitutional right under the Article 14.\nOn January 27, 2004, the Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel voted for a law on the cantonal level, the Partenariat enregistr\u00e9 (the Cantonal Registered Partnership). It grants unmarried couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, the same rights as married couple for cantonal matters such as responsibilities and protections, benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums.\nOn June 5, 2005, voters extended this right to the whole of Switzerland through a federal referendum. This was the first time that the civil union laws were affirmed in a nationwide referendum in any country. The Federal Domestic Partnership Law, reserved for same-sex couples, came into force on January 1, 2007. It grants the same rights as marriage, but full joint adoption rights, facilitated naturalization and medically assisted procreation are explicitly forbidden for same-sex domestic partners.\nIn 2017, the Federal Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga addressed the issue that civil union is not open yet for heterosexual couples, in collaboration with experts at the University of Bern. In Geneva and Neuch\u00e2tel a type of civil union called cantonal PACS is available to opposite-sex and same-sex couples. The cantonal PACS effects are limited to cantonal law. The cantonal PACS, however, has no impact on civil status and inheritance, which are regulated by federal law.\nOn September 26, 2021, the people of Switzerland approved on national referendum the initiative \"Marriage for all\", which would grant marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples. This initiative would be made effective on July 1, 2022.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 2003, the British government announced plans to introduce civil partnerships which would allow same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities resulting from marriage. The Civil Partnership Bill was introduced into the House of Lords on 30 March 2004. After considering amendments made by the House of Commons, it was passed by the House of Lords, its final legislative step, on 17 November 2004, and received royal assent on 18 November. The Act came into force on 5 December 2005, and same-sex, but not opposite-sex, couples were able to form the civil partnerships from 19 December 2005 in Northern Ireland, 20 December 2005 in Scotland and 21 December 2005 in England and Wales. Separate provisions were included in the first Finance Act 2005 to allow regulations to be made to amend tax laws to give the same tax advantages and disadvantages to couples in civil partnerships as apply to married couples. At that time, the Church of England, the state church in England, permitted clergy to enter into same-sex civil partnerships.\nAside from the manner in which couples register and the non-use of the word \"marriage\", civil partnerships grant most of the same legal rights as marriage and generally operate under the same constrictions (one difference being that marriage requires dissolution by divorce while a civil union does not). It is not legal to be in both a civil partnership and a marriage at the same time. Nevertheless, some of those in favour of legal same-sex marriage object that civil partnerships do not grant full equality.\nBoth same-sex marriages and civil unions of other nations will be automatically considered civil partnerships under UK law providing they came within Section 20 of the Act. This means, in some cases, non-Britons from nations with civil unions will have greater rights in the UK than in their native countries. For example, a Vermont civil union would have legal standing in the UK; however, in cases where one partner was American and the other British, the Vermont civil union would not provide the Briton with right of abode in Vermont (or any other US state or territory), whereas it would provide the American with right of abode in the UK.\nIn September 2011, the succeeding coalition government announced its intention to legalise same-sex marriage in England and Wales by 2015 at the latest. The future status of civil partnerships is unclear. The Scottish Government, which has devolved responsibility for such legislation, held a consultation concerning both civil and religious same sex marriage in the autumn of 2011. Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in July 2013 and came into force on 13 March 2014, and the first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014. The first same-sex marriages in Scotland took place in December 2014.\nIn June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples was discriminatory. In response, the Prime Minister announced in October 2018 that civil partnerships would be opened to heterosexual couples. In autumn 2018 Theresa May announced that she would open up the \"Civil Partnership\" to heterosexual couples in England. As of 31st December 2019 it is possible for both same-sex and heterosexual couples to enter into a civil partnership in England.\nMexico.\nOn 9 November 2006, Mexico City's unicameral Legislative Assembly passed and approved (43\u201317) a bill legalizing same-sex civil unions, under the name \"Ley de Sociedades de Convivencia\" (Law for Co-existence Partnerships), which became effective on 16 March 2007. The law gives property and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. On 11 January 2007, the northern state of Coahuila, which borders Texas, passed a similar bill (20\u201313), under the name \"Pacto Civil de Solidaridad\" (Civil Pact of Solidarity). Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila, the state protects their rights no matter where they live in the country. Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo, Coahuila. Civil unions have been proposed in at least six states since 2006.\nIn Colima, governor Mario Anguiano Moreno has agreed to discuss the legalization of civil unions and adoption by same-sex couples. In Jalisco, local congress approved on 31 October 2013 the Free Coexistence Act, which allows the performance of civil unions in the state.\nNew Zealand.\nOn 9 December 2004 the New Zealand Parliament passed the Civil Union Bill, establishing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The debate over Civil Unions was highly divisive in New Zealand, inspiring great public emotion both for and against the passing. A companion bill, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was passed shortly thereafter to remove discriminatory provisions on the basis of relationship status from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a de facto partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to immigration, next-of-kin status, social welfare, matrimonial property and other areas.\nThe Civil Union Act 2004 came into effect on 26 April 2005 with the first unions able to occur from Friday 29 April 2005.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, a \"civil union\" is either a marriage or a civil partnership, although the term \"civil union\" is commonly used when \"civil partnership\" is meant. Same-sex and opposite-sex couples may register their unions either as marriages or as civil partnerships. This was achieved through the Civil Union Act, 2006. In laws where \"marriage\" is mentioned, its definition now retroactively includes civil partnerships.\nUnited States.\nThe first civil unions in the United States were offered by the state of Vermont in 2000. The federal government does not recognize these unions. By the end of 2006, Connecticut and New Jersey had also enacted civil union laws; New Hampshire followed in 2007. Furthermore, California's domestic partnership law had been expanded to the point that it became practically a civil union law as well. The same might be said for domestic partnership in the District of Columbia, domestic partnership in Washington, and domestic partnership in Oregon.\nJurisdictions in the U.S. that offer civil unions or domestic partnerships granting nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples include:\nStates in the U.S. with domestic partnerships or similar status granting some of the rights of marriage include:\nSince October 2014, all states that provide for civil unions, domestic partnerships, or similar arrangements between same-sex partners also allow same-sex partners to legally wed.\nArizona.\nIn 2013, Bisbee became the first city in Arizona to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. After its passage, the state's Attorney General, Tom Horne, threatened to challenge the law in court, arguing that it violated the state's constitution. However, the Attorney General agreed to withdraw the challenge after Bisbee amended the law, and the civil union ordinance was approved.\nFollowing Bisbee, also in 2013, Tucson became the second municipality to legalize civil unions. Jerome followed in the same year. Also in 2013, Clarkdale and Cottonwood were the next cities in the Verde Valley to pass civil unions. A measure to allow civil unions failed in Camp Verde by a split 3\u20133 vote in the city council making it the only city in the Verde Valley to not have passed the bill.\nSedona passed civil unions in September 2013. The city of Tempe considered legal advice about a civil union ordinance, but it did not pass a bill. After the legalization of same-sex marriage in Arizona, civil unions may continue to be registered in the cities that had legalized the ordinances.\nCalifornia.\nIn California, where domestic partnership (DP) has been available to same-sex and certain opposite-sex couples since 2000, a wholesale revision of the law in 2005 made it substantially equivalent to marriage at the state level. In 2007, the Legislature took a further step when it required same-sex DP couples to file state income taxes jointly. (Couples must continue to file federal taxes as individuals.) In the May 2008 \"In re Marriage Cases\" decision, the state supreme court noted nine differences between Domestic Partnerships and same-sex marriage in state law, including a cohabitation requirement for domestic partners, access to CalPERS long-term care insurance (but not CalPERS in general), and the lack of an equivalent to California's \"confidential marriage\" institution. The cohabitation requirement was dropped on January 1, 2012, and a \"confidential option\" for domestic partners became available the same day.\nColorado.\nA bill to establish civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples passed both chambers of the Colorado legislature and was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper. Civil unions began on May 1, 2013.\nConnecticut.\nIn 2005, the Connecticut General Assembly passed a bill to adopt civil unions in Connecticut. Connecticut's civil unions were identical to marriage and provided all of the same rights and responsibilities except for the title. Connecticut was the first state in the U.S. to voluntarily pass a same-sex civil unions law through the legislature without any immediate court intervention. The law was repealed on October 1, 2010, and replaced with a law making marriage gender-neutral.\nDelaware.\nDelaware Governor Jack Markell signed a civil union bill on May 12, 2011, that establishes civil unions in the state effective January 1, 2012. The law was repealed on July 1, 2014, and replaced with a law making marriage gender-neutral.\nDistrict of Columbia.\nSame-sex marriage in the District of Columbia was legalized on December 18, 2009. Marriage licenses became available on March 3, 2010, and marriages began on March 9, 2010. Legislation on domestic partnerships in the District of Columbia was first passed in 1992, implemented in 2002, and expanded over time up to 2009.\nHawaii.\nHawaii legalized civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples on January 1, 2012. Same-sex marriage became legal on December 2, 2013.\nIllinois.\nOn December 1, 2010, the Illinois state senate passed SB1716\u00a0\u2013 the \"Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act\"\u00a0\u2013 in a 32\u201324\u20131 vote, just one day after the Illinois House of Representatives did the same in a 61\u201352\u20132 vote. On January 31, 2011, Illinois state Governor Pat Quinn signed SB1716 into law, establishing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The new law came into effect on June 1, 2011. The provision allowing opposite-sex couples to establish a civil union effectively doubles as a tool for widowed seniors to keep survivor's benefits from a marriage while gaining marital rights at the state level with another partner.\nMaine.\nMaine legalized domestic partnership for same-sex and opposite-sex couples in 2004. Maine's domestic partnership registry only provides limited rights, most of which are aimed at protecting couples' security in emergency situations.\nNew Hampshire.\nOn April 26, 2007, the New Hampshire General Court (state legislature) passed a civil union bill, and Governor John Lynch signed the bill into law on May 31, 2007. At the time, New Hampshire was \"... the first state to embrace same-sex unions without a court order or the threat of one\". The New Hampshire civil union legislation became effective on January 1, 2008. The law was replaced by the same-sex marriage law on January 1, 2010.\nNew Jersey.\nOn October 25, 2006, the Supreme Court of New Jersey gave New Jersey lawmakers 180 days to rewrite the state's marriage laws, either including same-sex couples or creating a new system of civil unions for them. On December 14 the Legislature passed a bill establishing civil unions in New Jersey, which was signed into law by Governor Jon Corzine on December 21, 2006. The first civil unions took place on February 19, 2007.\nThere are differences between civil unions and domestic partnerships. In 2004, the state of New Jersey enacted a domestic partnership law, the Domestic Partnership Act, offering certain limited rights and benefits to same-sex and different-sex couples. In 2006, however, after the state Supreme Court's ruling in \"Lewis vs. Harris\" that same-sex couples must be extended all the rights and benefits of marriage, the Legislature passed a civil unions law, the Civil Union Act, effective in 2007, which was an attempt to satisfy the court's ruling.\nNevada.\nOn May 31, 2009, the Nevada legislature overrode Governor Jim Gibbons' veto of a domestic partnership bill. The bill allows registered domestic partners, whether they are a same-sex or opposite-sex couple, to have most of the state level rights and responsibilities afforded to married couples. It does not require any other entity to provide rights or benefits afforded to married individuals. This has left the partnership bill ineffective compared to those of other states. The law took effect on 1 October 2009.\nOregon.\nSince 4 February 2008, Oregon offers domestic partnerships which grant nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples.\nRhode Island.\nCivil unions were permitted in Rhode Island since July 1, 2011 until July 1, 2013.\nVermont.\nThe civil unions law that was passed in the Vermont General Assembly in 2000 was a response to the Vermont Supreme Court ruling in \"Baker v. Vermont\", requiring that the state grant same-sex couples the same rights and privileges accorded to married couples under the law.\nA Vermont civil union is nearly identical to a legal marriage, as far as the rights and responsibilities for which state law, not federal law, is responsible are concerned. It grants partners next-of-kin rights and other protections that heterosexual married couples also receive. However, despite the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the United States Constitution, civil unions are generally not recognized outside Vermont in the absence of specific legislation. Opponents of the law have supported the Defense of Marriage Act and the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment in order to prevent obligatory recognition of same-sex couples in other jurisdictions. This means that many of the advantages of marriage, which fall in the federal jurisdiction (over 1,100 federal laws, such as joint federal income tax returns, visas and work permits for the foreign partner of a U.S. citizen, etc.), are not extended to the partners of a Vermont civil union.\nRegarding voluntary recognition of the civil union in other jurisdictions, New York City's Domestic Partnership Law, passed in 2002, recognizes civil unions formalized in other jurisdictions. Germany's international civil law (EGBGB) also accords to Vermont civil unions the same benefits and responsibilities that apply in Vermont, as long as they do not exceed the standard accorded by German law to a German civil union. The law was replaced by the same-sex marriage law on September 1, 2009.\nWashington.\nWashington offers domestic partnerships which grant nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples. Washington is the first state to have passed a same-sex civil union bill by a popular vote.\nWashington legalized same-sex marriage early in 2012, which provided that a couple in a civil union would have two years to convert their civil union to a marriage. The law was upheld by popular referendum in November 2012.\nUruguay.\nCivil unions in Uruguay were allowed nationwide from January 2008.\nNational debates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInternational standards.\nTo date, only two countries, Spain and Portugal, have signed onto the Convention on the Recognition of Registered Partnerships, a draft multilateral agreement on the status of civil, unmarried partnerships. The document is inclusive of rights for both same and opposite sex partnerships.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is Florida's second-most populous county after Miami-Dade County and the 17th-most populous in the United States, with 1,944,375 residents as of the 2020 census. Its county seat and most populous city is Fort Lauderdale, which had a population of 182,760 as of 2020. The county is part of the South Florida region of the state.\nBroward County is one of the three counties that make up the Miami metropolitan area, which is home to 6.14 million people as of 2020. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the entire country. As of 2022, Broward County has a gross domestic product of $124.8 billion, the second-largest GDP of Florida's 67 counties and the 25th-largest for the nation's 3,033 counties.\nHistory.\nNative people.\nThe earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 12,000 years ago. The first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with the main villages on the northern banks.\nThe inhabitants at the time of first European contact were the Tequesta people, who controlled much of southeastern Florida, including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern part of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.\nFounding of Broward.\nBroward County was founded on April 30, 1915. It was intended to be named Everglades County, but then-Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Ion Farris amended the bill that established the county to name it in honor of Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, governor of Florida from 1905 to 1909.\nThroughout his term as governor, Broward championed Everglades drainage and was remembered for his campaign to turn the Everglades into \"useful land\". This opened up much of today's urban Broward County for development, first as agricultural land and later as residential. A year before Broward became governor, Dania became the first incorporated community of what is now Broward County, followed by Pompano in 1908, and Fort Lauderdale in 1911.\nIn 1915, Palm Beach and Dade counties contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County.\nBroward County began a huge development boom after its incorporation, with the first \"tourist hotel\", in Fort Lauderdale, opening in 1919. A year later, developers began dredging wetlands in the county to create island communities.\nLand boom and rapid growth.\nBy 1925, the boom was considered to have reached its peak, but the 1926 Miami hurricane caused economic depression in the county. The county saw another population and development boom post-World War II when the transformation from agricultural to urbanized residential area began.\nIn 1967, Coconut Creek was incorporated.\nThe effects of a national recession hit the county in 1974 and the population growth finally slowed. This is from a peak growth percentage change of 297.9% which saw the population of Broward grow from 83,933 as of 1950 to 333,946 in 1960. The population subsequently experienced an 85.7% population growth which brought the population to a total of 620,100 in 1970.\nRecent history.\nThe structure of the Broward County government was signed into law in 1975 with the passage of the Broward County charter. In the same year, the Seminole Tribe of Florida incorporated as a governing entity and began organizing cigarette sales, bingo and land leases that would bring millions of dollars in annual revenue in later years. In 1976, Interstate 95 was completed through Broward County.\nOn January 19, 1977, snow fell in South Florida for the first time in recorded history. Snow was seen across all of South Florida as far south as Homestead and even on Miami Beach. Snow was officially reported by weather observers in West Palm Beach, LaBelle, Hollywood, and Royal Palm Ranger Station in southern Miami-Dade County.\nIn the year 1980, the US census reported over 1 million people living in Broward County.\nOn August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed through Broward County County, causing $100 million in damage in the county and leaving many residents homeless.\nIn the year 2000, the US census reported a total population of 1,623,018. The town of South West Ranches was incorporated this year.\nOn March 1, 2005, West Park became Broward County's 31st municipality to be incorporated.\nOn October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma hit South Florida leaving the entire area damaged and causing almost universal power outages. Wilma was the most damaging storm in Broward County since Hurricane King in 1950. Broward experienced wind speeds between which endured for about five hours.\nOn February 14, 2018, the city of Parkland became the scene of a deadly mass shooting perpetrated by a 19-year-old former student of Stoneman Douglas High School. The trial of the perpetrator of the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, was held at the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida in Broward County in 2022 with Judge Elizabeth Scherer presiding. Cruz was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\nIn June 2020, following the George Floyd protests, some residents called for the county to be renamed due to Governor Broward's support for segregation and the Back-to-Africa movement.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (8.5%) is water.\nBroward County has an average elevation of above sea level. It is rather new geologically and at the eastern edge of the Florida Platform, a carbonate plateau created millions of years ago. Broward County is composed of Oolite limestone while western Broward is composed mostly of Bryozoa. Broward is among the last areas of Florida to be created and populated with fauna and flora, mostly in the Pleistocene.\nOf developable land in Broward County, approximately , the majority is built upon, as the urban area is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Everglades Wildlife Management Area to the west. Within developable land, Broward County has a population density of 3,740 per square mile (1,444 per square kilometer).\nBroward approved the construction of Osborne Reef, an artificial reef made of tires off the Fort Lauderdale beach, but it has proven to be an environmental disaster.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLaw, government, and politics.\nBroward County mayors.\nThe Broward County Charter provides for a separation between the legislative and administrative functions of government. The Board of County Commissioners is the legislative branch of Broward County Government. The County Commission is composed of nine members elected by district. Commissioners must be a resident of the district where they seek election. Each year the Commission elects a mayor and vice mayor. The mayor's functions are primarily ceremonial; serving as presiding officer and as the county's official representative. The Commission appoints the County Administrator, County Attorney and County Auditor. The commission also appoints numerous advisory and regulatory boards.\nThe County Commission meets in formal session the first four Tuesdays of each month at 10:00\u00a0a.m. in Room 422 of the Broward County Governmental Center. Over 507,000 cable subscribers in Broward County have access to Government-access television (GATV) coverage of Commission meetings, which are broadcast live beginning at 10:00\u00a0a.m. each Tuesday, and rebroadcast at 5:30\u00a0p.m. the following Friday. Meetings can also be viewed via webcasting at www.broward.org.\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) has 5,400 employees, and is the largest sheriff's department in Florida. The BSO was founded in 1915. Sheriff Gregory Tony has been the Sheriff heading the agency since 2019, when he replaced Sheriff Scott Israel, who had been Sheriff since 2013.\nPolitics.\nOverview.\nBroward County has been a Democratic stronghold since 1992, voting for the party's presidential nominee in every election since then. It is now considered one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the state, still generally voting for Democrats even in statewide landslide losses, in presidential and gubernatorial elections. \nIt gave greater than 60% support to the Democratic party nominee in every election since 1996 until 2024. In 2024, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won below 60% of the vote in the county for the first time since 1992. It had also given Democrat Charlie Crist less than 60% of the vote in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election.\nFrom 1948 to 1988, the county leaned Republican, voting for the Republican nominee in every election except 1976, even supporting Republican Barry Goldwater by a 56\u201344 margin while he lost the national election in a landslide.\nUnlike Miami-Dade County to the south, where many of the immigrants are Republican-leaning Cuban-Americans, Cubans comprise only a small proportion of the immigrant population in Broward County. The county's population is also over 25% African American, a predominantly Democratic-leaning group.\nVoter registration.\nAccording to the Secretary of State's office, Democrats maintain a plurality among registered voters in Broward County. The county is also one of the few counties in the state where Independents outnumber Republicans.\nOrdinances.\nBroward's code of ordinances consists of resolutions, administrative rules and regulations passed in order to secure a responsive and efficient form of local government.\nThe county maintains a distinctive rule regarding communication between the county and bidders for county contracts, known as the \"Cone of Silence\". This rule prevents staff involved in a purchasing process from communicating with bidders from the time when the solicitation is issued, and County Commissioners from the time when bids are opened, until the vote to award the contract or the time when all bids are rejected.\nEconomy.\nSilver Airways has its headquarters on the property of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in an unincorporated area.\n Other companies with headquarters in unincorporated areas include Locair.\nSpirit Airlines relocated its headquarters to Dania Beach on April 18, 2024. Prior to that, the airline operated out of Miramar for 24 years, since December 1999.\nWhen Chalk's International Airlines existed, its headquarters was on the grounds of the airport in an unincorporated area. When Bimini Island Air existed, its headquarters were in an unincorporated area.\nBy far the largest agricultural sector is nurseries, greenhouses, floricultures, and sod. This supplies ornamental uses in the area.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nBroward County Schools, the sole school district in the county, has the sixth largest school district in the country and the second largest in the state after the Miami-Dade district.\nPublic libraries.\nThe Broward County Library is one of the largest public library systems in the country, comprising 38 branch locations. There are also five municipal public libraries in the county that are not part of the Broward County Library system: Ethel M. Gordon Oakland Park Library, Lighthouse Point Library, Helen B. Hoffman Plantation Library, Richard C. Sullivan Public Library of Wilton Manors, and Parkland Public Library.\nLibrary Resources.\nBroward County libraries provide endless amount of resources to the public. For high-schoolers looking to prepare themselves for college, the library offers college readiness &amp; https://. For adults looking to learn computer skills, https:// are also offered. These resources are free of cost, therefore, all it takes is registering to participate. In addition to the many resources offered at the library, bus passes are also sold at most Broward County libraries. If you want to enjoy some of these resources, you can simply download the app to utilize them on the go. There are nine apps available for download: Broward County Library (BCL WoW), Freegal Music, Hoopla, Overdrive, Libby, Axis 360, RBdigital Magazines, Rosetta Stone, and Brainfuse.\nSites of interest.\nOther areas and attractions.\nAdditionally, with 23 miles of beach, Broward County is a popular destination for scuba diving, snorkeling, and droves of young Spring break tourists from around the world.\nTransportation.\nAirports.\nFort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport serves as the primary airport of the Broward County area. The airport is bounded by the cities Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Dania Beach, southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale and north of Miami. The airport is near cruise line terminals at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has become an intercontinental gateway, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights. FLL is ranked as the 19th busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States, as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway and one of the world's 50 busiest airports. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a \"major hub\" facility serving commercial air traffic. In 2017 the airport processed 32,511,053 passengers (11.3% more than 2016) including 7,183,275 international passengers (18.6% more than 2016).\nStreet grid.\nA street grid stretches throughout Broward County. Most of this grid is loosely based on three primary eastern municipalities, (from South to North) Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, and Pompano Beach. Deerfield Beach\u2014another primary eastern municipality\u2014has its own street grid, as do two smaller municipalities\u2014Dania Beach and Hallandale Beach.\nGreenways System.\nConstruction is underway on a network of recreational trails to connect cities and points of interest in the county.\nCommunities.\nMunicipalities.\nMunicipality populations are based on the 2020 US census using their QuickFacts with 5,000 residents and above, while municipalities under 5,000 people are based on their US Decennial Census.\nFormer unincorporated neighborhoods.\nIn the 1980s, the Broward County Commission adopted a policy of having all populated places in the county be part of a municipality. Municipalities were often reluctant to annex neighborhoods which were not projected to yield enough tax revenue to cover the costs of providing services to those neighborhoods. In 2001 the Broward County Legislative Delegation adopted a policy encouraging the annexation of all unincorporated areas in Broward County into municipalities by October 1, 2005. Formerly unincorporated neighborhoods that have been annexed into existing municipalities or combined to form new municipalities as of 2018[ [update]] include:\nRemaining unincorporated neighborhoods.\nBy late in the first decade of the 21st century, annexation of remaining neighborhoods had stalled. As of 2018[ [update]] the Broward County Municipal Services District serves seven unincorporated neighborhoods, including six census designated places (Boulevard Gardens, Broadview Park, Franklin Park, Hillsboro Pines, Roosevelt Gardens and Washington Park) and a parcel with a population of 72 in 2018, Hillsboro Ranches. Other areas in the developed part of the county that are not in municipalities include the Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, several landfills and resource recovery facilities, and other scattered small parcels with few or no residents.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,648, making it the fifth-least populous county in Florida. Its county seat is Blountstown.\nHistory.\nCalhoun County was created in 1838. It was named for John C. Calhoun, member of the United States Senate from South Carolina and the seventh U.S. vice president, serving under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. The county was originally located between St. Joseph Bay and the Apalachicola River, with the county seat at St. Joseph (which was abandoned by 1844 due to a yellow fever epidemic and hurricanes).\nIn the late 1850s, there was a violent feud between the local Durden family and another anti-Durden group. This feud escalated and there was a breakdown of the law, with roaming gangs and a \"pitched battle\" at the courthouse square in Blountstown. The violence got so bad that the county judge had to call in aid from the Fifth Florida Militia Regiment, which deployed 150 militiamen to breakup the outlaw bands.\nThe relative lawlessness continued during the American Civil War when armed gangs gathered in the country side and avoided conscription by the Confederacy. These groups were in contact with and armed by the Federal blockade and even concocted a plan to kidnap the Confederate Governor Milton. Milton caught word of the plot and avoided capture.\nThe county was later expanded to the north with territory from Jackson and Washington counties. In 1913, part of Calhoun County was transferred to the new Bay County. In 1925, the southern part of Calhoun County was separated as the new Gulf County, which included the territory that had formed the original Calhoun County.\nIn 1930, a federal employee shot the County Sheriff over a dispute of unknown origin.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water.

In 2008 the two counties separated and reverted to providing services to residents and visitors of their own communities. The newest addition to the library system was an expansion to the Englewood Branch; the new building created is an additional 6,500 square feet. This provides more space for the youth services department, a new computer lab, and an archives run by the historical department. The Mid-County Regional Library suffered heavy damage due the impact of Hurricane Ian in 2022. It had to close as a result, but is expected to re-open in 2026.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places (unincorporated).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
