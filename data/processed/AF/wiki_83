LFP mainly produces pornographic magazines, such as \"Hustler\", pornographic videos, and three pornographic television channels named Hustler TV. Flynt fought several high-profile legal battles involving the First Amendment, and unsuccessfully ran for public office. He was paralyzed from the waist down due to injuries sustained in a 1978 attempted assassination by serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin. In 2003, \"Arena\" magazine listed him at No.\u00a01 on the \"50\u00a0Powerful People in Porn\" list. The 1996 biographical drama film \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\", directed by Milo\u0161 Forman and starring Woody Harrelson, chronicles the life and career of Flynt.\nEarly life.\nFlynt was born in Lakeville, Magoffin County, Kentucky, the first of three children of Larry Claxton Flynt Sr. (1919\u20131990), a sharecropper, and Edith (n\u00e9e Arnett; 1925\u20131982), a homemaker. He had two younger siblings: sister Judy (1947\u20131951) and brother Jimmy Ray Flynt (born 1948). His father served in the United States Army in the European theatre of World War II. Due to his father's absence, Flynt was raised solely by his mother and maternal grandmother for the first three years of his life. Flynt was raised in poverty, and said Magoffin County was the poorest county in the nation during the Great Depression. In 1951, Flynt's sister, Judy, died of leukemia at age four. The death provoked his parents' divorce one year later; Flynt was then raised by his mother in Hamlet, Indiana, and his brother, Jimmy, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Magoffin County. Two years later, Flynt returned to live in Magoffin County with his father because he disliked his mother's new boyfriend.\nFlynt attended Salyersville High School (now Magoffin County High School) in the ninth grade. However, he ran away from home and, despite being only 15 years old, joined the United States Army using a counterfeit birth certificate. It was around that time that he developed a passion for the game of poker. After being honorably discharged, Flynt returned to his mother in Indiana and found employment at the Inland Manufacturing Company, an affiliate of General Motors. However, there was a union-led slowdown and he was laid off after only three months. He then returned to his father in Kentucky. For a brief period, he became a bootlegger but stopped when he learned that county deputies were searching for him. After living on his savings for two months, he enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1960. He became a radar operator on . He was the operator on duty when the ship was assigned to recover John Glenn's space capsule. He was honorably discharged in July\u00a01964.\nFirst enterprises.\nIn early 1965, Flynt took $1,800 (approx. $17,000 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation) from his savings and bought his mother's bar in Dayton, Ohio, called the Keewee. He refitted it and was soon making $1,000 a week (approx. $9,300 in 2022); he used the profits to buy two other bars. He worked as many as 20\u00a0hours a day and took amphetamines to stay awake.\nFlynt decided to open a new, higher-class bar, which would also be the first in the area to feature nude hostess dancers; he named it the Hustler Club. From 1968 onward, with the help of his brother Jimmy and later his girlfriend Althea Leasure, he opened Hustler Clubs in Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo, Ohio. Soon each club grossed between $260,000 and $520,000 a year. He also acquired the Dayton franchise of a small newspaper called \"Bachelor's Beat\", which he published for two years before selling it. At the same time, he closed a money-losing vending-machine business.\n\"Hustler\" magazine.\nIn January\u00a01972, Flynt created the \"Hustler Newsletter\", a two-page, black-and-white publication about his clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May\u00a01972, he expanded the \"Hustler Newsletter\" to 16\u00a0pages, then to 32\u00a0pages in August\u00a01973. As a result of the 1973 oil crisis, the American economy entered recession and the revenues of Hustler Clubs declined. Flynt had to refinance his debts or declare bankruptcy. He decided to turn the \"Hustler Newsletter\" into a sexually explicit magazine with national distribution. He paid the start-up costs of the new magazine by deferring payment of sales taxes his clubs owed on their activities.\nIn July\u00a01974, the first issue of \"Hustler\" was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year the magazine became highly lucrative, and Flynt was able to pay his tax debts. Flynt's friend Al Goldstein said that \"Hustler\" took its inspiration from his own tabloid \"Screw\", but credited his comrade-in-arms with accomplishing what he had not: creating a national publication. In November\u00a01974, \"Hustler\" showed the first \"pink-shots\", or photos of open vulvas. Flynt had to fight to publish each issue. Many people, including some at his distribution company, found the magazine too explicit and threatened to remove it from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a paparazzo who had taken pictures of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis while she was sunbathing nude on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 (approx. $98,000 in 2022) and published them in the August 1975 issue. That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few days. (Goldstein's \"Screw\" magazine had previously published nude photos of Onassis in early 1973.) Now a millionaire, Flynt bought a $375,000 (approx. $2 million in 2022) mansion.\nAttempted assassination.\nOn March 6, 1978, during a legal battle related to obscenity in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local attorney, Gene Reeves Jr. were shot on the sidewalk in Lawrenceville by Joseph Paul Franklin. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, and in need of a wheelchair. Reeves Jr. was shot in the arm and side; but fully recovered.\nJoseph Paul Franklin.\nFranklin, a militant white supremacist and serial killer, also shot Vernon Jordan; he targeted other black and Jewish people in a killing spree from 1977 to 1980. Violently opposed to 'miscegenation,' he confessed to the shootings many years later, claiming he was outraged by an interracial photo shoot in \"Hustler\". About Flynt and a \"Hustler\" pictorial, he stated, \"I saw that interracial couple ... having sex ... It just made me sick ... I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.\" Flynt himself suspected the attack was part of a larger conspiracy involving ultra-right elements surrounding U.S. Representative Larry McDonald also behind the Karen Silkwood case with ties to the Intelligence Community and that Franklin may have been subject to MKULTRA-style mind control.\nFranklin was never brought to trial for the attack on Flynt. Franklin was eventually charged in Missouri with eight unrelated counts of murder and sentenced to death. Flynt expressed his opposition to the death penalty and stated he did not want Franklin to be executed. Despite that, Franklin was executed by lethal injection on November 20, 2013.\nPersonal life and death.\nFlynt was married five times; his wives were:\nHe married his fourth wife, Althea, in 1976, and they remained married for eleven years until her death at age\u00a033. Larry reported she had ARC (AIDS-related complex), but drowned in a bathtub in 1987. Toxicology reports were inconclusive. He married his fifth wife, Elizabeth Berrios, in 1998. Flynt had four daughters and a son, as well as many grandchildren. His daughter Lisa Flynt-Fugate died in a car crash in Ohio in October\u00a02014 at age\u00a047.\nHe said he was an evangelical Christian for one year, \"converted\" in 1977 by evangelist Ruth Carter Stapleton, the sister of Jimmy Carter. He said he became \"born again\" and that he had a vision from God while flying with Stapleton in his jet. He continued to publish his magazine, however, vowing to \"hustle for God\". He later declared himself an atheist.\nIn 1994, Flynt bought a Gulfstream II private jet, which was used in the movie \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\". In 2005, he replaced it with a Gulfstream IV. At the time of his death, he resided in the Hollywood Hills.\nFlynt said he had bipolar disorder.\nFlynt died from heart failure in Los Angeles on February 10, 2021, at age\u00a078.\nFlynt's enterprises.\nBy 1970, he ran eight strip clubs throughout Ohio in Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland.\nIn July\u00a01974, Flynt first published \"Hustler\" as a step forward from the \"Hustler Newsletter\", which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August\u00a01975 was a major coup. \"Hustler\" has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash \u2013 though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.\nFlynt created his privately held company Larry Flynt Publications (LFP) in 1976. LFP published several other magazines and also controlled distribution of the various titles. LFP launched \"Ohio Magazine\" in 1977, and later its output included other mainstream work. LFP sold the distribution business, as well as several mainstream magazines, beginning in 1996. LFP started to produce pornographic movies in 1998, through the Hustler Video film studio, which purchased VCA Pictures in 2003. In 2014, Flynt said his print portfolio made up only 10% of his company's revenue, and predicted the demise of \"Hustler\" due to competition from the Internet.\nOn June 22, 2000, Flynt opened the Hustler Casino, a card room located in the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena. Other ventures which were wholly owned or licensed by Flynt or are wholly owned or licensed by LFP, Inc. include the Hustler Clubs and the Hustler Hollywood Store. LFP also publishes \"Barely Legal\", a pornographic magazine featuring young women who reportedly have recently turned 18, the minimum age for a person to appear in pornography in the US.\nLegal battles.\nFlynt was embroiled in many legal battles regarding the regulation of pornography and free speech within the United States, especially attacking the \"Miller v. California\" (1973) obscenity exception to the First Amendment. He was first prosecuted on obscenity and organized crime charges in Cincinnati in 1976 by Simon Leis, who headed a local anti-pornography committee. He was given a sentence of 7\u201325\u00a0years in prison, but served only six days in jail; the sentence was overturned on appeal following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, as well as judicial and jury bias. One argument resulting from this case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981. Flynt made an appearance in a feature film based on the trial, \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" (1996), playing the judge who sentenced him in the case.\nOutraged by a derogatory cartoon published in \"Hustler\" in 1976, Kathy Keeton, then girlfriend of \"Penthouse\" publisher Bob Guccione, filed a libel suit against Flynt in Ohio. Her lawsuit was dismissed because she had missed the deadline under the statute of limitations. She then filed a new lawsuit in New Hampshire, where \"Hustler\"'s sales were very small. The question of whether she could sue there reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, with Flynt losing the case. This case is occasionally reviewed today in first-year law school Civil Procedure courses, due to its implications regarding personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\nDuring the proceedings in \"Keeton v. Hustler Magazine\", Flynt shouted \"Fuck this court!\" and called the justices \"nine assholes and one token cunt\" (referring to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor). Chief Justice Warren E. Burger had him arrested for contempt of court, but the charge was later dismissed.\nAlso in 1983, he leaked an FBI surveillance tape to the media regarding John DeLorean. In the videos, when arresting DeLorean, the FBI is shown asking him whether he would rather defend himself or have \"his daughter's head smashed in\". During the subsequent trial, Flynt wore a U.S. flag as a diaper and was jailed for six months for desecration of the flag.\nIn 1988, Flynt won a Supreme Court decision, \"Hustler Magazine v. Falwell\", after being sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an offensive ad parody in \"Hustler\" that suggested that Falwell's first sexual encounter was with his mother in an outhouse. Falwell sued Flynt, citing \"emotional distress\" caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" based on parodies. After Falwell's death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, \"I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.\"\nAs a result of a sting operation in April\u00a01998, Flynt was charged with a number of obscenity-related offenses concerning the sale of sex videos to a youth in a Cincinnati adult store he owned. In a plea agreement in 1999, LFP, Inc. (Flynt's corporate holdings group) pleaded guilty to two counts of pandering obscenity and agreed to stop selling adult videos in Cincinnati.\nIn June\u00a02003, prosecutors in Hamilton County, Ohio, attempted to revive criminal charges of pandering obscene material against Flynt and his brother Jimmy Flynt, charging that they had violated the 1999 agreement. Flynt said that he no longer had an interest in the Hustler Shops and that prosecutors had no basis for the lawsuit.\nIn January\u00a02009, Flynt filed suit against two nephews, Jimmy Flynt\u00a0II and Dustin Flynt, for the use of his family name in producing pornography. He regarded their pornography to be inferior. He prevailed on the main trademark infringement issue, but lost on invasion of privacy claims.\nIn May 2021, VICE News published and reported on a copy of Flynt's 322-page FBI file, which the outlet obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It contained details of his 1983 arrest for disrupting the U.S. Supreme Court during the \"Keeton\" hearing and the unconfirmed claim of a confidential informant that Flynt had asked mercenary Mitchell WerBell III to rig his wheelchair with C-4 explosives so he could blow himself up during that same hearing, taking all of the justices with him.\nPolitics.\nFlynt was a Democrat when Bill Clinton was president. In 2013, he said he was \"a civil libertarian to the core\", though he once attempted a presidential run as a Republican in 1984. He was a staunch critic of the Warren Commission and offered $1\u00a0million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the assassin of John F. Kennedy. In 2003, Flynt was a candidate in the recall election of California governor Gray Davis, calling himself a \"smut peddler who cares\". He finished seventh in a field of 135\u00a0candidates with 17,458\u00a0votes (0.2%).\nFlynt repeatedly weighed in on public debates by trying to expose conservative or Republican politicians with sexual scandals. He did so during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton in 1998, offering $1\u00a0million for evidence and publishing the results in \"The Flynt Report\". These publications led to the resignation of incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston. In 2007, Flynt repeated his $1\u00a0million offer and also wrote the foreword to Joseph Minton Amann and Tom Breuer's \"The Brotherhood of Disappearing Pants: A field guide to conservative sex scandals\", which contained some cases published by Flynt.\nIn 2003, Flynt purchased nude photographs of former PFC Jessica Lynch, who was captured by Iraqi forces, rescued from an Iraqi hospital by U.S. troops and celebrated as a hero by the media. He said he would never show any of the photographs, calling Lynch a \"good kid\" who became \"a pawn for the government\". Flynt supported activist groups opposed to the war in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. He was a strong supporter of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage.\nIn 2012, Flynt offered a $1\u00a0million reward for information on Mitt Romney's unreleased tax returns and ran two full-page ads in \"USA Today\" and \"The Washington Post\" to promote the offer.\nFlynt endorsed Mark Sanford in the 2013 special election for South Carolina's 1st congressional district, saying \"His open embrace of his mistress in the name of love, breaking his sacred marriage vows, was an act of bravery that has drawn my support.\"\nIn January 2015, following the attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\", Flynt criticized the American media for refusing to broadcast the caricatures of Mohammed from the satirical weekly.\nIn May\u00a02015, Flynt endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In an interview with \"Marfa Journal\" later that year, he described his political views as \"progressively liberal\".\nIn October\u00a02017, Flynt offered a $10\u00a0million reward for any evidence that would lead to the impeachment of President Donald Trump. A 2019 Christmas card from Larry Flynt Publications, sent to several Republican congressmen, depicted Trump's assassination.\nAllegations of incest, misogyny, and racism.\nFlynt's daughter, Tonya Flynt-Vega, accused him of sexually abusing her as a child.16 In the 1998 book, \"Hustled: My Journey from Fear to Faith\", Flynt-Vega writes about her father showing her images from \"Hustler\" and while he did so, he began touching her, had her remove her bathing suit, assaulted her orally, then showed her his erection and tried to penetrate her. She writes, \"The pain was intense. I know I was hurt. Dad had not penetrated [me].\" She described an exchange with her father after he knew she planned to publish a book describing his abuses of her: \"He called me at work one day and said 'If you don't back-off that book, I'll send somebody to wring your [expletive] neck.' ... He's 'Mr.\u00a0Free Speech', but he's threatening to kill somebody for writing a book.\"67 Flynt denied his daughter's accusation of sexual abuse on several occasions, but he did acknowledge he had not been a good parent to Flynt-Vega. \"She's looking for attention, and she's looking to get back at me, as her father, for not being there when she really needed me,\" he said in one response. In another interview, he stated, \"Anyone who knows me knows my sexual preference. It's not children, especially my own.\"\n\"Hustler\" cartoonist and humor editor Dwaine B. Tinsley created the comic feature called \"Chester the Molester\". It was a monthly part of the magazine for 13\u00a0years. In the comic, the main character endeavors through various means to molest and otherwise sexually assault girls and women. In 1989, Tinsley was arrested, charged with molesting his daughter from age\u00a013\u201318. Tinsley was convicted of that charge on January 5, 1990. His conviction was overturned in 1992 when an appeals court ruled that the jury should not have seen cartoons drawn by Tinsley. The prosecutor in the case ultimately decided not to retry Tinsley, who served 23 months of a six-year sentence. Flynt claims he did not ask Tinsley about the conviction and \"Chester the Molester\" cartoons drawn while in prison continued to appear in \"Hustler\". He also defended Tinsley, calling him \"a genius\" and \"at one time in America in the Seventies and Eighties the most brilliant and recognized cartoonist in America.\"\nIn addition to child molestation, the rape of adult women is a common theme in many of his magazines, including \"Hustler\". A photo pictorial titled \"The Naked and the Dead\", depicted an imprisoned woman being forcibly shaved, sexually assaulted, raped, and electrocuted. In the January\u00a01983 issue of \"Hustler\", there was a photographic pictorial called \"Dirty pool\". It depicted a woman on a pool table being sexually assaulted and gang raped by four men. In early March\u00a01983, 21\u00a0year-old Cheryl Araujo was gang raped on a pool table by four men in New Bedford. At the time, some coverage took on xenophobic overtones, blaming the crime not only on the victim but on the Portuguese community as a whole. Flynt created a fake postcard featuring a naked woman on a pool table with the caption, \"Greetings from New Bedford, Massachusetts, the Portuguese gang-rape capital of America.\"\nCriticizing the sanitizing scope of the 1996 film \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\", feminist Gloria Steinem detailed his depictions of misogyny: \"What's left out [of the film] are the magazine's images of women being beaten, tortured, and raped; women subject to degradations from bestiality to sexual slavery.\" Steinem also addressed what she saw as the hypocrisy of him being regarded as a protector of everyone's free speech, noting \"other feminists and I have been attacked in \"Hustler\" for using our First Amendment rights to protest pornography.\" The film's director, Milo\u0161 Forman, a native of the former Czechoslovakia, rebutted these and similar feminist critiques, stating that if he had used such extreme pornographic content, he would not have been able to make the film, which was rated \"R\". Forman, whose parents were victims of the Nazis, said he made the movie \"out of admiration for the beauty and wisdom of the American Constitution, which allows this country to rise to its best when provoked by the worst\". Others also viewed the film as historical revisionism, portraying a heroic Flynt. \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted the \"magazine's racist and anti-Semitic overtones \u2013 one \"Hustler\" cartoon showed a black man reaching for a watermelon on a giant mousetrap \u2013 is also nowhere to be found.\" His daughter Tonya also spoke out against the film.\nIn real life, Flynt did not shy away from rationalizing his publication of taboo content and humor, claiming that his goal was to \"offend every single person in this world at some point\", and pointing out that \"If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me then it will protect all of you, because I'm the worst.\" He defended himself against allegations of misogyny, stating that he supported abortion rights, same-sex marriage and equality, while at the same time offering harsh assessments of his feminist critics and embracing the magazine's crude, sometimes bigoted depictions.\nFeminist author Laura Kipnis compared Flynt to the ribald, French Renaissance satirist Rabelais, saying that she saw \"Hustler\" \"as really dedicated to violating the proprieties that uphold class distinctions\", and calling it \"one of the most class-antagonistic publications in the country\".\nOther.\nFlynt appears in the music video \"Afraid\" by the American rock band M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce which first aired on June 9, 1997.\nIn January 2019, Flynt discussed the importance of freedom and voting in America when he was interviewed by \"Weekly Alibi\"'s August March.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70760", "revid": "415269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70760", "title": "Union Jack", "text": "Flag of the United Kingdom\nThe Union Jack or Union Flag is the national flag of the United Kingdom.\nThe flag consists of the red cross of Saint George (the patron saint of England), edged in white, superimposed on the red saltire of Saint Patrick (the patron saint of Ireland), also edged in white, superimposed on the saltire of Saint Andrew (the patron saint of Scotland). Wales is not represented in the flag by Wales's patron saint, Saint David, because the flag was designed while Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.\nThe origins of the flag date to the earlier flag of Great Britain which was established in 1606 by a proclamation of King James VI and I of Scotland and England. The present design was established by an Order in Council following the Act of Union 1800, which joined the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It was unchanged following the secession of the Irish Free State in 1922.\nIt is sometimes asserted that the term \"Union Jack\" properly refers only to naval usage, but this assertion was dismissed by the Flag Institute in 2013 after historical investigations.\nThe flags of British Overseas Territories, as well as certain sovereign states and regions (particularly in the Commonwealth) that were previously British possessions, incorporate the Union Jack into their own flag designs or have official flags that are derived from the Union Jack. Many of these flags are blue or red ensigns with the Union Jack in the canton and defaced with the distinguishing arms of the territory. The governors of British Overseas Territories and the Australian states also have personal standards that incorporate the Union Jack in their design. In Australia, the 'right or privilege' of a person to fly the Union Jack is protected under Australian statute law. The flag continues to have official status in Canada, by parliamentary resolution, where it is also known as the Royal Union Flag.\nTerminology.\n Evolution of the Union flag\nThe terms \"Union Jack\" and \"Union Flag\" are both used historically for describing the national flag of the United Kingdom.\nInitially, the flag was termed the 'British flag' or 'flag of Britain', and the term 'Union' first appeared in 1625. The etymology of \"jack\" in the context of flagstaffs reaches back to Middle German. The suffix \"-kin\" was used in Middle Dutch and Middle German as a diminutive. Examples occur in both Chaucer and Langland though the form is unknown in Old English. \"John\" is a common male forename (going back to the Bible), appearing in Dutch as \"Jan\". Both languages use it as a generic form for a man in general. The two were combined in the Middle Dutch , whence Middle French and Middle English . \"Jack\" came to be used to identify all manner of particularly small objects or small versions of larger ones. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has definition III.21 \"Something insignificant, or smaller than the normal size\" and gives examples from 1530 to 2014 of this usage. Further examples in the compounds section at 2b illustrate this. The original maritime flag use of \"jack\" was \"A ship's flag of a smaller size than the ensign, used at sea as a signal, or as an identifying device\". The jack was flown in the bows or from the head of the spritsail mast to indicate the vessel's nationality: \"You are alsoe for this present service to keepe in yor Jack at yor Boultspritt end and yor Pendant and yor Ordinance\" The Union Flag when instantiated as a small jack became known as the \"Union Jack\" and this later term transferred to more general usage of the Union Flag.\nAlso later a short flagpole was placed in the bows of a ship to fly the jack, this became known as the \"jackstaff\".\nAccording to the Flag Institute, a membership-run vexillological charity, \"the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack.\" The institute has also stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. In 1908, a government minister stated, in response to a parliamentary question, that \"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\". Notwithstanding Their Lordships' circular of 1902, by 1913 the Admiralty described the \"Union Flag\" and added in a footnote that \"A Jack is a Flag to be flown only on the 'Jack' Staff\".\nHowever, the authoritative \"A Complete Guide to Heraldry\" published in 1909 by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies uses the term \"Union Jack\".\nThe term \"Union Flag\" is used in King Charles I's 1634 proclamation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... none of Our Subjects, of any of Our Nations and Kingdoms shall from henceforth presume to carry the Union Flag in the Main top, or other part of any of their Ships (that is) St Georges cross and St Andrew's Cross joined together upon pain of Our high displeasure, but that the same Union Flag be still reserved as an ornament proper for Our own Ships and Ships in our immediate Service and Pay, and none other.\u2014\u200a and in King George III's proclamation of 1 January 1801 concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And that the Union Flag shall be Azure, the Crosses Saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick Quarterly per Saltire, counterchanged Argent and Gules; the latter fimbriated of the Second, surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the Third, fimbriated as the Saltire : ...\u2014\u200a\nWhen the first flag representing Britain was introduced on the proclamation of King James I in 1606, it became known simply as the \"British flag\" or the \"flag of Britain\". The royal proclamation gave no distinctive name to the new flag. At the funeral of King James in 1625 the flag was called the \"Banner of the Union of the two Crosses of England and Scotland\". The word \"jack\" was in use before 1600 to describe the maritime bow flag. By 1627 a small Union Jack was commonly flown in this position. One theory goes that for some years it would have been called simply the \"Jack\", or \"Jack flag\", or the \"King's Jack\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \"His Majesty's Jack\", it was commonly called the \"Union Jack\", and this was officially acknowledged.\nA proclamation issued by King George III at the time of the Union of 1801 concerned flags at sea and repeatedly referred to \"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships. Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \"the Union Flag\".\nThe size and power of the Royal Navy internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \"Union Jack\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and colonies, it is possible that the term \"jack\" occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jackstaff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The name may alternatively come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.\nWinston Churchill, British Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945, referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack. In March 1899, Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called \"The Anglo-Saxon Review\". The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately facetious, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, \"Your title 'The Anglo Saxon' with its motto 'Blood is thicker than water' only needs the Union Jack &amp; the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's cheap Imperialist productions.\"\nMore recently, Reed's \"Nautical Almanac\" (1990 edition) unambiguously stated: \"The Union Flag, frequently but incorrectly referred to as the Union Jack, ...\" and later: \"8. The Jack \u2013 A small flag worn on a jackstaff on the stem of Naval Vessels. The Royal Navy wears the Union Flag ... This is the only occasion when it correct to describe the flag as the Union Jack\". However, this assertion does not appear in any Reed's \"Nautical Almanac\" since 1993. In the 2016 Reed's \"Nautical Almanac\", the only entry where this might appear, section 5.21, covering Flag Etiquette, does not include this statement. Within the \"Almanac\", neither the Union Flag nor the Union Jack are included pictorially or mentioned by name.\nFor comparison with another anglophone country with a large navy, \"jack of the United States\" specifically refers to the flag flown from the jackstaff of a warship, auxiliary or other U.S. governmental entity.\nThe \"Butcher's Apron\" is a pejorative term for the flag, common amongst Irish republicans, citing the blood-streaked appearance of the flag and referring to atrocities committed in Ireland and other countries under British colonial rule. In 2006, Sandra White, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, caused a furore when the term was used in a press release under her name. It was later blamed on the actions of a researcher, who resigned yet claimed that the comment had been approved by White. The Irish folk band the Wolfe Tones has a song entitled \"The Butcher's Apron\" which makes reference to the term.\nIn the Chinese language, the flag has the nickname \"Rice-Character Flag\" (; Mandarin Pinyin: , Cantonese Jyutping: ) because the pattern looks similar to the Chinese character for \"rice\" ().\nDesign.\nThe current flag's design has been in use since 1801. Its original blazon, as decreed by George III of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1801, reads: \nthe Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].\nSpecification.\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but is 1:2 for most purposes. In 2008, MP Andrew Rosindell proposed a Ten Minute Rule bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Jack are sized as follows:\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's \"height\" whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2. \"Height\" here is the distance from top to bottom which in vexillology is termed width or breadth.\nRatios.\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century. In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.\nAlthough the most common ratio is 1:2, other ratios exist. The Royal Navy's flag code book, BR20 \"Flags of All Nations\", states that both 1:2 and 3:5 versions are official. In the 3:5 version, the innermost points of the lower left and upper right diagonals of the St Patrick's cross are cut off or truncated. The Garter King of Arms also suggests a ratio of 3:5 as the suitable proportion for a Union Flag flown on land. The war flag used by the British Army has the proportions 3:5.\nThe King's Harbour Master's flag, similar to the Pilot Jack, is a 1:2 flag that contains a white-bordered Union Flag that is longer than 1:2. The jacks of ships flying variants of the Blue Ensign are square and have a square Union Flag in the canton. The King's Colours of Army regiments are ; on them, the bars of the cross and saltire are of equal width, as are their respective narrow fimbriations.\nColours.\nAlthough the proclamation of 1801 did not specify colours beyond azure, argent and gules (blue, silver/white and red, respectively), the Garter King of Arms, under the authority of the Earl Marshal, has approved the below shades as an accurate representation:\nFlying.\nThe flag does not have reflection symmetry due to the slight pinwheeling of the St Patrick's and St Andrew's crosses, technically the \"counterchange of saltires\". Thus, there is a correct side up. It is one of two national flags with two-fold rotational symmetry, symmetry group C2, the other being the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. The original specification of the Union Flag in the royal proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description. The flag was deliberately designed with the Irish saltire slightly depressed at the hoist end to reflect the earlier union with Scotland, giving as it were seniority to the Saint Andrew's cross.\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is \"above\" the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases \"wide white top\" and \"broadside up\". An upside-down flag must be \"turned over\" to be flown correctly; \"rotating it\" 180 degrees will still result in an upside-down flag.\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the red ensign (also to be used as a red jack by privateers). As it appears in the \"London Gazette\", the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.\nHistory.\nIn 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the Kingdom of England (and the newly created client state, the Kingdom of Ireland) as James I, thereby uniting the crowns in a personal union. With Wales annexed into the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, James now ruled over all of the island of Great Britain, which he frequently described as a unified kingdom (though the parliaments of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland did not actually unify until the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707). In the wake of the 1603 personal union, several designs for a new flag were drawn up, juxtaposing the Saint George's Cross and the St Andrew's Saltire, but none were acceptable to James:\nVarious other designs for a common flag were drawn up following the union of the two Crowns in 1603, but were rarely, if ever, used. One version showed St George's cross with St Andrew's cross in the canton, and another version placed the two crosses side by side. \nA painted wooden ceiling boss from Linlithgow Palace, dated to about 1617, depicts the Scottish royal unicorn holding a flag where a blue Saltire surmounts the red cross of St. George.\n1606\u20131801.\nOn 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent the regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together, forming the flag of Great Britain and first union flag:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By the King: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter. We have, with the advice of our Council, ordered: That from henceforth all our Subjects of this Isle and Kingdome of Great Britaine, and all our members thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the Red Crosse, commonly called St George's Crosse, and the White Crosse, commonly called St Andrew's Crosse, joyned together according to the forme made by our heralds, and sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our Subjects: and in their fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall weare the Red Crosse onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North Britaine in their fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were accustomed.\nThis royal flag was, at first, to be used only at sea on civil and military ships of both England and Scotland, whereas land forces continued to use their respective national banners. Flying the national flag at the mainmast had signified the Admiral of the Narrow Seas (the English Channel) and confusion arose. In 1634, King Charles I restricted its use to Royal Navy ships. After the Acts of Union 1707, the flag gained a regularised status as \"the ensign armorial of the Kingdom of Great Britain\", the newly created state. It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"navy\" blue (Pantone 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the Blue Ensign of the Royal Navy's historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on maritime flags on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"royal\" blue (Pantone 300) (the Office of the Lord Lyon does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry).\nA thin white stripe, or fimbriation, separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's rule of tincture where colours (such as red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (such as white, i.e. \"argent\" or silver). The blazon for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is \"azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.\"\nThe Kingdom of Ireland, which had existed as a personal union with England since 1541, was unrepresented in the original versions of the Union Jack. However, the flag of the Protectorate from 1658 to 1660 was inescutcheoned with the arms of Ireland. These were removed at the Restoration, because Charles II found them offensive.\nThe original flag appears in the canton of the Commissioners' Ensign of the Northern Lighthouse Board. This is the only contemporary official representation of the pre-1801 Union Jack in the United Kingdom and can be seen flying from their George Street headquarters in Edinburgh.\nIt is this version of the Union Jack that formed the canton of the Continental Union Flag, the \"de facto\" first national flag of the United States from July 1776 to June 1777.\n\"Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June\", painted in 1795, shows a Union flying from on the \"Glorious First of June\" 1794. The actual flag, preserved in the National Maritime Museum, is a cruder approximation of the proper specifications; this was common in 18th and early 19th century flags.\nThe flag is also flown beside Customs House in Loftus Street, Sydney, to mark the raising of the Union Jack by Captain Phillip at Sydney Cove, the site of the first British settlement in New South Wales and Australia in 1788. On the plaque it is referred to as the \"Jack of Queen Anne\".\nThe British Army's flag is the Union Jack, but in 1938, a \"British Army Non-Ceremonial Flag\" was devised, featuring a lion on crossed blades with the St Edward's Crown on a red background. This is not the equivalent of the ensigns of the other armed services but is used at recruiting and military or sporting events, when the army needs to be identified but the reverence and ceremony due to the regimental flags and the Union Jack would be inappropriate.\nScottish Union Flag.\nIn objecting to the design of the Union Flag adopted in 1606, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, a number of owners and masters of merchant vessels in the Kingdom of Scotland raised the issue with John Erskine, 19th Earl of Mar, and were encouraged by him to send a letter of complaint to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, which stated: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most sacred Soverayne. A greate nomber of the maisteris and awnaris of the schippis of this your Majesteis kingdome hes verie havelie compleint to your Majesteis Counsell that the form and patrone of the flaggis of schippis, send doun heir and commandit to be ressavit and used be the subjectis of boith kingdomes, is very prejudiciall to the fredome and dignitie of this Estate and will gif occasioun of reprotche to this natioun quhairevir the said flage sal happin to be worne beyond sea becaus, as your sacred majestie may persave, the Scottis Croce, callit Sanctandrois Croce is twyse divydit, and the Inglishe Croce, callit Sanct George, haldin haill and drawne through the Scottis Croce, whiche is thairby obscurit and no takin nor merk to be seen of the Scottis Armes. This will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix your Majesteis subjectis, and it is to be ferit that some inconvenientis sall fall out betwix thame, for oure seyfairing men cannot be inducit to ressave that flag as it is set doun. They haif drawne two new drauchtis and patronis as most indifferent for boith kingdomes which they present to the Counsell, and craved our approbatioun of the same; bot we haif reserved that to you Majesteis princelie determination.\nAlthough documents accompanying this complaint which contained drafts for alternative designs have been lost, evidence exists, at least on paper, of an unofficial Scottish variant, whereby the Scottish cross was uppermost. There is reason to think that cloth flags of this design were employed during the 17th century for unofficial use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of \"The Present State of the Universe\" by John Beaumont, which contains as an appendix \"The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World\".\nOn land, evidence confirming the use of this flag appears in the depiction of Edinburgh Castle by John Slezer, in his series of engravings entitled \"Theatrum Scotiae\", c. 1693. Appearing in later editions of \"Theatrum Scotiae\", the \"North East View of Edinburgh Castle\" engraving depicts the \"Scotch\" (to use the appropriate adjective of that period) version of the Union Flag flying from the Palace block of the Castle. On \"The North Prospect of the City of Edenburgh\" engraving, the flag is indistinct.\nOn 17 April 1707, two weeks prior to the Acts of Union coming into effect, and with Sir Henry St George, the younger, the Garter King of Arms, having presented several designs of flag to Queen Anne and her Privy Council for consideration, the flag for the soon to be unified Kingdom of Great Britain was chosen. At the suggestion of the Scots representatives, the designs for consideration included that version of Union Jack showing the Cross of Saint Andrew uppermost; identified as being the \"Scotts union flagg as said to be used by the Scotts\". However, the Queen and her Council approved Sir Henry's original effort, numbered \"one\".\nA manuscript compiled in 1785 by William Fox and in possession of the Flag Research Center includes a full plate showing \"\"the scoth \" [\"sic\"]\" union\"\" flag. This could imply that there was still some use of a Scottish variant before the addition of the cross of St Patrick to the Union Flag in 1801.\nAfter 1801.\nThe current and second Union Jack dates from 1 January 1801 with the Act of Union 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The new design added a red saltire, the cross of Saint Patrick (which originates from the arms of the Old English FitzGerald family rather than directly from the saint), for Ireland. This is counterchanged with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the red always follows the white clockwise. The arrangement has introduced a requirement to display the flag \"the right way up\" (see specifications for flag use above). As with the red cross, so too the red saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field. This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than the red portion. The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.\nFlag speculation after Irish Free State establishment.\nWhen the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new Irish Free State was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. \"The New York Times\" reported that on 22 January 1922:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council. No parliamentary action would be necessary. Heraldry experts say that alterations in arms are very expensive. Some years ago there was a demand from Irish quarters that the blue ground of the golden harp on the royal standard should be changed to green. It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least \u00a32,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great. Probably it will be found that the deletion is not absolutely necessary. Other possible changes include the abolition of the title of the United Kingdom, and the removal of the harp from the Royal Standard and the Coat of Arms, and the substitution of the Ulster emblem.\nHowever, the fact that it was likely that Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were \"glad to think that our decision [to remain part of United Kingdom] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack.\" Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick's Saltire in favour of a new flag derived from the coat-of-arms of the Burkes, Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England's St George's Cross.\nUltimately, when the British home secretary was asked on 7 December 1922 (the day after the Irish Free State was established) whether the Garter King of Arms was \"to issue any Regulations with reference to the national flag consequent to the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act\", the response was no and the flag has never been changed.\nA D\u00e1il question in 1961 mooted raising the removal of the cross of St Patrick with the British government; Frank Aiken, the Irish Minister for External Affairs, declined to \"waste time on heraldic disputations\".\n21st century.\nThe lack of any Welsh symbol or colours in the flag is a result of Wales having been considered an integral part of the Kingdom of England at the time the flag of Great Britain was created in 1606. Since there is no Welsh element in the Union Jack, Wrexham's Labour MP Ian Lucas proposed on 26 November 2007 in a House of Commons debate that the Union Flag be combined with the Welsh flag to reflect Wales's status within the UK, and that the red dragon be added to the Union Flag's red, white, and blue pattern. He said the Union Jack currently only represented the other three UK nations, and Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism Margaret Hodge conceded that Lucas had raised a valid point for debate. She said, \"the Government is keen to make the Union Flag a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag.\" This development sparked design contests with entries from all over the world.\nIn the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, various non-official suggestions were made for how the flag could be redesigned without the St Andrew's Cross if Scotland left the Union. However, as Scotland voted against independence, the issue did not arise.\nIn September 2025, the England flag and the Union Jack became increasingly visible in the UK, in what was described as a \"flag phenomenon\". The first major display occurred in Weoley Castle, a neighbourhood of largely postwar council stock homes, before spreading to other parts of Birmingham in response to the 'proliferation' of Palestine flags. The phenomenon drew media attention after local authorities in Birmingham and York ordered the removal of British flags while allowing Palestine flags to remain, prompting public backlash and accusations of political double standards.\nStatus in the United Kingdom.\nThe Union Jack is used as a jack by commissioned warships and submarines of the Royal Navy, and by commissioned army and Royal Air Force vessels. When at anchor or alongside, it is flown from the jackstaff at the bow of the ship. When a ship is underway, the Union Jack is only flown from the jackstaff when the ship is dressed for a special occasion, such as the King's official birthday.\nThe Union Flag is worn at the masthead of a ship to indicate the presence of an Admiral of the Fleet, former First Sea Lords and Admirals who are or have been Chief of Defence Staff. On the day on which a court-martial is to sit, the Union Flag is to be hoisted at the peak or at the yardarm as appropriate and a gun is to be fired when colours are hoisted, or at the time the signal is made if the court is ordered to sit immediately.\nThe Royal Standard is flown when the Sovereign embarks in a warship. When other members of the Royal family embark they fly their own personal standard, which is usually a modified version of the Royal Standard.\nNo law has been passed making the Union Jack the national flag of the United Kingdom: it has become one through precedent. Its first recorded recognition as a national flag came in 1908, when it was stated in Parliament that \"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\". A more categorical statement was made by Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour, in 1933 when he stated that \"the Union Flag is the national flag and may properly be flown by any British subject on land.\"\nCivilian use is permitted on land, but use of the unmodified flag at sea is restricted to military vessels. Unauthorised use of the flag in the 17th century to avoid paying harbour duties\u00a0\u2013 a privilege restricted to naval ships\u00a0\u2013 caused James's successor, Charles I, to order that use of the flag on naval vessels be restricted to His Majesty's ships \"upon pain of Our high displeasure.\" It remains a criminal offence under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to display the Union Flag (other than the \"pilot jack\"\u00a0\u2013 see below) from a British ship. Naval ships will fly the white ensign, merchant and private boats can fly the red ensign, others with special permission such as naval yacht clubs can fly the blue ensign. All of the coloured ensigns contain the union flag as part of the design.\nThe Court of the Lord Lyon, which has legal jurisdiction in heraldic matters in Scotland, confirms that the Union Jack \"is the correct flag for all citizens and corporate bodies of the United Kingdom to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their nationality.\"\nOn 5 February 2008, Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew Rosindell introduced the 'Union Flag Bill' as a private member's bill under the 10 Minute Rule in the House of Commons. The Bill sought to formalise the position of the Union Flag as the national flag of the UK in law, to remove legal obstacles to its regular display. The Bill did not receive its second reading by the end of that parliamentary session. The Bill stated \"Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack)\" in subsection 1(1), but otherwise uses the term \"Union Flag\".\nFlag days.\nIn July 2007, prime minister Gordon Brown unveiled plans to have the Union Flag flown more often from government buildings. While consultation on new guidelines was under way, the decision to fly the flag could be made by each government department. In March 2021, the UK government published new guidance for the Union Flag to be flown all year round on UK government buildings, unless another flag is being flown, such as another national flag of the UK, a county flag, or other flags to mark civic pride.\nPreviously, the flag was generally only flown on public buildings on days marking the birthdays of members of the royal family, the wedding anniversary of the monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, the monarch's official birthday, Remembrance Sunday, and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament. Non-government organisations were (and are) permitted to fly the Union Flag whenever they choose.\nThe latest specified set of days when the Union Flag should be flown from government buildings throughout the UK are:\nIn addition, the flag should be flown in the following areas on these days:\nThe Union Flag is flown at half-mast from the announcement of the death of the sovereign (save for Proclamation Day), or upon command of the sovereign.\nOn 30 November, St Andrew's Day, the Union Flag can be flown in Scotland only where a building has more than one flagpole\u2014on this day the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole. This difference arose after members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day. However, on 23 April, St George's Day, it is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom that is flown over UK government offices in England.\nUsage and disposal.\nThe Union Flag has no official status in the United Kingdom, and there are no national regulations concerning its use or prohibitions against flag desecration. In Northern Ireland, the Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 provide for the flying of the flag on government buildings on certain occasions, when it is flown half-mast, and how it is displayed with other flags.\nThe Flags and Heraldry Committee, an all-party parliamentary group lobbying for official standards, cooperated with the Flag Institute in 2010 to publish a set of recommended guidelines for the flag's display and use as a symbol.\nThere is no specific way in which the Union Flag should be folded. It is usually folded rectilinearly, with the hoist on the outside, to be easily reattached to the pole.\nRoyal Navy Stores Duties Instructions, article 447, dated 26 February 1914, specified that flags condemned from further service use were to be torn up into small pieces and disposed of as rags, not to be used for decoration or sold. The exception was flags that had flown in action: these could be framed and kept on board, or transferred to a \"suitable place\", such as a museum.\nPosition of Honour.\nAccording to the UK Flag Protocol, the order of precedence of flags in the United Kingdom is: the Royal Standards, the Union Flag, the flag of the host country (England, Scotland and Wales etc.), the flags of other nations (in English alphabetical order), the Commonwealth Flag, the county flags, the flags of cities or towns, the banners of arms, and the house flags.\nBritish Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.\nThe Union Jack is the national flag of the British Overseas Territories, which are parts of the British realm with varying degrees of local autonomy. Most populated administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom have been granted a unique flag for the locality, usually the Blue ensign or Red ensign defaced with the distinguishing arms of the territory. All fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of Gibraltar (other than the government ensign).\nThe Crown Dependencies, unlike the British Overseas Territories, are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special ensign in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right. When the Union Jack and the territorial flag are flown together, the national flag is always arranged to take precedence over the territorial flag.\nStatus outside the United Kingdom.\nAustralia.\nThe Union Flag was used formally as the Australian national flag until 1953, having official precedence over the Australian Blue Ensign, though the latter was used by government and informally. Schools were encouraged to fly the Union Jack to encourage patriotism for the British Empire, with South Australia requiring students from 1911 to 1956 to fly the Union Jack for the \"national salute\".\nOver time, the blue ensign came to be used and embraced as the national flag, officially being designated as the \"Australian National Flag\" in 1953 with the passage of the \"Flags Act.\" Due to the sensitivity of those who still considered the Union Jack the national flag, the act specified that it did \"not affect the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack\". Additionally, Australian prime minister Robert Menzies told Australians that the Union Flag would be flown together with the Australian national flag \"on notable occasions\". The Union Jack continued to see informal use as a flag of Australia for a period thereafter, although by the 1980s, the majority of Australians viewed the Australian blue ensign as the national flag as opposed to the Union Jack.\nCanada.\nThe Union Jack was the official national flag of Canada until 1965 when it was replaced in that role by the Maple Leaf flag. Since 1965, the Union Jack in Canada is used as an authorised symbol to represent Canada's \"membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and its allegiance to the Crown\".\nHistory.\nThe Union Jack has been used in a variety of colonies in British North America since its official adoption in 1707, In 1867, the British North American colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada were united to form the Canadian Confederation; with the Union Jack being retained as the official flag of the new \"confederation\".\nIn addition to the Union Jack, during the late 19th century, a red ensign defaced with the arms of Canada was also used as an informal flag of Canada. The defaced red ensign, later known as the Canadian Red Ensign, was eventually authorised for official use as the country's civil ensign in 1892. Although the Canadian Red Ensign was only formally authorised as a civil ensign, it was also viewed as a \"de facto\" national flag, as it was a uniquely Canadian symbol.\nIn 1964, Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson introduced plans to replace the Union Flag with a new national flag, spurring the Great Canadian flag debate. A new national flag, the \"Maple Leaf\", was approved by the parliament of Canada on 18 December 1964. However, on the following day, the Canadian parliament passed another resolution that designated the Union Flag as the \"Royal Union Flag\" and authorised its official use as the symbol of the country's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and its allegiance to the Crown. On 15 February 1965, the maple leaf flag formally replaced the Union Flag as the flag of Canada following an official proclamation by Elizabeth II, with the Royal Union Flag becoming an official ceremonial flag. The Royal Union Flag's specific use as approved by parliament was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in May 2005.\nThe Union Flag was also legislated as the national flag for the Dominion of Newfoundland in 1931, a separate dominion of the British Empire. Newfoundland retained the Union Flag as a provincial flag after it joined the Canadian confederation in 1949, reaffirmed through the 1952 Revised Statutes of Newfoundland. In 1980, the flag of Newfoundland was adopted as the new provincial flag, with the design for the new flag of Newfoundland being derived from the Union Flag.\nProtocol.\nThe parliamentary resolution passed on 18 December 1964 assigned two purposes for the Royal Union Flag: a flag representing the United Kingdom and an official ceremonial flag of Canada. When used to represent the United Kingdom, the flag takes precedence before the flag of a Canadian province or territory. However, when the flag is used as a ceremonial flag of Canada, the flag of a Canadian province or territory takes precedence before the Royal Union Flag.\nThe parliamentary resolution requires the Royal Union Flag to be flown alongside the national flag of Canada (if there are at least two flag poles available) on federal properties on Commonwealth Day, Victoria Day (the monarch's official birthday in Canada), 11 December (the anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, 1931), and when otherwise instructed to do so by the National Defence Headquarters. The Royal Union Flag may also be formally flown alongside the flag of Canada at federal locations in Canada for ceremonies, anniversaries, and other events relating to the Canadian Armed Forces or other forces in the Commonwealth.\nItems and properties that the parliamentary resolution applies to includes buildings operated by the federal government, military installations, federally-operated airports, at the masthead of Royal Canadian Navy ships within Canadian waters, and other appropriate establishments. The requirement for federal properties to fly the Royal Union Flag applies only when there are two or more flagpoles on the property, to ensure that the national flag of Canada is not taken down in place of the Royal Union Flag.\nNew Zealand.\nThe Union Flag became the flag of New Zealand after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840, replacing the flag used by the United Tribes of New Zealand. The issue of flying the flag of the United Tribes alongside the Union Jack, as a symbol of their equal standing with the colonial government, was a factor that led to the Flagstaff War, led by Ng\u0101puhi chief H\u014dne Heke. British maritime flags were used by New Zealand vessels until 1865. After the passage of the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, vessels of the New Zealand government used a defaced blue ensign issued by the colonial government.\nThe current national flag of New Zealand was given official standing under the New Zealand Ensign Act in 1902, replacing the Union Flag. However, the Union Flag continued to see tandem use with the national flag of New Zealand into the 1950s.\nSouth Africa.\nThe Union Jack was used as the flag of a variety of colonies in South Africa since 1795. The Union Jack was retained as the official flag of the Union of South Africa after its formation in 1910. In addition to the Union Jack, from 1910 to 1928, the South African Red Ensign was also treated as an unofficial flag of the union.\nProposals to adopt a national flag were made during the 1920s. In 1927, the Union Nationality and Flag Act was passed by the Parliament of South Africa, which named both the Union Jack and the flag of South Africa as the flags of the union, both co-equal in status. The flag also incorporated the Union Jack in its design, alongside the flag of the Orange Free State and the flag of the South African Republic. The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the at principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine. The act went into effect on 31 May 1928.\nInstructions issued in 1931 confirmed the places where both flags were to be flown. In addition to those already mentioned, they were the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the head offices of the four provincial administrations, the supreme courts, certain magistrates' courts, customs houses, and three buildings in Durban (the general post office, the railway station, and the local military district headquarters). Under these arrangements, the Union Jack was subordinate to the . As the two flags had to be the same size, it meant that the Union Jack was made in the ratio 2:3 rather than the usual 1:2.\nThis dual arrangement continued until 1957, when the Flags Amendment Act was passed naming the as the sole flag of South Africa. The was replaced by the flag of South Africa in 1994 as the country's national flag.\nUse outside the Commonwealth.\nMovements in countries not a part of the Commonwealth of Nations have adopted the Union Flag as a flag of protest.\nHong Kong.\nThe Union Flag was formerly used in Hong Kong when it was a British Dependent Territory. Official use of the Union Flag and the British colonial Hong Kong flag ceased following the handover of Hong Kong to China in July 1997. In the 2010s, the Union Flag, along with the colonial flag of Hong Kong began to see use by supporters of the pro-democracy camp during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests. The flag has been displayed at other pro-democracy events in Hong Kong, including the new year marches and the 1 July marches. Members of the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement, the Hong Kong independence movement and Hong Kong localists have been seen wielding the Union Flag or the colonial flag of Hong Kong.\nHowever, the meaning behind the use of the flags by pro-democracy protestors, including the Union Flag, remains disputed with protestors citing a variety of reasons for flying it. Some pro-democracy protestors that flew foreign flags, including the Union Flag, did so in an effort to attract international media attention to the protests, while others did so in an effort to irritate the central government of China. The Union Flag, in addition to other foreign flags, were also used by some protestors to illustrate their desire for Hong Kong to be an \"international city\"; whereas others used the flag simply as a generic symbol of freedom.\nSome specifically flew the Union Flag and the colonial flag of Hong Kong, nostalgic of the \"values\" of the previous colonial government, namely \"personal freedoms, rule of law, [and] clean governance\". Other pro-democracy protestors choose to use the Union Flag and the colonial flag of Hong Kong in an effort to call upon the British government to declare that China had failed to uphold the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Several Hongkongers that hold British National (Overseas) passports who used the flag during the protests were doing so as a call to the British government to grant British National (Overseas) the right to abode in the United Kingdom. Although a small number of Hongkongers seek direct British intervention into the matter, the majority of those that used the Union Flag or the colonial flag of Hong Kong during the protests do not hold such beliefs.\nThe use of foreign flags at the protests, including the Union Flag, has been cited multiple times by the central government of China as evidence for their claim that foreign interference is steering the protests in Hong Kong against the central government. Conversely, several protestors in the pro-democracy camp have also criticised the use of foreign flags, who view their use as reinforcing the claims made by the central government of China.\nItaly.\nAfter the British referendum on membership of the European Union resulted in a vote to leave, the Union Flag became a symbol of euroscepticism in Italy. In August 2016, many local businesses along the Italian riviera hoisted the flags as a protest against the implementation of the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006.\nUse in other flags.\nNational and regional flags.\nAs the national flag of the entire British Realm, the Union Flag was found in the \"canton\" (upper flagpole-side quarter) of the flags of many colonies of Britain, while the \"field\" (background) of their flags was the colour of the naval ensign flown by the particular Royal Navy squadron that patrolled that region of the world. Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included Aden, Basutoland (now Lesotho), Barbados, Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Borneo, Burma, Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Cyprus, Dominica, British East Africa (Kenya Colony), Gambia, Gold Coast (Ghana), Grenada, Guiana, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Labuan (Malaysia), Lagos, Malta, Mauritius, Nigeria, Palestine, Penang (Malaysia), Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somaliland, South Africa, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Pre-partitioned India (present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar), Tanganyika, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United States, and Weihaiwei. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former Dependent Territory of Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and Tuvalu, which have retained the monarchy; and Fiji, which abolished the monarchy in 1987.\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Newfoundland and Labrador uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, similar to the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organisations, most notably the United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada.\nAlong with the national flag, many other Australian flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the Royal Australian Navy Ensign (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, the Australian Red Ensign (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower Murray River Flags. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the Flags Act 1953 states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual. The unofficial flag of Lord Howe Island harks to the pre-1801 Union Jack.\nThe Basque Country's flag, the Ikurri\u00f1a, is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain at the time the Ikurri\u00f1a was designed in 1894. The Miskito people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the Continental Union Flag. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the British East India Company. The historical Kingdom of Hawaii adopted a flag featuring a Union Jack which was retained when Hawaii became a US state in 1959. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the flag of Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the Seven Years' War until the end of the American Revolutionary War, when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. Taunton, Massachusetts, uses a defaced Red Ensign variant featuring the old-style Union Jack and has since 1974, as does Weymouth Township, New Jersey. Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 flags of South Africa. The 1910\u20131928 flag was a Red Ensign with the Union coat of arms in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the Prinsenvlag and commonly known as the \"oranje-blanje-blou\" (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags. The present flag of South Africa features a nod to the Union Jack in its red, white and blue portion, the colours also harking to the South African Republic and the Dutch tricolour.\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of Shanghai International Settlement in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolise the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield and close to the flags of the United States and France, there was also contained the flag of Prussia nearby, but it was removed around 1917.\nThe flag of the Chilean city of Coquimbo features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\nEnsigns.\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the ensigns flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, and on land at locations associated with the organisation which the ensign represents, for example government offices, military establishments, etc. These are used in cases where it is illegal or inappropriate to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the White ensign (Royal Navy), the Red ensign (Merchant and private boats) or the Blue ensign (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as New Zealand and Australia) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as India and Jamaica) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\nOthers.\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the Pilot Jack. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, but not intended as a civil jack. A book issued to British consuls in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the Red Ensign for merchant shipping.\nIn 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the Red Ensign, the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced Red Ensign), no other colours.\" The Flag Institute listed the white bordered Union Flag as \"Civil Jack\".\nFrom 1884 until 1928, the Royal Indian Marine flew a modified Union Jack bordered with blue as its jack. From 11 November 1928 until its dissolution in 1947, it substituted the Blue Ensign defaced with the Star of India emblem as jack and flew the British White ensign as ensign.\nAn unofficial flag for the British Empire was created around 1910 due to a belief that the Union Jack itself no longer sufficiently represented dominions such as Canada, which were beginning to adopt their own unique symbols. The flag was similar in design to a White Ensign, which features the Union Jack in the canton. In the other quadrants were the coats of arms of Canada, Australia, and South Africa. The four stars forming the Crux over Saint George's Cross represented New Zealand, and the Star of India was featured prominently in the middle. Civilians often flew Empire flags for patriotic events such as coronations, Empire Day, and the British Empire Exhibition. It is still flown on special occasions at the Dangarsleigh War Memorial.\nThe Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival North West Company had a similar flag as well. The HBC Red Ensign was in use from 1801 to 1965 and was replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\nThe Union Jack is the third quarter of the 1939 coat of arms of Alabama, which is used on the flag of the governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\nA pink Union Jack, with the blue triangles of the Union Jack changed to pink in reference to the pink triangle symbol, was created by a gay man, David Gwinnutt, to express his \"pride in being gay and British.\"\nIn the former International Settlement of Kulangsu the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag. The badge was incorporated into their police flag.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Union Jack remains one of the most instantly-recognisable flags in the world. This is chiefly due not only to its unusual design, but the influence of British culture across the globe as a result of the British Empire, and its resulting presence in several Commonwealth nations' flags and heraldry. \nWhile most of the former colonies of the British Empire have chosen to omit the Union Jack in their national flags, some countries such as Australia and New Zealand have chosen to keep the Union Jack as a symbol of their British heritage, despite numerous attempts to change it.\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of fashion since the British Invasion movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American Stars and Stripes flag, and came back into fashion in the mid-1990s 'Cool Britannia' era, notably Noel Gallagher's Union Jack Epiphone Sheraton II electric guitar, and Geri Halliwell's dress at the 1997 Brit Awards. A notable increase in popularity was seen in Cuba following the 2012 London Olympics, with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.\nA hypothetical Union flag design appears in the Ubisoft published action adventure game titled , where following Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, the colour of the Union flag is altered to reflect the absence of the Azure (blue) field of the flag of Scotland, which is replaced by the Sable (black) field of the Flag of Saint David, patron saint of Wales. The Or (gold) cross of Saint David forms a fimbriated border to the Gules (red) cross of Saint George.\nSubsumation in corporate branding.\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an icon representing a choice of the English language where a choice amongst multiple languages may be presented to the user, though the American flag is also sometimes used for this purpose. The flag has been embroidered on various Reebok equipment as a mark of the brand's British origin, and the Reebok Union Jack has been referred to as a brand icon. Many music artists have used the Union Jack, including the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, Sex Pistols, the Stone Roses, David Bowie, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Freddie Mercury, Morrissey, Oasis, Blur, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, and the Spice Girls.\nBritish Airways painted a cropped Union Flag on their tail fins until 1984; from 1997 on, they started painting a stylised, fluttering Union flag on tail fins, nicknamed \"Chatham Dockyard Union Flag\". The coat of arms of British Airways also features the escutcheon cropped from the Union Flag. British Airways used the coat of arms on their aircraft via the Landor livery between 1984 and 1997 and added back in 2011; they also used it as cap badge for pilots or in advertisements.\nThe BMW Mini tail lights are shaped after the Union Jack.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The design was adopted during the French Revolution and has remained the national flag since then, with only minor variations in shade and proportion. While not the first tricolour, it became one of the most influential flags in history. The tricolour scheme was later adopted by many other nations in Europe and elsewhere, and, according to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", has historically stood \"in symbolic opposition to the autocratic and clericalist royal standards of the past\".\nBefore the tricolour was adopted the royal government used many flags, the best known being a blue shield and gold fleurs-de-lis (the Royal Arms of France) on a white background, or state flag. Early in the French Revolution, the Paris militia, which played a prominent role in the storming of the Bastille, wore a cockade of blue and red, the city's traditional colours. According to French general Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, white was the \"ancient French colour\" and was added to the militia cockade to form a tricolour, or national, cockade of France.\nThis cockade became part of the uniform of the National Guard, which succeeded the militia and was commanded by Lafayette. The colours and design of the cockade are the basis of the Tricolour flag, adopted in 1790, originally with the red nearest to the flagpole and the blue farthest from it. A modified design by Jacques-Louis David was adopted in 1794. The royal white flag was used during the Bourbon Restoration from 1815 to 1830; the tricolour was brought back after the July Revolution and has been used since then, except for an interruption for a few days in 1848. Since 1976, there have been two versions of the flag in varying levels of use by the state: the original (identifiable by its use of navy blue) and one with a lighter shade of blue. Since July 2020, France has used the older variant by default, including at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\nDesign.\nArticle 2 of the French constitution of 1958 states that \"the national emblem is the tricolour flag, blue, white, red\". No law has specified the shades of these official colours. In English blazon, the flag is described as \"tierced in pale azure, argent and gules.\"\nThe blue stripe has usually been a dark navy blue; a lighter blue (and lighter red) version was introduced in 1976 by President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing. Both versions were used from then; town halls, public buildings and barracks usually fly the darker version of the flag, but the lighter version was sometimes used even on official State buildings.\nOn 13 July 2020, President Emmanuel Macron reverted, without any statement and with no orders for other institutions to use a specific version, to the darker hue for the presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as a symbol of the French Revolution. The move was met with comments both in favour of and against the change, but it was noted that both the darker and lighter flags have been in use for decades.\nCurrently, the flag is one and a half times wider than its height (i.e. in the proportion 2:3) and, except in the French Navy, has stripes of equal width. Initially, the three stripes of the flag were not equally wide, being in the proportions 30 (blue), 33 (white) and 37 (red). Under Napoleon I, the proportions were changed to make the stripes' width equal, but by a regulation dated 17 May 1853, the navy went back to using the 30:33:37 proportions, which it now continues to use, as the flapping of the flag makes portions farther from the halyard seem smaller.\nWhen the French president or prime minister is expected to be photographed at an official or televised event, a flag with a much narrower white stripe is often used as a backdrop to ensure that all three stripes are visible when the cameras are focused on them, as using a flag with equal stripes might show only the white stripe in frame.\nSymbolism.\nBlue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, used on the city's coat of arms. Blue is identified with Saint Martin, red with Saint Denis. At the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the Paris militia wore blue and red cockades on their hats. White had long featured prominently on French flags and is described as the \"ancient French colour\" by Lafayette. White was added to the \"revolutionary\" colours of the militia cockade to \"nationalise\" the design, thus forming the cockade of France. Although Lafayette identified the white stripe with the nation, other posterior accounts, notably from July Monarchy, identify it with the monarchy. Lafayette denied that the flag contains any reference to the red-and-white livery of the Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans. Despite this, Orl\u00e9anists adopted the tricolour as their own.\nBlue and red are associated with the Virgin Mary, the patroness of France, and were the colours of the oriflamme. The colours of the French flag may also represent the three main estates of the Ancien R\u00e9gime (the clergy: white, the nobility: red and the bourgeoisie: blue). Blue, as the symbol of class, comes first and red, representing the nobility, comes last. Both extreme colours are situated on each side of white referring to a superior order.\nThe cockade of France was adopted in July 1789, a moment of national unity that soon faded. Royalists began wearing white cockades and flying white flags, while the Jacobins, and later the Socialists, flew the red flag. The tricolour, which combines royalist white with republican red, came to be seen as a symbol of moderation and of a nationalism that transcended factionalism.\nThe French government website states that the white field was the colour of the king, while blue and red were the colours of Paris.\nThe three colours are occasionally taken to represent the three elements of the revolutionary motto, (freedom: blue), (equality: white), (brotherhood: red); this symbolism was referenced in Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's three colours film trilogy, for example.\nIn the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks, many famous landmarks and stadiums around the world were illuminated in the flag colours to honour the victims.\nHistory.\nKingdom of France.\nDuring the early Middle Ages, the oriflamme, the flag of Saint Denis, was used\u2014red, with two, three, or five spikes. Originally, it was the royal banner under the Capetians. It was stored in Saint-Denis abbey, where it was taken when war broke out. French kings went forth into battle preceded either by Saint Martin's red cape, which was supposed to protect the monarch, or by the red banner of Saint Denis.\nLater during the Middle Ages, these colours came to be associated with the reigning house of France. In 1328, the coat-of-arms of the House of Valois was blue with gold fleurs-de-lis bordered in red. From this time on, the kings of France were represented in vignettes and manuscripts wearing a red gown under a blue coat decorated with gold fleurs-de-lis. Charles V of France changed the design from an all-over scattering of fleurs-de-lis to a group of three in about 1376; these two coats are known in heraldic terminology as \"France Ancient\" and \"France Modern\", respectively.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, England was recognised by a red cross; Burgundy, a red saltire; and France, a white cross. This cross could figure either on a blue or a red field. The blue field eventually became the common standard for French armies. The French regiments were later assigned the white cross as standard, with their proper colours in the cantons. The French flag of a white cross on a blue field is still seen on some flags derived from it, such as that of Quebec.\nThe flag of Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years' War is described in her own words, \"I had a banner of which the field was sprinkled with lilies; the world was painted there, with an angel at each side; it was white of the white cloth called 'boccassin'; there was written above it, I believe, 'JHESUS MARIA'; it was fringed with silk.\" Joan's standard led to the prominent use of white on later French flags.\nFrom the accession of the Bourbons to the throne of France, the green ensign of the navy became a plain white flag, the symbol of purity and royal authority. The merchant navy was assigned \"the old flag of the nation of France\", the white cross on a blue field. There also was a red jack for the French galleys. A variant of the plain white Bourbon banner, a white field strewn with gold fleur de lis, was also sometimes seen.\nThe \"Tricolore\".\nAdopted after the French Revolution, the French tricolour flag evolved from revolutionary symbols like the blue and red cockade of France. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. The addition of white has been attributed to Lafayette, Mayor Jean Sylvain Bailly, and even Louis XVI himself. This episode is supposed to have taken place on July 17, 1789, on the occasion of the king's visit to the Paris city hall. However, it is proven that the tricolor cockade began to be worn, by order of the city, from the 13th or 14 July. In any case, Louis XVI actually went to the Paris city hall where he received the tricolor cockade. On 27 July, a tricolour cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the National Guard, the national police force that succeeded the militia.\nA \"drapeau tricolore\" with vertical red, white and blue stripes was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 24 October 1790. Simplified designs were used to illustrate how the revolution had broken with the past. The order was reversed to blue-white-red, the current design, by a resolution passed on 15 February 1794.\nWhen the Bourbon dynasty was restored following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the \"tricolore\"\u2014with its revolutionary connotations\u2014was replaced by a white flag, the pre-revolutionary naval flag. However, following the July Revolution of 1830, the \"citizen-king\", Louis-Philippe, restored the \"tricolore\", and it has remained France's national flag since that time.\nFollowing the overthrow of Napoleon III, voters elected a royalist majority to the National Assembly of the new Third Republic. This parliament then offered the throne to the Bourbon pretender, Henri, Comte de Chambord. However, he insisted that he would accept the throne only on the condition that the tricolour be replaced by the white flag. As the tricolour had become a cherished national symbol, this demand proved impossible to accommodate. Plans to restore the monarchy were adjourned and ultimately dropped, and France has remained a republic, with the tricolour flag, ever since.\nThe Vichy r\u00e9gime, which dropped the word \"republic\" in favour of \"the French state\", maintained the use of the \"tricolore\", but Philippe P\u00e9tain used as his personal standard a version of the flag with, in the white stripe, an axe made with a star-studded marshal's baton. This axe is called the \"Francisque\" in reference to the ancient Frankish throwing axe. During this same period, the Free French Forces used a \"tricolore\" with, in the white stripe, a red Cross of Lorraine.\nThe constitutions of 1946 and 1958 instituted the \"blue, white, and red\" flag as the national emblem of the Republic.\nThe colours of the national flag are occasionally said to represent different flowers; blue represents cornflowers, white represents marguerites, and red represents poppies.\nColonial flags.\nMost French colonies either used the regular tricolour or a regional flag without the French flag. There were some exceptions:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Large groups included the Iraqi National Congress, Kurdish groups such as KDP, PUK, IMK, AAI, as well as the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy which aimed at restoring the Kingdom of Iraq, and the Iraqi National Accord, and the Iran-backed Shia groups such as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and Islamic Dawa Party, also the Democratic July 14 Movement coalition, pro-Assad Ba'athists, and the Iraqi Communist Party and its military wing Al-Ansar.\nIn February 2003, the Bush administration fell apart with the Iraqi opposition, its closest ally."}

It was formed as an umbrella opposition group of majority Feyli Kurds and Shia Arabs, with the aid of the United States' government following the Persian Gulf War, for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of longtime Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Today the party is mainly run by Feyli Kurds after Aras Habib was elected as the general secretary of the party in 2015. The party was mainly considered as a pro-American ally before turning its stance towards Iran in 2006 after alleged disputes with the Americans.\nHistory.\nINC was set up in Vienna, Austria in 1992 by Ahmad Chalabi and Aras Habib with the backing of secular Feyli dissidents largely funded by money from UAE following the Persian Gulf War to coordinate the activities of various anti-Saddam groups. Then President George H. W. Bush signed a presidential finding directing the Central Intelligence Agency to create conditions for Saddam's removal in May 1991. Coordinating anti-Saddam groups was an important element of this strategy. The name INC was reportedly coined by public relations expert John Rendon (of the Rendon Group agency) and the group was funded by the United States. The group received millions in covert funding in the 1990s, and then about $8 million a year in overt funding after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998. The deep involvement of the American CIA in the creation and early funding of the INC in its early years led many to consider the group a \"creation of the CIA\" rather than an organ of genuine Iraqi opposition.\nINC represented the first major attempt by opponents of Saddam to join forces, bringing together Kurds of all religions, Sunni and Shi'ite Arabs (both Islamic fundamentalist and secular) as well as non-Muslim Arabs; additionally monarchists, nationalists and ex-military officers. In June 1992, nearly 200 delegates from dozens of opposition groups met in Vienna, along with Iraq's two main Kurdish militias, the rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In October 1992, major Shi'ite groups, including the SCIRI and al-Dawa, came into the coalition and INC held a pivotal meeting in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, choosing a Leadership Council and a 26-member executive council. The leaders included monarchist Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein that called for the return of a constitutional monarchy for Iraq, moderate Shi'ite Muslim cleric Mohammad Bahr al-Ulloum; ex-Iraqi general Hasan Naqib; and Masoud Barzani. Ahmed Chalabi, a secular Shi'ite Iraqi-American and mathematician by training, became head of the group.\nINC's political platform promised \"human rights and rule of law within a constitutional, democratic, and pluralistic Iraq\"; preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity, and complete compliance with international law, including United Nations resolutions relating to Iraq.\nDifferences within INC eventually led to its virtual collapse. In May 1994, the two main Kurdish parties began fighting with each other over territory and other issues. As a result of the growing difficulties within INC, the United States began seeking out other opponents who could threaten the Iraqi regime, such as the Iraqi National Accord (INA), headed by Ayad Allawi. The rivalries between the Kurdish parties prompted the KDP to seek armed support from Saddam Hussein for its capture of the town of Arbil from rival PUK. Iraq took advantage of the request by launching a military strike in which 200 opposition members were executed and as many as 2,000 arrested. 650 oppositionists (mostly INC) were evacuated and resettled in the United States under parole authority of the US Attorney General. INC played a central role in the truce negotiations between KDP and PUK.\nINC was subsequently plagued by dissociation of many of its constituent groups from the INC umbrella, a cutoff of funds from its international backers (including the United States), and continued pressure from Iraqi intelligence services especially after a failed 1995 coup attempt. In 1998, however, the US Congress authorized $97 million in U.S. military aid for Iraqi opposition via the Iraq Liberation Act, intended primarily for INC.\nIn March 2002, Seymour Hersh reported in \"The New Yorker\" that \"exile groups supported by the INC have been conducting sabotage operations inside Iraq, targeting oil refineries and other installations. The latest attack took place on January 23rd, an INC official told me, when missiles fired by what he termed 'indigenous dissidents' struck the large Baiji refinery complex, north of Baghdad, triggering a fire that blazed for more than twelve hours.\" However, Hersh added, \"A dispute over Chalabi's potential usefulness preoccupies the bureaucracy, as the civilian leadership in The Pentagon continues to insist that only the INC can lead the opposition. At the same time, a former Administration official told me, 'Everybody but the Pentagon and the office of the Vice President wants to ditch the INC.' INC's critics note that Chalabi, despite years of effort and millions of dollars in American aid, is intensely unpopular today among many elements in Iraq. 'If Chalabi is the guy, there could be a civil war after Saddam's overthrow,' one former C.I.A. operative told me. A former high-level Pentagon official added, 'There are some things that a President can't order up, and an internal opposition is one.'\"\nNotwithstanding these concerns, Hersh reported that \"INC supporters in and around the Administration, including Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, believe, like Chalabi, that any show of force would immediately trigger a revolt against Saddam within Iraq, and that it would quickly expand.\" In December 2002, Robert Dreyfuss reported that the administration of George W. Bush actually preferred INC-supplied analyses of Iraq over analyses provided by long-standing analysts within the CIA. \"Even as it prepares for war against Iraq, the Pentagon is already engaged on a second front: its war against the Central Intelligence Agency.,\" he wrote. \"The Pentagon is bringing relentless pressure to bear on the agency to produce intelligence reports more supportive of war with Iraq. ... Morale inside the U.S. national-security apparatus is said to be low, with career staffers feeling intimidated and pressured to justify the push for war.\" Much of the pro-war faction's information came from INC, even though \"most Iraq hands with long experience in dealing with that country's tumultuous politics consider the INC's intelligence-gathering abilities to be nearly nil. ... The Pentagon's critics are appalled that intelligence provided by the INC might shape U.S. decisions about going to war against Baghdad. At the CIA and at the State Department, Ahmed Chalabi, the INC's leader, is viewed as the ineffectual head of a self-inflated and corrupt organization skilled at lobbying and public relations, but not much else.\"\n\"The [INC's] intelligence isn't reliable at all,\" said Vincent Cannistraro, a former senior CIA official and counterterrorism expert. \"Much of it is propaganda. Much of it is telling the Defense Department what they want to hear. And much of it is used to support Chalabi's own presidential ambitions. They make no distinction between intelligence and propaganda, using alleged informants and defectors who say what Chalabi wants them to say, [creating] cooked information that goes right into presidential and vice-presidential speeches.\" (Dreyfuss, December 2002). Chalabi received training in television presentation techniques from the Irish scriptwriter Eoghan Harris prior to the invasion of Iraq.\nIn February 2003, as the Bush administration neared the end of its preparations for war, an internal fight erupted over INC's plan to actually become the government of Iraq after the U.S. invasion. Chalabi wanted to \"declare a provisional government when the war starts,\" a plan that \"alienated some of Mr. Chalabi's most enthusiastic backers in the Pentagon and in Congress, who fear the announcement of a provisional government made up of exiles would split anti-Saddam sentiment inside Iraq.\"\nDuring the Iraq War, the United States created the Free Iraqi Forces, a militia made of Iraqi expatriates and under the control of the Iraqi National Congress, fought alongside American forces. The INC's forces were reportedly ill-equipped, often engaged in lawless activities, and also engaged in sectarian activity against Sunni Muslims.\nAfter the first phase of the Iraq War was over and the Ba'athist government of Iraq was overthrown, a governing council, including Chalabi was set up, but when it came time to choose an interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, head of rival Iraqi National Accord, was chosen.\nIn May 2004, the United States military raided the residences of Iraqi National Congress members now living in Iraq. It had been announced on May 18 that the Pentagon had stopped sending funding to INC, which had averaged about $340,000 per month for intelligence gathered by the organization. It is unclear what the military forces were seeking, although a spokesman for Ahmed Chalabi said Chalabi had been held at gunpoint and told to accept concessions then being put in place by the United States in preparation for a transfer of sovereignty on June 30, 2004. Chalabi had been a critic of the transfer, saying that the U.S. retained too much power.\nIn the lead up to the January 2005 Iraqi election INC joined the United Iraqi Alliance coalition of mainly Shi'ite groups as Chalabi reinvented himself as a sharp critic of the occupation, aligning himself with Muqtada al-Sadr. Chalabi was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in the transitional government, and INC member Ali Allawi (the cousin of Ayad Allawi, and incidentally nephew of Chalabi) became Minister of Finance.\nIn preparation for the December 2005 Iraqi election, INC broke with the United Iraqi Alliance and formed its own multi-ethnic coalition, the National Congress Coalition. It did not win any seats in the election."}

{"id": "70775", "revid": "51065820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70775", "title": "Trans-Canada Highway", "text": "Transcontinental highway system\nThe Trans-Canada Highway (French: ; abbreviated as the TCH or T-Can, or simply the Trans-Canada) is a transcontinental federal\u2013provincial highway system that travels through all ten provinces of Canada, from the Pacific Ocean on the west coast to the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast. The main route spans across the country, one of the longest routes of its type in the world. The highway system is recognizable by its distinctive white-on-green maple leaf route markers, although there are small variations in the markers in some provinces.\nWhile by definition the Trans-Canada Highway is a highway \"system\" that has several parallel routes throughout most of the country, the term \"Trans-Canada Highway\" often refers to the main route that consists of Highway\u00a01 (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), Highways 11, 17, and 417 (Ontario), Autoroutes 40, 25, 20, and 85 and Route\u00a0185 (Quebec), Highway\u00a02 (New Brunswick), Highways 104 and 105 (Nova Scotia), and Highway\u00a01 (Newfoundland and Labrador). This main route starts in Victoria, British Columbia and ends in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, passes through nine of the ten provinces, and connects most of the country's major cities, including Vancouver, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Ottawa, Ontario; Montreal and Quebec City, Quebec; and Fredericton, New Brunswick. One of the main route's eight other parallel routes connects to the tenth province, Prince Edward Island.\nWhile the other parallel routes in the system are also technically part of the Trans-Canada Highway, they are usually considered either secondary routes or different highways altogether. For example, Highway\u00a016 throughout Western Canada is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, but is almost exclusively referred to as the Yellowhead Highway and is often recognized as its own highway under that name. In comparison, Highway\u00a01 in Western Canada is always referred to as the Trans-Canada Highway, and has a significantly higher traffic volume with a route passing through more major cities than the less important Highway\u00a016 (Yellowhead) TCH route. Therefore Highway\u00a01 is usually considered to be part of the main Trans-Canada Highway route, while Highway\u00a016 is not, although it may be considered a second mainline corridor as it serves a more northerly belt of major cities, as well as having its own Pacific terminus.\nAlthough the TCH network is strictly a transcontinental highway system, and does not enter any of Canada's three northern territories or run to the Canada\u2013United States border, it does form part of Canada's overall National Highway System (NHS), which provides connections to the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and the border, although the NHS (apart from the TCH sections) is unsigned.\nJurisdiction and designation.\nCanada's National Highway System is not under federal jurisdiction or coordination, as highway construction and maintenance are entirely under the jurisdiction of the individual provinces, which also handle route numbering on the Trans-Canada Highway. The Western provinces have voluntarily coordinated their highway numbers so that the main Trans-Canada route is designated Highway\u00a01 and the Yellowhead route is designated Highway\u00a016 throughout. Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador also designate Highway\u00a01 as their section of the TCH, while New Brunswick uses Highway\u00a02 (a separate important highway\u2014albeit non-TCH\u2014is Highway\u00a01 in that province). East of Manitoba, the highway numbers change at each provincial boundary, or within a province (especially in Ontario and Quebec) as the TCH piggybacks along separate provincial highways (which often continue as non-TCH routes outside the designated sections) en route. In addition, Ontario and Quebec use standard provincial highway shields to number the highway within their boundaries, but post numberless Trans-Canada Highway shields alongside them to identify it. As the Trans-Canada route was composed of sections from pre-existing provincial highways, it is unlikely that the Trans-Canada Highway will ever have a uniform designation across the whole country.\nHighway design and standards.\nUnlike the Interstate Highway System in the United States, the Trans-Canada Highway system has no national construction standard, and it was originally built mostly as a two-lane highway with few multi-lane freeway sections, similar to the older United States Numbered Highway System. As a result, highway construction standards vary considerably among provinces and cities. In much of British Columbia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, the Trans-Canada Highway system is still in its original two-lane state. British Columbia is actively working on converting its section of Highway\u00a01 east of Kamloops to a four-lane divided highway. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have widened most of their southern Trans-Canada Highway network to four lanes. In Quebec, most sections of the TCH network overlap with the province's Autoroute freeways. New Brunswick is the only province to have its whole length of the main Trans-Canada Highway route at a four-lane freeway standard.\nLike the former U.S. Route\u00a066 (US\u00a066), the many non-expressway sections of the Trans-Canada Highway often form the main streets of communities, with homes and businesses directly adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway is not always the preferred route between two cities, or even across the country. For example, the vast majority of traffic travelling between Hope and Kamloops, British Columbia, takes the Coquihalla Highway via Merritt, rather than the longer Trans-Canada Highway route. Another example is that much long-distance traffic between Western and Eastern Canada will drive south into the United States and use the Interstate Highway System, rather than the Trans-Canada Highway through Northern Ontario.\nMain route.\nWestern Canada.\nThe main Trans-Canada Highway is uniformly designated as Highway\u00a01 across the four western provinces. The British Columbia section of Highway\u00a01 is long, beginning in Victoria at the intersection of Douglas Street and Dallas Road (where the \"Mile\u00a00\" plaque stands), and ending on the Alberta border at Kicking Horse Pass. The highway starts by passing northward along the east coast of Vancouver Island for to Nanaimo along a mostly-four-lane, heavily signalized highway. After passing through downtown Nanaimo on a small arterial road, the highway enters the Departure Bay ferry terminal and crosses the Strait of Georgia to Horseshoe Bay via BC Ferries. From there, it travels through Metro Vancouver on a four-to-eight-lane freeway before leaving the city and continuing as a four-lane freeway eastward up the Fraser Valley to Hope. There, the Trans-Canada Highway exits the freeway and turns north for through Fraser Canyon and Thompson Canyon toward Cache Creek (as a scenic alternative and for local traffic), mostly as a two-lane rural highway with only occasional traffic lights, while the freeway continues on Highway 5 (which is the preferred route for through traffic). Approaching Kamloops, Highway\u00a01 re-enters a short freeway alignment with Highways 5 (and concurrent 97), before passing through Kamloops itself as a four-lane signalized highway. From Kamloops, the highway continues east as a mostly-two-lane rural highway through the Interior of British Columbia, with occasional passing lanes. It widens to a signalized, four-lane arterial road for short stretches in Salmon Arm, Revelstoke, and Golden, but has no signal lights on it for most of its length. The highway crosses two high passes along its route: Rogers Pass in Glacier National Park, and Kicking Horse Pass in Yoho National Park. At Kicking Horse Pass, the highest point on the whole Trans-Canada Highway system is reached, at . The high pass marks the boundary between British Columbia and Alberta (and also between Yoho and Banff National Parks), as well as the Continental Divide of the Americas.\nSpeed limits on the Mainland segment of the Trans-Canada Highway in British Columbia range from , although in towns it can be as low as . A combination of difficult terrain and growing urbanization limits posted speeds on the Vancouver Island section to in urban areas, over the Malahat and through suburban areas, and a maximum of in rural areas.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway through the three Prairie Provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) is long. It starts at the border with British Columbia at Kicking Horse Pass near Lake Louise, Alberta, and runs all the way to the Ontario border east of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The highway continues through Alberta, running east for as Alberta Highway\u00a01 to Lake Louise, Banff, Canmore, and Calgary. This section of the highway passes through Banff National Park and has significant tourism. The section of Highway\u00a01 through Banff National Park was also one of the first highways in North America to have wildlife crossing structures and fencing installed on it. After leaving the mountains, it enters Alberta's largest city, Calgary, where it becomes known as 16\u00a0Avenue\u00a0N, a busy six-lane street with many signalized intersections. For the next after Calgary, the Trans-Canada Highway continues as a four-lane expressway, with few stops along its route. Medicine Hat is served by a series of six interchanges, after which the Trans-Canada crosses into Saskatchewan on the way to Swift Current and Moose Jaw. The highway mainly travels straight as a four-lane route for most of these sections. The expressway continues east to the city of Regina (Saskatchewan's capital), and skirts around the city on the Regina Bypass, the most expensive infrastructure project in Saskatchewan to date. Beyond Regina, it continues east for , across the border with Manitoba, to the cities of Brandon and Portage la Prairie, and finally east to Manitoba's capital, Winnipeg. The southern portion of Winnipeg's Perimeter Highway (Highway\u00a0100) is part of the Trans-Canada Highway, and bypasses the city with a mix of traffic lights and interchanges, while Highway\u00a01 continues through central Winnipeg as a signalized arterial highway.\nWith the exception of a stretch of two-lane highway just west of the Ontario border, the entire length of Highway\u00a01 through the Prairie Provinces is a four-lane highway. While the only true freeway sections of the route are along the Regina Bypass, in Medicine Hat, and between Calgary and Banff, the whole highway is largely stoplight-free, with \"split\" at-grade intersections forming the vast majority of the junctions.\nThe speed limit is restricted to through national parks in Canada, including Banff National Park. East of Banff, traffic on most of Highway\u00a01 through Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba is limited to , but is east of Winnipeg.\nOntario.\nEast of Winnipeg, the highway continues for over to Kenora, Ontario. At the provincial border, the expressway becomes an arterial highway and the numeric designation of the highway changes from 1 to 17. It is signed with a provincial shield along with a numberless Trans-Canada Highway sign, and continues as an arterial highway along the main route across Northern and Eastern Ontario, until widening out to a freeway at Arnprior, near Ottawa (Canada's capital city). In Kenora, the Trans-Canada designation includes both the main route through the city's urban core and the Highway\u00a017A bypass route to the north. The existing branch from Kenora continues east for to Dryden. This section of highway passes through the Canadian Shield, a rugged, forested area with thousands of lakes. There are many cottage communities along this section of the Trans-Canada Highway, some of which have their driveways directly onto the highway.\nHighway\u00a011/Highway\u00a017 proceeds southeast for to Thunder Bay, then northeast for to Nipigon. Between Thunder Bay and Nipigon, an segment of the Trans-Canada is commemorated as the \"Terry Fox Courage Highway\". Fox was forced to abandon his cross-country Marathon of Hope run here, and a bronze statue of him was later erected in his honour. The highway is the only road that connects eastern and western Canada. On January 10, 2016, the Nipigon River Bridge suffered a mechanical failure, closing the Trans-Canada Highway for 17 hours; the only alternative was to go through the United States, around the south side of Lake Superior.\nHighway\u00a017 proceeds east from Nipigon for along the northern and eastern coast of Lake Superior. Between Wawa and Sault Ste. Marie, the highway crosses the Montreal River Hill, which sometimes becomes a bottleneck on the system in the winter when inclement weather can make the steep grade virtually impassable. At Sault Ste. Marie, the main route turns eastward for to Sudbury.\nThe mainline route then continues east from Sudbury for to North Bay. The northern route rejoins the mainline here, which continues to Arnprior, where it widens to a freeway and becomes Highway\u00a0417. The freeway continues to Ottawa, passing through the city on Highway\u00a0417, which is between six and eight lanes wide at this point. In Southern Ontario, the speed limit is generally on the Trans-Canada Highway, while in Northern Ontario, it is . Sections routed along Highway\u00a0417 outside urban Ottawa feature a higher limit of .\nWhile Highways\u00a017 and 417 are largely free from traffic congestion except for minor rush hour delays on Ottawa's stretch of Highway\u00a0417, the non-freeway sections are subject to frequent closures due to crashes, especially in winter. It is considered a dangerous route due to its extensive outdated sections of winding two-lane highway. Because this section of the highway passes through a largely undeveloped and forested area, collisions with animals are a common cause of crashes. As recently as 2022[ [update]], Sault Ste. Marie's local government has asked for Highway 17 to be expanded north of the city.\nOntario plans to extend the 417 freeway to Sudbury, which will widen the section of the mainline TCH between Ottawa and Sudbury to four-lane freeway standards. However, there is no funding secured for such a project, as Ontario is currently focusing on extending Highway\u00a0400 to Sudbury along the Highway\u00a069 corridor (which is part of the Georgian Bay TCH route).\nIt is notable that the Trans-Canada largely bypasses Canada's most heavily populated region, the Golden Horseshoe area of Southern Ontario, which includes Canada's largest and most populous city; Toronto. However, a short section of the Central Ontario branch does pass through the rural northeastern edge of Durham Region at both Sunderland and Beaverton, which is officially part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Access to Toronto itself from the mainline from Northern Ontario is via the non-TCH southern section of Highway 400, while access from Toronto to Quebec and points east is via Highway 401 (North America's busiest highway and a major national highway in itself), a short non-TCH section of Autoroute 20, and A-30, where the Trans-Canada is joined at A-40 just west of Montreal.\nQuebec.\nFrom Ottawa, the Trans-Canada Highway continues as a freeway and proceeds east to Quebec's largest city, Montreal, as Highway\u00a0417 in Ontario (and the Queensway in Ottawa) and in Quebec. The Trans-Canada assumes the name (also known as \"The Met\" or \"Metropolitan Boulevard\") as it traverses Montreal as an elevated freeway. At the Laurentian Interchange (in Montreal's suburban area), the Abitibi route (Highway\u00a066, Route\u00a0117, A-15) rejoins the main TCH line. The TCH then follows Autoroute\u00a025 southbound, crossing the St. Lawrence River through the 6-lane Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge\u2013Tunnel, and proceeds northeast on Autoroute\u00a020 for to (across from Quebec's capital and second largest city, Quebec City).\nEast of , the Trans-Canada Highway continues on Autoroute\u00a020 following the south bank of the St. Lawrence River to a junction just south of , northeast of Quebec City. At that junction, the highway turns southeast and changes designation to Autoroute\u00a085 for , and then downgrades from a freeway to Route\u00a0185, a non-Autoroute (not limited-access) standard highway for until Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, where Autoroute 85 resumes once again. The portion from Autoroute\u00a020 to Edmundston, New Brunswick is approximately long.\nSince the Trans-Canada Highway for the most part follows Quebec's Autoroute System, which is always composed of a minimum four-lane freeway, travel through Quebec is generally, safe, fast, and congestion-free. The exception is the route through Montreal, which can be prone to traffic congestion. However, drivers can bypass the city on the tolled Autoroute 30, which is not part of the Trans-Canada.\nThe maximum speed limit on the Quebec Autoroute System (including the TCH) is a strictly enforced . However, the speed limit may be lower in select spots, such as through tunnels or major interchanges.\nSince 2018, Quebec has been working on upgrading the , two-lane, undivided section of Trans-Canada Highway along Route\u00a0185 to an Autoroute, with of new freeway commissioned during 2021\u201322, another 10 kilometres in 2024 and the remaining of freeway under construction, with final completion targeted for 2026. Once this project is completed, the disconnected sections of Autoroute 85 will be joined, and all of Quebec's Mainline Trans-Canada Highway route will be minimum four-lane freeway standards. This will also result in the TCH becoming a continuous freeway from Arnprior, Ontario to Lower South River, Nova Scotia.\nNew Brunswick.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway crosses into New Brunswick and becomes Route\u00a02 just northwest of Edmundston. From Edmundston, the highway (again signed exclusively with the TCH shield) follows the Saint John River Valley, running south for to Woodstock (parallelling the Canada\u2013United States border) and then east for another to pass through New Brunswick's capital city, Fredericton. east of Fredericton, the Saint John River turns south, whereby the highway crosses the river at Jemseg and continues heading east to Moncton for another . On November 1, 2007, New Brunswick completed a 20-year effort to convert its entire section of the Trans-Canada Highway into a four-lane, limited-access, divided highway. The highway has a speed limit of on most of its sections in New Brunswick.\nNew Brunswick was the first province where the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway was made entirely into a four-lane, limited-access, divided highway.\nFrom Moncton, the highway continues southeast for to a junction at Aulac close to the New Brunswick\u2013Nova Scotia border (near Sackville). Here, Trans-Canada Highway again splits into two routes, with the main route continuing to the nearby border with Nova Scotia as Route\u00a02, and a route designated as Route\u00a016, which runs east to the Confederation Bridge at Cape Jourimain.\nNova Scotia.\nFrom the New Brunswick border, the main Trans-Canada Highway route continues east into Nova Scotia as Nova Scotia Highway\u00a0104, passing the town of Amherst. Southeast of Amherst (near Thomson Station), the highway traverses the Cobequid Pass, a tolled section ending at Masstown, before passing Truro, where it links with Highway\u00a0102 to Halifax, east of the New Brunswick border. Like Toronto, Halifax is a provincial capital that the Trans-Canada Highway does not pass through. Beyond Truro, the highway continues east for to New Glasgow, where it meets Highway\u00a0106, before continuing to the Canso Causeway, which crosses the Strait of Canso onto Cape Breton Island near Port Hawkesbury. From the Canso Causeway, the highway continues east, now designated as Highway\u00a0105 on Cape Breton Island, until reaching the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal at North Sydney.\nNewfoundland and Labrador.\nFrom North Sydney, a ferry route (operated by the Crown corporation Marine Atlantic) continues the highway to Newfoundland, arriving at Channel-Port aux Basques, whereby the Trans-Canada Highway assumes the designation of Highway\u00a01. The highway runs northeast for through Corner Brook, and travels east for another through Gander. It then travels another southeast, and then northeast. Finally, after across Canada from Victoria, the Trans-Canada Highway finally ends at St. John's. From Channel-Port aux Basques to its eastern terminus in the provincial capital city, the highway travels in total, across the island. The eastern terminus of the highway is at an intersection with Outer Bay Road/White Hills Road and Logy Bay Road. The majority of the Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland is undivided, though sections in Corner Brook, Grand Falls-Windsor, Glovertown, and a section from Whitbourne to St. John's are divided.\n\"Mile zero\".\nAlthough there does not appear to be any nationally sanctioned \"starting point\" for the entire Trans-Canada Highway system, St. John's has adopted this designation for the section of highway running in the city. The foot of East White Hills Road in St. John's, near Logy Bay Road, would be a more precise starting point of the highway, where the road meets and transfers into the start of the Trans-Canada Highway. The terminus of the Trans-Canada Highway in Victoria, British Columbia, at the foot of Douglas Street and Dallas Road at Beacon Hill Park, is also marked by a \"mile zero\" monument. St. John's downtown arena, Mary Brown's Centre, was originally branded under naming rights as \"Mile One Centre\" in reference to the geography of the region.\nThe usage of miles instead of kilometres at both designations dates back to when the Trans-Canada Highway was completed in 1962, prior to metrication in Canada.\nOther routes.\nHighway 16 (Yellowhead Highway).\nThe Yellowhead Highway (YH) is a highway in Western Canada, running from Masset, British Columbia, on Graham Island (in Haida Gwaii), east to where it intersects the main Trans-Canada Highway (Highway\u00a01) just west of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, near Winnipeg (Manitoba's capital). It is designated as Highway\u00a016 in all four provinces that it passes through (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). It follows a more northerly east\u2013west route across Western Canada than the main TCH and passes through fewer cities. Other major municipalities on the route include Prince Rupert, Prince George, Edmonton, Lloydminster, and Saskatoon. The Yellowhead Highway is most well-known for passing through Jasper National Park in Alberta, where it crosses the Continental Divide through its namesake Yellowhead Pass. Since it carries significantly less traffic than its more southerly counterpart, the Yellowhead is almost exclusively a two-lane highway in British Columbia and Manitoba, and is only partially a four-lane expressway in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Until 1990, the Yellowhead Highway had its own unique highway number signs, but they have now mostly been replaced with standard maple-leaf Trans-Canada Highway signs, with numberless Yellowhead shields posted adjacent to them.\nNorthern Ontario &amp; Quebec routes.\nThe section of Highway 71 and Highway 11 between Kenora and North Bay, Ontario, is considered part of the Trans-Canada Highway. This highway first runs south of the Main TCH route between Kenora and Thunder Bay, passing through the town of Fort Frances on the U.S. border. Then, after running concurrently with the main Trans-Canada Highway route, Highway\u00a011 splits off to the north at Nipigon, running through a vast and sparsely populated area of northern Ontario. This highway sees little long-distance traffic compared to the main route, beside heavy transport trucks looking to avoid the significant elevation changes along the Lake Superior route, since it is much flatter and the transit time for heavy hauling is usually the same. The area is also not well-known as a tourist destination outside of fishing tours, which are often fly-in. A much shorter section of Highway\u00a066 connects another northern Trans-Canada Highway route to Quebec's Highway 117, which itself continues the TCH route to Montreal after connecting with Autoroute 15. The main Highway\u00a011 continues south until it intersects the main Trans-Canada Highway route (Highway\u00a017) in North Bay. Except for the southernmost stretches south of Labelle, these highways are two-lane undivided routes.\nCentral Ontario / Georgian Bay route.\nThe southern Ontario Trans-Canada Highway route is even more abstract than the northern ones, as it uses four different provincial highways, and is largely non-functional as a major long distance corridor due to its roundabout route and the complete avoidance of the Toronto area. It is a alternate route to Highway\u00a017 (the mainline TCH) between Sudbury and Ottawa. It passes through several major communities, including Orillia and Peterborough. Because it passes closer to major population centres, this section of the TCH sees higher traffic volumes. It is made up of various sections of freeways, expressways, and two-lane routes.\nPrince Edward Island route.\nAnother spur route of the Trans-Canada Highway splits off the mainline in eastern New Brunswick. This route connects to Prince Edward Island across the Confederation Bridge, crosses the central part of Prince Edward Island, including through the provincial capital of Charlottetown, before crossing back to the mainland on a ferry. This length of the route is 234\u00a0km (145 miles), and consists of New Brunswick Highway\u00a016, Prince Edward Island Highway\u00a01, and Nova Scotia Highway\u00a0106. This leg of the Trans-Canada Highway sees moderately high traffic volumes and is an important tourist route. The Confederation Bridge is often viewed as an attraction in itself. Although the highway is mostly a two-lane route, portions of the route are built as two-lane expressways.\nBypasses.\nTwo short bypasses are also considered part of the Trans-Canada Highway system. These include the Perimeter Highway\u00a0100 bypass around Winnipeg, which provides an expressway standard alternative to the crowded Highway\u00a01 in the city centre, and the two-lane Kenora Bypass (Highway\u00a017A), which is a two-lane route that bypasses the entire town to the north.\nHistory.\nPredecessor routes.\nEarly on, much of the route of the Trans-Canada Highway was first explored in order to construct the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th century, a route which much of the mainline TCH route later ended up following.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway was not the first road across Canada. In British Columbia, the highway was predated by the Crowsnest Highway, the Big Bend Highway, and the Cariboo Highway, all of which were constructed during the Great Depression era. Many of the earlier highways in British Columbia were largely gravel and had many frequent inland ferry crossings at wide rivers and lakes. In Alberta, the section between Calgary and Banff was predated by the Morley Trail (now Highway\u00a01A), which was driveable starting in the 1910s and paved in the 1930s. The first route over the Central Canadian Rockies to connect Calgary to British Columbia was the Banff\u2013Windermere Parkway, which was opened in 1922 and is now numbered as Highway\u00a093. Sections of road across the Prairies have also existed since the 1920s. A gravel road connection across northern Ontario (Highway\u00a017) was constructed starting in 1931. While this section was largely open by the late 1930s, it was not fully completed until 1951 (in large part due to World War II interrupting construction). However, despite the gap, vehicles could still cross the county by getting ferried around the relatively short section of incomplete highway by either rail or water, and Highway 11 was completed to Hearst from the east by 1937 and Nipigon by 1943.\nOpening.\nThe system was approved by the Trans-Canada Highway Act of 1949, with construction commencing in 1950. The highway officially opened in 1962, with the completion of the Rogers Pass section of highway between Golden and Revelstoke. This section of highway bypassed the original Big Bend Highway, the last remaining section of gravel highway on the route. Upon its original completion, the Trans-Canada Highway was the longest uninterrupted highway in the world. Construction on other legs continued until 1971, when the last gap on Highway\u00a016 was completed in the Upper Fraser Valley east of Prince George, at which point the highway network was considered complete.\nSince completion (1960\u20132000).\nWhen the Trans-Canada Highway first opened, it was almost exclusively a two-lane route for its whole length across the country. While at the time it was considered a major improvement to the gravel roads and ferries it replaced, it was soon believed to be insufficient to handle the growing traffic volumes. In response, several provinces began to construct realignments, freeway widenings, and twin sections of highway in response to traffic flow and safety concerns.\nIn British Columbia, the Upper Levels Freeway alignment was opened in 1960 through Metro Vancouver with the completion of the Second Narrows Crossing, which allowed the TCH to bypass downtown Vancouver's streets and the narrow Lions Gate Bridge. The four-lane Upper Levels Freeway was constructed to a relatively low standard, with narrow lanes, low overpasses, and no proper merge ramps. It remains in this state in the present day. Between 1962 and 1964, Highway\u00a01 was rerouted onto a new four-lane freeway bypass between Vancouver and Chilliwack. This section of highway was originally part of British Columbia's own 400 series of highways, until the designation was replaced by Highway\u00a01. A freeway alignment on the Trans-Canada Highway between Chilliwack and Hope opened in 1986. The opening of the Cassiar Tunnel in 1990 bypassed the last sets of signal lights in Vancouver, rendering the whole alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway through the Lower Mainland a freeway. All bypassed sections of the highway were absorbed into various urban and rural road networks. The older freeways in the Lower Mainland were largely built as a parkway design, with wide, forested medians and low overpasses (a road configuration that was common across North America at the time). After the opening of the Coquihalla Highway in 1986, the Trans-Canada Highway through the Fraser Canyon received less traffic, because the freeway bypass shortened the drive between Hope and Kamloops by 90 minutes. However, the route was retained as part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and is considered a scenic route and a valuable part of the Fraser Country Circle Tour. The opening of the Coquihalla was also an economic disaster for many of the towns along the Fraser Canyon section of the Trans-Canada Highway, since most of the travel and tourism business along the route quickly dried up when most of the traffic took the new highway. The towns continue to be largely deprived of wealth, and some are close to being abandoned. On the other hand, Merritt, located midway up the new Coquihalla highway, ended up booming, and continues to grow as a tourism and travel centre. The Coquihalla project also realigned Highway\u00a01 (TCH) to a new freeway bypass around Kamloops. Plans for a freeway to bypass or eliminate traffic congestion and road hazards along the heavily travelled route from Victoria to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island were cancelled during the recession that followed the 1987 stock market crash.\nIn Alberta, between 1964 and 1972, the Trans-Canada Highway was completely rerouted from its former two-lane alignment along the Bow River to a new, more direct, four-lane freeway between Banff and Calgary, resulting in the bypassing of several towns, such as Canmore and Cochrane. Prior to this change, one of the first traffic circles in Canada existed on Highway\u00a01 at the \"gateway\" junction for Banff from at least as early as the 1950s until about 1980 when it was replaced by an interchange. In the rest of Banff National Park, much of the predecessor Highway\u00a01 parkway was bypassed by a new two-lane route in the 1960s. This new route was subsequently twinned in phases beginning in about 1980. The original route between Banff and Lake Louise remains as the Bow Valley Parkway and Lake Louise Drive, while a section over Kicking Horse Pass was abandoned and is now only open to pedestrians and cyclists. Between 1973 and 1990, the highway was twinned from Calgary to the Saskatchewan Border. In 1970, plans were made for a six-to-eight-lane freeway to carry the Trans-Canada Highway though the heart of North Calgary, but the plan was soon dropped due to citizen outcry.\nBetween Ottawa and the Ontario\u2013Quebec border, the Trans-Canada Highway designation was taken from the two-lane Highway\u00a017 and applied to the existing Highway\u00a0417 freeway in 1997\u201398. On April 1, 1997, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred the responsibility of maintenance and upkeep along of Highway\u00a017 east of \"the split\" with Highway\u00a0417 to Trim Road (Regional Road\u00a057) to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, a process commonly referred to as \"downloading\". The Regional Municipality then designated the road as Regional Road\u00a0174. Despite the protests of the region that the route served a provincial purpose, a second round of transfers saw Highway\u00a017 within Ottawa downloaded entirely on January 1, 1998, adding an additional to the length of Regional Road\u00a0174. The highway was also downloaded within the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, where it was redesignated as County Road\u00a017. The result of these transfers was the truncation of Highway\u00a017 at the western end of Highway\u00a0417. 1990 saw the opening of the two-lane Kenora Bypass, providing through traffic with a way to avoid the congested town.\nStarting in the 1960s, Quebec began to build its Autoroute network. Many sections of Trans-Canada Highway were widened to freeway standards during that era of highway construction.\nStarting in 1987, New Brunswick began to widen its section of TCH to four lanes. Work to make the route a full freeway began in the late 1990s and was completed in 2007.\nThe Confederation Bridge connecting PEI to New Brunswick opened in 1997. Replacing the ferry that previously serviced that route, it was hailed as a major accomplishment.\nRecent changes (2000\u2013present).\nIn 2000 and 2001, Transport Canada considered funding an infrastructure project to have the full Trans-Canada system converted to limited-access divided highways. Although construction funding was made available to some provinces for portions of the system, the federal government ultimately decided to not pursue a comprehensive limited-access highway conversion. Opposition to funding the limited-access widening was due to low traffic levels on parts of the Trans-Canada Highway.\nPrior to the start of the Great Recession in 2008, the highway underwent some changes through the Rocky Mountains from Banff National Park to Golden, British Columbia. A major piece of this project was completed on August 30, 2007, with the new Park Bridge and Ten Mile Hill sections opening up of new four-lane highway. Other smaller four-lane widening projects on the Trans-Canada Highway in the interior of British Columbia were also built around the same time. As part of the Gateway Program, of congested four-lane Highway\u00a01 freeway in Metro Vancouver were widened to an eight-lane buildout starting in 2012. This project continues into the present, with the current goal of rebuilding the freeway to a minimum six-lane layout from Langley to Abbotsford by 2025.\nThe twinning of the highway in Alberta's Banff National Park continued, with the final of Highway\u00a01 between Lake Louise and the British Columbia border opened to traffic on June 12, 2014, making the whole length of Alberta's main Trans-Canada Highway route a minimum four lanes. Stoney Trail began construction in 2005, and was usable as a bypass around Calgary when its northeastern section opened in 2010. Although not officially part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, Stoney Trail plays a critical role in providing through traffic on the Trans-Canada Highway with a way around the city.\nDuring the 2000s, much of the Trans-Canada Highway through Saskatchewan and Manitoba was twinned. In 2019, the Regina Bypass opened, resulting in the Trans-Canada Highway being realigned around the city and bypassing a section of heavily signalized arterial road on Victoria Avenue.\nThe 2010s saw changes to other routes in the Trans-Canada Highway system as well. Ontario Highway\u00a0400 began to be extended towards Sudbury, replacing Highway\u00a069 and resulting in a freeway alignment for part of the Southern Ontario Trans-Canada Highway Route. Work on this project is continuing, with almost of freeway currently under construction.\nEdmonton is currently attempting to widen its urban section of Highway\u00a016 to a six-lane freeway. Large amounts of Highway\u00a016 in Alberta were twinned during the 2000s.\nDespite these many widenings, over half of the mainline Trans-Canada highway still remains in its original two-lane state, and only about 15% of the mainline's length is composed of freeway comparable to that of the Interstate Highway System.\nIn 2012, a series of free public electric vehicle charging stations were installed along the main route of the highway by a private company, Sun Country Highway, permitting electric vehicle travel across the entire length, as demonstrated by the company's president, Kent Rathwell, in a publicity trip from St John's, NL, to Victoria, BC, in a Tesla Roadster. As of 2012[ [update]], this made the TCH the longest electric-vehicle-ready highway in the world.\nFuture.\nNo national plan for widening the Trans-Canada Highway exists, and all planning is currently done by the individual provinces, as the Trans-Canada Highway and highways within National Highway System fall within provincial/territorial jurisdiction, with provincial/territorial governments responsible for planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and financing.\u00a0 However, the federal government may contribute funding to highway projects through its various funding programs. Currently, there are five large-scale highway projects on the Trans-Canada Highway Network.\nQuebec is working on completing Autoroute 85, bringing the last two-lane section of the mainline highway in Quebec up to four-lane freeway standards. As of \u00a02021[ [update]], only of two-lane highway had not yet been addressed. The rest either had been completed or was currently under construction.\nIn Ontario, the province has several significant highway expansion projects on the Trans-Canada Highway planned or under way:\nIn Manitoba in May 2023, the province announced the launch of a conceptual design study for the twinning of the remaining two-lane section of Highway 1 west of the Ontario border, plus the immediate construction of a section to align with four-laning work in Ontario.\nAs of \u00a02021[ [update]], British Columbia was planning on widening the long section of TCH between Kamloops and Alberta to four lanes by 2050. The project goals do not include an eventual freeway conversion, and it is likely that the signalized sections of highway in Kamloops, Salmon Arm, Revelstoke, and Golden will remain. Around of four-lane highway were under construction, with more planned to start in 2022. Around a quarter of the length of highway between Kamloops and Alberta is now four lanes wide. At the current rate of construction, the project will likely not be completed until the 2070s. However, some of the most difficult sections have been completed, meaning that it may be easier to widen the remaining sections of highway to four lanes. Some of the highway in this section is under the jurisdiction of Parks Canada, specifically the sections through Mount Revelstoke, Glacier, and Yoho National Parks, which means that Parks Canada will have to implement its own four-lane program in order for the provincial government to accomplish its goal.\nThe City of Edmonton is changing its urban section of Highway 16 (TCH) to a six-lane freeway by replacing all signal lights with overpasses. The route is already largely a freeway, but seven signalized intersections remain. The project is expected to be finished by 2026.\nAs of \u00a02021[ [update]], British Columbia was planning on widening of Highway 1 in the Lower Mainland as part of its Fraser Valley Highway program. The four-lane freeway is over-congested, and many of the overpasses are in poor shape. The project intends to rebuild most of the interchanges and overpasses and widen the highway to six lanes. The first of this project opened in 2020, with more expected to be complete in 2025.\nApart from the major programs, many smaller-scale projects exist on the highway in order to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure or make minor traffic changes.\nAlberta had long term plans to convert both of its Trans-Canada Highway routes to a minimum four-lane freeway standard, but has not set a timeline for doing so.\nBicycling.\nMost of the Trans-Canada Highway (except a few sections of exceptionally heavy motorized traffic) is a popular bike tour route.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The flag was first sighted in 1848 in the German Confederation. The flag was also used by the German Empire from 1848 to 1849. It was officially adopted as the national flag of the German Reich (during the period of the Weimar Republic) from 1919 to 1933, and has been in use since its reintroduction in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949.\nSince the mid-19th century, Germany has had two competing traditions of national colours, black-red-gold and black-white-red. Black-red-gold were the colours of the 1848\u20131849 Revolutions, the Weimar Republic of 1919\u20131933 and the Federal Republic (since 1949). They were also adopted by the German Democratic Republic (1949\u20131990).\nThe colours black-white-red appeared for the first time in 1867 in the constitution of the North German Confederation. This nation state for Prussia and other north and central German States was expanded to the south German states in 1870\u201371, under the name German Empire. It kept these colours until the revolution of 1918\u201319. Thereafter, black-white-red became a symbol of the political right. The Nazis (National Socialist German Worker's Party) re-established these colours along with the party's own swastika flag in 1933. After World War II, black-white-red was still used by some conservative groups or by groups of the far right, as it is not forbidden, unlike specific Nazi symbols such as the aforementioned swastika.\nBlack-red-gold is the official flag of the Federal Republic of Germany. As an official symbol of the constitutional order, it is protected against defamation. According to \u00a790a of the German penal code, the consequences are a fine or imprisonment up to three years.\nOrigins.\nThe German association with the colours black, red, and gold surfaced in the radical 1840s, when the black-red-gold flag was used to symbolise the movement against the Conservative Order, which was established in Europe after Napoleon's defeat.\nThere are many theories in circulation regarding the origins of the colour scheme used in the 1848 flag. It has been proposed that the colours were those of the Jena Students' League (), one of the radically minded banned by in the Carlsbad Decrees. The colours are mentioned in their canonical order in the seventh verse of August Daniel von Binzer's student song (\"On the Dissolution of the Jena Students' League\") quoted by in his \"Academic Festival Overture\". Another claim goes back to the uniforms (mainly black with red facings and gold buttons) of the L\u00fctzow Free Corps, which were mostly worn by university students and were formed during the struggle against the occupying forces of Napoleon. Whatever the true explanation, those colours soon came to be regarded as the national colours of Germany during that brief period. Especially after their reintroduction during the Weimar period, they became synonymous with liberalism in general. (The colours also appear in the medieval .)\nFlag variants.\nCivil flag.\nThe German national flag or (), containing only the black-red-gold tricolour, was introduced as part of the (West) German constitution in 1949. Following the creation of separate government and military flags in later years, the plain tricolour is now used as the German civil flag and civil ensign. This flag is also used by non-federal authorities to show their connection to the federal government, e.g. the authorities of the German states use the German national flag together with their own flag.\nGovernment flag.\nThe government flag of Germany is officially known as the (state flag of the federal authorities) or for short. It was introduced in 1950. It is the civil flag defaced with the (\"Federal Shield\"), which overlaps with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. The is a variant of the coat of arms of Germany, whose main differences are the illustration of the eagle and the shape of the shield: the is rounded at the base, whereas the standard coat of arms is pointed.\nThe government flag may only be used by federal government authorities and its use by others is an offence, punishable with a fine. However, public use of flags similar to the (e.g. using the actual coat of arms instead of the ) is tolerated, and such flags are sometimes seen at international sporting events.\nVertical flags.\nIn addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings in Germany use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag (and usually the flag of the state they are in and the flag of the European Union) in this way; many town flags in Germany exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified. In 1996, a layout for the vertical version of the government flag was established, that coincidentally matched the pattern of the \"conventional\" black-red-gold flag of the Principality of Reuss-Gera () from 1806 to 1918: the is displayed in the centre of the flag, overlapping with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. When hung like a banner or draped, the black band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the black band must face the staff. The only type of vertical flag that can be flown under the Federal Government Decree is a banner. Flags in vertical format, vertical flags with outrigger and hanging flags are not permitted.\nMilitary flags.\nSince the German armed forces () are a federal authority, the is also used as the German war flag on land. In 1956, the (Flag of the German Navy) was introduced: the government flag ending in swallowtail. This naval flag is also used as a navy jack.\nDesign.\nArticle 22 of the German constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, states:\nThe federal flag shall be black, red and gold.\nFollowing specifications set by the West German government in 1950, the flag displays three bars of equal width and has a width\u2013length ratio of 3:5; the tricolour used during the Weimar Republic had a ratio of 2:3.\nAt the time of the adoption of the flag there were no exact colour specifications other than \"Black-Red-Gold\". However on 2 June 1999, the federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the German government which defined the specifications of the official colours as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe flag is blazoned in English as, \"Tierced in fess sable, gules and or.\"\nColour.\nVexillology rarely distinguishes between gold and yellow; in heraldry, they are both \"Or\". For the German flag, such a distinction is made: the colour used in the flag is called gold, not yellow.\nWhen the black\u2013red\u2013gold tricolour was adopted by the Weimar Republic as its flag, it was attacked by conservatives, monarchists, and the far right, who referred to the colours with spiteful nicknames such as (black\u2013red\u2013yellow) or even (black\u2013red\u2013mustard). When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the black\u2013white\u2013red colours of pre-1918 Imperial Germany were swiftly reintroduced, and their propaganda machine continued to discredit the , using the same derogatory terms as previously used by the monarchists.\nOn 24 December 1951, the Federal Court of Justice () stated that the usage of \"black\u2013red\u2013yellow\" and the like had \"through years of Nazi agitation, attained the significance of a malicious slander against the democratic symbols of the state\" and was now an offence. As summarised by heraldist Arnold Rabbow in 1968, \"the German colours are black\u2013red\u2013yellow but they are called black\u2013red\u2013gold.\"\nFlag-flying days.\nThere are a number of flag-flying days in Germany. Following federal decree on 22 March 2005, the flag must be flown from public buildings on the following dates. Only 1 May and 3 October are public holidays.\nElection days for the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in addition to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).\nHistory.\nMedieval period.\nThe Holy Roman Empire (800/962 \u2013 1806, known as the \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" after 1512) did not have a national flag, but black and gold were used as colours of the Holy Roman Emperor and featured in the imperial banner: a black eagle on a golden background. After the late 13th or early 14th century, the claws and beak of the eagle were coloured red. From the early 15th century, a double-headed eagle was used.The colours red and white were also significant during this period. When the Holy Roman Empire took part in the Crusades, a war flag was flown alongside the black-gold imperial banner. This flag, known as the \"Saint George Flag\", was a white cross on a red background: the reverse of the St George's Cross used as the flag of England, and similar to the flag of Denmark.\nRed and white were also colours of the Hanseatic League (13th\u201317th century). Hanseatic trading ships were identifiable by their red-white pennants, and most Hanseatic cities adopted red and white as their city colours (see Hanseatic flags). Red and white still feature as the colours of many former Hanseatic cities such as Hamburg or Bremen.\nPrincipality of Reuss-Greiz.\nWhen Heinrich XI, Prince Reuss of Greiz was appointed by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor to rule the then-new Principality of Reuss-Greiz on 12 May 1778, the flag adopted by the \"F\u00fcrstentum Reu\u00df-Greiz\" was the first-ever appearance of the black-red-gold tricolour in its modern arrangement in any sovereign state within what today comprises Germany \u2013 the Reuss elder line that ruled the principality used a flag whose proportions were close to a \"nearly square\"-shape 4:5 hoist/fly ratio, instead of the modern German flag's 3:5 figure.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nIn 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte declared the First French Empire. In response to this, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of the Habsburg dynasty declared his personal domain to be the Austrian Empire and became Francis I of Austria. Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, the flag of the Austrian Empire was black and gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the flag of Austria until 1918.\nWith the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, many of its dukes and princes joined the Confederation of the Rhine, a confederation of Napoleonic client states. These states preferred to use their own flags. The confederation had no flag of its own; instead it used the blue-white-red flag of France and the Imperial Standard of its protector, Napoleon.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the German struggle against the occupying French forces was significantly symbolised by the colours of black, red, and gold, which became popular after their use in the uniforms of the L\u00fctzow Free Corps, a volunteer unit of the Prussian Army. This unit had uniforms in black with red facings and gold buttons. The colour choice had pragmatic origins, even though black-red-gold were the former colours used by the Holy Roman Empire. At the time, the colours represented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Out of the blackness (black) of servitude through bloody (red) battles to the golden (gold) light of freedom\".\nMembers of the corps were required to supply their own clothing: in order to present a uniform appearance it was easiest to dye all clothes black. Gold-coloured buttons were widely available, and pennons used by the lancers in the unit were red and black. As the members of this unit came from all over Germany and included a modest but well known number of university students and academics, the L\u00fctzow Free Corps and their colours gained considerable exposure among the German people. \nGerman Confederation.\nThe 1815\u201316 Congress of Vienna led to the creation of the German Confederation, a loose union of all remaining German states after the Napoleonic Wars. The Confederation was created as a replacement for the now-extinct Holy Roman Empire, with Francis I of Austria\u2014the last Holy Roman Emperor\u2014as its president. The confederation did not have a flag of its own, although the black-red-gold tricolour is sometimes mistakenly attributed to it.\nUpon returning from the war, veterans of the L\u00fctzow Free Corps founded the fraternity in Jena in June 1815. The Jena eventually adopted a flag with three equal horizontal bands of red, black, and red, with gold trim and a golden oak branch across the black band, following the colours of the uniforms of the Free Corps. The famous gymnast and student union (\"\") founder Friedrich Ludwig Jahn proposed a black-red-gold banner for the Burschen. Some members interpreted the colours as a rebirth of the Imperial black-yellow colours embellished with the red of liberty or the blood of war. More radical students exclaimed that the colours stood for the black night of slavery, the bloody struggle for liberty, and the golden dawn of freedom. In a memoir, Anton Probsthan of Mecklenburg, who served in the L\u00fctzow Free Corps, claimed his relative Fraulein Nitschke of Jena presented the Burschenschaft with a flag at the time of its foundation, and for this purpose chose the black-red-and-gold colours of the defunct secret society \"Vandalia\".\nSince the students who served in the L\u00fctzow Free Corps came from various German states, the idea of a unified German state began to gain momentum within the and similar Burschenschaft that were subsequently formed throughout the Confederation. On 18 October 1817, the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, hundreds of fraternity members and academics from across the Confederation states met in Wartburg in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (in modern Thuringia), calling for a free and unified German nation.\nThe gold-red-black flag of the Jena featured prominently at this Wartburg festival. Therefore, the colours black, red, and gold eventually became symbolic of this desire for a unified German state. The Ministerial Council of the German Confederation, in its determination to maintain the status quo, enacted the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819 that banned all student organisations, officially putting an end to the .\nIn May 1832, around 30,000 people demonstrated at the Hambach Festival for freedom, unity, and civil rights. The colours black, red, and gold had become a well established symbol for the liberal, democratic and republican movement within the German states since the Wartburg Festival, and flags in these colours were flown en masse at the Hambach Festival. While contemporary illustrations showed prominent use of a gold-red-black tricolour (an upside-down version of the modern German flag), surviving flags from the event were in black-red-gold. Such an example is the , the flag flown from Hambach Castle during the festival: a black-red-gold tricolour where the red band contains the inscription (Germany's rebirth). This flag is now on permanent display at the castle.\nRevolution and the Frankfurt Parliament.\nIn the Springtime of the Peoples during the Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries took to the streets, many flying the tricolour. The Confederation's Bundestag, alarmed by the events, hasted to adopt the tricolour (9 March 1848). Liberals took power and made the Bundestag call for general elections for a German parliament, the national assembly. This Frankfurt Parliament declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.\nIn May 1849, the larger states actively fought the revolution and the Frankfurt parliament. In late 1850, the German Confederation was definitely restored under Austrian-Prussian leadership. The tricolour remained official but was no longer used before 1863 at a conference of the German governments. Afterwards, the most pressing issue was whether or not to include Austria in any future German nation, as Austria's status as a multi-ethnic empire complicated the dream of a united Greater Germany\u2014the solution. Alternatively, there was the (Lesser German) solution for a Germany that encompassed only German lands and excluded Austria. The Prussian\u2013Austrian duality within the Confederation eventually led to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. During the war, the southern states allied with Austria adopted the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, and the 8th German Army Corps also wore black-red-gold armbands. The Kingdom of Prussia and its predominately north German allies defeated Austria and made way for the realisation of the Lesser German solution a few years later. \nNorth German Confederation and the German Empire (1867\u20131918).\nFollowing the dissolution of the German Confederation, Prussia formed its unofficial successor, the North German Confederation, in 1866 with the signing of the Confederation Treaty in August 1866 and then the ratification of the Constitution of 1867. This national state consisted of Prussia, the largest member state, and 21 other north German states.\nThe question regarding what flag should be adopted by the new confederation was first raised by the shipping sector and its desire to have an internationally recognisable identity. Virtually all international shipping that belonged to the confederation originated from either Prussia or the three Hanseatic city-states of Bremen, Hamburg, and L\u00fcbeck. Based on this, Adolf Soetbeer, secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, suggested in the on 22 September 1866 that any planned flag should combine the colours of Prussia (black and white) with the Hanseatic colours (red and white). In the following year, the constitution of the North German Confederation was enacted, where a horizontal black-white-red tricolour was declared to be both the civil and war ensign.\nKing Wilhelm I of Prussia was satisfied with the colour choice: the red and white were also taken to represent the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the Imperial elector state that was a predecessor of the Kingdom of Prussia. The absence of gold from the flag also made it clear that this German state did not include the \"black and gold\" monarchy of Austria. In the Franco-Prussian War, the remaining southern German states allied with the North German Confederation, leading to the unification of Germany. A new constitution of 1871 gave the federal state the new name of German Empire and the Prussian king the title of Emperor. The German Empire retained black, white, and red as its national colours. An ordinance of 1892 dealt with the official use of the colours.\nThe black-white-red tricolour remained the flag of Germany until the end of the German Empire in 1918, in the final days of World War I.\nA visually near-identical flag was used as the national flag of the Republic of Upper Volta, adopted upon the country's independence in 1958 and used until 1984, when the nation was overthrown and re-established as Burkina Faso.\nWeimar Republic (1918\u20131933).\nFollowing the declaration of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called Weimar Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the Weimar Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz, where the use and layout of the \"schwarz-rot-gold\" design had originated some 140 years earlier, Reuss-Gera, Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the 1778-established tradition, and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.\nThis change was not welcomed by many people in Germany, who saw this new flag as a symbol of humiliation following Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (\"see Colour above\"). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.\nThe symbols of Imperial Germany became symbols of monarchist and nationalist protest and were often used by monarchist and nationalist organisations (e.g. \"Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten\"). This included the (war flag of the Reich), which has been revived in the present for similar use. Many nationalist political parties during the Weimar period\u2014such as the German National People's Party (see poster) and the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party)\u2014used the imperial colours, a practice that has continued today with the National Democratic Party of Germany.\nOn 24 February 1924, the organisation was founded in Magdeburg by the member parties of the Weimar Coalition (Centre, DDP, SPD) and the trade unions. This organisation was formed to protect the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic, which was under constant pressure by both the far right and far left. Through this organisation, the black-red-gold flag became not only a symbol of German democracy, but also of resistance to political extremism. This was summarised by the organisation's first chairman, Otto H\u00f6rsing, who described their task as a \"struggle against the swastika and the Soviet star\".\nIn the face of the increasingly violent conflicts between the communists and Nazis, the growing polarisation of the German population and a multitude of other factors, mainly the drastic economic sinking, extreme hyperinflation and corruption of the republic, the Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 with the Nazi seizure of power () and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor.\nNazi Germany and World War II (1933\u20131945).\nAfter Adolf Hitler became leader on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was banned; a ruling on 12 March established two legal flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour national flag and the flag of the Nazi Party.\nOn 15 September 1935, one year after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's elevation to the position of \"F\u00fchrer\", the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the \"\"Bremen\" incident\" of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS \"Bremen\", tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law\u200a was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann G\u00f6ring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a bygone era and under threat of being used by \"reactionaries\".\nThe design of the Nazi flag was introduced by Hitler as the party flag in mid-1920, roughly a year before he became his political party's leader: a flag with a red background, a white disk and a black swastika in the middle. In \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler explained the process by which the Nazi flag design was created: It was necessary to use the same colours as Imperial Germany, because in Hitler's opinion they were \"revered colours expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation.\" The most important requirement was that \"the new flag\u00a0... should prove effective as a large poster\" because \"in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.\" Nazi propaganda clarified the symbolism of the flag: the red colour stood for the social, white for the movement's national thinking, and the swastika for the victory of Aryan humanity.\nAn off-centred disk version of the swastika flag was used as the civil ensign on German-registered civilian ships and was used as the jack on (the name of the German Navy, 1933\u20131945) warships. The flags for use on sea had a through and through image, so the reverse side had a \"left-facing\" swastika; the national flag was right-facing on both sides.\nFrom 1933 to at least 1938, the Nazis sometimes \"sanctified\" swastika flags by touching them with the (blood flag), the swastika flag used by Nazi paramilitaries during the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. This ceremony took place at every Nuremberg Rally. It is unknown whether this tradition was continued after the last Nuremberg rally in 1938.\nAt the end of World War II, the first law enacted by the Allied Control Council abolished all Nazi symbols and repealed all relevant laws. The possession of swastika flags is forbidden in several countries since then, with the importation or display of them forbidden particularly in Germany.\nAfter World War II (1945\u20131949).\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War II, the country was placed under Allied administration. Although there was neither a national German government nor a German flag, German ships were required by international law to have a national ensign of some kind. As a provisional civil ensign of Germany, the Council designated the international signal pennant Charlie representing the letter C ending in a swallowtail, known as the C-Pennant (). The Council ruled that \"no ceremony shall be accorded this flag which shall not be dipped in salute to warships or merchant ships of any nationality\". Similarly, the Japanese civil ensign used immediately following World War II was the signal pennant for the letter E ending in a swallowtail, and the Ry\u016bky\u016ban civil ensign was a swallowtailed letter D signal pennant. \nWest of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, the German states were reorganised along the lines of the zones of occupation, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the northern halves of the former states of W\u00fcrttemberg and Baden were merged to form W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in 1946. As its flag, W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to W\u00fcrttemberg's colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden's colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could be mistaken for a combination of the two flags. In 1952, W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, whose flag is black and gold.\nTwo other states that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour combinations from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led to the use of the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly to any one of the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.\nDivided Germany (1949\u20131990).\nWith relations deteriorating between the Soviet Union and the United States, the three western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation and allow the formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany.\nDuring the preparation of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections to the creation of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.\nProposed designs.\nWhile there were other suggestions for the new flag for West Germany, the final choice was between two designs, both using black-red-gold. The Social Democrats proposed the re-introduction of the old Weimar flag, while the conservative parties such as the CDU/CSU and the German Party proposed a suggestion by Ernst Wirmer, a member of the (parliamentary council) and future advisor of chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Wirmer suggested a variant of the 1944 \"Resistance\" flag (using the black-red-gold scheme in a Nordic Cross pattern) designed by his brother and 20 July co-conspirator Josef. The tricolour was ultimately selected, largely to illustrate the continuity between the Weimar Republic and this new German state. With the enactment of the (West) German constitution on 23 May 1949, the black-red-gold tricolour was readopted as the flag for the Federal Republic of Germany.\nIn 1955, the inhabitants of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a blue and red background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar to be a part of West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.\nWhile the use of black-red-gold had been suggested in the Soviet zone in 1946, the Second People's Congress in 1948 decided to adopt the old black-white-red tricolour as a national flag for East Germany. This choice was based on the use of these colours by the National Committee for a Free Germany, a German anti-Nazi organisation that operated in the Soviet Union in the last two years of the war. In 1949, following a suggestion from Friedrich Ebert, Jr., the black-red-gold tricolour was instead selected as the flag of the German Democratic Republic upon the formation of this state on 7 October 1949. From 1949 to 1959, the flags of both West and East Germany were identical. On 1 October 1959, the East German government changed its flag with the addition of its coat of arms. In West Germany, these changes were seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the two Germanies. Displaying this flag in West Germany and West Berlin\u2014where it became known as the (divider-flag)\u2014was seen as a breach of the constitution and subsequently banned until the late 1960s.\nFrom 1956 to 1964, West and East Germany attended the Winter and Summer Olympic Games as a single team, known as the United Team of Germany. After the East German national flag was changed in 1959, neither country accepted the flag of the other. As a compromise, a new flag was used by the United Team of Germany from 1960 to 1964, featuring the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with white Olympic rings in the red stripe. In 1968 the teams from the two German states entered separately, but both used the same German Olympic flag. From 1972 to 1988, the separate West and East German teams used their respective national flags.\n1990\u2013present.\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans removed the coat of arms from their flags to imply the plain black-red-gold tricolour symbolic of a united Germany. The widespread act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.\nThe old black-white-red tricolour of the German Empire is still used by monarchists and those members of German royalty who long for the peaceful reintroduction of a German democratic monarchy. This use of the old flag is almost completely overshadowed by its prevalent use by the far right, however; since the aforementioned ban on all Nazi symbolism (e.g. the swastika), the \"Schutzstaffel's\" (SS) double sig rune, etc.) is still in effect within today's Germany, the far right have been forced to forgo any Nazi flags and instead use the old imperial flag, which the Nazis themselves banned in 1935.In Germany, the use of the flag and other national symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since World War II \u2013 a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against nationalistic fervour in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany and in which the Germany national team made a deep run into the knockout rounds (being eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual winners Italy), public use of the national flag increased drastically. This explosion in the flag's occurrence in day-to-day life was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension. The decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed by the end of the tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike. As many Germans regarded showing their flag as part of support for their own team in the tournament, most flags disappeared after the end of a tournament, sometimes due to administrative decisions.\nBy the time of Germany's World Cup victory in 2014, usage of the German flag had been increasing sporadically. In the following period the display of the German flag colours, even outside stadiums, was regularly limited to the period of major sporting events.\nWith the rise of nationalist currents, however, (Pegida, AfD, etc.) and their showing of the German flag as a symbol of their nationalism, the flag again became more widespread but remained somewhat contentious in everyday life. Mainstream society remains hesitant to use the colours.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Meigs Field Airport (pronounced , formerly ) was a single-runway airport in Chicago, named for newspaper publisher and aviation enthusiast Merrill C. Meigs. It was located on Northerly Island, an artificial peninsula in Lake Michigan, and was operational from 1948 to 2003.\nConstructed to accommodate demand for general aviation following World War II, Meigs Field also served regional commercial air travel. With its proximity to downtown Chicago, it quickly became the busiest single-strip airport in the United States, adding an air traffic tower in 1952, and a terminal in 1961.\nIt became widely familiar when it was featured as the default airport in early versions of the \"Microsoft Flight Simulator\" software.\nSeeking to repurpose the land as a park, mayor Richard M. Daley forced its abrupt closure in 2003 by ordering the overnight destruction of its runway.\nHistory.\nConstruction.\nNortherly Island, owned by the Chicago Park District, is the only lakefront structure to be built based on Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The Plan of Chicago had no provision for air service. The island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment by all. Northerly Island was also the site of the Century of Progress (1933\u201334) in Chicago. Chicago's first airplane flight took place in 1910 in Grant Park, adjacent to Northerly Island, with an international aeronautical exhibition at the same location in 1911. Then, in 1918, regular air mail service to Grant Park began. Nonetheless, Grant Park was unsuitable for the city's growing aviation needs.\nBurnham died in 1912. By 1916, Edward H. Bennett, co-author of the Plan of Chicago, wrote that a lakefront location would be most suitable for an airport serving the central business district. In 1920, Chicagoans approved a bond referendum to pay for landfill construction of the peninsula, and in 1922 construction began. That same year Mayor William Hale Thompson recommended locating the downtown airport there. A few years later the Chicago South Park Commission voted in agreement. In 1928, the Chicago Association of Commerce, representing the business community, also advocated for the lakefront airport.\nThe Great Depression put numerous civic plans on hold, including the airport. Construction continued on the peninsula itself, with the 1933 World's Fair occupying the just-completed peninsula. In the 1930s, the Chicago City Council and Illinois State Legislature passed resolutions to create the airport, but both the poor economy and World War II intervened.\nOperations.\nAlmost immediately after World War II, in 1946, airport construction began. That same year the Illinois state legislature deeded of adjacent lake bottom to Chicago for additional landfill, to make the property large enough for a suitable runway. Aviation technology had advanced rapidly during World War II. The airport opened on December 10, 1948, in a grand ceremony.\nOn June 30, 1950, the airport was officially renamed Merrill C. Meigs Field, named after Merrill C. Meigs, publisher of the \"Chicago Herald and Examiner\" and an aviation advocate. Various improvements took place over the years, including the 1952 opening of an air traffic control tower, the 1961 opening of a new terminal building (dedicated by Richard J. Daley), runway lengthening, and the late 1990s charting of two FAA instrument approaches allowing landings in poor weather conditions. By the 1970s Meigs Field became a critical facility for aeromedical transport of patients and transplant organs to downtown hospitals as medical transportation technology modernized. Corporate aircraft also used the airfield including Cessna Citation and Dassault Falcon 10 business jets, and Beechcraft King Air and Grumman Gulfstream I business propjets.\nThe Main Terminal Building was operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly . In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south end of the runway, near McCormick Place. The north end of the runway was near the Adler Planetarium.\nMeigs Field also provided commuter airline service to the public, peaking in the late 1980s as Mayor Richard M. Daley took office. During the mid-1950s, Illini Airlines was operating scheduled passenger service between the airport and Freeport, IL, Madison, WI, Rockford, IL and Sterling, IL with de Havilland Dove and Piper Navajo twin engine prop aircraft. From the 1960s to early 1990s, typical intrastate destinations were Springfield, IL and Carbondale, IL. Small airliners such as Beechcraft Model 99, Beechcraft 1900C, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Fairchild Swearingen Metro III turboprops as well as Piper PA-31 Navajo prop aircraft were operated on a scheduled basis into the airport. In 1968, Gopher Airlines was operating nonstop service between the airport and Minneapolis/St. Paul with Beechcraft 99 turboprops. In the mid- and late 1970s Air Illinois operated 44-passenger seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops into Meigs. The HS 748 was the largest aircraft to use Meigs on a regular basis for scheduled passenger airline operations. Ozark Air Lines, a large local service airline in the midwest that primarily operated McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jets and Fairchild Hiller FH-227B propjets at the time, served the airport during the early 1970s with DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops with up to eight round trip nonstop flights a day between Meigs and the Illinois state capital in Springfield. Other commuter air carriers serving Meigs Field in 1975 included Midwest Commuter Airways with nonstop flights to Indianapolis and South Bend, and Skystream Airlines with nonstops to Detroit City Airport with both small airlines operating Beechcraft 99 commuter turboprops.\nScheduled passenger helicopter airline service was also available between Meigs Field and Chicago O'Hare Airport and Chicago Midway Airport at different times over the years. From the late 1950s to late 1960s, Chicago Helicopter Airways operated 12-seat Sikorsky S-58C helicopters with frequent flights to both O'Hare and Midway.\nNumerous VIPs used the airport in order to maintain security and also to avoid inconveniencing the Chicago traveling public, including President John F. Kennedy. In a common pattern, Air Force One would land at a larger area airport, and the President would then take the Marine One helicopter to Meigs Field to avoid the complications of a Secret Service escort via Chicago's expressways.\nOn October 15, 1992, a Boeing 727-100 jetliner donated from United Airlines to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry made its final landing at Meigs, on its way to be transported to the museum to become an exhibit. This was notable because Meigs' runway was considerably shorter than other airfields the aircraft normally used. Still, the lightly loaded jet did not require all of the runway. The 727 was then barged off the airport, prepared for exhibit and further barged to the museum.\nStarting in the early 1990s, the Chicago-area Tuskegee Airmen, Inc provided free airplane rides every month and aviation education to Chicago youth at Meigs Field. Thousands of children took their first airplane rides there until 2003.\nHistorical airline service.\nThe following are the main air carriers that operated scheduled passenger service from Meigs Field to Springfield, IL:\nSmaller carriers that briefly provided service from Meigs to other cities include:\nAccording to the February 1, 1976, edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), two airlines were serving Meigs Field at this time: Air Illinois and Skystream Airlines. Air Illinois was operating the 44-seat HS-748 turboprop into the airport at this time with nonstop flights to Springfield, IL and continuing no change of plane service to Alton, IL and Carbondale, IL. Skystream Airlines was operating Beechcraft 99 commuter turboprops on a nonstop and direct flights to Detroit Metro Airport, Indianapolis, IN and South Bend, IN.\nThe September 15, 1994, edition of the OAG reported that three air carriers were serving Meigs Field with scheduled passenger flights: Great Lakes Aviation operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines, Trans States Airlines flying as Trans World Express on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Blade Helicopters. Great Lakes was operating Beechcraft 1900C turboprops on its nonstop service to Lansing, MI, and Springfield, IL and was also flying one stop direct service to Quincy, IL. Trans States served Springfield, IL nonstop with Swearingen Metro III propjets. Blade Helicopters was operating Eurocopter AS350 \"AStar\" turbine powered helicopters on a high frequency shuttle schedule with 39 flights every weekday to Chicago O'Hare Airport and 12 flights every weekday to Chicago Midway Airport.\nDemolition and closure.\nIn 1994, Mayor Richard M. Daley announced plans to close the airport and build a park in its place. Northerly Island, where the airport was located, was owned by the Chicago Park District, which refused to renew the airport lease in 1996. The city briefly closed the airport from the expiration of the lease in October 1996 through February 1997, when pressure from the state legislature persuaded them to reopen the airport.\nOn the night of March 30, 2003, Mayor Daley ordered city crews to make the runway unusable by bulldozing large X-shaped gouges into the runway surface in the middle of the night. This resulted in several aircraft being stranded on the ground at the airport; these were later allowed to depart from Meigs' taxiway.\n\"To do this any other way would have been needlessly contentious,\" Mayor Daley claimed at a news conference on March 31. Daley defended his actions by claiming it would save the City of Chicago the effort of further court battles before the airport could close. He claimed the closure was due to safety concerns, in particular the post-September 11 risk of terrorist-controlled aircraft attacking the downtown waterfront near Meigs Field.\n\"The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field,\" according to \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Eric Zorn. \"He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could,\" columnist John Kass wrote of Daley in the \"Tribune\".\nWhile aviation interests and commentators decried the move, supporters of the park believed it was in the city's best interest for the land to be a park. For example, the Lake Michigan Federation (later the Alliance for the Great Lakes) released in February 2001 an urban wilderness plan for the site. Instead of calling it \"Northerly Island\" a reference to the northernmost landmass of four others that were never built under the 1909 Plan of Chicago, \"Sanctuary Point\" would allow access for many more people than the fairly exclusive use as an airstrip.\nOn July 28, 2003, an aircraft flying from Maine to the Experimental Aircraft Association Annual Convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, made an emergency landing on the grass next to the demolished Meigs Field runway. Mayor Daley accused the pilot of intentionally landing in order to \"embarrass\" him, despite the FAA's statement that the pilot \"did the correct thing\" in landing the plane at Meigs.\nInterest groups, led by the Friends of Meigs Field, attempted to use the courts to reopen Meigs Field over the following months, but because the airport was owned by the City of Chicago and had paid back its federal aviation grants, the courts ruled that Chicago was allowed to close the field. The FAA fined the city $33,000 for closing an airport with a charted instrument approach without giving the required 30-day notice. This was the maximum fine the law allowed at the time. In the aftermath, the \"Meigs Legacy provision\" was passed into law, increasing the maximum fine per day from $1,100 to $10,000. On September 17, 2006, the city dropped all legal appeals and agreed to pay the $33,000 fine as well as repay $1 million in FAA Airport Improvement Program funds that it used to demolish the airfield and build Northerly Island Park.\nNortherly Island.\nBy August 2003, construction crews had finished the demolition of Meigs Field. Northerly Island is now a park that features prairie grasses, strolling paths and a giant pond. In 2005, the 7,500\u00a0seat Huntington Bank Pavilion, which hosts music concerts in the summer, opened on the site. The island also has a modest beach named 12th Street Beach.\nOther Chicagoans had a different vision for the lakefront area. After the 2003 closure, the Friends of Meigs Field introduced a new plan, \"Parks and Planes,\" which promoted the idea of an aviation museum, small operating runway, and park land on the property. This plan suggested that Chicago could qualify for federal funds earmarked for airport property acquisition to purchase many more acres of parkland in Chicago's neighborhoods and to improve the Chicago Park District's maintenance budget.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It is part of the United States Numbered Highway System and runs for over along the Pacific Ocean. The highway is also known by various names, including El Camino Real in parts of California, the Oregon Coast Highway, and the Olympic Highway in Washington. Despite its three-digit number, normally used for spur routes, US\u00a0101 is classified as a primary route with 10 as its \"first digit\".\nThe highway's southern terminus is at a major interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) and I-10 in Los Angeles. US\u00a0101 follows several freeways in Southern California as it travels north of the Santa Monica Mountains and along the coast, where it is concurrent with California State Route 1 (SR\u00a01). The highway travels inland from the coast after it splits from SR\u00a01 and approaches the San Francisco Bay Area, where it becomes the Bayshore Freeway and later traverses San Francisco on city streets to reach the Golden Gate Bridge. US\u00a0101 continues north on the Redwood Highway and rejoins the coast before it enters Oregon.\nThe Oregon Coast Highway carries US\u00a0101 through the state's coastal towns and regions in the foothills of the Oregon Coast Range. The highway crosses over the Columbia River on the Astoria\u2013Megler Bridge into Washington, where it follows Willapa Bay and an inland route to Aberdeen and Olympic National Park. US\u00a0101 travels north and east around the Olympic Peninsula and reaches its northernmost point in Port Angeles; from there, it travels east and later south to its northern terminus at I-5 in Tumwater, near Olympia. Several portions of the highway are also designated as scenic byways, including the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway in Washington; US\u00a0101 also serves three national parks: Pinnacles, Redwood, and Olympic.\nThe highway is a major north\u2013south link along the Pacific coast north of San Francisco but does not serve the largest cities in Oregon and Washington; that role is instead filled by I-5, which has a more direct inland routing. US\u00a0101 was established in 1926 and followed several historic routes, including El Camino Real, which linked California's early Spanish missions, pueblos, and presidios. It originally terminated to the south in San Diego but was truncated to Los Angeles in 1964 after the construction of I-5. Other sections were later moved to freeway alignments that bypassed cities. Several sections of US\u00a0101 in Washington and Oregon were rebuilt in the mid-20th century to eliminate curves and address traffic congestion. Later projects expanded the Bayshore Freeway in the San Francisco Bay Area and relocated sections of the highway in Oregon in response to landslides and erosion.\nRoute description.\nUS\u00a0101 is a major highway that generally follows the Pacific Ocean through the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It spans over from its southern terminus in Los Angeles to its northern terminus near Olympia, Washington. US\u00a0101 generally runs parallel to I-5, which serves most of the West Coast's largest cities and is designated for long-haul freight. The corridor is also designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95 (USBR\u00a095) in Northern California and is proposed to be part of USBR\u00a040 and USBR\u00a097 in Washington.\nThe highway is known by several names that vary between the states. In California, portions of US\u00a0101 are part of the Santa Ana Freeway, Hollywood Freeway, Ventura Freeway, Bayshore Freeway, and Redwood Highway. In Oregon, it is officially the Oregon Coast Highway No. 9 under the named highways system and part of the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway. In Washington, it is officially part of the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway, a state scenic highway. In Southern California, US\u00a0101 is commonly called \"the 101\" (pronounced \"the one oh one\").\nCalifornia.\nUS\u00a0101 travels on several major freeways in the Greater Los Angeles area, including some of the most congested roads in the United States. Its southern terminus is in Boyle Heights at the East Los Angeles Interchange, one of the busiest freeway junctions in the United States, where US\u00a0101 meets I-5, I-10, and SR\u00a060. The highway travels north on a section of the Santa Ana Freeway and turns west to cross the Los Angeles River after merging with the San Bernardino Freeway. The Santa Ana Freeway continues across Downtown Los Angeles and passes Union Station, a major transit hub, and government buildings before it reaches a junction with SR\u00a0110. Beyond Downtown Los Angeles, US\u00a0101 uses the Hollywood Freeway as it travels northwest through the eponymous neighborhood towards Cahuenga Pass, where it crosses the Hollywood Hills and passes Universal Studios Hollywood. The highway leaves the Hollywood Freeway to turn west onto the Ventura Freeway, which travels along the southern edge of the suburban San Fernando Valley and intersects I-405. US\u00a0101 continues into Ventura County, where it joins SR\u00a01 and serves communities in the Conejo Valley and Oxnard Plain.\nThe highway follows the Pacific Ocean northwest from Ventura through Santa Barbara, where it separates the downtown from its beach, and Goleta. US\u00a0101 becomes a divided highway beyond Goleta as it turns north at Gaviota State Park to cross the Santa Ynez Mountains at Gaviota Pass; SR\u00a01 splits to remain closer to the coastline, as it does in several areas of the state. The highway continues inland and travels around the Purisima Hills to reach Santa Maria, where the freeway resumes as it bypasses the city. US\u00a0101 briefly returns to the coastline near Pismo Beach and turns inland over the Irish Hills towards San Luis Obispo alongside SR\u00a01. The highway crosses the Santa Lucia Range through Cuesta Pass and follows the Salinas River northwest through Atascadero and the wine-growing region surrounding Paso Robles. US\u00a0101 passes near Pinnacles National Park and travels through the city of Salinas, where it turns northeast to cross the Gabilan Range. From there, the highway descends into the Santa Clara Valley and Gilroy, the southernmost city in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nUS\u00a0101 continues northwest into San Jose on the South Valley Freeway and later the Bayshore Freeway, which travels around the east and north sides of downtown San Jose. The ten-lane freeway generally follows the west side of San Francisco Bay as it traverses several Silicon Valley communities, including Palo Alto, Redwood City, and San Mateo, and passes offices for high-tech companies. It parallels I-280, which travels along the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west, as the two continue up the San Francisco Peninsula. US\u00a0101 passes San Francisco International Airport and briefly turns northeast to rejoin the coastline before it enters the city of San Francisco near Candlestick Point. The Bayshore Freeway intersects I-280 and terminates at an interchange with I-80 near the SoMa neighborhood in the city center. US\u00a0101 then uses city streets to continue through San Francisco; it travels north on Van Ness Avenue, a wide boulevard with bus lanes, and west on Lombard Street to the Presidio of San Francisco, a historic landmark and city park.\nThe divided highway travels through the north side of the Presidio and tunnels under a portion of the park as it approaches the Golden Gate Bridge, a tolled suspension bridge across the Golden Gate at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. It is operated by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District and is not legally defined as part of US\u00a0101 and SR\u00a01. The orange-colored bridge, considered an icon of the city, has six lanes with a movable barrier and walkways on both sides for pedestrians and cyclists. North of the bridge, US\u00a0101 is designated as the Redwood Highway. It splits from SR\u00a01 and continues as an eight-lane freeway through suburban communities in Marin County, including an elevated viaduct in downtown San Rafael. The highway continues along the west side of San Pablo Bay into Sonoma County, where it turns northwest to head inland through Petaluma and Santa Rosa in the North Bay's Wine Country. US\u00a0101 follows the Russian River upstream through wineries and vineyards into Mendocino County as the freeway narrows to four lanes and eventually ends.\nBeyond the San Francisco Bay Area, US\u00a0101 is primarily an undivided highway with some short freeway sections and serves as the primary route in the rugged North Coast region. It traverses the Mendocino Range and reaches the northern terminus of SR\u00a01 at Leggett. The Redwood Highway then follows the South Fork Eel River north into Humboldt Redwoods State Park, where it runs parallel to the Avenue of the Giants. US\u00a0101 continues northwest along the Eel River to reach the coastline near Eureka, which it travels through on city streets before becoming a divided highway around Humboldt Bay. The highway travels north along the coast through the Redwood National and State Parks, where it passes through old-growth coast redwood forests, and reaches Crescent City. US\u00a0101 intersects US\u00a0199 north of the city and continues northwest along the coast to the Oregon state line.\nOregon.\nThe Oregon Coast Highway begins at the California state line near Brookings and carries US\u00a0101 north along the Pacific coast. It is generally a two-lane highway that passes through small towns and near 77 state parks on the rugged coastline, as well as some inland areas. From Brookings, US\u00a0101 traverses the Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor, which includes roadside viewpoints and trailheads that face the ocean. The highway remains elevated from the coastline and briefly descends to sea level near the Pistol River State Scenic Viewpoint before climbing Cape Sebastian on its way to Gold Beach. US\u00a0101 travels through Gold Beach and crosses the Rogue River to continue north along the coast. The highway turns west to follow the base of Humbug Mountain, a mountain that rises from the Pacific Ocean, and northwest to reach Port Orford, where it leaves the coastline.\nUS\u00a0101 continues north, separated from the coastline by prairies and marshes, to Bandon; there, it briefly turns east and crosses the Coquille River to traverse more marshes. The highway travels further inland to the northeast and follows a slough off Coos Bay to the neighboring cities of Coos Bay and North Bend, where it splits into a pair of one-way streets. US\u00a0101 leaves North Bend and crosses Coos Bay on the Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge; from there, it heads north along the edge of a exposed coastal sand dune that forms the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, along with freshwater lakes to the east. US\u00a0101 diverts northeast to cross the Umpqua River at Reedsport and passes through a meandering section near Tahkenitch Lake before it returns to the coastal dunes around Dunes City.\nThe Oregon Coast Highway crosses the Siuslaw River into Florence and intersects Oregon Route 126 (OR\u00a0126), a major east\u2013west route that traverses the Coast Range to Eugene. US\u00a0101 returns to the coastline near the Heceta Head Lighthouse and continues north along several high cliffs around Cape Perpetua and Yachats that overlook the beaches. The Oregon Coast Highway then crosses the Yaquina Bay Bridge into Newport and serves as the western terminus of US\u00a020, a transcontinental route to Boston and the longest highway in the United States. US\u00a0101 continues along the coastline and Siletz Bay into Lincoln City, where it serves as the city's main street for and turns away from the coast to bypass the Cascade Head biosphere reserve. The highway briefly returns to the coastline before beginning a long inland stretch that follows the Nestucca River and other streams to Tillamook.\nUS\u00a0101 passes the Tillamook County Creamery Association factory and travels northwest along Tillamook Bay to rejoin the coast near Garibaldi, but later turns inland to skirt Nehalem Bay and avoid Cape Falcon. The highway travels around the community of Cannon Beach, home to the landmark Haystack Rock, and turns northeast to bypass Tillamook Head and intersect US\u00a026\u2014a major route to Portland. US\u00a0101 continues north along the Necanicum River to reach the coast at Seaside and travel through the city and nearby beach communities. The highway turns northeast and crosses Youngs Bay from Warrenton to Astoria, where it meets the western terminus of US\u00a030; that highway continues into downtown Astoria and east towards Portland. US\u00a0101 turns south onto a loop ramp that leads north to the Astoria\u2013Megler Bridge, a bridge that spans the mouth of the Columbia River and carries the highway into Washington.\nWashington.\nUS\u00a0101 enters Washington state at the north end of the Astoria\u2013Megler Bridge and immediately turns west to follow the Columbia River. The highway traverses Fort Columbia State Park in a tunnel and passes through Chinook on the north side of the river's mouth towards Ilwaco, near Cape Disappointment. From Ilwaco, US\u00a0101 briefly travels north before turning east at Seaview, the southernmost city on the Long Beach Peninsula, and following Willapa Bay to a junction with State Route 4 (SR\u00a04) on the Naselle River. The highway continues along the east side of the bay through South Bend to Raymond, where it travels inland to cross the forested Willapa Hills to reach Aberdeen. US\u00a0101 enters the city by crossing the Chehalis River and turns west onto a pair of one-way streets after an intersection with US\u00a012.\nThe streets travel through western Aberdeen and neighboring Hoquiam, where the highway is split by the Hoquiam River, and rejoin north of downtown. The highway continues north along inland streams into the Quinault Indian Reservation, which it enters near Lake Quinault at the edge of Olympic National Park. US\u00a0101 circumnavigates the Olympic Peninsula and provides the main access to the national park and various sites via spur roads; there are no roads that cross the Olympic Mountains, which separate areas of the national park and adjacent Olympic National Forest. The highway turns west from Lake Quinault to reach the Pacific coastline, which it follows for between Queets and Ruby Beach within Olympic National Park. US\u00a0101 then heads northeast to follow the Hoh River upstream and intersects the main access road to the Hoh Rainforest. It then travels north through Forks and follows the Sol Duc River east to re-enter the national park.\nUS\u00a0101 travels along the southern shore of Lake Crescent, one of the deepest lakes in the state, and the foothills of the Olympic Mountains until it crosses the Elwha River near the site of the demolished Elwha Dam. The highway enters Port Angeles and uses city streets to reach the northernmost point of US\u00a0101, near the ferry terminal for the Black Ball Line to Victoria, British Columbia. The four-lane highway turns east to follow the Strait of Juan de Fuca through a rural prairie and becomes a super two expressway as it bypasses Sequim. US\u00a0101 dips south to travel around Sequim Bay and turns south to follow Discovery Bay to a junction with SR\u00a020, which serves Port Townsend and the North Cascades.\nThe highway travels south and crosses a pass in the Olympic Mountains near Mount Walker before it reaches the west shore of Hood Canal, which it follows for more than . US\u00a0101 passes several state parks and additional access points for the national park, including Lake Cushman near Hoodsport. It leaves Hood Canal on the Skokomish Indian Reservation and continues south on a super two bypass around Shelton, where it intersects SR\u00a03. US\u00a0101 then becomes a freeway and cuts across several inlets and bays of Puget Sound as it turns southeast towards the Olympia area. The freeway merges with SR\u00a08 and continues southeast to reach its northern terminus at I-5 in Tumwater, near the Washington State Capitol campus in nearby Olympia.\nThe section between Lake Crescent and Sequim is generally signed east\u2013west, while the section south of the intersection with SR\u00a020 is signed north\u2013south but turned 180 degrees. The direct route between Aberdeen and Olympia uses US\u00a012 and SR\u00a08, which complete the Olympic Loop Highway.\nNumbering.\nAccording to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials's (AASHTO) numbering scheme for United States Numbered Highways, three-digit route numbers are generally subsidiaries of two-digit primary routes. Of these two-digit routes, the principal north\u2013south routes were assigned numbers ending in 1. US\u00a0101 is an exception to the three-digit rule due to its role as the westernmost major route; it is treated as a primary, two-digit route with a \"first digit\" of 10, rather than a spur of US\u00a01, which is located along the east coast.\nHistory.\nEstablishment and early development.\nUS\u00a0101 was established as part of the initial United States Numbered Highway System that was developed by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in the 1920s. The preliminary plan recommended in 1925 had the highway terminate at San Diego in the south and in Port Angeles, Washington, to the north. The final plan extended US\u00a0101 within Washington around the east side of the Olympic Peninsula to Olympia and was adopted by the AASHO on November 11, 1926. The first section of US\u00a0101 to be signed in California was between San Diego and Los Angeles in January 1928, which was followed by the rest of the route later in the year.\nPortions of the coastal highway had already been constructed by the respective state governments and also followed foot and wagon routes developed in earlier centuries. Among these was El Camino Real in California, which was formed by the Portol\u00e1 expedition in 1769 and 1770 and connected the historic Spanish missions, pueblos, and presidios. The California state government chose a section of El Camino Real in San Bruno in 1912 to become the first paved highway in the state. The San Diego\u2013San Francisco section of El Camino Real was incorporated into the multi-state Pacific Highway in the 1910s; other sections of US\u00a0101 in California used the existing Redwood Highway, which was constructed from 1917 to 1923, and Coast Highway.\nConstruction of the Oregon Coast Highway began in 1921, two years after a state referendum that voted in favor of funding the development of highways with a one-cent gas tax. At the time, several short wagon roads and plank roads connected settlements on the coast, and overland travel primarily used beaches. The highway was gradually constructed and paved in the 1920s, but a set of six ferry crossings remained. These ferries were operated by private companies until the state government acquired them in 1927 with plans to replace them with bridges. The five major Oregon bridges on US\u00a0101 were designed by state engineer Conde B. McCullough and opened by 1936 using funding from the federal government's New Deal programs. As automobile traffic on the Oregon Coast increased, other sections were realigned to avoid rugged terrain or bypassed with tunnels. The Oregon Coast Highway was declared complete on October 3, 1936, and cost $25\u00a0million to construct (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars).\nWashington completed the final sections of the Olympic Loop Highway between 1927 and 1931 for $11\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars). The project paved several existing sections of the state roads and also constructed of new highway from the Queets River to Ruby Beach near Kalaloch. Portions of US\u00a0101 passed through lands that were later incorporated into Olympic National Park when it was established in 1938; under the National Park Service, sections of the Crescent Lake Highway were widened and improved in 1949. The Washington State Highway Commission submitted an application to AASHO in 1955 to extend US\u00a0101 northeast from Discovery Bay to Whidbey Island and Mount Vernon, where it would terminate at US\u00a099. The proposal was rejected by AASHO for being too long of a detour and including a tolled ferry crossing.\nNew alignments and freeways.\nUS\u00a0101 was split into two routes in the San Francisco Bay Area between San Jose and San Francisco in 1929: US\u00a0101W followed El Camino Real on the San Francisco Peninsula for ; US\u00a0101E traversed the East Bay for to Oakland, where it turned west on a cross-bay ferry to San Francisco. The branches converged in Downtown San Francisco and traveled along city streets to the Hyde Street Pier, where the highway continued on automobile ferries to Sausalito at the south end of the Redwood Highway. By 1936, US\u00a0101E had been eliminated in favor of the route on the west side, which was re-designated as US\u00a0101.\nThe Hyde Street\u2013Sausalito ferry was removed from US\u00a0101 following the May 1937 completion of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would carry the highway from San Francisco to Marin County. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its construction and was funded by a $35\u00a0million regional bond (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars) that was paid off in 1971. The San Jose\u2013San Francisco section of US\u00a0101 was initially moved from El Camino Real to the Bayshore Highway, a four-lane undivided highway that was constructed between 1924 and 1937 to bypass several towns on the peninsula. El Camino Real was re-designated as US\u00a0101 Alternate in 1936, which sparked outcry from businesses and groups who lobbied for a reversal of the change that was submitted by state officials to AASHO. In 1938, US\u00a0101 was moved back to El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway was designated as US\u00a0101 Bypass.\nIn the late 1940s, the California state government announced plans to convert most of US\u00a0101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco to freeways using funds from the Collier\u2013Burns Highway Act of 1947. Prior to the act, the Cahuenga Pass Freeway had opened in June 1940 between Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles to replace a narrow, winding mountain road. It was the city's second freeway and was later extended southeast towards Downtown and renamed the Hollywood Freeway when it was completed on April 16, 1954. Several other early freeway segments were signed as US\u00a0101 Bypass or US\u00a0101 Alternate. In San Luis Obispo, a freeway around the northwest side of downtown was completed by the early 1960s, alongside bypasses of nearby rural towns. The San Diego\u2013San Francisco section of US\u00a0101 was designated as El Camino Real by the California state government in 1959 as part of a program to add historic markers on the highway.\nThe Santa Ana Freeway was planned as a Los Angeles\u2013Irvine connector in the late 1930s and constructed in phases, beginning with a section near Downtown Los Angeles that opened in December 1947. US\u00a0101 was later moved onto sections of the freeway, which was completed in 1958 and served as a continuation of the Hollywood Freeway. By the time it was completed, sections of the freeway between Anaheim and Los Angeles were carrying over 113,000\u00a0vehicles per day and were planned to be widened to six lanes within a few years. The south end of the Santa Ana Freeway merged into the San Diego Freeway, which began construction in 1954 and was completed in 1968. Both freeways were incorporated into plans for the new Interstate Highway System in 1955 and assigned to I-5 three years later.\nUS\u00a0101 was truncated to Los Angeles during a 1963 AASHO meeting at the request of the California state government, as I-5 had replaced the stretch to San Diego; the changes were made ahead of a major restructuring of the state's highway system that took effect on July 1, 1964. The old sections of the highway from San Diego to Los Angeles were given local names and later signed as Historic US\u00a0101 in the late 2010s by local governments. The 1963 action also moved the San Jose\u2013San Francisco section onto the Bayshore Freeway, which was built to replace the Bayshore Highway on US\u00a0101 Bypass. The freeway had been proposed to address congestion and frequent collisions on the highway, nicknamed \"Bloody Bayshore\", and opened in stages between 1947 and 1962. The bypassed sections of El Camino Real were renumbered to SR\u00a082 in the Bay Area and signed as business routes of US\u00a0101 in other cities. From the north end of the Bayshore Freeway at I-80 in San Francisco, US\u00a0101 was routed west along a section of the Central Freeway, which opened in 1955 and was extended four years later to Van Ness Avenue. Plans to extend the Central Freeway and other thoroughfares through San Francisco to the Golden Gate Bridge were later cancelled by the mid-1960s following widespread opposition and protests from city residents.\nSeveral sections of the Oregon Coast Highway were rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s to eliminate curves and move the highway further from the coastline in cities such as Cannon Beach. A realignment from Brookings to Gold Beach and a more direct route from Bandon to Coos Bay to bypass Coquille were completed as part of this program in the early 1960s. In 1955, Oregon congressman A. Walter Norblad unsuccessfully proposed that the US\u00a0101 corridor be included in the Interstate Highway System to allow for federal funds to construct a bridge across the Columbia River; the proposal was also endorsed by a U.S. Army official, who also sought a similar designation for the Washington section. The Seaside\u2013Astoria section was straightened and realigned onto a new bridge over Youngs Bay in 1964. The Astoria\u2013Megler Bridge over the Columbia River opened to traffic on July 29, 1966, replacing a ferry and comprising the final \"link\" in US\u00a0101. The northern terminus of US\u00a0101 was originally at Capitol Way (US\u00a099) in downtown Olympia until it was moved to a freeway bypass in December 1958. The freeway section was extended northwest from Olympia to Shelton in 1965.\nModern projects.\nThe final traffic signal on the section of US\u00a0101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco, located at Anacapa Street in Santa Barbara, was removed in November 1991. The removal was spurred by the construction of a freeway through Santa Barbara, which was completed the following year and bypassed four signalized intersections. The Central Freeway's northernmost leg in San Francisco was demolished in the early 2000s after it had sustained damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which required the upper deck to be removed in 1997. A portion of the corridor was replaced by Octavia Boulevard, which opened in 2005, while US\u00a0101 was rerouted onto Van Ness Avenue further east. From 2016 to 2022, Van Ness Avenue was rebuilt by the San Francisco Municipal Railway to add center bus lanes and landscaped medians as part of the Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit project.\nSeveral existing freeway sections in California were expanded to add high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) beginning in the 1980s to address increased congestion, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. By 1984, a section in Marin County had been opened to traffic; it was followed by sections in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties that were funded by a sales tax approved in a 1984 ballot measure. The HOV lanes were extended south through San Jose to Bernal Road in 1990. A section of the existing HOV lanes from Redwood City to San Bruno was converted to high-occupancy toll lanes in 2023 with the use of electronic toll collection.\nSections of US\u00a0101 in Oregon have been rebuilt or relocated due to erosion or landslides that caused considerable damage to the highway. The use of riprap to reinforce new sections of the roadway was banned by the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development in 1977 due to its effect on beach degradation. An effort to repeal the ban and rebuild sections of US\u00a0101 began in 2002 and resulted in an amendment in 2022. Several sections of US\u00a0101 between Newport and Lincoln City are identified as persistent sunken grade and rockfall areas in need of frequent repairs. Other portions of the highway in southwestern Oregon had landslide and subsidence issues, including a section in Harbor that was closed for several weeks in early 2016 by an sinkhole.\nSevere erosion of the highway along the Hoh River in Washington was addressed through the construction of eight engineered logjams by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 2004. The project redirected the river's flow through the use of dense piles of spruce logs reinforced by steel piles; the highway previously underwent four emergency repairs in the area that included installation of riprap and other conventional materials. US\u00a0101 was relocated onto an expressway bypass of Sequim, Washington, in August 1999 that replaced a congested route on the city's main street, Washington Avenue. The project cost $40.7\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars) to construct and included the installation of warning signals triggered by the presence of nearby Roosevelt elk wearing radio collars for tracking. The section of the highway between Port Angeles and Sequim was widened to four lanes in November 2014 following a two-year project to fill the final, gap. The section west of Port Angeles along Lake Crescent was rehabilitated from 2017 to 2019 to repave the roadway and repair structures\u2014among them retaining walls and guardrails.\nA freeway bypass of Willits, California, for the Redwood Highway opened in November 2016 at a cost of $460\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars). The bypass was expected to divert away tourists and cause a drop in local sales tax revenue due to lost traffic. A portion of US\u00a0101 in the North Bay region near San Francisco, nicknamed the \"Novato Narrows\", was widened to three lanes with the addition of an HOV lane; construction on the section began in 2011 and is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

{"id": "70786", "revid": "11112747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70786", "title": "Poetic Edda", "text": "Collection of Old Norse poems\nThe Poetic Edda is the modern name for an untitled collection of Old Norse anonymous narrative poems in alliterative verse. It is distinct from the closely related \"Prose Edda\", although both works are seminal to the study of Old Norse poetry. Several versions of the \"Poetic Edda\" exist; especially notable is the medieval Icelandic manuscript \"Codex Regius\", which contains 31 poems.\nComposition.\nThe Eddic poems are composed in alliterative verse. Most are in \"fornyr\u00f0islag\" (\"old story metre\"), while \"m\u00e1lah\u00e1ttr\" (\"speech form\") is a common variation. The rest, about a quarter, are composed in \"lj\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr\" (\"song form\"). The language of the poems is usually clear and relatively unadorned. Kennings are often employed, though they do not arise as frequently, nor are they as complex, as those found in typical skaldic poetry.\nAuthorship.\nLike most early poetry, the Eddic poems were minstrel poems, passed orally from singer to singer and from poet to poet for centuries. None of the poems are attributed to a particular author, though many of them show strong individual characteristics and are likely to have been the work of individual poets. While scholars have speculated on hypothetical authors, firm and accepted conclusions have never been reached.\nDate.\nAccurate dating of the poems has long been a source of scholarly debate. Firm conclusions are difficult to reach; lines from the Eddic poems sometimes appear in poems by known poets. For example, Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir composed in the latter half of the 10th century, and he uses a couple of lines in his \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\" that are also found in \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\". It is possible that he was quoting a known poem, but it is also possible that \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\", or at least the strophe in question, is the younger derivative work.\nThe handful demonstrably historical characters mentioned in the poems, such as Attila, provide a \"terminus post quem\" of sorts. The dating of the manuscripts themselves provides a number of useful \"terminus ante quem\".\nIndividual poems have individual clues to their age. For example, \"Atlam\u00e1l hin groenlenzku\" is claimed by its title to have been composed in Greenland and seems so by some internal evidence. If so, it must have been composed no earlier than about 985, since there were no Scandinavians in Greenland until that time.\nMore certain than such circumstantial evidence are linguistic dating criteria. These can be arrived at by looking at Skaldic poems whose dates are more firmly known. For instance the particle \"of\", corresponding to \"ga-\" or \"ge-\" in other old Germanic languages, has been shown to occur more frequently in Skaldic poems of earlier date. Applying this criterion to Eddic poetry, Bjarne Fidjest\u00f8l found large variation, indicating that some of the poems were much older than others.\nOther dating criteria include the use of the negative adverb \"eigi\" 'not', and alliteration of \"vr-\" with \"v-\". In western dialects of Old Norse the former became \"r-\" around the year 1000, but in some Eddic poems the word \"vrei\u00f0r\", younger form \"rei\u00f0r\", is seen to alliterate with words beginning in an original \"v-\". This was observed already by Olaf \u2018White Skald\u2019 Thordarson, the author of the Third Grammatical Treatise, who termed this \"v\" before \"r\" the \"vindandin forna\"; 'the ancient use of vend'.\nIn some cases, old poems may have been interpolated with younger verses or merged with other poems. For example, stanzas 9\u201316 of \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", the \"Dvergatal\" or \"Roster of Dwarfs\", is considered by some scholars to be an interpolation.\nLocation.\nThe problem of dating the poems is linked with the problem of determining where they were composed. Iceland was not settled until approximately 870, so anything composed before that time would necessarily have been elsewhere, most likely in Scandinavia. More recent poems, on the other hand, are likely Icelandic in origin.\nScholars have attempted to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results. For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but we can be sure that Icelandic poets were familiar with the species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland \u2013 but this is hardly certain.\n\"Codex Regius\".\nThe \"Codex Regius\" is arguably the most important extant source on Norse mythology and Germanic heroic legends. Since the early 19th century, it has had a powerful influence on Scandinavian literature, not only through its stories, but also through the visionary force and the dramatic quality of many of the poems. It has also been an inspiration for later innovations in poetic meter, particularly in Nordic languages, with its use of terse, stress-based metrical schemes that lack final rhymes, instead focusing on alliterative devices and strongly concentrated imagery. Poets who have acknowledged their debt to the \"Codex Regius\" include Vilhelm Ekelund, August Strindberg, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ezra Pound, Jorge Luis Borges, and Karin Boye.\nThe \"Codex Regius\" was written during the 13th century, but nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson, then Bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt. At the time, versions of the \"Prose Edda\" were known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another Edda, an Elder Edda, which contained the pagan poems that Snorri quotes in his \"Prose Edda\". When \"Codex Regius\" was discovered, it seemed that the speculation had proved correct, but modern scholarly research has shown that the \"Prose Edda\" was likely written first and that the two were, at most, connected by a common source.\nBrynj\u00f3lfur attributed the manuscript to S\u00e6mundr the Learned, a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. Modern scholars reject that attribution, but the name S\u00e6mundar Edda is still sometimes associated with both the \"Codex Regius\" and versions of the \"Poetic Edda\" using it as a source.\nBishop Brynj\u00f3lfur sent the manuscript as a present to the Danish king, hence the Latin name \"Codex Regius,\" lit.\u2009'Royal Book'. For centuries it was stored in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland. Because air travel at the time was not entirely trustworthy with such precious cargo, it was transported by ship, accompanied by a naval escort.\nContents.\nPoems similar to those found in the \"Codex Regius\" are also included in many editions of the \"Poetic Edda\". Important manuscripts containing these other poems include AM 748 I 4to, \"Hauksb\u00f3k\", and \"Flateyjarb\u00f3k\". Many of the poems are also quoted in Snorri's \"Prose\" \"Edda\", but usually only in bits and pieces. What poems are included in an edition of the \"Poetic Edda\" depends on the editor. Those not found in the \"Codex Regius\" are sometimes called the \"eddic appendix\". Other Eddic-like poems not usually published in the \"Poetic Edda\" are sometimes called Eddica minora and were compiled by Andreas Heusler and Wilhelm Ranisch in their 1903 book titled \"Eddica minora: Dichtungen eddischer Art aus den Fornaldars\u00f6gur und anderen Prosawerken\".\nEnglish translators are not consistent on the translations of the names of the Eddic poems or on how the Old Norse forms should be rendered in English. Up to three translated titles are given below, taken from the translations of Bellows, Hollander, and Larrington with proper names in the normalized English forms found in John Lindow's \"Norse Mythology\" and in Andy Orchard's \"Cassell's Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend\".\nHeroic lays.\nAfter the mythological poems, the \"Codex Regius\" continues with heroic lays about mortal heroes, examples of Germanic heroic legend. The heroic lays are to be seen as a whole in the \"Edda\", but they consist of three layers: the story of Helgi Hundingsbani, the story of the Nibelungs, and the story of J\u00f6rmunrekkr, king of the Goths. These are, respectively, Scandinavian, German, and Gothic in origin. As far as historicity can be ascertained, Attila, J\u00f6rmunrekkr, and Brynhildr actually existed, taking Brynhildr to be partly based on Brunhilda of Austrasia, but the chronology has been reversed in the poems.\nNot in the \"Codex Regius\".\nSeveral of the legendary sagas contain poetry in the Eddic style. Their age and importance is often difficult to evaluate but the \"Hervarar saga\", in particular, contains interesting poetic interpolations.\nEnglish translations.\nThe \"Elder\" or \"Poetic Edda\" has been translated numerous times, the earliest printed edition being that by A. S. Cottle in 1797, though some short sections had been translated as early as the 1670s. Some early translators relied on a Latin translation of the \"Edda\", including Cottle.\nOpinions differ on the best way to translate the text, on the use or rejection of archaic language, and the rendering of terms lacking a clear English analogue. Still, Cottle's 1797 translation is now considered very inaccurate.\nA comparison of the second and third verses (lines 5\u201312) of the \"V\u01eblusp\u00e1\" is given below:\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70789", "revid": "50631274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70789", "title": "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan", "text": "Political party in Iraqi Kurdistan\nMilitary unit\nThe Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK; ) is a political party active in Kurdistan Region and the disputed territories in Iraq. The PUK describes its goals as self-determination, human rights, democracy and peace for the Kurdish people of Kurdistan and Iraq. The PUK is currently under the leadership of Bafel Talabani. The PUK was founded in 1975 by Adel Murad, Jalal Talabani, Nawshirwan Mustafa, Fuad Masum, Ali Askari and Abdul Razaq Feyli Dawood Mohammed Ali. All presidents of Iraq under the 2005 constitution have been from this party.\nHistory.\nDiscontent within the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).\nThe PUK traces its political heritage to Sulaymaniyah native Ibrahim Ahmad. After the collapse of the Soviet-backed Kurdish Mahabad Republic in Iran in early 1947, Ibrahim Ahmad, previously the Sulaymaniyah representative of the Iranian KDP (KDP-I), joined the newly formed Iraqi KDP. Ahmad was a highly influential leftist intellectual, who by 1951 had succeeded in rallying most of the Iraqi Kurdish leftist-nationalists to the new Iraqi KDP, which, in turn, took the opportunity to convene a second Party Congress and duly elect Ahmad as secretary-general (effectively acting Chairman).\nHowever, from the very beginning in Iran, Ibrahim Ahmad's leftist politics, \"intellectualism\", and support for Qazi Muhammad put him at odds with the faction of the KDP loyal to Mustafa Barzani and his traditionalist-conservative tribal support base. It was \"well-known in nationalist circles that the relations between the two men Mustafa and Qazi were not easy\". Ibrahim Ahmad was soon joined by up-and-coming intellectual and socialist Jalal Talabani. Barzani and Ahmad were known to dislike each other. But while each wanted to reduce the others' influence in the KDP, each also knew that the other was indispensable in securing the loyalty of their respective support-bases.\nWhen the first Ba'ath Party government was deposed in a coup led by Abdul Salam Arif, Mustafa developed a close relationship with Arif. Mulla Mustafa signed an agreement with Arif in his personal capacity, rather than as president of the KDP. This infuriated Ahmad and Jalal Talabani as the agreement omitted any mention of self-administration, let alone autonomy\u2014the whole point for which the Kurds had been fighting a long-term guerrilla war. Arif threatened force against any Kurdish opponent of Mustafa, while Mustafa declared that any resistance to Baghdad would constitute a declaration of war against himself and the Barzanis.\nIbrahim Ahmad and Jalal Talabani decried this complicity, and as they saw it, submission, to Baghdad. Mulla Mustafa rallied the conservatives and tribal leaders to his side. Furious debates and campaigning followed, but Ahmad's and Talabani's arguments could not dislodge Mulla Mustafa's position as the popular figurehead of the Kurdish people. Mulla Mustafa would accept no dissent, and, fearing for their lives, Ahmad and his followers slipped away at night from a heated discussion with Mulla Mustafa, and retreated back to their stronghold in Mawat, Iraq.\nAt the Sixth Party Congress of the KDP in July 1964, representatives from the Ahmad-Talabani faction were arrested upon arrival. A few days later Mulla Mustafa sent his son, Idris Barzani with a large force to drive Ahmad, Talabani, and their 4,000 or so followers into exile in Iran. With this, Mulla Mustafa had finally achieved undisputed control of the KDP.\nFounding.\nAfter the defeat of the Kurds in the 1974\u20131975 Revolt, on 22 May 1975, Talabani met in a coffee shop called Gligla, in Aum Rmana, Damascus, with Adel Murad, Fuad Mausm, and Abdul Razaq Faily. That day, the PUK announced its formation via Syrian and Lebanese media. The day after, Talabani visited Berlin in West Germany and met three other co-founders, Nawshirwan Mustafa, Omar Shekhmus, and Kamal Fuad, and some other activists. On 1 June 1975, the PUK was announced again in Berlin, and thus it was decided that 1 June is the anniversary date of the founding of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).\nThe PUK was a coalition of at least five separate political entities, the most significant of which were Talabani and his closest followers, Nawshirwan Mustafa's clandestine Marxist-Leninist group Komala, and the Kurdistan Socialist Movement (KSM), formed as a result of a series of meetings within the cadres of the Aylul Revolution who took refuge in Iran in 1975, including Omer Dababa, Ali Askari, Dr. Khalid, Ali Hazhar, Kardo Galali, Ibrahim Ahmad, Jamal Agha, Rasul Mamand, Mala Nasih, Abdulrahman Gomashini, Milazm Tahir, Ali Wali and Kamal Mihedeen. The PUK served as an umbrella organization unifying various trends within the Kurdish political movement in Iraq.\nThe PUK received grassroots support from the urban intellectual classes of Iraqi Kurdistan upon its establishment, partly due to five of its seven founding members being Ph.D. holders and academics. In the early 1980s, the PUK evolved and broadened its appeal to all sections of Iraqi Kurdish society, especially the rural classes.\nIn 1992, the constituent groups within the PUK merged into a unified political movement that affirmed its social-democratic identity and affiliation. Their communique ascribed the collapse of the revolt to \"the inability of the feudalist, tribalist, bourgeois rightist and capitulationist Kurdish leadership\".\nThe PUK's support lies predominantly in the southern part of the Kurdistan Region.\nConflicts.\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war, the PUK entered into hostilities with the Iranian Kurdish Sipay Rizgari, opposing them due to Sipay Rizgari's close ties to the Iraqi authorities that the PUK was fighting. The PUK harassed Sipay Rizgari's troops and, to a large extent, cut off their supply lines.\nSince the first Gulf War, the PUK has jointly administered Kurdistan Region with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). However, in 1994 the parties engaged in a three-year conflict, known as the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War. The conflict ended with US mediation, and reconciliation was eventually achieved.\nIn September 2001, the Islamist group Jund al-Islam (the Army of Islam) massacred 43 PUK members.\nLeadership crisis and split-offs.\nOriginally a centre-left party opposing the conservative tribalism of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the PUK developed into a similarly tribalistic vehicle for the political ambitions of Jalal Talabani and his family. In 2009, influential PUK politician Nawshirwan Mustafa left the party, frustrated by widespread tribalism and corruption within the party. He proceeded to found the Gorran Movement, which in turn presented itself as an alternative to the corrupt politics of PUK and KDP.\nAfter the founder and leader of the PUK, Jalal Talabani, died in 2017, a struggle for the leadership of the party ignited between Jalal's son Bafel Talabani and the then co-president Lahur Sheikh Jangi. On the PUK's fourth congress in December 2019, Sheikh Jangi received the most votes for the General Leadership Council. In a compromise, he and Bafel were proclaimed co-presidents. In July 2021, Bafel shut down a media outlet close to Sheikh Jangi and ousted several important commanders from the counter-terrorism and intelligence units of the PUK, who were seen as affiliates of him. Shortly after, Bafel was declared the sole leader of the party. In November, Lahur Sheikh Jangi was expelled from the PUK along a few others and Bafel took full control over the party's finances. Sheikh Jangi filed a lawsuit against the expulsion. In February 2023, a court in Erbil ruled, that the ouster from the co-presidency was contradicted PUK's internal regulation and reinstated him. A day after however, on 21 February, the judicial authority on Iraqi elections in Baghdad declared Bafel Talabani the sole leader of the PUK. \nAfter that, Sheikh Jangi proceeded to work on founding his own party. His new party, the People's Front received its license from the interior ministry on 17 January 2024 and was joined by several former PUK-members from Lahur's wing.\nStructure.\nA Co-Presidents are elected by the General Leadership Council. The PUK has 36 branches throughout Iraqi Kurdistan and draws membership from a broad cross-section of Kurdish society. The membership of the PUK, based on statistics compiled in September 1998, stands at 800,280 members and associates. The PUK contested the 1992 elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly, and the party list acquired 423,682 votes of the total of 957,469 valid votes cast - giving the PUK commanding majority in three of Kurdistan Region's four provinces. The PUK is a member of the Socialist International. Kosrat Rasul Ali was elected as the leader of the Supreme Political Council at the party congress in December 2019 and Lahur Talabany and Bafel Talabany were elected as Co-Presidents in February 2020 to lead the party.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe PUK's structure consists of 8 bureaus:\nElection results.\nIraq.\nParliamentary election\nKurdistan Region.\nParliamentary election \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had succeeded in establishing himself as a claimant in the international press and (in the politics of Iraq). Prince Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein was the only Iraqi royal campaigning in Iraq for the return of a monarchy based on a constitutional monarchy. Some critics asserted he was not even in line to the throne according to the constitution of the old Iraqi monarchy (The Iraqi Constitution as amended in November 1943). According to this constitution, the heir to the monarchy would be Prince Ra'ad (born 1936), Lord Chamberlain of Jordan, and the heir apparent Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad, a former Jordanian diplomat who was active within the United Nations.\nRole and structure.\nThe Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy Movement was a regional political initiative supported by the Jordanian royal family, several Gulf Arab states, and influential Iraqi exile communities. Its aim was to restore Iraq\u2019s Hashemite monarchy under a constitutional, secular, and pluralistic system, with the possibility of a political union with Jordan.\nBackers included wealthy exiled Shia Feyli Kurd and Sunni Arab merchant families based in Amman, many of whom had longstanding ties to the Hashemites. Jordan coordinated and financed efforts to organize Feyli merchants into a lobby inside Iraq, because the Feyli establishment had very close ties to the clergy in Najaf. This group sought to persuade Shia political parties and senior clerics to support a national referendum on restoring the monarchy.\nThe plan ultimately failed due to resistance from Iraqi political factions, suspicion of foreign influence, and opposition from Islamist and nationalist movements. The main opponents of the Feylis were the Islamic Dawa Party, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. While short-lived, the effort reflected ongoing debates over Iraq\u2019s political identity and its historical links to the Hashemite dynasty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Nordic cross design traditionally represents Christianity. The design and colours of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross patt\u00e9e of gold. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.\nSpecifics.\nRatio and colour scheme.\nThe Swedish flag is one of only five that use the ratio 5:8, the others being the flags of Argentina, Guatemala, Palau, and Poland.\nIt is one of only five flags that currently use the colour scheme of blue and yellow, the others being the flags of Kazakhstan, Palau, Ukraine, and the European Union.\nState flag and civil ensign.\nThe dimensions of the Swedish flag are 5:2:9 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The dimensions of the Swedish flag with a triple-tail are 5:2:5:8 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The colours of the flag are officially established through the Natural Color System to be NCS 0580-Y10R for the shade of yellow, and NCS 4055-R95B for the shade of blue. They are also specified to Pantone \"PMS 301 C/U\" for blue and \"PMS 116\" or \"PMS 109 U\" for yellow. The square-cut Swedish state flag is identical to the civil ensign. The Swedish law does not regulate the design of the Swedish pennant, but it is recommended that its colour scheme should correspond with that of the flag.\nNaval ensign.\nThe triple-tailed flag () is used as a naval ensign (). Its overall ratio, including the tails, is 1:2. The flag is also used as the Swedish naval jack (). The jacks are smaller than the ensigns, but they have the same proportions. The Swedish swallowtail flag was originally the King's personal emblem, or the emblem representing a command conferred by the King. It was at first two-pointed, but by the mid-17th century, the distinctive swallowtail with tongue appeared. The flag is also flown by the defence ministry, while civil ministries fly square flags.\nRoyal flag.\nThe Royal flag () is identical to the triple-tailed naval ensign, but has in its centre a white field with the greater or the lesser coat of arms surrounded by the Order of the Seraphim, which has the monarch as its grand master. The monarch personally decides about the specific use of the royal flag.\nHistory.\nMythology.\nAccording to early modern legend, the 12th-century King Eric IX saw a golden cross in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade in 1157. Seeing this as a sign from God he adopted the golden cross against a blue background as his banner.\nAccording to one theory, the Swedish flag was created during the reign of King Charles VIII, who also introduced the coat of arms of Sweden in 1442. The national coat of arms is a combination of King Albert's coat of arms of 1364 and King Magnus III's coat of arms of 1275, and is blue divided quarterly by a golden cross patt\u00e9e.\nOther historians claim that the Swedish flag was blue with a white cross before 1420, and became blue with a golden cross a century later during the early reign of King Gustav I.\nEarly history.\nThe exact age of the Swedish flag is not known, but the oldest recorded pictures of a blue cloth with a yellow cross date from the early 16th century, during the reign of King Gustav I. The first legal description of the flag was made in a royal warrant of 19 April 1562 as \"yellow in a cross fashioned on blue\". As stipulated in a royal warrant of 1569, the yellow cross was always to be borne on Swedish battle standards and banners. Prior to this, a similar flag appeared in the coat of arms of King John III's duchy, which is today Southwest Finland. The same coat of arms is still used by the province.\nTriple-tailed flag.\nA royal warrant of 6 November 1663, regulated the use of the triple-tailed flag, to be used only as a state flag and naval ensign. According to the same royal warrant, merchant ships were only allowed to fly square-cut city flags in their respective provincial colours. In practice, however, the merchant fleet began using a square-cut civil ensign of the state flag. In a government instruction of ship building of 1730, this civil ensign should have the same proportions and colors as the state flag, with the notable difference of being square-cut. In 1756, the use of pennants by private ships was prohibited.\nBlue ensign.\nA royal warrant of 18 August 1761, stipulated that an all blue triple-tailed flag to be used by the archipelago fleet, a branch of the army tasked with defending the archipelago along the Swedish coastlines. The commander of the fleet also had the right to order the use of the ordinary war ensign instead of the blue ensign when that was \"appropriate\". The blue flag was used until 1813.\nUnion between Sweden and Norway.\nUnion flags of 1815 and 1818.\nOn 6 June 1815, a common military ensign was introduced for the two united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. This flag was identical to the former triple-tailed military ensign of Sweden, with a white saltire on red to be included in the canton. Proposed by the Norwegian Prime Minister and unionist Peder Anker, the white saltire on a red background was supposed to symbolise Norway, as the country had previously been united with Denmark and initially continued to use the same flag as an independent country, but with the national arms in the canton.\nNorwegian ships continued to use the Danish civil ensign distinguished with the national arms in the canton north of Cape Finisterre, but had to fly the Swedish civil ensign in the Mediterranean to be protected from pirate attacks. A common civil ensign for both countries was introduced in 1818, on the pattern of the naval ensign, but square-cut. This flag was optional for Swedish vessels, but compulsory for Norwegian ones in distant waters. In 1821, Norway adopted a new national civil ensign, identical to the present flag of Norway.\nFollowing the adoption of a separate Norwegian flag, a royal regulation of 17 July 1821, stipulated that ships of both kingdoms use the common square-cut civil ensign (with the saltire included) in \"distant waters\" (\"i.e.\" beyond Cape Finisterre). In \"distant waters\", they had the right to use any of the square-cut civil ensigns of their respective countries, or the uniform Union civil ensign. This system was in force until 1838.\nUnion flags of 1844.\nA royal resolution of 20 June 1844, introduced new flags and heraldry to denote the equal status of the two kingdoms within the union. Both countries were granted civil and military ensigns on the same pattern, their respective national flags with the addition of a union mark in the canton, combining the flag colours of both countries. The naval ensign was based on the traditional triple-tailed Swedish model. In addition, the new union mark was to be used as the naval jack and as the flag for the common diplomatic representations abroad. The warrant also stipulated that the merchant fleet use their respective countries' square-cut civil ensigns, including the new union mark. Also, royal ensigns were introduced for both countries, their respective naval ensigns with the union mark, with the addition of the union arms at the center of the cross.\nThe new union flags were well received by the Norwegians, who had demanded their own military ensign since the union was formed. In Sweden, however, the new union mark in particular became quite unpopular and was contemptuously nicknamed the \"Sillsallaten\" (Swedish) or \"Sildesalaten\" (Norwegian) after a colorful dish of pickled herring, decorated with red beets and apples in a radial pattern. It is believed that the name was first used in a speech by Lord Brakel in the Swedish House of Lords in Stockholm.\nDuring the 19th century, a number of regulations were issued regarding the use of Swedish flags. The military ensign was also to be used by civil government ships and buildings, such as the Customs, Harbor pilots and the Royal Mail. For this use, the military ensign would have a white field included with a golden marker: For the Harbor pilots (as of 1881, based on a proposal of 1825) an anchor with a star; for the Customs (as of 1844) the letter \"T\" topped a royal crown; for the Royal Mail (as of 1844) a postal horn with a royal crown. On 7 May 1897, an alternate state flag was introduced. This double-tailed flag was used by government owned ships and buildings, which did not fly the triple-tailed military ensign.\nDuring the late 19th century, increasing Norwegian dissatisfaction with the union led to the demand for a return to the \"pure\" flag of 1821 without the union mark. Opponents of the union began to use this flag several years before it was officially recognised. During the 1890s, two consecutive sessions of the Norwegian parliament voted to abolish the mark, but the decision was overruled by royal veto. However, in 1898, when the flag law was passed for the third time, the king had to sanction it. On 12 October 1899, the union mark was removed from the Norwegian civil ensign. As the Norwegian military ensign according to the constitution of 1814 was to be a union ensign, the union mark remained on military flags until the dissolution of the union with Sweden. \"Pure\" military ensigns were hoisted on fortresses and naval vessels on 9 June 1905.\nThe union mark, however, remained a part of the Swedish flag until 1905, when a Law of 28 October 1905, stipulated the removal of the union mark as of 1 November 1905.\nColour change in 1906.\nFollowing the dissolution of the union in 1905, the triple-tailed naval ensign also became the Swedish naval jack, replacing the common naval jack, and the Flag law of 22 June 1906 further regulated the use and design of the flag, specifying the colours to be \"ljust mellanbl\u00e5\" (light medium blue) and \"guldgul\" (golden yellow), a departure from the previously darker shade of blue. The Swedish state flag became identical to the square-cut civil ensign, and all private use of the triple-tailed ensign was prohibited.\nRoyal flag.\nThe king and queen use a royal flag with the greater national coat of arms. Other members of the royal house use a royal flag with the lesser national coat of arms. On naval ships the flag of the king is raised together with a split pennant with the greater national coat of arms. Likewise the flag of the heir apparent is raised together with a split pennant with the lesser national coat of arms on naval ships.\nThe Swedish Marshal of the Realm (\"Riksmarskalken\") has published a series of decisions regarding the royal flag of Sweden. In a decision of 6 April 1987, rules are defined on how to fly the royal flag at the Royal Palace of Stockholm.\nUnder King Carl XVI Gustaf, king since 1973, the plain triple-tailed flag has flown at the Royal Palace only once. This occurred on 2\u20133 July 1988, when the King went on a private visit to Wuppertal, West Germany; at the same time, the Duke of Halland, his uncle and the only person in the line of succession, was on a private visit to Sainte-Maxime, France. The government therefore ordered the speaker of the Riksdag, Ingemund Bengtsson, to serve as regent \"ad interim\" for two days.\nPrivate use of the state flag.\nThere have been a few notable exemptions regarding the prohibition of private parties to use the state flag. All these privileges were terminated in accordance with the new specific flag regulation of 22 June 1906.\nUse outside Sweden.\nThe flag of Sweden appears in coat of arms of Finland's province Southwest Finland.\nThe flag of Wilmington, Delaware in the United States is modelled after the Swedish flag in remembrance of the short-lived colony of New Sweden, with the cross affixed with the seal of the city. The flag of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which also lies within historic New Sweden, is a vertical triband rather than a Nordic Cross, but the blue and yellow colours of the flag were chosen to commemorate the Swedish settlement of the region. According to a legend, the Argentine football team Boca Juniors' flag and colours were inspired by the flag of Sweden.\nThe seal of the Municipal Council of Shanghai International Settlement incorporated the 1844 Swedish civil ensign.\nRules for displaying the Swedish flag.\nWhen used from a stand-alone flagpole, the size of the flag is recommended to have a width equalling a fourth of the height of the pole. When used from a flagpole extending from a building, the flag is recommended to have a width equalling a third of the height (length) of the pole.\nThe times and rules for raising and lowering the Swedish flag are as follows:\nIf the flag is no longer in presentable condition it should be discarded by burning in a respectful manner or returned to the manufacturer for disposal.\nPrivate citizens are not obliged to fly the flag on official flag flying days, but they are encouraged to do it. Apart from the flag flying days in Sweden, everyone is of course able to hoist the flag whenever there is a reason for celebration in the family or otherwise.\nPennant.\nSwedish pennant flying\nThe Swedish pennant is shaped like an isosceles triangle (to prevent fraying, it is sometimes shaped like an isosceles trapezoid), consisting of two horizontal bands with blue at the top and yellow at the bottom. The National Archives of Sweden recommends its length to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 the height of the flag pole. There is also an unofficial version of the pennant which resembles the national flag, with a yellow cross on a blue field, which is advised not to be used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At that time, the two most active anti-Saddam groups were the SCIRI and al-Dawa; both were Iranian-backed Islamic Shi'ite parties, originating from Iraq, but operating from Iran from which they received support. Both parties were disagreeable to the western powers, and Saudi Arabia, who had long poor relations with Iran. The INA was thus set up to be an alternative, largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia; with extra support coming from the UK and the United States.\nINA membership consisted largely of military and security personnel who had defected from the Iraqi military under Saddam Hussein's rule.\nThe INA organised attacks in Iraq between 1992 and 1995 to demonstrate its capacities as a militant group, but these had little effect on the government. In August 1995, Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel al-Majid authorized the INA to operate from Jordan after he too defected. Unlike the Iraqi National Congress strategy of fomenting revolution among Iraq's disaffected minorities, the INA felt the best way to remove Saddam was organizing a coup among Iraqi military and security services. To this end, the INA, in close cooperation with the CIA, was involved in a coup against Saddam in 1996. However, the INA had been infiltrated by agents loyal to Saddam, and in June, 1996, 30 Iraqi military officers were executed and 100 others were arrested for alleged ties to the INA. Allawi has claimed INA remained active in Iraq as of March, 1998.\nWith the fall of Saddam, the INA entered Iraq playing a central role in the occupation government. With the rift between the United States and the Iraqi National Congress, the INA's role was further enhanced and Allawi was declared Prime Minister of Iraq on 28 May 2004. Under Allawi, the INA participated in the January 2005 Iraqi election, as part of the Iraqi List coalition. In the December 2005 elections, it was part of the Iraqi National List coalition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established in Iran in 1982 by Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim and changed its name to the current Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007. Its political support comes from Iraq's Shia Muslim community.\nPrior to his assassination in August 2003, SCIRI was led by Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim; afterwards it was led by the Ayatollah's brother, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. After Abdul Aziz al-Hakim's death in 2009 his son Ammar al-Hakim became the group's new leader. In light of its gains in the three 2005 elections and government appointments, the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council became one of Iraq's most powerful political parties and was the largest party in the Iraqi Council of Representatives until the 2010 Iraqi elections, where it lost support due to Nuri Al-Maliki's political party rise.\nPreviously, ISCI's militia wing was the Badr Brigade, which the party used during the Iraqi civil war of 2006\u20132007. After the civil war, the Badr Brigade turned into a political force on its own and left ISCI, although the two continue to be part of a coalition in Iraq's parliament. After the departure of Badr Brigade, ISCI created a new militia called the Knights of Hope.\nHistory.\nIran.\nSupreme Council of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq was founded in Iran in 1982 during the Iran\u2013Iraq War after the leading Islamist insurgent group, Islamic Dawa Party, was severely weakened by an Iraqi government crackdown following Dawa's unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. SCIRI was the umbrella body for two Iran-based Shia Islamist groups, Dawa and the Islamic Action Organisation led by Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi. Another of SCIRI's founders was Ayatollah Hadi al-Modarresi, the leader the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The Iranian Islamic revolutionary government arranged for the formation of SCIRI, which was based in exile in Tehran and under the leadership of Mohammad-Baqir al-Hakim. Hakim, living in exile in Iran, was the son of Ayatollah Mohsen-Hakim and a member of one of the leading Shia clerical families in Iraq. \"He declared the primary aim of the council to be the overthrow of the Ba'ath and the establishment of an Islamic government in Iraq. Iranian officials referred to Hakim as the leader of Iraq's future Islamic state ...\"\nHowever, there are crucial ideological differences between SCIRI and al-Dawa. SCIRI supports the ideologies of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that must be controlled by the ulema (Islamic scholars). Al-Dawa, on the other hand, follows the position of Iraq's late Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, and al-Dawa co-founder, that government should be controlled by the ummah (Muslim community as a whole).\nDespite this ideological disagreement, several of SCIRI's factions came from al-Dawa before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This historical intersection is significant because al-Dawa was widely viewed as a terrorist group during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. In February 2007, journalists reported that Jamal Jaafar Muhammed, who was elected to the Iraqi parliament in 2005 as part of the SCIRI/Badr faction of the United Iraqi Alliance, was also sentenced to death in Kuwait for planning the al-Dawa bombings of the French and American embassies in that country in 1983.\nPost-invasion.\nWith the fall of Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Iraq, SCIRI quickly rose to prominence in Iraq, working closely with the other Shia parties. It gained popularity among Shia Iraqis by providing social services and humanitarian aid, following the pattern of Islamic organizations in other countries such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. SCIRI is alleged to receive money and weapons from Iran, and is often accused of being a proxy for Iranian interests. The party leaders have toned down many of the party's public positions and committed it to democracy and peaceful cooperation. SCIRI's power base is in the Shia-majority southern Iraq. The council's armed wing, the Badr Organization, reportedly has had an estimated strength of between 4,000 and 10,000 men. Its Baghdad offices are based in a house that previously belonged to Ba'athist Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.\nIts leader, Ayatollah al-Hakim, was killed in a car bomb attack in the Iraqi city of Najaf on August 29, 2003. The car bomb exploded as the ayatollah was leaving a religious shrine (Imam Ali Mosque) in the city, just after Friday prayers, killing more than 85. According to Kurdish Intelligence officials, Yassin Jarad, allegedly Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's father-in-law, carried out the car bombing.\nInterior Ministry.\nIn the Shia Islamist\u2013dominated government in post-invasion Iraq, SCIRI controlled the Interior Ministry. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, was a former leader of SCIRI's Badr Brigade militia. In 2006 the United Nations human rights chief in Iraq, John Pace, said that every month hundreds of Iraqis were being tortured to death or executed by the Interior Ministry under SCIRI's control. According to a 2006 report by the \"Independent\" newspaper:\n'Mr Pace said the Ministry of the Interior was \"acting as a rogue element within the government\". It is controlled by the main Shia party, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri); the Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, is a former leader of Sciri's Badr Brigade militia, which is one of the main groups accused of carrying out sectarian killings. Another is the Mehdi Army of the young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is part of the Shia coalition seeking to form a government after winning the mid-December election.\nMany of the 110,000 policemen and police commandos under the ministry's control are suspected of being former members of the Badr Brigade. Not only counter-insurgency units such as the Wolf Brigade, the Scorpions and the Tigers, but the commandos and even the highway patrol police have been accused of acting as death squads.\nThe paramilitary commandos, dressed in garish camouflage uniforms and driving around in pick-up trucks, are dreaded in Sunni neighbourhoods. People whom they have openly arrested have frequently been found dead several days later, with their bodies bearing obvious marks of torture.'\nPolitics.\nSIIC is a Shia Islamist political party that is widely regarded as one of the most pro-Iranian parties in Iraq. SIIC's support is strongest in Iraq's south especially Basra, where it has been said to have become \"the de facto government.\"\nIt joined the United Iraqi Alliance list for the general election on January 30, 2005 (see Iraqi legislative election, 2005), but filed separate lists in some governorate council elections held on the same day (see for instance 2005 Nineveh governorate election). In the January 2005 election it won six out of eight Shia-majority governorates and came in first in Baghdad with 40% of the vote. Following the election SIIC had many members hired by various government ministries, particularly the Interior Ministry, \"ensuring a favorable position for\" it.\nIts administration in Southern Iraq has been criticized as corrupt and as \"theocracy mixed with thuggery\" According to a 2005 report by journalist Doug Ireland, the Badr Organization has been involved in many incidents of attacking and killing gays in Iraq. According to the British television Channel 4, from 2005 through early 2006, SIIC's Badr Organization members working as commandos in the Ministry of the Interior (which Badr controls) \"have been implicated in rounding up and killing thousands of ordinary Sunni civilians.\"\nIdeologically SIIC differs from Muqtada al-Sadr and its sometime ally Islamic Dawa Party, in favoring a decentralized Iraq state with an autonomous Shia zone in the south.\n2009 governorate elections.\nDuring the 2009 Iraqi governorate elections ISCI ran under the name \"al-Mehrab Martyr List\", the ISCI did not perform as well as they hoped to, winning 6.6% of vote and 52 out of 440 seats. They did however come second in the election.\nIranian support.\nIn a BBC interview in London, Ghazi al-Yawar the Sunni Arab sheik, cited reports that Iran sent close to a million people to Iraq and covertly supplied Shia religious groups with money to help compete in the elections. But U.S. and Iraqi officials say that many of the migrants crossing the largely unmonitored border are Iraqi Shia families who fled Saddam Hussein's repression, particularly after the failed Shia uprising that followed the 1991 Gulf war.\nSupreme Council name change.\nThe Council was formerly known as SCIRI, but in a statement released May 11, 2007 SCIRI officials told Reuters the Islamist party would change its name to reflect what they called the changing situation in Iraq, removing the word \"Revolution\" because that was seen as a reference to overthrowing the Ba'athist government. \"Our name will change to the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. Other things will change as well,\" said the SCIRI official.\nExpressing the council's rejection of the \"concept of a civil or sectarian war,\" the statement accused terrorists, extremists and supporters of Takfiri (accusing someone of unbelief) of causing bloodshed in Iraq.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70798", "revid": "50849194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70798", "title": "Valkyrie", "text": "Figures in Norse mythology\nIn Norse mythology, a valkyrie ( or ; from ) is one of a host of female figures who guide souls of the dead to the god Odin's hall Valhalla. There, the deceased warriors become ('single fighters' or 'once fighters'). When the are not preparing for the cataclysmic events of Ragnar\u00f6k, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.\nValkyries are attested in the \"Poetic Edda\" (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the \"Prose Edda\", the (both by Snorri Sturluson) and the (one of the Sagas of Icelanders), all written\u2014or compiled\u2014in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of skalds, in a 14th-century charm, and in various runic inscriptions.\nThe Old English cognate term appears in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the term appears in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflects a tradition also native among the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the Norns, and the , all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"valkyrie\" derives from Old Norse \"valkyrja\" (plural ), which is composed of two words: the noun \"valr\" (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb \"kj\u00f3sa\" (meaning \"to choose\"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse is cognate to Old English \"w\u00e6lcyrge\". From the Old English and Old Norse forms, philologist Vladimir Orel reconstructs the Proto-Germanic form . However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the Old English attestations section below.\nOther terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include (\"wish maid\"), appearing in the poem , and (\"Odin's maids\"), appearing in the . may be related to the Odinic name (roughly meaning \"wish fulfiller\"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.\nThe name \"Randal\u00edn\", which Aslaug is called in \"Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar\", when she joins her sons to avenge their brothers Agnarr and Eric in Sweden, is probably from \"Randa-Hl\u00edn\", which means \"shield-goddess\", i.e. a kenning for \"Valkyrie\".\nOld Norse attestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nValkyries are mentioned or appear in the \"Poetic Edda\" poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", \"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\", \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\", \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\", \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\" and \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\".\n\"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" and \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\".\nIn stanza 30 of the poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", a v\u00f6lva (a travelling seeress in Norse society) tells Odin that \"she saw\" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to \"the realm of the gods\". The v\u00f6lva follows this with a list of six valkyries: Skuld (Old Norse, possibly \"debt\" or \"future\") who \"bore a shield\", Sk\u00f6gul (\"shaker\"), Gunnr (\"war\"), Hildr (\"battle\"), G\u00f6ndul (\"wand-wielder\") and Geirsk\u00f6gul (\"Spear-Sk\u00f6gul\"). Afterwards, the v\u00f6lva tells him she has listed the \"ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth\".\nIn the poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Odin (disguised as \"Gr\u00edmnir\"), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young Agnar that he wishes that the valkyries Hrist (\"shaker\") and Mist (\"cloud\") would \"bear him a [drinking] horn\", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says \"bear ale to the einherjar\"; Skeggj\u00f6ld (\"axe-age\"), Sk\u00f6gul, Hildr, \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r (\"power\"), Hl\u00f6kk (\"noise\", or \"battle\"), Herfj\u00f6tur (\"host-fetter\"), G\u00f6ll (\"tumult\"), Geirah\u00f6\u00f0 (\"spear-fight\"), Randgr\u00ed\u00f0 (\"shield-truce\"), R\u00e1\u00f0gr\u00ed\u00f0 (\"council-truce\") and Reginleif (\"power-truce\").\n\"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\".\nA prose introduction in the poem \"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\" relates that the brothers Slagfi\u00f0r, Egil and V\u00f6lund dwelt in a house sited in a location called \u00dalfdalir (\"wolf dales\"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake \u00dalfsj\u00e1r (\"wolf lake\"), and \"near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries\". Two daughters of King Hl\u00f6dv\u00e9r are named Hla\u00f0gu\u00f0r svanhv\u00edt (\"swan-white\") and Herv\u00f6r alvitr (possibly meaning \"all-wise\" or \"strange creature\"); the third, daughter of Kj\u00e1rr of Valland, is named \u00d6lr\u00fan (possibly meaning \"beer rune\"). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them\u2014Egil takes \u00d6lr\u00fan, Slagfi\u00f0r takes Hla\u00f0gu\u00f0r svanhv\u00edt and V\u00f6lund takes Herv\u00f6r alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for \u00d6lr\u00fan, Slagfi\u00f0r goes searching for Hla\u00f0gu\u00f0r svanhv\u00edt and V\u00f6lund sits in \u00dalfdalir.\n\"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\".\nIn the poem \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\", a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0r and Sigrlinn of Sv\u00e1faland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a burial mound. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as Sv\u00e1va, King Eylimi's daughter, who \"often protected him in battles\". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name \"Helgi\" (meaning \"the holy one\"). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as \"bright-face lady\", and asks her what gift he will receive with the name she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail. Further into the poem, Atli flytes with the female j\u00f6tunn Hr\u00edmger\u00f0r. While flyting with Atli, Hr\u00edmger\u00f0r says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter Hr\u00edmger\u00f0r is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sv\u00e1va's father\u2014King Eylimi\u2014and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sv\u00e1va are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sv\u00e1va stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sv\u00e1va \"was a valkyrie just as before\". The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sv\u00e1va \"are said to be reincarnated\".\n\"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\".\nIn the poem \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\", the hero Helgi Hundingsbane sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafj\u00f6ll. A light shines from the fell, and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length mail armour is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as \"southern goddesses\") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigr\u00fan (\"victory-rune\"), informs him from her horse that her father H\u00f6gni has betrothed her to H\u00f6\u00f0broddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigr\u00fan deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigr\u00fan in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfj\u00f6tli flytes with Gu\u00f0mundr. Sinfj\u00f6tli accuses Gu\u00f0mundr of having once been female, and gibes that Gu\u00f0mundr was \"a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries\", adding that all of the einherjar \"had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account\". Further in the poem, the phrase \"the valkyrie's airy sea\" is used for \"mist\".\nTowards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigr\u00fan and wolves (referred to as \"the troll-woman's mount\") consume corpses:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe battle won, Sigr\u00fan tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.\n\"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\".\nAt the beginning of the poem \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\", a prose narrative says that King Sigmund (son of V\u00f6lsung) and his wife Borghild (of Br\u00e1lund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0sson (the protagonist of the earlier \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\"). After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigr\u00fan. Sigr\u00fan, daughter of King H\u00f6gni, is \"a valkyrie and rode through air and sea\", and she is the valkyrie Sv\u00e1va reincarnated. In stanza 7, Sigr\u00fan uses the phrase \"fed the gosling of Gunn's sisters\". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are ravens, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.\nAfter stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigr\u00fan. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land. Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigr\u00fan from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigr\u00fan later dies of grief. The epilogue details that \"there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated\" and that \"Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn\" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaska\u00f0i and Sigr\u00fan as the daughter of Halfdan; the valkyrie K\u00e1ra. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work \"K\u00e1rulj\u00f3\u00f0\".\n\"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\".\nIn the prose introduction to the poem \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", the hero Sigurd rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards \"the land of the Franks\". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, \"as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky\". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a \"skjaldborg\" with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the \"skjaldborg\", and sees a warrior lying there\u2014asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's corslet is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.\nThe woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdr\u00edfa and that she is a valkyrie.\nA narrative relates that Sigrdr\u00edfa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these\u2014Hjalmgunnar\u2014victory in battle, yet she had \"brought down\" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again \"fight victoriously in battle\", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdr\u00edfa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdr\u00edfa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdr\u00edfa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes, mystic wisdom, and prophecy.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book \"Gylfaginning\", where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says \"there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups.\" Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" that contains a list of valkyries. High says \"these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory\". High adds that Gunnr (\"war\"), R\u00f3ta, and Skuld\u2014the last of the three he refers to as \"the youngest norn\"\u2014\"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle\". In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr, with them came the valkyries and also Odin's ravens.\nReferences to valkyries appear throughout the book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work \"H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa\" by the 10th century skald \u00dalfr Uggason. In the poem, \u00dalfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem \"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\" is provided (see the \"Fagrskinna\" section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including \"[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or \"d\u00edsir\"\". In chapter 41, while the hero Sigurd is riding his horse Grani, he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a coat of mail. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and \"she is known as Brynhildr, and was a valkyrie\".\nIn chapter 48, poetic terms for \"battle\" include \"weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise\", followed by examples of compositions by various skalds that have used the name of valkyries in said manner (\u00deorbj\u00f6rn Hornklofi uses \"Sk\u00f6gul's din\" for \"battlefield\", Bersi Sk\u00e1ldtorfuson uses \"Gunnr's fire\" for \"sword\" and \"Hl\u00f6kk's snow\" for \"battle\", Einarr Sk\u00falason uses \"Hildr's sail\" for \"shield\" and \"G\u00f6ndul's crushing wind\" for \"battle\" and Einarr sk\u00e1laglamm uses \"G\u00f6ndul's din\"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term \"death-maidens\"\u2014Old Norse \"valmeyjar\"\u2014instead of \"valkyries\" is used here), with further examples. In chapter 57, within a list of names of \u00e1synjur (and after alternate names for the goddess Freyja are provided), a further section contains a list of \"Odin's maids\"; valkyries: Hildr, G\u00f6ndul, Hl\u00f6kk, Mist, Sk\u00f6gul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, Eir, Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that \"they are called norns who shape necessity\".\nSome manuscripts of the feature \"Nafna\u00feulur\" section of \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the \"valkyries of Vi\u00f0rir\"\u2014a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hl\u00f6kk, Geirav\u00f6r, G\u00f6ll, Hj\u00f6r\u00ferimul, Gu\u00f0r, Herfj\u00f6tra, Skuld, Geir\u00f6nul, Sk\u00f6gul and Randgn\u00ed\u00f0. The second stanza lists: R\u00e1\u00f0gr\u00ed\u00f0r, G\u00f6ndul, Svipul, Geirsk\u00f6gul, Hildr, Skegg\u00f6ld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgr\u00ed\u00f0r, \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r, Reginleif, Svei\u00f0, \u00de\u00f6gn, Hjalm\u00ferimul, \u00derima and Skalm\u00f6ld.\n\"Hrafnsm\u00e1l\".\nThe fragmentary skaldic poem \"Hrafnsm\u00e1l\" (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald \u00deorbj\u00f6rn Hornklofi) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of Harald I of Norway. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a \"high-minded\", \"golden-haired\" and \"white-armed\" maiden speaking with a \"glossy-beaked raven\". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.\n\"Nj\u00e1ls saga\".\nIn chapter 156 of \"Nj\u00e1ls saga\", a man named D\u00f6rru\u00f0 witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and D\u00f6rru\u00f0 can no longer see them. D\u00f6rru\u00f0 goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called \"Darra\u00f0arlj\u00f3\u00f0\", which D\u00f6rru\u00f0 memorizes.\nThe song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf (fought outside Dublin in 1014 CE). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, Hj\u00f6r\u00ferimul, Sanngri\u00f0r, Svipul, Gu\u00f0r and G\u00f6ndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt the end of the poem, the valkyries sing \"start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled\u2014hence to battle with brandished swords!\" The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. D\u00f6rru\u00f0 leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.\n\"Heimskringla\".\nAt the end of the \"Heimskringla\" saga \"H\u00e1konar saga g\u00f3\u00f0a\", the poem \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\" by the 10th century skald Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died \"among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you\". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to S\u00e6heim in North Hordaland. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, \"words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla\". The poem \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\" is then provided.\nIn \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\", Odin sends forth the two valkyries G\u00f6ndul and Sk\u00f6gul to \"choose among the kings' kinsmen\" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning \"Sk\u00f6gul's-stormblast\" for \"battle\". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie G\u00f6ndul leaning on a spear shaft. G\u00f6ndul comments that \"groweth now the gods' following, since H\u00e1kon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads\". Haakon hears \"what the valkyries said\", and the valkyries are described as sitting \"high-hearted on horseback\", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Sk\u00f6gul:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSk\u00f6gul says that they shall now ride forth to the \"green homes of the godheads\" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.\n\"Fagrskinna\".\nIn chapter 8 of \"Fagrskinna\", a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as \"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\". It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse \"\u00d3\u00f0inn\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking\u2014as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla\u2014and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfj\u00f6tli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.\nRagnhild Tregag\u00e1s charm.\nA witchcraft trial held in 1324 in Bergen, Norway, records a spell used by the accused Ragnhild Tregag\u00e1s to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named B\u00e1rd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie G\u00f6ndul being \"sent out\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOld English attestations.\nThe Old English appears several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. It is used in the sermon , where it is thought to appear as a word for a human \"sorceress\". An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) glosses with (with meaning \"goddess\"). is used to translate the names of the classical furies in two manuscripts (Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, and the older \"Corpus Glossary\"). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, is also used to gloss the Roman goddess Bellona. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as (meaning \"dark one choosing the slain\"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).\nArchaeological record.\nFemale figures, cups, and horn-bearers.\nViking Age stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing drinking horns, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or d\u00edsir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because \"they were thought to have protective powers\".\nThe Tj\u00e4ngvide image stone from the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female figure, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female figure bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.\nIn 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in H\u00e5rby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that \"there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700\".\nRunic inscriptions.\nSpecific valkyries are mentioned on two runestones; the early 9th century R\u00f6k runestone in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Sweden, and the 10th-century Karlevi Runestone on the island of \u00d6land, Sweden, which mentions the valkyrie \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r. On the R\u00f6k runestone, a kenning is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAmong the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, Norway, is the \"valkyrie stick\" from the late 14th century. The stick features a runic inscription intended as a charm. The inscription says that \"I cut cure-runes\", and also \"help-runes\", once against elves, twice against trolls, thrice against thurs and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis is followed by \"I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and \"j\u00f6luns\" wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself.\" According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription \"seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie\", and they posit the final line appears \"to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman\".\nMacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", where the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term \"skag\" is unclear, but a cognate exists in \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\" where Sinfj\u00f6tli accuses Gu\u00f0mundr of having once been a \"\"skass\"-valkyrie\". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like \"supernatural sending\", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregag\u00e1s charm, where a valkyrie is also \"sent forth\".\nValkyrie names.\nThe Old Norse poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", \"Darra\u00f0arlj\u00f3\u00f0\" and the \"Nafna\u00feulur\" section of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as \"Sigr\u00fan\" (who is attested in the poems \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\" and \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\"). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear\u2014a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds.\nSome valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name \"Herja\" has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess \"Hariasa\", who is attested from a stone from 187\u00a0CE. The name \"Herfj\u00f6tur\" has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters. The name \"Svipul\" may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or \u00f8rlog\u2014a Germanic concept of fate.\nTheories.\nOld English and Old English charms.\nRichard North says that the description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army (glossed as ) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of in may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse , but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the \"Corpus Glossary\" instances \"appear to show an Anglo-Saxon conception of that was independent of contemporary Scandinavian influence\".\nTwo Old English charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; , a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and \"For a Swarm of Bees\", a charm to keep honey bees from swarming. In , a sudden pain is attributed to a small, \"shrieking\" spear thrown with supernatural strength () by \"fierce\" loudly flying \"mighty women\" () who have ridden over a burial mound:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries. Richard North says that \"though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as women being analogous to the later Norse .\" Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke \"a prosaic stitch in the side\". Towards the end of \"For a Swarm of Bees\", the swarming bees are referred to as \"victory-women\" (Old English ):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe term \"victory women\" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the \"victorious sword\" (the stinging) of the bees.\nMerseburg Incantation, fetters, , and norns.\nOne of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings\u2014\"Idisi\"\u2014to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,\nsome bound fetters, some hampered the army,\nsome untied fetters:\nEscape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe \"Idisi\" mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that \"these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology\" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name (Old Norse \"army-fetter\"). Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English charm and theorises a similar role for them both.\nSimek says that the West Germanic term \"Idisi\" (, , ) refers to a \"dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin \" and that a link to the North Germanic term is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. Also notable is the place name Idisiaviso (meaning \"plain of the Idisi\") where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name \"Idisiaviso\", the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.\nRegarding the , Simek states that Old Norse appears commonly as simply a term for \"woman\", just as Old High German , Old Saxon and Old English , and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, \"several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in I 19 the valkyries are even called \"Odin's \". The are explicitly called dead women in 28 and a secondary belief that the were the souls of dead women (see ) also underlies the of Icelandic folklore. Simek says that \"as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied\u2014fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses\u2014the belief in the , like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.\"\nJacob Grimm states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a can be both norn and a valkyrie, \"but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs \"ride\" to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods\".\nOrigins and development.\nVarious theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as \"demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged\", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred \"when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise\". Simek says that this original concept was \"superseded by the shield girls\u2014Irish female warriors who lived on like the \"einherjar\" in Valhall.\" Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as \"demons of death\". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry, and during this transition were stripped of their \"demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...].\" Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old, and that the names \"mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief.\"\nMacLeod and Mees theorise that \"the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the Norns, the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...].\"\nHilda Ellis Davidson says that, regarding valkyries, \"evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the seeresses, who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea\". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a \"priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle.\"\nDavidson places emphasis on the fact that \"valkyrie\" literally means \"chooser of the slain\". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a \"chooser of the slain\" in his \"Sermo Lupi ad Anglos\" sermon, which appears among \"a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers\", to \"all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions\", and concludes as those \"are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well.\" Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an \"old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon\" (who Fadlan refers to as the \"Angel of Death\") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that \"it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god \"chose\" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war.\" Davidson says that it appears that from \"early times\" the Germanic peoples \"believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain.\"\nFreyja and F\u00f3lkvangr.\nThe goddess Freyja and her afterlife field F\u00f3lkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m points out the description in \"Gylfaginning\" where it is said of Freyja \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain\", and interprets \"F\u00f3lkvangr\" as \"the field of the Warriors\". N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to \u00d3\u00f0inn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"\nSiegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death-realm F\u00f3lkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role-model for the Valkyrjar [\"sic\"] and the d\u00edsir\".\nModern art.\nValkyries have been the subjects of various poems, stories, works of visual art, musical works, movies, TV-series and cartoons, comic books, and video games.\nIn poetry, valkyries appear in \"\"Die Walk\u00fcren\"\" by H. Heine (appearing in \"Romanzero\", 1847), \"\"Die Walk\u00fcren\"\" (1864) by H. v. Linge, and \"\"Sk\u00f6ldmon\"\" (appearing in \"G\u00f6mda Land\", 1904). In music, they appear in \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" by Richard Wagner (1870), from which the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is the best-known theme. In literature, Valkyries make an appearance in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Marsh King's Daughter\".\nWorks of visual art depicting valkyries include \"Die Walk\u00fcren\" (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, \"Reitende Walk\u00fcre\" (fresco), previously located in Munich palace but now destroyed, 1865\u201366 by M.

{"id": "70801", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70801", "title": "Yuri (genre)", "text": "Fiction genre depicting female same-sex relationships\n, also known by the \"wasei-eigo\" construction , is a genre of Japanese media focusing on intimate relationships between female characters. While lesbian relationships are a commonly associated theme, the genre is also inclusive of works depicting emotional and spiritual relationships between women that are not necessarily romantic or sexual in nature. \"Yuri\" is most commonly associated with anime and manga, though the term has also been used to describe video games, light novels, and other forms of literature.\nThemes associated with \"yuri\" originate from Japanese lesbian fiction of the early twentieth century, notably the writings of Nobuko Yoshiya and literature in the Class S genre. Manga depicting female homoeroticism began to appear in the 1970s in the works of artists associated with the Year 24 Group, notably Ryoko Yamagishi and Riyoko Ikeda. The genre gained wider popularity beginning in the 1990s. The founding of \"Yuri Shimai\" in 2003 as the first manga magazine devoted exclusively to \"yuri\", followed by its successor \"Comic Yuri Hime\" in 2005, led to the establishment of \"yuri\" as a discrete publishing genre and the creation of a \"yuri\" fan culture.\nAs a genre, \"yuri\" does not inherently target a single gender demographic, unlike its male homoerotic counterparts boys' love (BL, marketed towards a female audience) and gay manga (marketed towards a gay male audience). Although \"yuri\" originated as a genre targeted towards a female audience, \"yuri\" works have been produced that target a male audience, as in manga from \"Comic Yuri Hime\"'s male-targeted sister magazine \"Comic Yuri Hime S\".\nTerminology and etymology.\n\"Yuri\".\nThe word translates literally to \"lily\", and is a relatively common Japanese feminine name. White lilies have been used since the Romantic era of Japanese literature to symbolize beauty and purity in women, and are a de facto symbol of the \"yuri\" genre.\nIn 1976, Ito Bungaku, editor of the gay men's magazine , used the term in reference to female readers of the magazine in a column of letters titled . While not all women whose letters appeared in \"Yurizoku no Heya\" were lesbians, and it is unclear whether the column was the first instance of the term \"yuri\" in this context, an association of \"yuri\" with lesbianism subsequently developed. For example, the male\u2013male romance magazine \"Allan\" began publishing in July 1983 as a personal ad column for \"lesbiennes\" to communicate.\nThe term came to be associated with lesbian pornographic manga beginning in the 1990s, notably through the manga magazine \"Lady's Comic Misuto\" (1996\u20131999), which heavily featured symbolic lily flowers. When the term \"yuri\" began being used in the West in the 1990s, it was similarly used almost exclusively to describe pornographic manga aimed at male readers featuring lesbian couples. Over time, the term drifted from this pornographic connotation to describe the portrayal of intimate love, sex, or emotional connections between women, and became broadly recognized as a genre name for works depicting same-sex female intimacy in the mid-2000s following the founding of the specialized \"yuri\" manga magazines \"Yuri Shimai\" and \"Comic Yurihime\". The Western use of \"yuri\" subsequently broadened beginning in the 2000s, picking up connotations from the Japanese use. American publishing companies such as ALC Publishing and Seven Seas Entertainment have also adopted the Japanese usage of the term to classify their \"yuri\" manga publications.\nIn Korea and China, \"lily\" is used as a semantic loan from the Japanese usage to describe female\u2013female romance media, where each use the direct translation of the term: \"baekhap\" (\ubc31\ud569) in Korea, and \"b\u01ceih\u00e9\" (\u767e\u5408) in China.\nGirls' love.\nThe \"wasei-eigo\" construction and its abbreviation \"GL\" were adopted by Japanese publishers in the 2000s, likely as an antonym of the male\u2013male romance genre boys' love (BL). While the term is generally considered synonymous with \"yuri\", in rare cases it is used to denote \"yuri\" media that is sexually explicit, following the publication of the erotic \"yuri\" manga anthology \"Girls Love\" by Ichijinsha in 2011. However, this distinction is infrequently made, and \"yuri\" and \"girls' love\" are almost always used interchangeably.\n\"Sh\u014djo-ai\".\nIn the 1990s, Western fans began to use the term to describe \"yuri\" works that do not depict explicit sex. Its usage was modeled after the Western appropriation of the term to describe BL works that do not feature sexually explicit content. In Japan, the term \"sh\u014djo-ai\" is not used with this meaning, and instead denotes pedophilic relationships between adult men and girls.\nHistory.\nBefore 1970: Class S literature.\nAmong the first Japanese authors to produce works about love between women was Nobuko Yoshiya, a novelist active in the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa periods. Yoshiya was a pioneer in Japanese lesbian literature, including the early twentieth century Class S genre. Her works popularized many of the ideas and tropes which drove the \"yuri\" genre for years to come. Class S stories depict lesbian attachments as emotionally intense yet platonic relationships, destined to be curtailed by graduation from school, marriage, or death. The root of this genre is in part the contemporary belief that same-sex love was a transitory and normal part of female development leading into heterosexuality and motherhood. Class S developed in the 1930s through Japanese girls' magazines, but declined as a result of state censorship brought about by the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War in 1937. Though homosociality between girls would re-emerge as a common theme in post-war \"sh\u014djo\" manga (comics for girls), Class S gradually declined in popularity in favor of works focused on male\u2013female romances.\nTraditionally, Class S stories focus on strong emotional bonds between an upperclassman and an underclassman, or in rare cases, between a student and her teacher. Private all-girls schools are a common setting for Class S stories, which are depicted as an idyllic homosocial world reserved for women. Works in the genre focus heavily on the beauty and innocence of their protagonists, a theme that would recur in \"yuri\". Critics have alternately considered Class S as a distinct genre from \"yuri\", as a \"proto-\"yuri\"\", and a component of \"yuri\".\n1970s and 1980s: The \"dark age\".\nIn 1970, manga artist Masako Yashiro published the \"sh\u014djo\" manga , which focuses on a love triangle between two girls and a boy. Noted as the first non-Class S manga to depict an intimate relationship between women, \"Sh\u012bkuretto Rabu\" is regarded by some scholars as the first work in the \"yuri\" genre. As both Yashiro and \"Sh\u012bkuretto Rabu\" are relatively obscure and the work focuses in part on male\u2013female romance, most critics identify \"Shiroi Heya no Futari\" by Ry\u014dko Yamagishi, published in 1971, as the first \"yuri\" manga. The 1970s also saw \"sh\u014djo\" manga that dealt with transgender characters and characters who blur gender distinctions through cross-dressing, which was inspired in part by the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female theater troupe where women play male roles. These traits are most prominent in Riyoko Ikeda's works, including \"The Rose of Versailles\" (1972\u20131973), \"Dear Brother\" (1975), and \"Claudine\" (1978). Some \"sh\u014dnen\" works of this period featured lesbian characters, though they were typically depicted as fanservice and comic relief.\nRoughly a dozen \"yuri\" manga were published from the 1970s to the early 1990s, with the majority being published in the 1970s. Most of these stories are tragedies, focused on doomed relationships that end in separation or death. Owing to the small number of works published during this period and their generally tragic focus, \"Yuri Shimai\" has referred to the 1970s and 1980s as the \"dark age\" of \"yuri\". Several theories have emerged to explain the bias towards tragic narratives present in this period. Writer and translator Frederik L. Schodt notes that the majority of \"sh\u014djo\" manga published during this period were tragic, regardless of whether or not they were \"yuri\". James Welker of Kanagawa University argues that these narratives represent a form of \"lesbian panic\", where the character\u2014and by extension, the author\u2014refuses their own lesbian feelings and desires. Verena Maser suggests that the decline of Class S removed the only context in which intimate relationships between women were possible, while Yukari Fujimoto suggests that patriarchal forces were responsible for tragic endings in these stories.\n1990s: Mainstream popularity.\nBy the 1990s, tragic story formulas in manga had declined in popularity. 1992 saw the release of two major works for the development of \"yuri\": \"Jukkai me no Jukkai\" (1992) by Wakuni Akisato, which began to move the genre away from tragic outcomes and stereotyped dynamics; and the anime adaptation of \"Sailor Moon\" (1991\u20131997) by Naoko Takeuchi, the first mainstream manga and anime series to feature a \"positive\" portrayal of a lesbian relationship in the coupling of Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The immense popularity of \"Sailor Moon\" allowed the series to be adapted into anime, films, and to be exported internationally, significantly influencing the \"sh\u014djo\" and \"yuri\" genres. Uranus and Neptune became popular subjects of \"d\u014djinshi\" (self-published manga, analogous to fan comics) and contributed to the development of \"yuri d\u014djinshi\" culture.\nThe success of \"Sailor Moon\" significantly influenced the development of \"yuri\", and by the mid-1990s, anime, and manga featuring intimate relationships between women enjoyed mainstream success and popularity. \"Sailor Moon\" director Kunihiko Ikuhara went on to create \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" (1997\u20131999), a \"sh\u014djo\" anime series with female same-sex relationships as a central focus. This period also saw a revival of the Class S genre through the bestselling light novel series \"Maria-sama ga Miteru\" (1998\u20132004) by Oyuki Konno, which by 2010 had 5.4 million copies in print. Another prominent author of this period is Kaho Nakayama, active since the early 1990s, with works involving love stories among women. The first Japanese magazines specifically targeted towards lesbians, many of which contained sections featuring \"yuri\" manga, also emerged during this period. Stories in these magazines ranged from high school romance to lesbian life and love and featured varying degrees of sexual content.\n2000s: Publishing and fan culture growth.\nFaced with a proliferation of stories focused on homosociality, homoeroticism, and female homosexuality, some publishers sought to exploit the \"yuri\" market by creating manga magazines dedicated to the genre, coalescing around \"yuri\" as the preferred name for this genre in response to its popularity in \"d\u014djinshi\" culture. In 2003, \"Yuri Tengoku\" and \"Yuri Shimai\" launched as the first manga magazines devoted exclusively to \"yuri\". This was followed by the female-oriented \"Comic Yuri Hime\" in 2005 and the male-oriented \"Comic Yuri Hime S\" in 2007; the two magazines merged under the title \"Comic Yuri Hime\" in 2010.\nStories in these magazines dealt with a range of themes, from intense emotional connections such as those depicted in \"Voiceful\" (2004\u20132006), to sexually explicit schoolgirl romances like those portrayed in \"First Love Sisters\" (2003\u20132008), and realistic tales about love between adult women such as those seen in \"The Conditions of Paradise\" (2007). Some of these subjects are seen in male-targeted works of this period as well, sometimes in combination with other themes, including mecha and science fiction. Examples include series such as \"Kannazuki no Miko\" (2004\u20132005), \"Blue Drop\" (2004\u20132008), and \"\" (2004\u20132007). In addition, male-targeted stories tend to make extensive use of \"moe\" and \"bish\u014djo\" characterizations.\nThe publication of \"yuri\" magazines had the effect of nurturing a \"\"yuri\" culture\" that influenced artists to create works depicting female same-sex relationships. Further, articles in these magazines contributed to the history of the genre by retroactively labeling certain works as \"yuri\", thus developing \"a historical canon of the \"yuri\" genre.\" Specifically, Verena Maser notes in her analysis of issues of \"Yuri Shimai\", \"Comic Yurihime\", and \"Comic Yurihime S\" published from 2003 to 2012 that eight of the ten most-referenced series in the magazines predate the 2003 formalization of \"yuri\" as a publishing genre: \"Apur\u014dzu - Kassai\" (1981\u20131985), \"Sakura no Sono\" (1985\u20131986), \"Sailor Moon\" (1992\u20131996), \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" (1996\u20132000), \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" (1997\u20131999), \"Maria-sama ga Miteru\" (1998\u20132012), \"Loveless\" (2002\u2013present), and \"Strawberry Marshmallow\" (2002\u2013present).\n2010s\u2013present: Genre diversification.\nWhile schoolgirl romances remained popular into the 2010s and 2020s, notably \"Kase-san\" (2010\u20132017), \"Citrus\" (2012\u20132018), \"Bloom Into You\" (2015\u20132019), and \"Whisper Me a Love Song\" (2019\u2013present), \"yuri\" works during this period began to incorporate new genres, themes, and subject material. The mid-2010s saw \"yuri\" works expand to genres such as science fiction and \"isekai\", as well as the formalization of as a subgenre focused on stories involving adult women. The growth of digital platforms like Pixiv, Twitter, and Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d allowed for the creation and widespread distribution of \"yuri\" works outside of traditional manga magazine and \"d\u014djinshi\" publishing: \"My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness\" (2016) was originally published as a web comic, while the \"yuri\" fantasy works \"Sexiled\" (2018\u20132019), \"Roll Over and Die\" (2018\u2013present), and \"I'm in Love with the Villainess\" (2018\u2013present) began as web novels on Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d before being adapted into other mediums. \"Yuri\" stories by openly lesbian creators also became more prominent, such as \"My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness\". The genre of comic essays\u2014stories that focus on the author's life experiences\u2014have also become popular, including the aforementioned \"My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness\" and Hiranishi Mieri's \"The Moment I Realized I Wasn't Straight.\"\nConcepts and themes.\nIntimacy between women.\n\"Yuri\" as a genre depicts intimate relationships between women, a scope that is broadly defined to include romantic love, intense friendships, spiritual love, and rivalry. While lesbianism is a theme commonly associated with \"yuri\", not all characters in \"yuri\" media are necessarily non-heterosexual; Welker states that the question whether \"yuri\" characters are lesbians is a \"very complicated issue.\" Characters in \"yuri\" works frequently do not define their sexual orientation in explicit terms, and the matter is instead left to reader interpretation.\nRica Takashima notes Western and Japanese fans often have differing expectations for the level of intimacy depicted in \"yuri\", which she ascribes to cultural differences between the groups. She notes that \"yuri\" works that enjoy international popularity tend to be explicit and focused on \"cute girls making out with each other,\" while Japanese fans \"have a propensity for reading between the lines, picking up on subtle cues, and using their own imaginations to weave rich tapestries of meaning from small threads.\"\nLack of genre and demographic exclusivity.\nThough \"yuri\" has been historically and thematically linked to \"sh\u014djo\" manga since its emergence in the 1970s, \"yuri\" works have been published in all demographic groups for manga, not only \"sh\u014djo\" (girls), but also \"josei\" (adult women), \"sh\u014dnen\" (boys) and \"seinen\" (adult men). \"Sh\u014djo\" \"yuri\" works tend to focus on fanciful and fairy tale-inspired narratives that idolize Takarazuka Revue-inspired \"girl prince\" characters, while \"yuri\" works in the \"josei\" demographic tend to depict same-sex female couples with a greater degree of realism. Conversely, \"sh\u014dnen\" and \"seinen\" manga tend to use \"yuri\" to depict relationships between \"innocent schoolgirls\" and \"predatory lesbians\". Manga magazines dedicated exclusively to \"yuri\" tend not to conform to any one specific demographic, and are thus inclusive of content ranging from schoolgirl romances to sexually explicit content.\nOften, works that are perceived and categorized as \"yuri\" in Japan are not regarded as such by international audiences. For example, while in the West \"Sailor Moon\" is regarded as a magical girl series with some \"yuri\" elements, in Japan the series is regarded by \"yuri\" magazines as a \"monumental work\" of the genre. The \"Sailor Moon\" example further illustrates how fans, rather than publishers or creators, often determine whether a work is \"yuri\"; \"Sailor Moon\" was not conceived as a \"yuri\" manga or anime, but \"became a \"yuri\" text\" based on how the work was interpreted and consumed by \"yuri\" fans.\nNominal sexual content.\n\"Yuri\" works generally do not depict graphic sex scenes. Unlike boys' love and, where explicit depictions of sexual acts are commonplace and stories typically climax with the central couple engaging in anal intercourse, sexual acts in \"yuri\" are rarely more explicit than kissing and the caressing of breasts. Kazumi Nagaike of Oita University argues that this general avoidance of sex \"does not mean that female sexual desire is effaced\" in \"yuri\", but rather that the absence of sex \"clearly derives from the importance which is placed on the spiritual female\u2013female bond.\"\n\"Crimson Rose and Candy Girl\".\nThe majority of \"yuri\" stories published in the 1970s and 1980s were tragedies, focused on doomed relationships that end in separation or death (see above). Yukari Fujimoto, a manga scholar at Meiji University, notes that the tragic plot of \"Shiroi Heya no Futari\" became a common \"yuri\" story archetype that she dubs \"Crimson Rose and Candy Girl\". These stories depict \"Candy\", a physically smaller character with lighter hair and a naive personality, who admires \"Rose\", a generally taller character with long dark hair and a serious demeanor. The characters bond over a common unhappiness, usually originating from their respective home lives. The attachment between Candy and Rose becomes the subject of rumors or even blackmail while Candy and Rose grow to acknowledge that their relationship has become romantic. The story concludes with Rose dying in order to protect Candy from scandal. While tragic story formulas in \"yuri\" declined in popularity by the 1990s, the Rose and Candy archetypes continue to influence contemporary \"yuri\" stories, particularly those that depict \"senpai\" and \"k\u014dhai\" relationships such as \"Bloom Into You\".\n\"Tachi\" and \"neko\".\nIn Japanese lesbian culture, the participants in a lesbian relationship are occasionally referred to as , which designates the active participant, and , which designates the submissive participant. This distinction is comparable to that of the \"seme\" and \"uke\" distinction in BL, or to the butch and femme distinction in general lesbian culture. Characters in contemporary \"yuri\" rarely conform to these dichotomies, though the dynamic of an active partner and a passive partner that the \"tachi\" and \"neko\" distinction represents does recur in the genre.\nMedia.\nIn Japan.\nIn the mid-1990s and early 2000s, some Japanese lesbian lifestyle magazines contained manga sections, including the now-defunct magazines \"Anise\" (1996\u20131997, 2001\u20132003) and \"Phryn\u00e9\" (1995). \"Carmilla\", an erotic lesbian publication, released an anthology of lesbian manga called \"Girl's Only\". Additionally, \"Mist\" (1996\u20131999), a ladies' comic manga magazine, contained sexually explicit lesbian-themed manga as part of a section dedicated to lesbian-interest topics.\nThe first publication marketed exclusively as \"yuri\" was Sun Magazine's manga anthology magazine \"Yuri Shimai\", which was released between June 2003 and November 2004 in quarterly installments, ending with only five issues. After the magazine's discontinuation, \"Comic Yuri Hime\" was launched by Ichijinsha in July 2005 as a revival of the magazine, containing manga by many of the authors who had had work serialized in \"Yuri Shimai\". Like its predecessor, \"Comic Yuri Hime\" was also published quarterly but went on to release bi-monthly on odd months from January 2011 to December 2016, after which it became monthly. A sister magazine to \"Comic Yuri Hime\", named \"Comic Yuri Hime S\", was launched as a quarterly publication by Ichijinsha in June 2007. Unlike either \"Yuri Shimai\" or \"Comic Yuri Hime\", \"Comic Yuri Hime S\" was targeted towards a male audience. However, in 2010 it was merged with \"Comic Yuri Hime\". Ichijinsha published light novel adaptations from \"Comic Yuri Hime\" works and original \"yuri\" novels under their \"sh\u014djo\" light novel line \"Ichijinsha Bunko Iris\" starting in July 2008.\nOnce \"Comic Yuri Hime\" helped establish the market, several other \"yuri\" anthologies were released, such as \"Yuri Koi Girls Love Story\", \"Mebae\", \"Yuri Drill\", \"Yuri + Kanojo\", and \"Eclair\". Houbunsha and Shinshokan also published their own \"yuri\" magazines, \"Tsubomi\" and \"Hirari\" respectively, with \"Tsubomi\" running from February 2009 to December 2012 for a total of 21 issues, and \"Hirari\" running from April 2010 to July 2014 for a total of 14 issues. After a successful crowdfunding campaign, the creator-owned \"yuri\" anthology magazine \"Galette\" was launched in 2017.\nOutside of Japan.\nThe first company to release lesbian-themed manga in North America was Yuricon's publishing arm ALC Publishing. Their works include Rica Takashima's \"Rica 'tte Kanji!?\" (1995\u20131996) and their annual \"yuri\" manga anthology \"Yuri Monogatari\", both of which were published in 2003. The latter collects stories by American, European, and Japanese creators, including Akiko Morishima, Althea Keaton, Kristina Kolhi, Tomomi Nakasora, and Eriko Tadeno. These works range from fantasy stories to more realistic tales dealing with themes such as coming out and sexual orientation.\nBesides ALC Publishing, the Los Angeles-based Seven Seas Entertainment has also incurred in the genre, with the English version of well-known titles such as \"\" (2004\u20132007) and \"Strawberry Panic!\" (2003\u20132007). On October 24, 2006, Seven Seas announced the launch of their specialized \"yuri\" manga line, which includes titles such as \"Strawberry Panic!\", \"The Last Uniform\" (2004\u20132006), and \"Comic Yuri Hime\"'s compilations such as \"Voiceful\" (2004\u20132006) and \"First Love Sisters\" (2003\u20132008). Between 2011 and 2013, the now-defunct JManga released several \"yuri\" titles to its digital subscription platform, before terminating service on March 13, 2013. As of 2017, Viz Media and Yen Press began publishing \"yuri\" manga, with Tokyopop following in 2018. Kodansha Comics announced its debut into publishing both \"yuri\" and BL manga in 2019, as well as Digital Manga launching a new imprint specializing in \"yuri\" \"d\u014djin\" manga.\nAs \"yuri\" gained further recognition outside Japan, some artists began creating original English-language manga that were labeled as \"yuri\" or having \"yuri\" elements and subplots. Early examples of original English-language \"yuri\" comics include \"Steady Beat\" (2003) by Rivkah LaFille and \"12 Days\" (2006) by June Kim, which were published between 2005 and 2006. Additionally, more English-developed visual novels and indie games have marketed themselves as \"yuri\" games. Some of these games include \"Highway Blossoms\" (2016) and \"Heart of the Woods\" (2019), both developed by Studio \u00c9lan. This has been aided by the \"Yuri Game Jam\", a game jam established in 2015 that takes place annually.\nBy the mid-2010s, \"yuri\" video games also began to be officially translated into English. In 2015, MangaGamer announced they would be releasing \"A Kiss for the Petals\", the first license of a \"yuri\" game to have an English translation. MangaGamer went on to publish \"Kindred Spirits on the Roof\" in 2016, which was one of the first adult visual novels to be released uncensored on the Steam store.\nAnalysis.\nDemography.\nWhile \"yuri\" originated in female-targeted (\"sh\u014djo\", \"josei\") works, the genre has evolved over time to also target a male audience. Various studies have been undertaken to examine the demography of \"yuri\" fandom.\nPublisher studies.\nThe first magazine to study the demographics of its readers was \"Yuri Shimai\" (2003\u20132004), who estimated the proportion of women at almost 70%, and that the majority of them were either teenagers or women in their thirties who were already interested in \"sh\u014djo\" and BL manga. In 2008, Ichijinsha made a demographic study for its two magazines \"Comic Yuri Hime\" and \"Comic Yuri Hime S\", the first being targeted to women, the second to men. The study revealed that women accounted for 73% of \"Comic Yuri Hime\" readership, while in \"Comic Yuri Hime S\", men accounted for 62%. The publisher noted, however, that readers of the latter magazine also tended to read the first, which led to their merger in 2010. Regarding the age of women for \"Comic Yuri Hime\", 27% were under 20 years old, 27% were 20\u201324 years old, 23% were 25\u201329 years old, and 23% over 30 years old. As of 2017, the ratio of men to women is said to have shifted to about 6:4, thanks in part to the \"Comic Yuri Hime S\" merge and the mostly male readership \"YuruYuri\" brought with it.\nAcademic studies.\nVerena Maser conducted a study of Japanese \"yuri\" fandom demographics between September and October 2011. This study, mainly oriented towards the \"Yuri Komyu!\" community and the social network Mixi, received a total of 1,352 valid responses. The study found that 52.4% of respondents were women, 46.1% were men and 1.6% did not identify with either gender. The sexuality of the participants was also requested, separated into two categories: \"heterosexual\" and \"non-heterosexual\". The results were as follows: 39.5% were heterosexual men, 30% were non-heterosexual women, 15.2% were heterosexual women, 4.7% were non-heterosexual men, and 1.2% identified as \"other\". Regarding age, 69% of respondents were 16\u201325 years old. Maser's study reinforced the notion of the \"yuri\" fandom being split somewhat equally between men and women, as well as highlighting the differing sexualities within it.\nDiscussion over connection between \"yuri\" and lesbianism.\nSemantic connections.\nThe relationship between \"yuri\" and lesbianism is tenuous in Japan. While \"yuri\" was strongly associated with lesbianism in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, the correlation between the terms has weakened over time. Though Japanese fans, journalists, and publishers recognize that \"yuri\" and lesbianism share common characteristics, they can specifically segregate the terms as concepts, with \"Comic Yurihime\" editor Seitar\u014d Nakamura stating that \"in general, [\"yuri\" is] not [about] lesbians [\"rezubian\"] with a carnal relationship.\" Japanese lesbian and queer magazines in the 1990s often opposed the conflation of \"yuri\" with lesbianism, likely due to its prior connotation with male-oriented pornography.\nErin Subramian of Yuricon explains that most Japanese people see the term \"lesbian\" as describing either \"abnormal people in pornography or strange people in other countries.\" Maser concurs that \"yuri\" is a genre primarily focused on ideals of beauty, purity, innocence, and spirituality before sexual identity; focus is placed on \"connection between hearts\" rather than \"connection between bodies.\" Nagaike notes in her analysis of letters published in \"Comic Yuri Hime\" that many female readers of the magazine identify as heterosexual; she thus argues \"yuri\" is more closely aligned with homosociality than it is with homosexuality, even if the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. Maser analyzes contradictory sources and concludes that the \"line between \"yuri\" and 'lesbian'/'homosexuality' is\u2026blurry\". She notes that in her sources, \"the term \"rezubian\" [lesbian] is used in many instances, but that it is almost never made clear what exactly it is referring to\".\nSociopolitical interpretations.\nNagaike argues that \"yuri\" is a byproduct of the , which formed in pre-war all-girls schools in Japan. Isolated from the influence of patriarchy, adolescent girls created a \"\"sh\u014djo\" culture\" that used Class S literature to disseminate and share homosocial cultural codes. Though this culture was significant in informing girls' attitudes about femininity and independence, it was ultimately ephemeral; upon leaving the single-sex school environment, girls became subject to patriarchal expectations of marriage and family.\nAs mixed-sex education became more common in the post-war era and Class S literature declined as a means to disseminate homosocial bonds, cross-dressing and BL emerged as the primary modes in literature for women to criticize and resist patriarchy. The emergence of \"yuri\" allowed for a return to Class S-style homosociality, of which homosexuality is a component. Thus, Nagaike asserts that \"yuri\" does not conform to the political vision of lesbianism espoused by philosophers like Monique Wittig that sees lesbianism as overthrowing \"the political and sociological interpretation of women's identity\"; rather, \"yuri\" is closer to Adrienne Rich's vision of a \"lesbian continuum\" that seeks to overthrow compulsory heterosexuality."}

Such an injury is invariably fatal to humans and all vertebrate animals, since it deprives the brain of oxygenated blood by way of severing the jugular vein and common carotid artery, while all other organs are deprived of the involuntary functions that are needed for the body to function.\nThe term beheading refers to the act of deliberately decapitating a person, either as a means of murder or as an execution; it may be performed with an axe, sword, or knife, or by mechanical means such as a guillotine. An executioner who carries out executions by beheading is sometimes called a headsman. Accidental decapitation can be the result of an explosion, a car or industrial accident, improperly administered execution by hanging or other violent injury. The national laws of Saudi Arabia and Yemen permit beheading. Under Sharia, which exclusively applies to Muslims, beheading is also a legal punishment in Zamfara State, Nigeria. In practice, Saudi Arabia is the only country that continues to behead its offenders regularly as a punishment for capital crimes. Cases of decapitation by suicidal hanging, suicide by train decapitation and by guillotine are known.\nLess commonly, decapitation can also refer to the removal of the head from a body that is already dead. This might be done to take the head as a trophy, as a secondary stage of an execution by hanging, for public display, to make the deceased more difficult to identify, for cryonics, or for other, more esoteric reasons.\nEtymology.\nThe word decapitation has its roots in the Late Latin word . The meaning of the word can be discerned from its morphemes (down, from) + (head). The past participle of is which was used to create , the noun form of , in Medieval Latin, whence the French word was produced.\nHistory.\nHumans have practiced capital punishment by beheading for millennia. The Narmer Palette (c. 3000 BCE) shows the first known depiction of decapitated corpses. The terms \"capital offence\", \"capital crime\", \"capital punishment\", derive from the Latin , \"head\", referring to the punishment for serious offences involving the forfeiture of the head; i.e. death by beheading.\nSome cultures, such as ancient Rome and Greece, regarded decapitation as the most honorable form of death. In the Middle Ages, many European nations continued to reserve the method only for nobles and royalty. In France, the French Revolution made it the only legal method of execution for all criminals regardless of class, one of the period's many symbolic changes.\nOthers have regarded beheading as dishonorable and contemptuous, such as the Japanese troops who beheaded prisoners during World War II. In recent times, it has become associated with terrorism.\nIf a headsman's axe or sword is sharp and his aim is precise, decapitation is quick and thought to be a relatively painless form of death. If the instrument is blunt or the executioner is clumsy, repeated strokes might be required to sever the head, resulting in a prolonged and more painful death. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and Mary, Queen of Scots required three strikes at their respective executions. The same could be said for the execution of Johann Friedrich Struensee, favorite of the Danish queen Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, is said to have required up to 10 strokes before decapitation was achieved. This particular story may, however, be apocryphal, as highly divergent accounts exist. Historian and philosopher David Hume, for example, relates the following about her death:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She refused to lay her head on the block, or submit to a sentence where she had received no trial. She told the executioner, that if he would have her head, he must win it the best way he could: and thus, shaking her venerable grey locks, she ran about the scaffold; and the executioner followed her with his axe, aiming many fruitless blows at her neck before he was able to give the fatal stroke.\nTo ensure that the blow would be fatal, executioners' swords usually were blade-heavy two-handed swords. Likewise, if an axe was used, it almost invariably was wielded with both hands.\nPhysiological aspects.\nPhysiology of death by decapitation.\nDecapitation is quickly fatal to humans and most animals. Unconsciousness occurs within seconds without circulating oxygenated blood (brain ischemia). Cell death and irreversible brain damage occur after 3\u20136 minutes with no oxygen, due to excitotoxicity. Some anecdotes suggest more extended persistence of human consciousness after decapitation, but most doctors consider this unlikely and consider such accounts to be misapprehensions of reflexive twitching rather than deliberate movement, since deprivation of oxygen must cause nearly immediate coma and death (\"[Consciousness is] probably lost within 2\u20133 seconds, due to a rapid fall of intracranial perfusion of blood\").\nA laboratory study testing for humane methods of euthanasia in awake animals used EEG monitoring to measure the time duration following decapitation for rats to become fully unconscious, unable to perceive distress and pain. It was estimated that this point was reached within 3\u20134 seconds, correlating closely with results found in other studies on rodents (2.7 seconds, and 3\u20136 seconds). The same study also suggested that the massive wave which can be recorded by EEG monitoring approximately one minute after decapitation ultimately reflects brain death. Other studies indicate that electrical activity in the brain has been demonstrated to persist for 13 to 14 seconds following decapitation (although it is disputed as to whether such activity implies that pain is perceived), and a 2010 study reported that decapitation of rats generated responses in EEG indices over a period of 10 seconds that have been linked to nociception across a number of different species of animals, including rats.\nSome animals (such as cockroaches) can survive decapitation and die not because of the loss of the head directly, but rather because of starvation. A number of other animals, including snakes, and turtles, have also been known to survive for some time after being decapitated, as they have slower metabolisms and their nervous systems can continue to function at some capacity for a limited time even after connection to the brain is lost, responding to any nearby stimulus. In addition, the bodies of chickens and turtles may continue to move temporarily after decapitation.\nAlthough head transplantation by the reattachment of blood vessels has seen some very limited success in animals, a fully functional reattachment of a severed human head (including repair of the spinal cord, muscles, and other critically important tissues) has not yet been achieved.\nTechnology.\nGuillotine.\nEarly versions of the guillotine included the Halifax Gibbet, which was used in Halifax, England, from 1286 until the 17th century, and the \"Maiden\", employed in Edinburgh from the 16th through the 18th centuries.\nThe modern form of the guillotine was invented shortly before the French Revolution with the aim of creating a quick and painless method of execution requiring little skill on the part of the operator. Decapitation by guillotine became a common mechanically assisted form of execution.\nThe French observed a strict code of etiquette surrounding such executions. For example, a man named Legros, one of the assistants at the execution of Charlotte Corday, was imprisoned for three months and dismissed for slapping the face of the victim after the blade had fallen in order to see whether any flicker of life remained. The guillotine was used in France during the French Revolution and remained the normal judicial method in both peacetime and wartime into the 1970s, although the firing squad was used in certain cases. France abolished the death penalty in 1981.\nThe guillotine was also used in Algeria before the French relinquished control of it, as shown in Gillo Pontecorvo's film \"The Battle of Algiers\".\nMany German states had used a guillotine-like device known as a (\"falling axe\") since the 17th and 18th centuries, and decapitation by guillotine was the usual means of execution in Germany until the abolition of the death penalty in West Germany in 1949. It was last used in communist East Germany in 1966.\nIn Nazi Germany, the was reserved for common criminals and people convicted of political crimes, including treason. Members of the White Rose resistance movement, a group of students in Munich that included siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl, were executed by decapitation.\nContrary to popular myth, executions were generally not conducted face-up, and chief executioner Johann Reichhart was insistent on maintaining \"professional\" protocol throughout the era, having administered the death penalty during the earlier Weimar Republic. Nonetheless, it is estimated that some 16,500 persons were guillotined in Germany and Austria between 1933 and 1945, a number that includes resistance fighters both within Germany itself and in countries occupied by Nazi forces. As these resistance fighters were not part of any regular army, they were considered common criminals and were in many cases transported to Germany for execution. Decapitation was considered a \"dishonorable\" death, in contrast to execution by firing squad.\nHistorical practices by nation.\nAfrica.\nCongo.\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, the conflict and ethnic massacre between local army and Kamuina Nsapu rebels has caused several deaths and atrocities such as rape and mutilation. One of them is decapitation, both a fearsome way to intimidate victims as well as an act that may include ritualistic elements. According to a UN report from Congolese refugees, they believed the Bana Mura and Kamuina Nsapu militias have \"magical powers\" as a result of drinking the blood of decapitated victims, making them invincible.\nBesides the massive decapitations (like the beheading of 40 members of the State Police), a globally notorious case happened in March 2017 to Swedish politician Zaida Catal\u00e1n and American UN expert Michael Sharp, who were kidnapped and executed during a mission near the village of Ngombe in Kasa\u00ef Province. The UN was reportedly horrified when video footage of the executions surfaced in April that same year, where some grisly details led to assume ritual components of the beheading: the perpetrators first cut the hair of both victims, and then one of them beheaded Catal\u00e1n only, because it would \"increase his power\", which may be linked to the fact that Congolese militias are particularly brutal in their acts of violence toward women and children.\nIn the trial that followed investigations after the bodies were discovered, and according to a testimony of a primary school teacher from Bunkonde, near the village of Moyo Musuila where the executions took place, he witnessed a teenage militant carrying the young woman's head, but despite the efforts of the investigation, the head was never found. According to a report published on 29 May 2019, the Monusco peacekeeping military mission led by Colonel Luis Mangini, in the search for the missing remains, arrived to a ritual place in Moyo Musila where \"parts of bodies, hands and heads\" were cut and used for rituals, where they lost track of the victim's head.\nAsia.\nAzerbaijan.\nDuring the 2016 Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani clashes, Yazidi-Armenian serviceman Kyaram Sloyan was decapitated by Azerbaijani servicemen.\nSeveral reports of decapitation, along with other types of mutilation of Armenian POWs by Azerbaijani soldiers, emerged in 2020 during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.\nChina.\nIn traditional China, decapitation was considered a more severe form of punishment than strangulation, although strangulation caused more prolonged suffering. This was because in Confucian tradition, a person's body was a gift from their parents, and so it was therefore disrespectful to their ancestors to return their bodies to the grave dismembered. The Chinese, however, had other punishments, such as dismembering the body into multiple pieces (similar to the English quartering). In addition, there was also a practice of cutting the body at the waist, which was a common method of execution before being abolished in the early Qing dynasty due to the lingering death it caused. In some tales, people did not die immediately after decapitation.\nIndia.\nThe British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathans in British India during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead enemy soldiers who were captured, such as British and Sikh soldiers.\nThe Execution of Sambhaji was a significant event in 17th-century Deccan India, where the second Maratha King was put to death by order of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The conflicts between the Mughals and the Deccan Sultanates, which resulted in the downfall of the Sultanates, paved the way for tensions between the Marathas and the Mughals. Aurangzeb was drawn to Southern India due to the vanquished rebel Akbar fleeing to the Maratha monarch, Sambhaji. The Maratha King was then captured by the Mughal general Muqarrab Khan. Sambhaji and his minister Kavi Kalash were then taken to Tulapur, where they were tortured to death.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, decapitation was a common punishment, sometimes for minor offences. Samurai were often allowed to decapitate soldiers who had fled from battle, as it was considered cowardly. Decapitation was historically performed as the second step in seppuku (ritual suicide by disembowelment). After the victim had sliced his own abdomen open, another warrior would strike his head off from behind with a katana to hasten death and to reduce the suffering. The blow was expected to be precise enough to leave intact a small strip of skin at the front of the neck\u2014to spare invited and honored guests the indelicacy of witnessing a severed head rolling about, or towards them; such an occurrence would have been considered inelegant and in bad taste. The sword was expected to be used upon the slightest sign that the practitioner might yield to pain and cry out\u2014avoiding dishonor to him and to all partaking in the privilege of observing an honorable demise. As skill was involved, only the most trusted warrior was honored by taking part. In the late Sengoku period, decapitation was performed as soon as the person chosen to carry out seppuku had made the slightest wound to his abdomen.\nDecapitation (without seppuku) was also considered a very severe and degrading form of punishment. One of the most brutal decapitations was that of Sugitani Zenjub\u014d (\u6749\u8c37\u5584\u4f4f\u574a), who attempted to assassinate Oda Nobunaga, a prominent \"daimy\u014d\", in 1570. After being caught, Zenjub\u014d was buried alive in the ground with only his head out, and the head was slowly sawn off with a bamboo saw by passers-by for several days (punishment by sawing; nokogiribiki (). These unusual punishments were abolished in the early Meiji era. A similar scene is described in the last page of James Clavell's book \"Sh\u014dgun\".\nKorea.\nHistorically, decapitation had been the most common method of execution in Korea, until it was replaced by hanging in 1896. Professional executioners were called (\ub9dd\ub098\ub2c8) and they were volunteered from death rows.\nThailand.\nDecapitation was the main method of execution in Thailand, until it was replaced by shooting in 1934.\nVietnam.\nExecution by beheading was one of the most common forms of execution in Vietnam under the feudal system. This form of execution still existed in the South Vietnam regime until 1962.\nEurope.\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nDuring the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992\u20131995) there were a number of ritual beheadings of Serbs and Croats who were taken as prisoners of war by mujahideen members of the Bosnian Army. At least one case is documented and proven in court by the ICTY where mujahedin, members of 3rd Corps of Army BiH, beheaded Bosnian Serb Dragan Popovi\u0107.\nBritain.\nIn British history, beheading was typically used for noblemen, while commoners would be hanged; eventually, hanging was adopted as the standard means of non-military executions. The last actual execution by beheading was of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat on 9 April 1747, while a number of convicts were beheaded posthumously up to the early 19th century. (Typically traitors were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, a method which had already been discontinued.) Beheading was degraded to a secondary means of execution, including for treason, with the abolition of drawing and quartering in 1870 and finally abolished by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973. One of the most notable executions by decapitation in Britain was that of King Charles I of England, who was beheaded outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall in 1649, after being captured by parliamentarians during the English Civil War and tried for treason.\nIn England, a bearded axe was used for beheading, with the blade's edge extending downwards from the tip of the shaft.\nCelts.\nThe Celts of western Europe long pursued a \"cult of the severed head\", as evidenced by both Classical literary descriptions and archaeological contexts. This cult played a central role in their temples and religious practices and earned them a reputation as head hunters among the Mediterranean peoples. Diodorus Siculus, in his 1st-century \"Historical Library\" (5.29.4) wrote the following about Celtic head-hunting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting. They embalm in cedar oil the heads of the most distinguished enemies, and preserve them carefully in a chest, and display them with pride to strangers, saying that for this head one of their ancestors, or his father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a large sum of money. They say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold.\nBoth the Greeks and Romans found the Celtic decapitation practices shocking and the latter put an end to them when Celtic regions came under their control.\nAccording to Paul Jacobsthal, \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\" Arguments for a Celtic cult of the severed head include the many sculptured representations of severed heads in La T\u00e8ne carvings, and the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who carry their own severed heads, right down to \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off in a beheading game, just as Saint Denis carried his head to the top of Montmartre.\nA further example of this regeneration after beheading lies in the tales of Connemara's Saint F\u00e9ch\u00edn, who after being beheaded by Vikings carried his head to the Holy Well on Omey Island and on dipping it into the well placed it back upon his neck and was restored to full health.\nClassical antiquity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Pothinus matched Mark Antony in crime:They slew the noblest Romans of their time.The helpless victims they decapitated,An act of infamy with shame related.One head was Pompey's, who brought triumphs home,The other Cicero's, the voice of Rome.\n \u2014 Martial, \"Epigram\" I:60 (Trans. by Garry Wills)\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans regarded decapitation as a comparatively honorable form of execution for criminals. The traditional procedure, however, included first being tied to a stake and whipped with rods. Axes were used by the Romans, and later swords, which were considered a more honorable instrument of death. Those who could verify that they were Roman citizens were to be beheaded, rather than undergoing crucifixion. In the Roman Republic of the early 1st century BC, it became the tradition for the severed heads of public enemies\u2014such as the political opponents of Marius and Sulla\u2014to be publicly displayed on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum after execution. Perhaps the most famous beheading was that of Cicero who, on instructions from Mark Antony, had his hands (which had penned the \"Philippicae\" against Antony) and his head cut off and nailed up for display in this manner.\nArchaeological evidence of Roman-period executions by decapitation has also been found in the provinces. In Israel, seven cases of decapitation have been discovered, all dating to the Roman period and involving Jewish individuals. An additional case, uncovered in Jerusalem, appears to date from the early 1st century BCE and may be linked to the Judean Civil War during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus.\nFrance.\nIn France, until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981, the main method of execution had been by beheading by means of the guillotine. Other than a small number of military cases in which a firing squad was used (including that of Jean Bastien-Thiry), the guillotine was the only legal method of execution from 1791, when it was introduced by the Legislative Assembly during the last days of the kingdom French Revolution, until 1981. Before the revolution, beheading had typically been reserved for noblemen and carried out manually. In 1981, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand abolished capital punishment and issued commutations for those whose sentences had not been carried out.\nThe first person executed by the guillotine in France was highwayman Nicolas Jacques Pelletier in April 1792. The last execution was of murderer Hamida Djandoubi, in Marseille, in 1977. Throughout its extensive overseas colonies and dependencies, the device was also used, including on St Pierre in 1889 and on Martinique as late as 1965.\nNordic countries.\nIn Nordic countries, decapitation was the usual means of carrying out capital punishment. Noblemen were beheaded with a sword, and commoners with an axe. The last executions by decapitation in Finland in 1825, Norway in 1876, Faroe Islands in 1609, and in Iceland in 1830 were carried out with axes. The same was the case in Denmark in 1892. Sweden continued the practice for a few decades, executing its second to last criminal\u2014mass murderer Johan Filip Nordlund\u2014by axe in 1900. It was replaced by the guillotine, which was used for the first and only time on Johan Alfred Ander in 1910.\nFinland's official beheading axe resides today at the Museum of Crime in Vantaa. It is a broad-bladed two-handed axe. It was last used when murderer Tahvo Putkonen was executed in 1825, the last execution in peacetime in Finland.\nSpain.\nIn Spain executions were carried out by various methods including strangulation by the garrotte. In the 16th and 17th centuries, noblemen were sometimes executed by means of beheading. Examples include Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem, Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn. They were tied to a chair on a scaffold. The executioner used a knife to cut the head from the body. It was considered to be a more honourable death if the executioner started with cutting the throat.\nMiddle East.\nIran.\nIran, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has alleged it uses beheading as one of the methods of punishment.\nIraq.\nThough not officially sanctioned, legal beheadings were carried out against at least 50 prostitutes and pimps under Saddam Hussein as late as 2000.\nBeheadings have emerged as another terror tactic especially in Iraq since 2003. Civilians have borne the brunt of the beheadings, although U.S. and Iraqi military personnel have also been targeted. After kidnapping the victim, the kidnappers typically make some sort of demand of the government of the hostage's nation and give a time limit for the demand to be carried out, often 72 hours. Beheading is often threatened if the government fails to heed the wishes of the hostage takers. Sometimes, the beheadings are videotaped and made available on the Internet. One of the most publicized of such executions was that of Nick Berg.\nJudicial execution is practiced in Iraq, but is generally carried out by hanging.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on Shari'ah law reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Crimes such as rape, murder, apostasy, and sorcery are punishable by beheading. It is usually carried out publicly by beheading with a sword.\nA public beheading will typically take place around 9am. The convicted person is walked into the square and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword to remove the condemned person's head from their body at the neck with a single strike. After the convicted person is pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded alleged criminal and the process is complete. The official might announce the same before the actual execution. This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia.\nAccording to Amnesty International, at least 79 people were executed in Saudi Arabia in 2013. Foreigners are not exempt, accounting for \"almost half\" of executions in 2013.\nIn 2015 Ashraf Fayadh (born 1980), a Saudi Arabian poet, was sentenced to be beheaded, but his sentence was later reduced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes, for apostasy.\nSyria.\nThe Syrian government employs hanging as its method of capital punishment. However, the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State, which controlled territory in much of eastern Syria, had regularly carried out beheadings of people. Syrian rebels attempting to overthrow the Syrian government have been implicated in beheadings too.\nNorth America.\nMexico.\nMiguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Ignacio Allende, Jos\u00e9 Mariano Jim\u00e9nez and Juan Aldama were tried for treason, executed by firing squad and beheaded during the Mexican independence in 1811. Their heads were on display on the four corners of the Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas, in Guanajuato.\nDuring the Mexican drug war, some Mexican drug cartels turned to decapitation and beheading of rival cartel members as a method of intimidation.\nThis trend of beheading and publicly displaying the decapitated bodies was started by the Los Zetas, a criminal group composed by former Mexican special forces operators, trained in the infamous \"US Army School of the Americas\", in torture techniques and psychological warfare.\nUnited States.\nThe United States government has never employed beheading as a legal method of execution. However, beheading has sometimes been used in mutilations of the dead, particularly during the time of slavery, such as Nat Turner, who led a rebellion against slavery. When caught, he was publicly hanged, flayed, and beheaded. This was a technique used by many enslavers to discourage the \"frequent bloody uprisings\" that were carried out by \"kidnapped Africans\". While bodily dismemberment of various kinds was employed to instill terror, Dr. Erasmus D. Fenner noted postmortem decapitation was particularly effective.\nDuring the Vietnam War, as a terror tactic, \"some American troops hacked the heads off... dead [Vietnamese] and mounted them on pikes or poles\". Correspondent Michael Herr noted \"thousands\" of photo-albums made by US soldiers \"all seemed to contain the same pictures\": \"the severed head shot, the head often resting on the chest of the dead man or being held up by a smiling Marine, or a lot of the heads, arranged in a row, with a burning cigarette in each of the mouths, the eyes open\". Some of the victims were \"very young\".\nGeneral George Patton IV, son of the famous WWII general George S. Patton, was known for keeping \"macabre souvenirs\", such as \"a Vietnamese skull that sat on his desk.\" Other Americans \"hacked the heads off Vietnamese to keep, trade, or exchange for prizes offered by commanders.\"\nAlthough the Utah Territory permitted a person sentenced to death to choose beheading as a means of execution, no person chose that option, and it was dropped when Utah became a state.\nIn July 2025, Florida enacted legislation that further expands the state's already extensive capital punishment laws to allow \"any execution method not explicitly deemed unconstitutional,\" which includes beheading. This makes the United States the only country outside of the Islamic world that currently allows executions via beheading.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It replaced the Commonwealth of England, established in January 1649 after the execution of Charles\u00a0I, with his son Charles\u00a0II. The Commonwealth of England had been governed by Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and then his son Richard Cromwell.\nThe term is also used to describe the reign of Charles\u00a0II (1660\u20131685), and sometimes that of his younger brother James\u00a0II (1685\u20131688).\nThe Protectorate.\nAfter Richard Cromwell, Lord Protector from 1658 to 1659, ceded power to the Rump Parliament, Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert then dominated government for a year. On 20 October 1659, George Monck, the governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland to oppose Fleetwood and Lambert. Lambert's army began to leave him, and he returned to London almost alone whilst Monck marched to London unopposed. The Presbyterian members, excluded in Pride's Purge of 1648, were recalled, and on 24 December the army restored the Long Parliament.\nFleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before Parliament to answer for his conduct. On 3 March 1660, Lambert was sent to the Tower of London, from which he escaped a month later. He tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the \"Good Old Cause\" to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill, but he was recaptured by Colonel Richard Ingoldsby, a participant in the regicide of Charles I who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime. Lambert was incarcerated and died in custody in 1684; Ingoldsby was pardoned.\nRestoration of Charles II.\nOn 4 April 1660, Charles II issued the Declaration of Breda, in which he made several promises in relation to the reclamation of the crown of England. While he did this, Monck organised the Convention Parliament, which met for the first time on 25 April. On 8 May, it proclaimed that King Charles II had been the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. Historian Timothy J. G. Harris would later argue that \"Constitutionally, it was as if the last nineteen years had never happened.\"\nCharles returned from exile, leaving The Hague on 23 May and landing at Dover on 25 May. He entered London on 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday. To celebrate his return to his Parliament, 29 May was made a public holiday, popularly known as Oak Apple Day. He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661.\nSome contemporaries described the Restoration as \"a divinely ordained miracle\". The sudden and unexpected deliverance from political chaos was interpreted as a restoration of the natural and divine order. The Cavalier Parliament convened for the first time on 8 May 1661, and it would endure for over 17 years, finally being dissolved on 24 January 1679. Like its predecessor, it was overwhelmingly Royalist. It is also known as the Pensionary Parliament for the many pensions it granted to adherents of the King.\nThe leading political figure at the beginning of the Restoration was Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. It was the \"skill and wisdom of Clarendon\" which had \"made the Restoration unconditional\".\nMany Royalist exiles returned and were rewarded. Prince Rupert of the Rhine returned to the service of England, became a member of the privy council, and was provided with an annuity. George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich, returned to be the Captain of the King's guard and received a pension. Marmaduke Langdale returned and was made \"Baron Langdale\". William Cavendish, Marquess of Newcastle, returned and was able to regain the greater part of his estates. He was invested in 1666 with the Order of the Garter (which had been bestowed upon him in 1650), and was advanced to a dukedom on 16 March 1665.\nEngland and Wales.\nCommonwealth regicides and rebels.\nThe Indemnity and Oblivion Act, which became law on 29 August 1660, pardoned all past treason against the crown, but specifically excluded those involved in the trial and execution of Charles I. Thirty-one of the 59 commissioners (judges) who had signed the death warrant in 1649 were living. The regicides were hunted down; some escaped but most were found and put on trial. Three escaped to the American colonies. New Haven, Connecticut, secretly harboured Edward Whalley, William Goffe and John Dixwell, and after American independence named streets after them to honour them as forefathers of the American Revolution.\nIn the ensuing trials, twelve were condemned to death. The Fifth Monarchist Thomas Harrison, the first person found guilty of regicide, who had been the seventeenth of the 59 commissioners to sign the death warrant, was the first regicide to be hanged, drawn and quartered because he was considered by the new government still to represent a real threat to the re-established order. In October 1660, at Charing Cross or Tyburn, London, ten were publicly hanged, drawn and quartered: Thomas Harrison, John Jones, Adrian Scrope, John Carew, Thomas Scot, and Gregory Clement, who had signed the king's death warrant; the preacher Hugh Peters; Francis Hacker and Daniel Axtell, who commanded the guards at the king's trial and execution; and John Cooke, the solicitor who directed the prosecution. The 10 judges who were on the panel but did not sign the death warrant were also convicted.\nOliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, Judge Thomas Pride, and Judge John Bradshaw were posthumously attainted for high treason. Because Parliament was (at the time) a court, a bill of attainder is a legislative act declaring a person guilty of treason or felony, in contrast to the regular judicial process of trial and conviction. In January 1661, the corpses of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw were exhumed and hanged in chains at Tyburn.\nIn 1661 John Okey, one of the regicides who signed the death warrant of Charles I, was brought back from Holland along with Miles Corbet, friend and lawyer to Cromwell, and John Barkstead, former constable of the Tower of London. They were all imprisoned in the Tower. From there they were taken to Tyburn and hanged, drawn and quartered on 19 April 1662. A further 19 regicides were imprisoned for life.\nJohn Lambert was not in London for the trial of Charles I. At the Restoration, he was found guilty of high treason and remained in custody in Guernsey for the rest of his life. Henry Vane the Younger served on the Council of State during the Interregnum even though he refused to take the oath which expressed approbation (approval) of the King's execution. At the Restoration, after much debate in Parliament, he was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. In 1662 he was tried for high treason, found guilty and beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 June 1662.\nThough regicide was widely condemned and many Regicides were executed or imprisoned after 1660, the revolutionary idea of conditional monarchy endured. In political writings and the debates of the period, the notion that a king should rule in accordance with the will of the people or law became increasingly widespread. Even Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon and Charles II\u2019s chief advisor, acknowledged the need for a balanced constitutional arrangement in his efforts to secure a lasting postwar settlement.\nRegrant of certain Commonwealth titles.\nThe Instrument of Government, The Protectorate's written constitutions, gave to the Lord Protector the King's power to grant titles of honour. Over 30 new knighthoods were granted under the Protectorate. These knighthoods passed into oblivion upon the Restoration of Charles II, but many were regranted by the restored King.\nOf the eleven Protectorate baronetcies, two had been previously granted by Charles I during the Civil War, but under Commonwealth legislation they were not recognised under the Protectorate (hence the Lord Protector's regranting of them). When that legislation passed into oblivion these two baronets were entitled to use the baronetcies granted by Charles I, and Charles II regranted four more. Only one now continues: Richard Thomas Willy, 14th baronet, is the direct successor of Griffith Williams. Of the remaining Protectorate baronets one, William Ellis, was granted a knighthood by Charles II.\nEdmund Dunch was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658, but this barony was not regranted. The male line failed in 1719 with the death of his grandson, also Edmund Dunch, so no one can lay claim to the title.\nThe one hereditary viscountcy Cromwell created for certain, (making Charles Howard Viscount Howard of Morpeth and Baron Gilsland) continues to this day. In April 1661, Howard was created Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Baron Dacre of Gillesland. The present Earl is a direct descendant of this Cromwellian creation and Restoration recreation.\nVenner rebellion (1661).\nOn 6 January 1661, about 50 Fifth Monarchists, headed by a wine-cooper named Thomas Venner, tried to gain possession of London in the name of \"King Jesus\". Most were either killed or taken prisoner; on 19 and 21 January 1661, Venner and 10 others were hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason.\nChurch of England settlement.\nThe Church of England was restored as the national Church in England, backed by the Clarendon Code and the Act of Uniformity 1662. People reportedly \"pranced around May poles as a way of taunting the Presbyterians and Independents\" and \"burned copies of the Solemn League and Covenant\".\nIreland.\n\"The commonwealth parliamentary union was, after 1660, treated as null and void\". As in England the republic was deemed constitutionally never to have occurred. The Convention Parliament was dissolved by Charles II in January 1661, and he summoned his first parliament in Ireland in May 1661. In 1662, 29 May was made a public holiday known to this day as Oak Apple Day.\nCoote, Broghill and Maurice Eustace were initially the main political figures in the Restoration. George Monck, Duke of Albemarle was given the position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland but he did not assume office. In 1662 James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond returned as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and became the predominant political figure of the Restoration period.\nScotland.\nCharles was proclaimed King again on 14 May 1660. He was not crowned, having been previously crowned at Scone in 1651. The Restoration \"presented an occasion of universal celebration and rejoicing throughout Scotland\".\nCharles II summoned his parliament on 1 January 1661, which began to undo all that been forced on his father Charles I of Scotland. The Rescissory Act 1661 made all legislation back to 1633 'void and null'.\nEnglish colonies.\nCaribbean.\nBarbados, as a haven for refugees fleeing the English republic, had held for Charles II under Lord Willoughby until defeated by George Ayscue. When news reached Barbados of the King's restoration, Thomas Modyford declared Barbados for the King in July 1660. The planters, however, were not eager for the return of the former governor Lord Willoughby, fearing disputes over titles, but the King ordered he be restored.\nJamaica had been a conquest of Oliver Cromwell's and Charles II's claim to the island was therefore questionable. However, Charles II chose not to restore Jamaica to Spain and in 1661 it became a British colony and the planters would claim that they held rights as Englishmen by the King's assumption of the dominion of Jamaica. The first governor was Lord Windsor. He was replaced in 1664 by Thomas Modyford who had been ousted from Barbados.\nNorth America.\nNew England.\nNew England, with its Puritan settlement, had supported the Commonwealth and the Protectorate. Acceptance of the Restoration was reluctant in some quarters as it highlighted the failure of Puritan reform. Rhode Island declared in October 1660 and Massachusetts lastly in August 1661. The Colony of New Haven provided refuge for Regicides such as Edward Whalley, William Goffe and John Dixwell and would be subsequently merged into Connecticut in 1662, perhaps in punishment. John Winthrop, a former governor of Connecticut, and one of whose sons had been a captain in Monck's army, went to England at the Restoration and in 1662 obtained a royal charter for Connecticut with New Haven annexed to it.\nMaryland and Virginia.\nMaryland had resisted the republic until finally occupied by New England Puritans/Parliamentary forces after the Battle of the Severn in 1655. In 1660 the Governor Josias Fendall tried to turn Maryland into a Commonwealth of its own in what is known as Fendall's Rebellion but with the fall of the republic in England he was left without support and was replaced by Philip Calvert upon the Restoration.\nVirginia was the most loyal of King Charles II's dominions. It had, according to the eighteenth-century historian Robert Beverley Jr., been \"the last of all the King's Dominions that submitted to the Usurpation\". Virginia had provided sanctuary for Cavaliers fleeing the English republic. In 1650, Virginia was one of the Royalist colonies that became the subject of Parliament's An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego. William Berkeley, who had previously been governor up until 1652, was elected governor in 1660 by the House of Burgesses and he promptly declared for the King. The Anglican Church was restored as the established church.\nCarolina.\nIn 1663 the Province of Carolina was formed as a reward given to some supporters of the Restoration. The province was named after the King's father, Charles I. The town of Charleston was established in 1669 by a party of settlers from Bermuda (some being Bermudians aboard Bermudian vessels, others having passed through Bermuda from as far as England) under the same William Sayle who had led the Eleutheran Adventurers to the Bahamas. In 1670, Sayle became the first Colonial Governor of the Province of Carolina.\nBermuda.\nThe Somers Isles, alias Bermuda (originally named \"Virgineola\"), was originally part of Virginia, and was administered by the Somers Isles Company, a spin-off of the Virginia Company, until 1684. The already existing contest between the mostly Parliamentarian Adventurers (shareholders) of the company in England and the Bermudians, who had their own House of Assembly (and many of whom were becoming landowners as they were sold the land they had previously farmed as tenants as the profitability of the tobacco farmed exclusively for the company fell), placed the Bermudians on the side of the Crown despite the large number of Puritans in the colony.\nBermudians were attempting to shift their economy from tobacco to a maritime one and were being thwarted by the company, which relied on revenue from tobacco cultivation. Bermuda was the first colony to recognise Charles II as King in 1649. It controlled its own \"army\" (of militia) and deposed the Company appointed Governor, electing a replacement. Its Independent Puritans were forced to emigrate, settling the Bahamas under prominent Bermudian settler, sometime Governor of Bermuda, and Parliamentary loyalist William Sayle as the Eleutheran Adventurers. Although eventually reaching a compromise with the Commonwealth, the Bermudians dispute with the company continued and was finally taken before the restored Crown, which was keen for an opportunity to re-assert its authority over the wealthy businessmen who controlled the Somers Isles Company.\nThe islanders' protest to the Crown initially concerned the mis-treatment of Perient Trott and his heirs (including Nicholas Trott), but expanded to include the company's wider mismanagement of the colony. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the company, and resulted in the company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684. From that point onwards the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the company's restraints, the emerging local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to seafaring.\nCulture.\nThe Restoration and Charles' coronation mark a reversal of the stringent Puritan morality, \"as though the pendulum [of England's morality] swung from repression to licence more or less overnight\". Theatres reopened after having been closed during the protectorship, Puritanism lost its momentum, and bawdy comedy became a recognisable genre. In addition, women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage as professional actresses for the first time. In Scotland, the bishops returned as the Episcopacy was reinstated.\nTo celebrate the occasion and cement their diplomatic relations, the Dutch Republic presented Charles with the Dutch Gift, a fine collection of old master paintings, classical sculptures, furniture, and a yacht.\nLiterature.\nRestoration literature includes the roughly homogenous styles of literature that centre on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of King Charles II. It is a literature that includes extremes, for it encompasses both \"Paradise Lost\" and the John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester's \"Sodom\", the high-spirited sexual comedy of \"The Country Wife\" and the moral wisdom of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". It saw Locke's \"Treatises of Government\", the founding of the Royal Society, the experiments and holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the hysterical attacks on theatres from Jeremy Collier, and the pioneering of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. The period witnessed news become a commodity, the essay develop into a periodical art form, and the beginnings of textual criticism.\nStyle.\nThe return of the king and his court from exile led to the replacement of the Puritan severity of the Cromwellian style with a taste for magnificence and opulence and to the introduction of Dutch and French artistic influences. These are evident in furniture in the use of floral marquetry, walnut instead of oak, twisted turned supports and legs, exotic veneers, cane seats and backs on chairs, sumptuous tapestry and velvet upholstery and ornate carved and gilded scrolling bases for cabinets. Similar shifts appear in prose style.\nComedy.\nComedy, especially bawdy comedy, flourished, and a favourite setting was the bed-chamber. Indeed, sexually explicit language was encouraged by the king personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian George Norman Clark argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper...The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.\nThe socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn.\nSpectacular.\nThe Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged machine play, hit the London public stage in the late 17th-century Restoration period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable scenery, baroque illusionistic painting, gorgeous costumes, and special effects such as trapdoor tricks, \"flying\" actors, and fireworks. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, \"legitimate\" Restoration drama; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.\nBasically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century court masque, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera, the spectaculars are sometimes called \"English opera\". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term \"opera\", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover Samuel Pepys.\nThe expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as John Dryden's \"Albion and Albanius\" would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\" or Dryden's \"King Arthur\" would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.\nEnd of the Restoration.\nThe Restoration was ended by the Glorious Revolution, which overthrew King James II of England, propelled by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his accession to the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter.\nIn April 1688, James reissued the \"Declaration of Indulgence\" and ordered all Anglican clergymen to read it to their congregations. When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel. On 30 June 1688, a group of seven Protestant nobles invited the Prince of Orange to come to England with an army. By September it became clear that William would invade England.\nWhen William arrived on 5 November 1688, James lost his nerve, declined to attack the invading Dutch and tried to flee to France. He was captured in Kent. Later, he was released and placed under Dutch protective guard. Having no desire to make James a martyr, William, Prince of Orange, let him escape on 23 December. James was received in France by his cousin and ally, Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a pension.\nWilliam convened a Convention Parliament to decide how to handle the situation. While the Parliament refused to depose James, they declared that James, having fled to France had effectively abdicated the throne, and that the throne was vacant. To fill this vacancy, James's daughter Mary was declared Queen; she was to rule jointly with her husband William, Prince of Orange, who would be king. The English Parliament passed the Bill of Rights 1689 that denounced James for abusing his power.\nThe abuses charged to James included the suspension of the Test Acts after having sworn as king to uphold the supremacy of the Church of England, the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for merely petitioning the crown, the establishment of a standing army, and the imposition of cruel punishments. The bill also declared that henceforth no Roman Catholic was permitted to ascend the English throne, nor could any English monarch marry a Roman Catholic.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its afternoon publication was known as the \"Chicago American\", while its evening publication was known as the Chicago Evening American.\nHistory.\nThe paper's first edition came out on July 4, 1900, as \"Hearst's Chicago American\". It became the \"Morning American\" in 1902 with the appearance of an afternoon edition. The morning and Sunday papers were renamed as the \"Examiner\" in 1904. James Keeley bought the \"Chicago Record-Herald\" and \"Chicago Inter-Ocean\" in 1914, merging them into a single newspaper known as the \"Herald\". William Randolph Hearst purchased the paper from Keeley in 1918.\n Distribution of the \"Herald Examiner\" after 1918 was controlled by gangsters. Dion O'Banion, Vincent Drucci, Hymie Weiss and Bugs Moran first sold the \"Tribune\". They were then recruited by Moses Annenberg, who offered more money to sell the \"Examiner\", later the \"Herald-Examiner\". This \"selling\" consisted of pressuring stores and news dealers. In 1939, Annenberg was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud and died in prison.\nThe newspaper joined the Associated Press on October 31, 1932.\nUnder pressure from his lenders, Hearst consolidated the \"American\" and the \"Herald-Examiner\" in 1939. It continued as the \"Chicago Herald-American\" until 1953 when it became the \"Chicago American\". The \"American\" was bought by the \"Chicago Tribune\" in 1956, and was renamed as \"Chicago's American\" in 1959.\nAs with many other afternoon daily newspapers the paper suffered in postwar years from declining circulation figures caused in part by television news and in part by population shifts from city to suburbs. The paper continued as an afternoon broadsheet until 1969 when the \"Tribune\" converted the paper to the tabloid-format \"Chicago Today\". Measures to bolster the paper were unsuccessful, and \"Chicago Today\" published its final issue on September 13, 1974. The \"Chicago Tribune\" inherited many of the \"Today\"'s writers and staff and became a 24-hour operation.\nThe \"American\" was the product of the merger or acquisition of 14 predecessor newspapers and inherited the tradition and the files of all of them.\nAs an afternoon paper, the \"American\" was dependent on street sales rather than subscriptions, and breaking news helped bring in street sales.\nWhen Frank Lloyd Wright announced plans to build a mile-high building in Chicago, the \"American\" stole the drawings and printed them.\nThe tradition was exemplified by the longtime night city editor of the \"American\", Harry \"Romy\" Romanoff, who could create news stories almost at will with only a telephone. He ran the city room at night with the help of two rewrite men (including Mike McGovern, noted below), one night photo editor, a sports desk editor (Brent Musburger's first job out of journalism school), and one night copy boy who cut and pasted AP and UPI wires for Harry's review. Since the afternoon paper was put together the previous evening, the night city editor was the key news editor. Romanoff enjoyed the fearful but absolute regard of pressmen, the composing room and the entire night staff of the Tribune Tower, which owned and housed the \"Chicago American\"'s operations in its final decades.\nOne night, floods threatened Southern Illinois, and the \"American\" did not have a big story for the front page. Romanoff called fire departments and police stations throughout the region, posing as \"Captain Parmenter of the state police\" (a nonexistent individual), urging them to take action. One fire department, bemused by the call, asked what they should do. \"Ring those fire bells! Call out the people!\" Romanoff then turned to his rewrite man to dictate the lead story:\nFire bells rang over southern Illinois as police and fire departments called out the people to warn them of impending floods.\nIt never did flood, but the \"American\" had its banner headline. These headlines were necessary for sales of the early editions. Later in the day, breaking news would generally replace them or reduce their importance. Of course, many stories developed in this way were genuine scoops that would be expanded in later editions.\nThe \"American\" gave the same attention to smaller stories as to large ones. It was usually first with police news. One notable headline:\nMother of 14 kids kills father of 9 in police station\nHeadquarters for the paper was the Hearst Building, located at 326 West Madison Street in Chicago. In 1961, the offices of \"Chicago's American\" were moved adjacent to the Tribune Tower at 435 North Michigan Avenue, where they would remain until the ultimate demise of \"Chicago Today\" in 1974.\nNotable people.\nIn addition to Romanoff, notable \"American\" staff members included:\nAlso:\nIn the end, TV news brought an end to most afternoon papers, but up until the 1970s, Chicago had a competitive journalistic scene unmatched by most other American cities, five daily newspapers and four wire services in competition, and none were more competitive than \"Chicago's American\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70807", "revid": "48467341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70807", "title": "Thunderstorm", "text": "Storm characterized by lightning\nA thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm or a lightning storm, is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and thunder. Relatively weak thunderstorms are sometimes called thundershowers. Thunderstorms occur in cumulonimbus clouds. They are usually accompanied by strong winds and often produce heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, or hail, but some thunderstorms can produce little or no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.\nThunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a front. However, some kind of cloud forcing, whether it is a front, shortwave trough, or another system is needed for the air to rapidly accelerate upward. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.\nThunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena, which can be potentially hazardous. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.\nThere are three types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, and supercell. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.\nLife cycle.\nWarm air has a lower density than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom. Clouds form when relatively warmer air, carrying moisture, rises within cooler air. The moist air rises, and, as it does so, it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air condenses. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of condensation, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder. Meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds. Generally, thunderstorms require moisture, an unstable air mass, and a lifting force in order to form.\nAll thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: the developing stage, the mature stage, and the dissipation stage. The average thunderstorm has a diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes.\nDeveloping stage.\nThe first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as \"cumulus\" clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection. This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.\nMature stage.\nIn the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called \"cumulonimbus incus\". The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating \"downdrafts\" as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.\nTypically, if there is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction, the downdraft will be separated from the updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.\nDissipating stage.\nIn the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20\u201330 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.\nClassification.\nThere are four main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell. Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere (\"wind shear\"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20\u201330 minutes.\nOrganized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, normally greater than in the lowest of the troposphere, which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation. Precipitable water values of greater than favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes. Those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than . Upstream values of CAPE of greater than 800 J/kg are usually required for the development of organized convection.\nSingle-cell.\nA single-cell thunderstorm, also known as an air-mass thunderstorm, is a single thunderstorm with one main updraft. Single-cell thunderstorms are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term \"cell\" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term \"air mass thunderstorm\". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20\u201330\u00a0minutes.\nMulti-cell clusters.\nThis is the most common type of thunderstorm development. \"Mature thunderstorms\" are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. \"Multicell storms\" form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20\u00a0minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These types of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.\nSquall line.\nA squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term was used as a synonym for cold front. The squall line contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Severe weather in the form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo, within the portion of the line that bows out the most. Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP, where mesoscale low pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos, and move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can form, which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy, which are sometimes associated with a heat burst. This kind of storm is also known as \"Wind of the Stony Lake\" (; shi2 hu2 feng1) in southern China.\nSupercells.\nSupercell storms are large, usually severe, quasi-steady-state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height (\"wind shear\"), and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts (i.e., where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft) with a strong, rotating updraft (a \"mesocyclone\"). These storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud (or anvil) can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere. Supercell storms can be wide. Research has shown that at least 90\u00a0percent of supercells cause severe weather. These storms can produce destructive tornadoes, extremely large hailstones ( diameter), straight-line winds in excess of , and flash floods. In fact, research has shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of thunderstorm. Supercells are generally the strongest type of thunderstorm.\nSevere thunderstorms.\nIn the United States, a thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least , hail is in diameter or larger, or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported. Although a funnel cloud or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm, a tornado warning is issued in place of a severe thunderstorm warning. A severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe, or will soon turn severe. In Canada, a rainfall rate greater than in one hour, or in three hours, is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms. Severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell. However, multicell, supercell, and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe weather.\nMesoscale convective systems.\nA mesoscale convective system (MCS) is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones, and normally persists for several hours or more. A mesoscale convective system's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape, and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, lake-effect snow events, polar lows, and mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs), and they generally form near weather fronts. Most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day. They tend to form when the surface temperature varies by more than between day and night. The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America, Europe, and Asia, with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours.\nForms of MCS that develop in the tropics are found in use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon troughs, generally within the warm season between spring and fall. More intense systems form over land than over water. One exception is that of lake-effect snow bands, which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water, and occurs from fall through spring. Polar lows are a second special class of MCS. They form at high latitudes during the cold season. Once the parent MCS dies, later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex (MCV). Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall.\nMotion.\nThe two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.\nBack-building thunderstorm.\nA back-building thunderstorm, commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004, and over Chennai on 1 December 2015.\nHazards.\nEach year, many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning. While severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer, they can occur at just about any time of the year.\nCloud-to-ground lightning.\nCloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting. Under a regime of low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms, where little precipitation is present, rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat. Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion. In areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning, like Florida, lightning causes several fatalities per year, most commonly to people working outside.\nAcid Rain.\nAcid rain is also a frequent risk produced by thunderstorms. Distilled water has a neutral pH of 7. \"Clean\" or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds. In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil, resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.\nHail.\nAny thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm. Thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are sometimes seen with green coloration. Hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards (known as orographic lifting), thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely. \nHail can cause serious damage, notably to automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass-roofed structures, livestock, and most commonly, farmers' crops. Hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft. When hail stones exceed in diameter, planes can be seriously damaged within seconds. The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft. \nWheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage. Hail is one of Canada's most costly hazards. \nHailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history. One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India. The largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the United States fell in 2003 in Aurora, Nebraska, United States.\nOne of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern India, which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888. China also experiences significant hailstorms. Across Europe, Croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail.\nIn North America, hail is most common in the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming meet, known as \"Hail Alley\". Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September. Cheyenne, Wyoming, is North America's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season. In South America, areas prone to hail are cities like Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\nTornadoes and waterspouts.\nA tornado is a violent, rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud (otherwise known as a thundercloud) or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds between , are approximately across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than , stretch more than across, and stay on the ground for more than 100\u00a0kilometres (dozens of miles).\nThe Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. An EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but does not cause significant damage to structures. An EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.\nWaterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes, characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water. These spiralling columns of air frequently develop within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.\nFlash flood.\nFlash flooding is the process where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods. These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding and are frequently (though not always) associated with intense rainfall. Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in arid regions as well as densely populated urban environments, where few plants, and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena.\nDownburst.\nDownburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.\nThunderstorm asthma.\nThunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.\nSafety precautions.\nMost thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning. Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.\nPreparedness.\nPreparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness takes the form of general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur:\n* Know the names of local counties, cities, and towns, as these are how warnings are described.\n* Monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area.\n* Be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm.\n* Cancel or reschedule outdoor events (to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits).\n* Take action early so you have time to get to a safe place.\n* Get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives.\n* If you hear thunder, get to the safe place immediately.\n* Avoid open areas like hilltops, fields, and beaches, and do not be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring.\n* Do not shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms.\n* If in the woods, put as much distance as possible between you and any trees during thunderstorms.\n* If in a group, spread out to increase the chances of survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a lightning strike.\nSafety.\nWhile safety and preparedness often overlap, \"thunderstorm safety\" generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm. The American Red Cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress:\n* Take action immediately upon hearing thunder. Anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning.\n* Avoid electrical appliances, including corded telephones. Cordless and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm.\n* Close and stay away from windows and doors, as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind.\n* Do not bathe or shower, as plumbing conducts electricity.\n* If driving, safely exit the roadway, turn on hazard lights, and park. Remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal.\nThe NWS stopped recommending the \"lightning crouch\" in 2008 as it does not provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike.\nFrequent occurrences.\n Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, even in the polar regions, with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas, where they may occur nearly daily. At any given time, approximately 2,000 thunderstorms are occurring on Earth. Kampala and Tororo in Uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on Earth, a claim also made for Singapore and Bogor on the Indonesian island of Java. Other cities known for frequent storm activity include Darwin, Caracas, Manila and Mumbai. Thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe, and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones. In temperate regions, they are most frequent in spring and summer, although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year. They may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water. Thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures.\nSome of the most powerful thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California. In spring and summer, they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime. In the Northeast, storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida.\nEnergy.\nIf the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5\u00d7108 kg of water vapor are lifted, and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.\nThe Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.\nStudies.\nIn more contemporary times, thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity. Every spring, storm chasers head to the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping. Radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms. More organized meteorological projects such as VORTEX2 use an array of sensors, such as the Doppler on Wheels, vehicles with mounted automated weather stations, weather balloons, and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather. Lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95\u00a0percent accuracy in detection and within of their point of origin.\nMythology and religion.\nThunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations. Greeks believed that they were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus. Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight J\u00f6tnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mj\u00f6lnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepts that fierce storms are the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.\nMartin Luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began, causing him to pray to God for being saved and promising to become a monk.\nOutside of Earth.\nThunderstorms, evidenced by flashes of lightning, on Jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice, suggesting a mechanism similar to that on Earth. (Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge, so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning). These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times more powerful than lightning on the Earth. The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior. The clouds of Venus may also be capable of producing lightning; some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Story of a Puppet\"), commonly shortened to Pinocchio, is an 1883 children's fantasy novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio. He faces many perils and temptations, meets characters who teach him about life, and learns goodness before he achieves his heart's desire to become a real boy.\nThe story was originally published in serial form as \"The Story of a Puppet\" () in the , one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes in Chapter 15, but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882, and concluded on 25 January 1883 after a total of 30 chapters published across 26 issues, all illustrated by Ugo Fleres. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book, with illustrations by Enrico Mazzanti. Since then, \"Pinocchio\" has been one of the most popular children's books and has been critically acclaimed.\nA universal icon and a metaphor for the human condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has had a great impact on world culture. Philosopher Benedetto Croce considered it one of the greatest works of Italian literature. Since its first publication, it has inspired many works of fiction, such as Walt Disney's animated version, and commonplace ideas such as a liar's long nose.\nThe book has been translated into as many as 260 languages worldwide, making it one of the world's most translated books. While it is likely one of the best-selling books ever published, the actual total sales since its first publication are unknown due to the many reductions and different versions. According to Viero Peroncini, \"some sources report 35 million [copies sold], others 80, but it is only a way, even a rather idle one, of quantifying an unquantifiable success.\" According to Francelia Butler, it also remains \"the most translated Italian book and, after the Bible, the most widely read\".\nPlot.\nIn Tuscany, Italy, a carpenter named Master Antonio finds a log that he plans to carve into a table leg. However, after being frightened when the log cries out, he gives it to his neighbor Geppetto who wants to carve a puppet from it and make a living as a traveling puppeteer. He carves a boy and names him \"Pinocchio\". Once the puppet is finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and into the town, where he is caught by a Carabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto.\nLeft alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat, where a talking cricket warns him of the perils of disobedience and laziness. After being called a wooden head, in retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, accidentally killing it. Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but a chick hatches from the egg and leaves to find food. He knocks on a neighbor's door, but they fear he is pulling a prank and dump water on him. Cold and wet, Pinocchio goes home and lies down on a stove, and upon waking he finds his feet have burned off. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison, gives Pinocchio three pears to eat for breakfast, and makes him a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school and Geppetto makes him a suit of clothing consisting of a dress made of flowered paper, tree bark shoes, and a cap made of dough, and sells his only coat to buy him a spelling book.\nOn his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre and sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppets Harlequin, Pulcinella and Signora Rosaura call out to Pinocchio. This angers the puppet master Mangiafuoco, and he decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner. However, after Pinocchio pleads for his and Harlequin's salvation and he learns of Geppetto's poverty, Mangiafuoco releases him and gives him five gold pieces.\nOn his way home, Pinocchio meets a fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame; a white blackbird tries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the Cat eats it. The two convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city of Catchfools, they will grow into a tree with gold coins. They stop for dinner at the Red Lobster Inn where they trick Pinocchio into paying for their meals and flee after telling the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio they would meet him at the Field of Miracles in the morning.\nAs Pinocchio sets off for the city of Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears and tells him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again and as he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised as bandits, ambush and attempt to rob him but fail. After biting off the Cat's paw, he escapes to a white house, where he is greeted by a young fairy with turquoise hair who says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the Fox and the Cat catch Pinocchio and hang him in a tree and leave after getting tired of waiting for him to suffocate, leaving Pinocchio to die alone and think about his misbehavior.\nThe Fairy has Pinocchio rescued and calls in three doctors to evaluate him: The Owl says he is alive, the Crow says he is dead, and the Ghost of the Talking Cricket says he is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy offers medicine to Pinocchio, which he takes when several Undertaker rabbits appear to collect his body. Now recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what happened to the gold coins, and his nose grows. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio's lies are causing his nose to grow and calls in a flock of woodpeckers to chisel it down to size. She then sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage.\nAs Pinocchio heads out to find Geppetto, he once again meets the Fox and the Cat, who remind him of the Field of Miracles, and he agrees to go with them and plant his gold. Once there, Pinocchio buries his coins and leaves to wait twenty minutes for it to grow, only for the Fox and the Cat to dig up the coins and run away.\nOnce Pinocchio returns, a parrot mocks him for falling for the Fox and Cat's tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse, where he reports the theft of the coins to a gorilla judge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the gorilla judge sentences him to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness. Fortunately, all criminals are released early when the Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies.\nAs Pinocchio heads back to the forest, he finds an enormous snake with a smoking tail blocking the way. He asks the serpent to move, but it remains completely still, and he assumes it is dead. He begins to step over it, but it suddenly rises up and hisses at him, toppling him over onto his head. Struck by Pinocchio's fright and comical position, the snake laughs so hard he bursts an artery and dies.\nPinocchio then heads back to the Fairy's house in the forest, where he sneaks into a farmer's yard to steal some grapes. He is caught in a weasel trap and encounters a glowworm. The farmer finds him and ties him up in his doghouse. When Pinocchio foils the chicken-stealing weasels, the farmer frees him as a reward. Pinocchio finally returns to the cottage, but there he finds nothing but a gravestone, and believes the Fairy has died.\nA friendly pigeon sees Pinocchio mourning the Fairy's death and offers to give him a ride to the seashore, where Geppetto is building a boat to search for Pinocchio. Pinocchio is washed ashore when he tries to swim to his father, who is swallowed by The Terrible Dogfish. Pinocchio accepts a ride from a dolphin to the Island of Busy Bees where everyone works every day. Upon arriving there, Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water, and upon arriving at her house, he recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now old enough to be his mother. She says she will act as his mother, and he will begin going to school. She hints that if he does well in school and is good for one year, then he will become a real boy.\nPinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, making the other boys jealous. They trick Pinocchio into playing hooky by saying they saw a large sea monster at the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, they were lying, and a fight breaks out, during which Pinocchio is accused of injuring another boy. He escapes, and along the way saves a drowning Mastiff named Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio from The Green Fisherman, who was going to eat him. After he meets the Snail who works for the Fairy, she gives him another chance.\nPinocchio does excellently in school, and the Fairy promises that he will be a real boy the next day, saying he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked after meeting Candlewick, one of his closest friends, who tells him he is heading to a place called Toyland, where children play all day and never work or study. Pinocchio goes along with him, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.\nOne morning, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. A marmot tells Pinocchio that he has gotten donkey fever, as boys who play and never study or work turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed, and Pinocchio is sold to a circus where he is trained to do tricks. He falls and sprains his leg after seeing the Fairy in one of the box seats. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and use his hide to make a drum, and throws him into the sea to drown him. But when he goes to retrieve the corpse, he finds Pinocchio, who explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again. Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea, where the Terrible Dogfish appears and swallows him. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, and they escape with help from a large tuna and look for a new place to live.\nPinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat, who are now impoverished. The Fox has become lame and the Cat has gone blind, respectively. They plead for food and money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that they have earned their misfortune. Geppetto and Pinocchio then arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for a farmer, and recognizes his dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.\nAfter long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money, and gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all of his money. That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy, with his puppet body lying lifeless on a chair. The Fairy has also left him a new suit, boots, and a bag which contains 40 gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health.\nHistory.\n\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" incorporates elements similar to that of fairy tales, as it is a story about an animated puppet and boys who turn into donkeys. The story is set in the Tuscan area of Italy, and features Italian language peppered with Florentine dialect features, such as the protagonist's Florentine name.\nAs a young man, Collodi joined the seminary. However, the cause of Italian unification (\"Risorgimento\") usurped his calling, as he took to journalism as a means of supporting the Risorgimento in its struggle with the Austrian Empire. In the 1850s, Collodi began to have a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books published. Once, he translated some French fairy-tales so well that he was asked whether he would like to write some of his own. In 1848, Collodi started publishing \"Il Lampione\", a newspaper of political satire. With the founding of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Collodi ceased his journalistic and militaristic activities and began writing children's books.\nCollodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recently unified Italy, including \"Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino\" (\"Little Johnny's voyage through Italy\"; 1876), a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, and \"Minuzzolo\" (1878). In 1881, he sent a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet to a friend who edited a newspaper in Rome, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this \"bit of foolishness\" in his children's section. The editor did, and the children loved it.\n\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" was originally published in serial form in the \"Giornale per i bambini\", one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. In the original, serialized version, Pinocchio dies a gruesome death: hanged for his innumerable faults, at the end of Chapter 15. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16\u201336, in which the Fairy with Turquoise Hair rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy, when he acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story more suitable for children. In the second half of the book, the maternal figure of the Blue-haired Fairy is the dominant character, versus the paternal figure of Geppetto in the first part. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book with huge success.\nChildren's literature was a new idea in Collodi's time, an innovation in the 19th century. Thus in content and style it was new and modern, opening the way to many writers of the following century.\nInternational popularity.\n\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" is the world's third most translated book (240\u2013260 languages), and was the first work of Italian children's literature to achieve international fame. The book has had great impact on world culture, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide. The title character is a cultural icon and one of the most reimagined characters in children's literature. The popularity of the story was bolstered by the powerful philosopher-critic Benedetto Croce, who greatly admired the tale and reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature.\nCarlo Collodi, who died in 1890, was respected during his lifetime as a talented writer and social commentator, and his fame continued to grow when \"Pinocchio\" was first translated into English by Mary Alice Murray in 1892, whose translation was added to the widely read Everyman's Library in 1911. Other well regarded English translations include the 1926 translation by Carol Della Chiesa, and the 1986 bilingual edition by Nicolas J. Perella. The first appearance of the book in the United States was in 1898, with publication of the first US edition in 1901, translated and illustrated by Walter S. Cramp and Charles Copeland. From that time, the story was one of the most famous children's books in the United States and an important step for many illustrators.\nTogether with those from the United Kingdom, the American editions contributed to the popularity of Pinocchio in countries more culturally distant from Italy, such as Iceland and Asian countries. In 1905, Otto Julius Bierbaum published a new version of the book in Germany, entitled \"Zapfelkerns Abenteuer\" (lit. \"The Adventures of Pine Nut\"), and the first French edition was published in 1902. Between 1911 and 1945, translations were made into all European languages and several languages of Asia, Africa and Oceania. In 1936, Soviet writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy published a reworked version of Pinocchio titled \"The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino\" (originally a character in the commedia dell'arte), which became one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature.\nThe first stage adaptation was launched in 1899, written by Gattesco Gatteschi and Enrico Guidotti and directed by Luigi Rasi. Also, Pinocchio was adopted as a pioneer of cinema: in 1911, Giulio Antamoro featured him in a 45-minute hand-coloured silent film starring Polidor (an almost complete version of the film was restored in the 1990s). In 1932, Nobur\u014d \u014cfuji directed a Japanese movie with an experimental technique using animated puppets, while in the 1930s in Italy, there was an attempt to produce a full-length animated cartoon film of the same title. The 1940 Walt Disney version was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.\nLiterary analysis.\nBefore writing \"Pinocchio\", Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recently unified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titled \"Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino\" (\"Little Johnny's voyage through Italy\"). Throughout \"Pinocchio\", Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun.\nThe structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folk-tales of peasants who venture out into the world but are naively unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations. At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from the industrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was the emigration of much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries, often as far away as the Americas.\nSome literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. According to Thomas J. Morrissey and Richard Wunderlich in \"Death and Rebirth in Pinocchio\" (1983) \"such mythological events probably imitate the annual cycle of vegetative birth, death, and renascence, and they often serve as paradigms for the frequent symbolic deaths and rebirths encountered in literature. Two such symbolic renderings are most prominent: re-emergence from a journey to hell and rebirth through metamorphosis. A journey to the underworld\u2014termed \"katabasis\"\u2014is a common feature of Eurasian literary epics; Gilgamesh, Odysseus, Aeneas, and Dante all benefit from the knowledge and power they gain after such descents. Rebirth through metamorphosis, however, is a motif generally consigned to fantasy or speculative literature [...] These two figurative manifestations of the death-rebirth trope are rarely combined; however, Carlo Collodi's great fantasy-epic, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", is a work in which a hero experiences symbolic death and rebirth through both infernal descent and metamorphosis. Pinocchio is truly a fantasy hero of epic proportions [...] Beneath the book's comic-fantasy texture\u2014but not far beneath\u2014lies a symbolic journey to the underworld, from which Pinocchio emerges whole.\"\nThe main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study. And in the end Pinocchio's willingness to provide for his father and devote himself to these things transforms him into a real boy with modern comforts. \"as a hero of what is, in the classic sense, a comedy, \"Pinocchio\" is protected from ultimate catastrophe, although he suffers quite a few moderate calamities. Collodi never lets the reader forget that disaster is always a possibility; in fact, that is just what Pinocchio's mentors \u2014Geppetto, the Talking Cricket, and the Fairy\u2014 repeatedly tell him. Although they are part of a comedy, Pinocchio's adventures are not always funny. Indeed, they are sometimes sinister. The book's fictive world does not exclude injury, pain, or even death\u2014they are stylized but not absent. [...] Accommodate them he does, by using the archetypal birth-death-rebirth motif as a means of structuring his hero's growth to responsible boyhood. Of course, the success of the puppet's growth is rendered in terms of his metamorphic rebirth as a flesh-and-blood human.\"\nAdaptations.\nThe story has been adapted into many forms on stage and screen, some keeping close to the original Collodi narrative while others treat the story more freely. There are at least fourteen English-language films based on the story, Italian, French, Russian, German, Japanese and other versions for the big screen and for television, and several musical adaptations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

It was the subject of limited research from the 1950s through to the 1970s as a potential cause of schizophrenia. While adrenochrome has no currently proven medical application, the semicarbazide derivative, carbazochrome, is a hemostatic medication. Adrenochrome is mass produced and commercially available to the public, and is not a controlled substance.\nDespite this compound's name, it is unrelated to the element chromium; instead, the \"chrome\" suffix indicates a relationship to color, as pure adrenochrome has a deep violet color.\nChemistry.\nThe oxidation reaction that converts adrenaline into adrenochrome occurs both \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\". Silver oxide (Ag2O) was among the first reagents employed for this, but a variety of other oxidizing agents have been used successfully. In solution, adrenochrome is pink and further oxidation of the compound causes it to polymerize into brown or black melanin compounds.\nSynthesis.\nAdrenochrome is readily synthesized from commercially available reagents: chloroacetic acid and catechol react in the presence of phosphoryl chloride to yield chloroacetylcatechol. After purification, chloroacetylcatechol is reacted with aqueous methylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid, yielding adrenalone hydrochloride. This is then hydrogenated to racemic adrenaline. Finally, adrenaline is oxidized to adrenochrome by an appropriate oxidizing agent such as silver oxide.\nHistory.\nSeveral small-scale studies involving 15 or fewer test subjects conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder and derealization.\nIn 1954, researchers Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond claimed that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and may play a role in schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. In what Hoffer called the \"adrenochrome hypothesis\", he and Osmond in 1967 speculated that megadoses of vitamin C and niacin could cure schizophrenia by reducing brain adrenochrome.\nThe treatment of schizophrenia with such potent anti-oxidants is controversial. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reported methodological flaws in Hoffer's work on niacin as a schizophrenia treatment and referred to follow-up studies that did not confirm any benefits of the treatment. Multiple additional studies in the United States, Canada, and Australia similarly failed to find benefits of megavitamin therapy to treat schizophrenia.\nThe adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia waned, despite some evidence that it may be psychotomimetic, as adrenochrome was not detectable in people with schizophrenia.\nIn the early 2000s, interest was renewed by the discovery that adrenochrome may be produced normally as an intermediate in the formation of neuromelanin. This finding may be significant because adrenochrome is detoxified at least partially by glutathione-S-transferase. Some studies have found genetic defects in the gene for this enzyme.\nAdrenochrome is also believed to have cardiotoxic properties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1024 to 1528, as one of the prince-bishoprics of the Holy Roman Empire, it was ruled by the bishops of Utrecht. \nThe Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht is not to be confused with the Diocese of Utrecht, which covered a larger area. Over the areas outside the Prince-Bishopric, the bishop exercised only spiritual, not temporal, authority.\nIn 1528, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor secularized the Prince-Bishopric, depriving the bishop of its secular authority.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Diocese of Utrecht was established in 695 when Saint Willibrord was consecrated bishop of the Frisians at Rome by Pope Sergius I. With the consent of the Frankish ruler, Pippin of Herstal, he settled in an old Roman fort in Utrecht. After Willibrord's death the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the Frisians, and later on of the Vikings. Whether Willibrord could be called the first bishop of Utrecht is doubtful; as James Palmer points out, \"there was no real concept of a well-defined bishopric until at least the days of Alberic (775\u201384)\". And while Saint Boniface is referred to in his hagiographies as the successor of Willibrord (and, in turn, Gregory of Utrecht is referred to as the successor to Willibrord and Boniface), this does not necessarily mean \"successor as bishop\", but rather that they succeeded each other as missionaries to the Frisians.\nFoundation.\nBetter times appeared during the reign of the Saxon emperors, who frequently summoned the Bishops of Utrecht to attend the imperial councils and diets. In 1024 the bishops were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the new Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was formed. The secular territory over which it ruled was known as Sticht Utrecht or Het Sticht (a sticht was any piece of land governed by a bishop or abbot). This territory was divided into the \"Nedersticht\" (Lower Sticht, roughly corresponding to the present day province of Utrecht) and \"Oversticht\" (Upper Sticht, encompassing the present-day provinces of Overijssel, Drenthe, and part of Groningen).\nIn 1122, with the Concordat of Worms, the Emperor's right of investiture was annulled, and the cathedral chapter received the right to elect the bishop. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters in the city. The Counts of Holland and Guelders, between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of Utrecht lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the episcopal see. This often led to disputes and consequently the Holy See frequently interfered in the election. After the middle of the 14th century the popes repeatedly appointed the bishop directly without regard to the five chapters.\nIt was part of the Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle, until 1548 when it joined the Burgundian Circle as part of the Habsburg Netherlands.\nIn 1527, the Bishop sold his territories, and thus his secular authority, to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the principality became an integral part of the Habsburg dominions. The chapters transferred their right of electing the bishop to Charles V and his government, a measure to which Pope Clement VII gave his consent, under political pressure after the Sack of Rome.\nDissolution.\nThe Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was conquered by Habsburg troops in 1528. The southwestern Nedersticht core territory around the city of Utrecht became the Lordship of Utrecht, whilst the southern part of the Oversticht was transformed into the Lordship of Overijssel. The northern parts were annexed in 1536 as the County of Drenthe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2022[ [update]], there are 76 cities in the United Kingdom\u201455 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales and six in Northern Ireland. Although it carries no special rights, the status of city can be a marker of prestige and confer local pride.\nThe status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criteria, though until 1889 in England and Wales it was limited to towns with diocesan cathedrals. This association between having an Anglican cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King Henry VIII founded dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and granted them city status by issuing letters patent. A city with a cathedral is often termed a cathedral city.\nCity status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England and Wales, and there are only two pre-19th-century cities in present-day Northern Ireland. In Scotland, city status did not explicitly receive any recognition by the state until the 19th century. At that time, a revival of grants of city status took place, first in England, where the grants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals, and later in Scotland and Ireland. In the 20th century, it was explicitly recognised that the status of city in England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral, and grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria, including population size.\nThe abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local-government reforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has deprived some ancient cities of their status. However, letters patent have been issued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration of their status. At present, Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in the United Kingdom.\nThe name \"City\" does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to place names for historic association (e.g. White City) or for marketing or disambiguation (e.g. Stratford City). A number of large towns (such as those with over 200,000 residents) in the UK are bigger than some small cities. \nHistory.\nEngland and Wales.\nPre-19th century.\nThe initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organised by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the \"28 Cities\" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.\nIn the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits, for which 22 dioceses existed in England &amp; Wales (see City status conferment further in the article). This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established when Henry VIII founded new dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and also granted them city status by issuing letters patent, demonstrating these were discrete procedures. Some cities today are very small because they were granted city status in or before the 16th century, then were unaffected by population growth during the Industrial Revolution\u2014notably Wells (population about 10,000) and St Davids (population about 2,000). After the 16th century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the 19th century in England (a further city was created in Ireland during the rule of King James I in the 17th century).\n1836\u20131888.\nA long-awaited resumption of creating dioceses began in 1836 with Ripon. Ripon Town Council assumed that this had elevated the town to the rank of a city, and started referring to itself as the \"City and Borough of Ripon\". The next diocese formed was Manchester and its Borough Council began informally to use the title \"city\". When Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851, widespread doubts surrounding its status were raised. The pretension was ended when the borough petitioned for city status, which was granted by letters patent in 1853. This eventually forced Ripon to regularise its position; its city status was recognised by Act of Parliament in 1865. From this year Ripon bore city status whilst the rapidly expanding conurbation of Leeds \u2013 in the Ripon diocese \u2013 did not. The Manchester case established a precedent that any municipal borough in which an Anglican see was established was entitled to petition for city status. Accordingly, Truro, St Albans, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Wakefield were all officially designated as cities between 1877 and 1888.\nThis was not without opposition from the Home Office, which dismissed St Albans as \"a fourth or fifth rate market town\" and objected to Wakefield's elevation on grounds of population. In one new diocese, Southwell, a city was not created, because it was a village without a borough corporation and therefore could not petition the Queen. The diocese covered the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the boroughs of Derby and Nottingham were disappointed that they would not be able to claim the title of city.\n1889\u20131907.\nThe link with Anglican dioceses was broken within England in 1889 when Birmingham successfully petitioned for city status (it was pre-empted in Ireland by Belfast in 1888) on the grounds of its large population and history of good local government. At the time of the grant, Birmingham lacked an Anglican cathedral, although the parish church later became a cathedral in 1905. This new precedent was followed by other large municipalities: Leeds and Sheffield became cities in 1893, and Bradford, Kingston upon Hull and Nottingham were honoured on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The last three had been the largest county boroughs outside the London area without city status.\nBetween 1897 and 1914, applications were received from a number of other boroughs, but only Cardiff was successful in being designated a city in 1905 and granted a Lord Mayoralty as \"the Metropolis of Wales\".\nThe status of Westminster.\nThe London Government Act 1899 abolished the existing local authorities within the County of London and replaced them with 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment at the committee stage to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster to 'City of Westminster'. This was intended to give \"recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries\". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it \"must necessarily disappear altogether\". The amendment was rejected by the committee, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be \"an anomaly which, I think, would be not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations\". The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that \"as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII\". Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of \"city\" to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.\n1907\u20131953.\nIn 1907, the Home Office and King Edward VII agreed on a policy that future applicants would have to meet certain criteria. This policy, which was not at the time made public, had the effect of stemming the number of city creations.\nThe 1907 policy contained three criteria:\nHowever, well into the 20th century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it. On this basis, the 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" said that Southwell and St Asaph were cities.\nThe policy laid down by Edward VII was continued by his successor, George V, who ascended the throne in 1910. In 1911, an application for city status by Portsmouth was refused. Explaining the Home Secretary's reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the Lord Advocate stated:\n...during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.\nFollowing the First World War, the King made an official visit to Leicester in 1919 to commemorate its contributions to the military victory. The borough council had made several applications for city status since 1889, and took the opportunity of the visit to renew its request. Leicester had a population of approximately 230,000 at the previous census, but its petition was granted as an exception to the policy, as it was officially a restoration of a dignity lost in the past. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent applied for city status in 1925, it was initially refused as it had only 294,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, as it was felt to have outstanding importance as the centre of the pottery industry. The effective relaxation of the population rule led to applications from Portsmouth and Salford. The civil servants in the Home Office were minded to refuse both applications. In particular, Salford was felt to be \"merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river\". Salford's case, however, was considered favourably by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who had once been a Member of Parliament (MP) for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester North West. Following protests from Portsmouth, which felt it had better credentials as a larger town and as the \"first Naval Port of the kingdom\", both applications were approved in 1926.\nIn 1927, a Royal Commission on Local Government was examining local council areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the Earl of Onslow, wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum that read:\nThe title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.\nIn 1928, Plymouth submitted an application for city status. As the borough had more inhabitants than Portsmouth and had absorbed Devonport and East Stonehouse, the King agreed to the request. However, he indicated that he had \"come to an end of city making\", and Southampton's application in the following year was turned down. In 1932 Sunderland's petition to gain city status was turned down, as was Derby's in 1935. The next city to be created was Lancaster in 1937 as part of the celebrations of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. With a population of a little over 50,000, Lancaster was stated to be an exception due to the town's \"long association with the crown\" and because it was \"the county town of the King's Duchy of Lancaster\". Following the Second World War, members of Cambridge Borough Council made contact with Lancaster officials for assistance in their application. Cambridge became a city in 1951, again for \"exceptional\" reasons, as the only ancient seat of learning in the kingdom not a city or royal burgh and to coincide with the 750th anniversary of the borough's first charter of incorporation.\n1953\u20131974.\nIt was anticipated that the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 would lead to the creation of a city, and Wolverhampton, Preston and Southampton made approaches; the only civic honour given was that of a lord mayoralty to Coventry. Croydon applied in 1954, but failed as it was felt not to have a sufficient identity apart from Greater London, and reports on the conduct of local government in the town were unfavourable. Derby and Southwark made unsuccessful applications in 1955. The planned reorganisations by the Local Government Commissions for England and Wales from 1958 effectively blocked new city grants. Southampton lodged a petition in 1958. Initially refused in 1959, pending the decision of the commission, it was eventually allowed in 1964. In the meantime, the administration of London was reformed under the London Government Act 1963. While the City of London was permitted to continue in existence largely unchanged, Westminster was merged with two neighbouring authorities to form a new London borough from 1 April 1965. In December 1963 it was announced that a charter was to be granted incorporating the new authority as \"Westminster\", and that the Queen had accepted the advice of the Home Secretary to raise the London borough to the title and dignity of city. This example, of a successor local authority to a merged local government entity taking on that former entity's city status, was to be replicated in many instances as a result of the 1972/74 local government reforms across England and Wales (see below).\nWith the establishment of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England in 1966, city grants were again in abeyance in England. Attempts by Derby, Teesside and Wolverhampton to become cities were not proceeded with. In Wales, Swansea campaigned for city status throughout the 1960s. The campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1969, in conjunction with the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.\n1974 reorganisation and new cities.\nThe Local Government Act 1972 abolished all existing local authorities outside London (other than parish councils) in England and Wales. This meant that the various local authorities that held city status ceased to exist on 1 April 1974. To preserve city status new letters patent were issued to the most relevant metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district or successor parish councils created by the Act. Some of these came to cover local government districts many times wider than the previous city, even taking in many square miles of rural land outside the urban areas, for example the cities of Bradford, Leeds and Winchester. Three non-local authority preservations arose: here charter trustees were established for the cities of Lichfield and Salisbury (or New Sarum) being neither districts nor civil parishes, and special letters patent for a time preserved the city of Rochester.\nIn 1977, as part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the Home Office identified nine candidates for city status: Blackburn, Brighton, Croydon, Derby, Dudley, Newport, Sandwell, Sunderland and Wolverhampton. Ultimately, Derby received the award as the largest non-metropolitan district not already designated a city. In April 1980 a parish council was created for Lichfield, and the charter trustees established six years earlier were dissolved. City status was temporarily lost until new letters patent were issued in November of the same year. In 1992, on the fortieth anniversary of the monarch's accession, it was announced that another town would be elevated to a city. An innovation on this occasion was that a competition was to be held, and communities would be required to submit applications. Sunderland was the successful applicant. This was followed in 1994 by the restoration of the dignity to St David's, historic see of a bishop. Since 2000, city status has been awarded to towns or local government districts by competition on special occasions. A large number of towns have applied for the honour in recent decades including Blackpool, Colchester, Croydon, Gateshead, Ipswich, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, Swindon and Warrington. Four successful applicants in England have become cities, as well as two in Wales; in 2000 for the Millennium celebrations, the new cities were Brighton and Hove and Wolverhampton; in 2002 for the Queen's Golden Jubilee it was Preston and Newport, and in 2012 for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee it was Chelmsford and St Asaph.\n2021 bids for city status.\nFrom June 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2022. Places submitting bids (some for a second or subsequent time) included Bangor (Northern Ireland), Bournemouth, Doncaster, Dunfermline, Dudley, Marazion, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, St Andrews and Wrexham. Bids were also accepted from overseas territories and crown dependencies for the first time. The competition closed on 8 December 2021 with 39 locations on the shortlist, and the winners were to be announced in June 2022.\nOn 18 October 2021, the Prime Minister announced in Parliament that the Queen, in advance of the closing date, would accord city status to one of the applicants, Southend-on-Sea. This was in memory of Sir David Amess, the town's MP who was murdered three days earlier and had long pressed for the status. City status was officially granted by letters patent dated 26 January 2022. They were presented to Southend Borough Council by Charles, Prince of Wales, on 1 March 2022.\nAn announcement on 20 May 2022 declared that eight new cities were to be created from the shortlist, with at least one in every UK country as well as in overseas locations. In England, Milton Keynes, Colchester and Doncaster were to be the recipients of the honour. Dunfermline, a previous royal capital of Scotland, was granted the privilege. Bangor in Northern Ireland was also a recipient, and the title in Wales was granted to Wrexham. These awards increased the number of official mainland cities to 76, with 55 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales, six in Northern Ireland.\nGreater London.\nOther than the cities of London and Westminster, no local authorities in the Greater London area have been granted city status. The Home Office had a policy of resisting any attempt by metropolitan boroughs to become cities even when their populations, and other proposed claims as qualifying criteria, might otherwise have made them eligible. It was felt that such a grant would undermine the status of the two existing cities in the capital. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark made a number of applications, but in 1955 the borough's town clerk was told not to pursue the matter any further. Outside the boundaries of the county, the County Borough of Croydon made three applications, all of which were dismissed as it was not seen as being sufficiently separate from London. When the successor London Borough of Croydon applied in 1965 the Assistant Under Secretary of State summarised the case against Croydon: \"...whatever its past history, it is now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs\".\nThe same objections were made when the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark unsuccessfully entered the competition for city status to mark the millennium: Croydon was said to have \"no particular identity of its own\" while Southwark was \"part of London with little individual identity\". When the competition was held to mark the Golden Jubilee of 2002, Croydon made a sixth application, again unsuccessful. It was joined by the London Borough of Greenwich, which emphasised its royal and maritime connections, while claiming to be \"to London what Versailles is to Paris\". In this vein Greenwich joined Kingston-upon-Thames and Kensington and Chelsea in London in having the title of Royal Borough in 2012.\nRochester.\nRochester was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On 1 April 1974, the city council was abolished, becoming part of the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. However, under letters patent the former city council area was to continue to be styled the \"City of Rochester\" to \"perpetuate the ancient name\" and to recall \"the long history and proud heritage of the said city\". The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979, the Borough of Medway was renamed as Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.\nOn 1 April 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished and became the new unitary authority of Medway. Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. Whilst the two other local government districts with city status (Bath and Hereford) that were abolished around this time decided to appoint charter trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty, Rochester-upon-Medway City Council did not do so. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor's Office's list of cities. The council campaigned unsuccessfully to be one of 2012 Diamond Jubilee cities. The campaign's \"City of Medway\" logo was used on a council tourism leaflet titled \"Historic Rochester and Maritime Chatham\" until the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a 2010 complaint that it misleadingly implied Medway had \"officially been granted city status\" because \"readers of the leaflet were likely to be aware of [the] official definition of a city\".\nScotland.\nScotland had no cities by royal charter or letters patent before 1889. The nearest equivalent in pre-Union Scotland was the royal burgh. The term \"city\" was not always consistently applied, and there were doubts over the number of officially designated cities. The royal burghs of Edinburgh and Perth anciently used the title \"civitas\", but the term \"city\" does not seem to have been used before the 15th century. Unlike the situation in England, in Scotland there was no link between the presence of a cathedral and the title of \"city\". Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh were accepted as cities by ancient usage by the 18th century, while Perth and Elgin also used the title. In 1856, the burgh of Dunfermline resolved to use the title of \"city\" in all official documents in the future, based on long usage and its former status as a royal capital. The status was not officially recognised until 2022.\nIn 1889, Dundee was granted city status by letters patent. The grant by formal document led to doubts about the use of the title \"city\" by other burghs. In 1891, the city status of Aberdeen was confirmed when the burgh was enlarged by local Act of Parliament. The Royal Burgh of Inverness applied for promotion to a city as part of the Jubilee honours in 1897. The request was not granted, partly because it would draw attention to the lack of any charter granting the title to existing cities. Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow were constituted \"counties of cities\" by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. The Act made no statement on the title \"city\" for any other burgh. In 1969, the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, stated that there were six cities in Scotland (without naming them) and Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Elgin, Glasgow and Perth were the only burghs listed as cities in 1972.\nThe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 completely reorganised Scotland's local administration in 1975. All burghs were abolished, and a system of districts created. The four districts of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow had \"City\" included in their titles by the Act. The 1975 districts were replaced with the present council areas in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, and the same four cities were designated. Since the 1996 reorganisation, four more Scottish cities have been designated: Inverness as part of the millennium celebrations, Stirling in 2002 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, Perth in 2012 to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and Dunfermline in 2022 to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. In the case of these four cities, there are no city councils and no formal boundaries. In January 2008, a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no corporate body or legal persona to whom arms can be granted.\nIreland and Northern Ireland.\nCity status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that have never been called cities. In spite of this, Armagh was considered a city, by virtue of its being the seat of the Primate of All Ireland, until the abolition of Armagh's city corporation by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The only historic city with a charter in present-day Northern Ireland is Derry. The garrison town of Derry was attacked and destroyed by Cahir O'Doherty in 1608. The present city status is the result of a Royal Charter granted in 1615 to The Honourable The Irish Society as part of the Plantation of Ulster, providing for the building of a walled city, which was named \"Londonderry\" in recognition of the London Guilds that established the Society.\nIn 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria was celebrated, and the Borough of Belfast submitted a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seeking city status. Belfast based its claim on its similarity to two English boroughs that had received the honour\u2014the seaport of Liverpool and the textile centre of Manchester\u2014and the fact that it had (at the time) a larger population than the City of Dublin. Following some legal debate, city status was conferred in 1888. The grant of the honour on the grounds of being a large industrial town, rather than a diocesan centre, was unprecedented. Belfast's example was soon followed by Birmingham in England and Dundee in Scotland.\nIn 1994, Armagh's city status was restored. In 2002, Lisburn and Newry were two of the five towns in the UK that were granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Golden Jubilee. In the case of Lisburn, the status extended to the entire local government district. Newry, like Inverness and Stirling in Scotland, has no formal boundaries or city council. The letters patent were presented to representatives of Newry and Mourne District Council on behalf of the city.\nCrown colonies and British Overseas Territories.\nDuring the British Empire, the Colonial Office had the power to declare cities in Crown colonies by letters patent when appointing bishops. When the Bishop of Guyana was created in 1842, Georgetown (then part of British Guiana) was officially declared the \"City of Georgetown\". The same process was followed for Gibraltar, Jamestown, St Helena, Bridgetown, Barbados, St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda, Victoria, Hong Kong and Nassau, Bahamas. Most of these have since gained independence from the United Kingdom, but Gibraltar and St Helena remain British Overseas Territories. This practice ended in 1865, and led to legal disputes about whether these letters patent were valid or not in territories with responsible government (primarily those in present day Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa). Goulburn in Australia for example found itself declared a city twice \u2013 once by letters patent in 1863 and once by law in 1885 after doubts arose to its status.\nHamilton, Bermuda was named as a city in 1897 as part of the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Since the second Millennium, competitions have been arranged by the UK government to grant the status to settlements. In 2021 submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories being allowed to take part for the first time. The applicants were George Town (in the Cayman Islands), Gibraltar, Stanley (in the Falkland Islands), Douglas and Peel (both in the Isle of Man). It was later discovered that Gibraltar had been previously named a city, researchers at The National Archives confirming that Gibraltar's city status was still in effect, with the territory missing from the official list of cities for the past 140 years. Stanley and Douglas were later granted the honour, and after confirmations this will take the overseas total to five cities.\nCurrent practice of granting city status.\nAccording to a Memorandum from the Home Office issued in 1927,\nIf a town wishes to obtain the title of a city the proper method of procedure is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.\nA town can now apply for city status by submitting an application to the Lord Chancellor, who makes recommendations to the sovereign. Competitions for new grants of city status have been held to mark special events, such as coronations, royal jubilees or the Millennium.\nLord mayors.\nSome cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the further distinction of having a lord mayor rather than just a mayor \u2013 in Scotland, the equivalent is the lord provost. Lord mayors have the right to be styled \"The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor\". The lord mayors and provosts of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, the City of London and York have the further right to be styled \"The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor\" (or Provost), although they are not members of the Privy Council as this style usually indicates. The style is associated with the office, not the person holding it.\nThere are currently 31 lord mayoralties or lord provostships in the UK: 23 lord mayoralties in England, two lord mayoralties in Wales, four lord provostships in Scotland and two lord mayoralties in Northern Ireland.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the ceremonial head of the city government of Dublin is the Lord Mayor of Dublin. This title was granted by Charles II in 1665 when Dublin was part of the Kingdom of Ireland. Whilst the 1665 letters patent provided for the Lord Mayor to hold the formal title of Right Honourable, this was repealed in 2001. There is also a Lord Mayor of Cork, a title granted in 1900 when Cork was part of the (then) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nIn modern practice, competitions are held for cities that wish to gain the distinction of a lord mayor. The 2002 competition was entered by Bath, Cambridge, Carlisle, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, St Albans, St Davids, Salford, Southampton, Sunderland, Truro, Wolverhampton and Worcester; the successful candidate was Exeter. In 2012 a further competition was held, as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, with Armagh receiving the distinction. Other than Armagh, eleven cities had entered the contest in 2012, namely: Cambridge, Derby, Gloucester, Lancaster, Newport, Peterborough, Salford, Southampton, St Albans, Sunderland, and Wakefield.\nLocal government districts.\nSince local government reorganisation in 1974 city status has been awarded to a number of local government districts which are not themselves towns. Each includes a number of towns and villages outside the urban area from which the district takes its name. In some of these cases city status was awarded to districts where the largest settlement had city status before 1974. In other cases a borough was formed to govern an area covering several towns and then city status was granted to the borough. The largest \"city\" district in terms of area was until 1 April 2023 the City of Carlisle, which covered some of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and was larger than smaller counties such as Merseyside or Rutland. (The largest now is the City of Winchester at .) Such cities include:\nThere are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Examples include: Manchester, where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury and the City of Salford; Kingston upon Hull, where surrounding areas and villages that are effectively suburbs, such as Cottingham, come under East Riding of Yorkshire Council; Glasgow, where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire.\nCity councils.\nThe holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a \"city\". Nonetheless, this appellation carries its own prestige and, consequently, competitions for the status are hard-fought.\nHistorically, city status could only be granted to incorporated towns. The grant was specifically awarded to the relevant local government area such as a civil parish or borough. However, recent grants have used a looser wording, where the status is awarded to the \"town\". In most cases the \"town\" is held to be coterminous with the relevant local government area, such that the city status holder is the corporate body of the council. Examples include the Letters Patent awarded to the \"Towns of Brighton and Hove\", the \"Town of Wolverhampton\" and the \"Town of Newport in the County Borough of Newport\". In each case the existing borough council became the city council.\nMost cities have city councils, which have varying powers depending on the country and type of settlement.\nEngland.\nThirteen of the 55 cities in England are in metropolitan counties and their city councils are single-tier metropolitan district councils. Outside the metropolitan counties fourteen cities are unitary authorities, and fourteen have ordinary district councils, which are subordinate to their local county council. In London the Westminster City Council functions as a London borough council, and the City of London Corporation is the council for the City of London. Eight smaller episcopal cities such as Ripon and Wells are neither local government districts nor within a 'local government district with city status', and have city councils which are parish councils, with limited powers. Two cities (Bath and Chester) have no city council, while Durham has a 'city' parish council; these, however, maintain the status through charter trustees on behalf of their prior district areas which held city status before being abolished in 1996 and 2009.\nScotland.\nAberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are themselves council areas and have their own city councils. The cities of Dunfermline, Perth, Stirling and Inverness are part of council areas which do not have city status, and have no city councils. Stirling Council's application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) Royal Burgh of Stirling and included proposed city boundaries which are much smaller than Stirling council area.\nWales.\nCardiff, Newport, and Swansea are principal areas and have city councils. Wrexham, being awarded the status in 2022, still maintains its county borough council as of April 2023. The city councils of Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids are community councils with limited powers.\nNorthern Ireland.\nBelfast City Council is a local government district council. Since the local government reforms of 2015 the four other cities of Armagh, Derry, Lisburn and Newry form parts of wider districts and do not have their own councils.\nCity status conferment.\nCity status is conferred by letters patent and not by a royal charter (except historically in Ireland). There are twenty towns in England and Wales that were recognised as cities by \"ancient prescriptive right\"; none of these communities had been formally declared a city, but they had all used the title since \"time immemorial\" (legally defined as before 3 September 1189) and had been granted some form of privilege such as freedoms by way of a charter or being given borough or corporation status. These ancient cities as listed by the Home Office in 1927:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThese twenty cities were concurrent with 22 ancient diocese (pre-English Reformation) locations. Bath and Wells being one diocese and the old Coventry cathedral having shared the Diocese of Lichfield pre-reformation, the remaining four were:\nThe holding of city status brings no special benefits other than the right to be called a city. All cities where a local government unit that holds that status is abolished have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government reorganisation where that holder has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since 1974, and York and Hereford's status was confirmed twice, in 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at Rochester in 1998 (\"see above\"), and also previously in St David's and Armagh, although both of these latter have regained city status since losing it. These three had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of city status.\nOfficially designated cities.\nThere are currently 76 officially designated cities in the UK, of which 17 have been created since 2000 in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002, Diamond Jubilee in 2012, and Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at recent competitions.\nCity status has been applied to a variety of entities including towns, local government districts and civil parishes.\nSmallest and largest cities.\nWhile cities are regularly ranked by the number of residents, this is not an ideal measure. Population can vary based on the number and type of residences present, and has to be limited to an area. The official area of a city in the UK is typically the coverage up to a local government/council boundary, there being a variety of council bodies. However, there are exceptions depending on the UK constituent country and whether the council has since been abolished.\nSuch a boundary can typically contain a built up (urban) area, and a surrounding, less populated rural landscape. Or the area of a city can be entirely built up, with that urban environment spilling over a boundary into another area which does not have city status. That wider urban area can still be considered in everyday parlance locally as a whole 'city' although it is not a formal designation.\nWith the 'square mile' City of London being in the middle of a huge urban area, it can be suggested that 'small' should be applied to only cities with minimal urban areas that have nearby surrounding areas of countryside and so is visibly representative of the term, the city of Wells being more suitable in this regard as the smallest standalone city council area. Therefore, sizing can be interpreted in a number of ways, and below are top 5 lists of the smallest and largest cities ranked by population, city council area, and urban area.\nAll statistics are 2021 census figures.\nPopulation is of the total residents in the city council area. Armagh (no local council) and the Largest Urban Area table both use urban population figures.\nTowns not cities.\nPopulous towns.\n'City' can refer to any large settlement, with no fixed limit but there are British towns with large urban areas that could qualify for city status on the grounds of population size. Some have applied for city status and had the application turned down. The report \"Key Statistics for Built-Up Areas 2011\" published by the Office for National Statistics showed that, at the 2011 Census, the following were the largest urban areas in the United Kingdom not having a city as a component:\nThe largest local authorities to have been unsuccessful in applying for city status in recent competitions are:\nCathedral towns.\nA \"cathedral city\" is a place designated as a city which has a cathedral.\nEngland and Wales.\nSince being the seat of an Anglican diocese is no longer sufficient or necessary to gain city status, some cathedral towns exist:\nThe 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" referred to Southwell as a city, A photograph of the Football XI sitting on the steps of Norwood Park (home since 1888 of the Starkey Bramley) in 1954 is titled Southwell City F.C. and in 1949 Bury St Edmunds was referred to as a city.\nThere are 16 English and Welsh cities that have never had Anglican cathedrals within their borders \u2013 Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Plymouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Southend-on-Sea, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, and Wolverhampton.\nBath Abbey was once a diocesan cathedral, as was Westminster Abbey briefly during the reign of Henry VIII. These cities retained their city status despite their cathedrals losing that status.\nScotland.\nThe national church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, is presbyterian in governance (not recognising authority of bishops), and thus has high kirks rather than cathedrals. However, the pre-Reformation dioceses do have extant cathedrals, most notably at Glasgow and Aberdeen, which remain in use by the Church of Scotland and continue to bear the honorific title of cathedral. Others (such as that of St Andrews) are now in ruins.\nBoth Perth and Elgin were recognised as cities before 1975; Perth's city status was restored in 2012. Additionally, five other pre-Reformation sees\u2014Brechin, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Kirkwall and St Andrews\u2014are often referred to as cities, notably in names associated with the settlements (e.g. 'City of Brechin and District' community council. and Brechin City F.C., City Road in St Andrews). Dornoch, Fortrose, Lismore, Saddell and Whithorn also possess pre-Reformation cathedrals but have never been described as cities.\nTowns with non-Church of Scotland, post-Reformation cathedrals which are not recognised as cities are Ayr (R.C.), Millport (Episcopal), Oban (R.C.), Motherwell (R.C.) and Paisley (R.C.). Of these, Ayr, Motherwell and Paisley have larger populations than Perth, Stirling and Inverness, and both Ayr and Paisley have formally made a bid for city status during the millennium competition.\nOf settlements granted city status in the 21st century, Inverness (awarded 2001) possesses an Episcopal cathedral (1866), but none under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. Stirling (awarded 2002) has never had a cathedral of any kind. Perth (reinstated 2012) has an Episcopal cathedral dating from 1860, but no pre-Reformation establishment.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, possession of a diocesan cathedral has never (except in the anomalous case of Armagh) been sufficient to attain this status. The Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871, The 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" did refer to Armagh (which lost city status in 1840) and Lisburn as cities. Armagh subsequently regained city status formally in 1994, and Lisburn achieved city status in 2002.\nThere are four towns in Northern Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that do not have city status\u2014Clogher, Downpatrick, Dromore and Enniskillen.\nNewry is the only city in Northern Ireland that does not have a Church of Ireland cathedral within its borders.\nClaimants.\nA number of towns describe themselves as cities in some contexts, despite not having the requisite charter.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70842", "revid": "50906742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70842", "title": "Idi Amin", "text": "President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979\nIdi Amin Dada Oumee (30 May 1928\u00a0\u2013 16 August 2003) was a Ugandan military officer and politician who served as the third president of Uganda from 1971 until his overthrow in 1979. An admirer of Adolf Hitler, he ruled as a military dictator and is considered one of the most brutal despots in modern world history. He is often called \"Hitler of Africa\" and his ideology draws similarity to National Socialism.\nAmin was born to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946, he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army as a cook. He rose to the rank of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels and then the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, and Amin remained in the army, rising to the position of deputy army commander in 1964 and being appointed commander two years later. He became aware that Ugandan president Milton Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, so he launched the 1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat and declared himself president.\nDuring his years in power, Amin shifted from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable support from Israel to being backed by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany. In 1972, Amin expelled Asians, a majority of whom were Indian-Ugandans, leading India to sever diplomatic relations with his regime. In 1975, Amin assumed chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), an intergovernmental organization designed to promote solidarity among African states (an annually rotating role). Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977 to 1979. The United Kingdom broke diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1977, and Amin declared that he had defeated the British and added \"CBE\" to his title for \"Conqueror of the British Empire\".\nAs Amin's rule progressed into the late 1970s, there was increased unrest against his persecution of certain ethnic groups and political dissidents, along with Uganda's very poor international standing due to Amin's support for PFLP-EO and RZ hijackers in 1976, leading to Israel's Operation Entebbe. He then attempted to annex Tanzania's Kagera Region in 1978. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere ordered his troops to invade Uganda in response. Tanzanian Army and rebel forces successfully captured Kampala in 1979 and ousted Amin from power. Amin went into exile, first in Libya, then Iraq, and finally in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death in 2003.\nAmin's rule was characterized by rampant human rights abuses including political repression and extrajudicial killings as well as nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. International observers and human rights groups estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were killed under his regime. His brutality and atrocities towards Ugandans has given him the nickname, \"The Butcher of Uganda\".\nEarly life.\nVirtually all retellings of Amin's early life are contradictory, as he did not write an autobiography and never authorized a written account of his life. British governmental records put Amin's birth year in 1925; however, no records were kept for native Ugandans at the time. In a 1972 interview with Judith Hare, Amin gives his birthplace as the village of Koboko and his age as 46, which would put his birth year as 1926. In a book published in 1977 by Little, Brown and Company and written by a British advisor in Uganda using the pseudonym David Gwyn, Amin was born in Buganda with his age given as 48, placing his birth year in 1928. The most comprehensive biography of Amin comes from his family based on oral tradition, which has some authority but its details ultimately cannot be confirmed. Family tradition and Saudi authorities in Jeddah puts his birth date as 10 Dhu al-Hijja 1346 in the Islamic calendar (30 May 1928 in the Gregorian Calendar).\nEarly childhood and family.\nAccording to Amin's family, Ugandan oral tradition, and his Saudi death certificate, Idi Amin Dada Oumee was born on 30 May 1928 around 4 a.m. in his father's workplace, the Shimoni Police Barracks in Nakasero Hill, Kampala. He was given the name Idi after his birth on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. According to Fred Guweddeko, a researcher at Makerere University, Amin's birth name was Idi Awo-Ango Angoo. There is disagreement on the meaning of the name \"Dada\", with some arguing that it meant \"sister\" or \"effeminate\" in Kiswahili, but most sources agree that \"Dada\" was a clan within the Kakwa tribe which was observed over thirteen generations.\nHe was the third son of Amin Dada Nyabira Tomuresu (1889\u20131976), an ethnic Kakwa, and his second wife, Aisha Chumaru Aate (1904\u20131970), a Lugbara. His father was christened as a Roman Catholic and born with the name Andreas Nyabira Tomuresu. According to British journalist David Martin, Nyabira spent most of his life in South Sudan. He converted to Islam in 1910 after being conscripted as a bugler by the colonial British army under his uncle, the Kakwa tribal leader Sultan Ali Kenyi Dada as a six-year-old child soldier and was given the name Amin Dada. He joined the Protectorate Police Force in Kampala's Nsambia Police Barracks in 1913.\nNyabira was forcibly conscripted into the British King's African Rifles (KAR) in 1914 where he fought in the First World War during the East African campaign in Tanganyika before being honorably discharged in 1921 and given a plot of land in Arua District. The same year, he joined the Protectorate Police Force in the Nsambia Police Barracks prior to being transferred to the Shimoni Police Barracks in 1928, where Amin was born according to his family. He was transferred to the Kololo Police Barracks and retired from the police force in 1931 and worked at the Office of the Resident District Commissioner in Arua District.\nHis mother, Aisha Aate, was born to a Kakwa mother and Lugbara father. By all accounts, Aate was a traditional healer, herbalist, and a midwife. Ten years before Amin's birth, Aate joined the Allah Water (also known as Yakani) movement, which was an anti-colonial alternative medicine congregation centered on a \"water of Yakan\" that was infused with a psychedelic daffodil plant locally known as Kamiojo, described as the \"LSD of Central Africa\". The movement was repressed by British colonial authorities, who had judged it as rebellion. Despite being largely described as a cult, Amin's family claims that Aate was a priestess in the \"Yakanye Order\" which they explained as a \"secret African society\", of which Idi Amin was also a member, that used \"sacred water and other mystical powers\" for warfare.\nAccording to Amin's family, Aate had cured Irene Drusilla Namaganda, then Queen of Buganda and wife of Daudi Cwa II of Buganda, of her infertility. Aate's high-ranking role in the Allah Water movement allegedly gained the interest of the Bugandan royal family and her alleged connection to the family led to rumours of Amin's biological father being Daudi Chwa II. These rumours were reportedly spread by Nyabira's childless senior wife, who was spiteful of Aate bearing two children.\nAccording to Amin's family, Idi Amin was given the title Awon'go (lit.\u2009'noise'), in reference to rumours about his alleged paternity. Idi was reportedly chosen to take a 'paternity test' as an infant by tribal elders, which involved abandoning him for four days in a forest near Mount Liru in Koboko where they returned to find Amin still alive. The elders attributed this apparent miracle to Nakan, a sacred seven-headed snake in Kakwa folk religion. His brother and sister died in 1932, when Idi was four years old.\nAmin's parents divorced when he was four, and most accounts suggest that he moved in with his mother's family in 1944 in the rural farming town of Mawale Parish, Luweero District, in north-western Uganda. The divorce of his parents was reportedly due to the lasting rumours regarding Idi's paternity, which angered his mother. Despite this, his family insists that he moved with his father per Muslim tradition in Tanganyika Parish, Arua District, while his mother continued to practice healing in Buganda.\nBoyhood and education.\nWhile living with his mother's relatives, Amin reportedly worked as a goat farmer from ages eight to ten. In 1938, he moved to the home of Sheikh Ahmed Hussein in the nearby town of Semuto and began memorizing the Quran through recitation until he was 12. In 1940, Amin moved to Bombo and lived with his maternal uncle, Yusuf Tanaboo. He attempted to register for primary school but was rejected, this was reportedly due to Amin's paternal Nubian heritage.\nThe same year, Amin was injured while participating in Nubian riots against discrimination at Makerere University in Wandegeya. He was enrolled in the Garaya madrasa in Bombo and continued memorizing the Quran under Mohammed Al Rajab until 1944, and reportedly won honours in recitation in 1943. Amin was conscripted by the colonial army alongside fifteen other students before being discharged for being underage.\nIn 1945, he moved to the Kiyindi Parish in Bwaise Parish and worked different odd jobs, including a stint as a doorman and concierge assistant at the Grand Imperial Hotel in Kampala.\nKing's African Rifles.\nAmin joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) in 1946 as an assistant cook, while at the same time receiving military training until 1947. In later life he falsely claimed to have served in the Burma Campaign of World War II. He was transferred to Kenya for infantry service as a private in 1947, and served in the 21st KAR infantry battalion in Gilgil, Kenya Colony until 1949. That year, his unit was deployed to northern Kenya to fight against Somali rebels. In 1952, his brigade was deployed against the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in 1953.\nIn 1959, Amin was made Effendi Class 2 (Warrant Officer), the highest possible rank for a black soldier in the KAR. Amin returned to Uganda the same year and received a short-service commission as a lieutenant on 15 July 1961, becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become commissioned officers. He was assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda's Karamojong and Kenya's Turkana nomads. According to researcher Holger Bernt Hansen, Amin's outlook, behavior and strategies of communication were strongly influenced by his experiences in the colonial military. This included his direct and hands-on leadership style which would eventually contribute to his popularity among certain parts of Ugandan society.\nRise in the Uganda Army.\nIn 1962, following Uganda's independence from the United Kingdom, Amin was promoted to captain and then, in 1963, to major. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army in 1964 and, the following year, to Commander of the Army. In 1970, he was promoted to commander of all the armed forces.\nAmin was an athlete during his time in both the British and Uganda Army. At tall and powerfully built, he was the Ugandan light heavyweight boxing champion from 1951 to 1960, as well as a swimmer. Amin was also a formidable rugby forward, although one officer said of him: \"Idi Amin is a splendid type and a good (rugby) player, but virtually bone from the neck up, and needs things explained in words of one letter\". In the 1950s, he played for Nile RFC.\nThere is a frequently repeated urban myth that he was selected as a replacement by the East Africa rugby union team for their 1955 tour match against the British Lions. Amin, however, does not appear in the team photograph or on the official team list.\nIn 1965, Prime Minister Milton Obote and Amin were implicated in a deal to smuggle ivory and gold into Uganda from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an associate of the former Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, was part of an arrangement to help troops opposed to the Congolese government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. In 1966, the Ugandan Parliament demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by Kabaka (King) Mutesa II of Buganda and declared himself executive president. He promoted Amin to colonel and army commander. Amin led an attack on the Kabaka's palace and forced Mutesa into exile to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.\nAmin began recruiting members of Kakwa, Lugbara, South Sudanese, and other ethnic groups from the West Nile area bordering South Sudan. The South Sudanese had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that Amin's army consisted mainly of South Sudanese soldiers.\nSeizure of power.\nEventually a rift developed between Amin and Obote, exacerbated by the support Amin had built within the Uganda Army by recruiting from the West Nile region (his region of origin), his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote took control of the armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of the commander of the Uganda Army.\nHaving learned that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup with the assistance of Israeli government agents on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending that year's Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin, who presented himself a soldier, not a politician, declared that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be held when the situation was normalized. He promised to release all political prisoners.\nAmin held a state funeral in April 1971 for Edward Mutesa, former king (\"kabaka\") of Buganda and president, who had died in exile.\nPresidency.\nEstablishment of military rule.\nOn 2 February 1971, one week after the coup, Amin declared himself President of Uganda, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Uganda Army Chief of Staff, and Chief of Air Staff. He suspended certain provisions of the Ugandan constitution, and soon instituted an Advisory Defense Council composed of military officers with himself as the chairman. Amin placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top posts in government and government-owned corporations, and informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military courtesy. Amin ruled by decree; over the course of his rule he issued approximately 30 decrees.\nAmin renamed the presidential lodge in Kampala from Government House to \"The Command Post\". He disbanded the General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, and replaced it with the State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at the Kampala suburb of Nakasero became the scene of torture and capital punishment over the next few years. Other agencies used to persecute dissenters included the military police and the Public Safety Unit (PSU).\nObote took refuge in Tanzania, having been offered sanctuary there by the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. Obote was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing Amin. The exiles attempted but failed to regain Uganda in 1972, through a poorly organised coup attempt.\nPersecution of ethnic and political groups.\nAmin retaliated against the attempted invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972 by purging the Uganda Army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers had been massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and at least twice as many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.\nThe killings, motivated by ethnic, political, and financial factors, continued throughout Amin's eight years in control. The exact number of people killed is unknown. The International Commission of Jurists estimated the death toll at no fewer than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. An estimate compiled by exile organizations with the help of Amnesty International puts the number killed at 500,000.\nIn his 1997 book \"State of Blood: The Inside Story of Idi Amin\", Henry Kyemba (who was a Ugandan minister for three years in Amin's cabinet) states that \"Amin's bizarre behavior derives partly from his tribal background. Like many other warrior societies, the Kakwa, Amin's tribe, are known to have practiced blood rituals on slain enemies. These involve cutting a piece of flesh from the body to subdue the dead man's spirit or tasting the victim's blood to render the spirit harmless. Such rituals still exist among the Kakwa. Amin's practices do not stop at tasting blood: on several occasions he has boasted to me and others that he has eaten human flesh.\" (Kyemba 109\u201310)\nAmong the most prominent people killed were Benedicto Kiwanuka, a former prime minister and chief justice; Janani Luwum, the Anglican archbishop; Joseph Mubiru, the former governor of the central bank of Uganda; Frank Kalimuzo, the vice-chancellor of Makerere University; Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright; and two of Amin's own cabinet ministers, Erinayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi.\nAmin recruited his followers from his own ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese, and Nubians. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 per cent of the 22 top generals and 75 per cent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 per cent and 87.5 per cent of these groups even though they were only 5 percent of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups. The Uganda Army grew from 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's military was largely a mercenary force. Half the soldiers were South Sudanese and 26 per cent Congolese, with only 24 per cent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are determined to make the ordinary Ugandan master of his own destiny and, above all, to see that he enjoys the wealth of his country. Our deliberate policy is to transfer the economic control of Uganda into the hands of Ugandans, for the first time in our country's history.\u2014\u200a\nIn August 1972, Amin declared what he called an \"economic war\", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly from the Indian subcontinent and born in the country, their ancestors having come to Uganda in search of prosperity when India was still a British colony. Many owned businesses, including large-scale enterprises, which formed the backbone of the Ugandan economy. In fact, he even referred to Asians as the \"Brown Jews\" because of their dominance in commerce and their perceived economic control. Furthermore, Amin expressed his sympathy for Hitler where he said Hitler was right for burning over six million Jews because \"the Israelis are not a people who work for humanity.\"\nOn 4 August 1972, Amin issued a decree ordering the expulsion of the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Amin claimed that he had a dream in which God told him he must expel all Asians for the welfare of Uganda. Furthermore, he believed that Asians were sabotaging the economy of Uganda. Additionally, the reasons articulated by Amin suggest a racial basis for the expulsion. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and handed them over to his supporters. Without the experienced owners and proprietors, businesses were mismanaged and many industries collapsed from lack of operational expertise and maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining Ugandan economy. At the time, Asians accounted for 90% of the country's tax revenue; with their removal, Amin's administration lost a large chunk of government revenue. The economy all but collapsed.\nIdi Amin murdered an estimated 500 Yemeni Hadrami Arab merchants.\nIn 1975, Emmanuel Bwayo Wakhweya, Amin's finance minister and longest-serving cabinet member at the time, defected to London. This prominent defection helped Henry Kyemba, Amin's health minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, to defect in 1977 and resettle in the UK. Kyemba wrote and published \"A State of Blood\", the first insider expos\u00e9 of Amin's rule.\nOn 25 June 1976, the Defense Council declared Amin president for life.\nInternational relations.\nInitially, Amin was supported by Western powers such as Israel, West Germany, and, in particular, the United Kingdom. During the late 1960s, Obote's move to the left, which included his Common Man's Charter and the nationalisation of 80 British companies, had made the West worried that he would pose a threat to Western capitalist interests in Africa and make Uganda an ally of the Soviet Union. Amin, who had served with the King's African Rifles and taken part in Britain's suppression of the Mau Mau uprising prior to Ugandan independence, was known by the British as \"intensely loyal to Britain\". This made him an obvious choice as Obote's successor. Although some have claimed that Amin was being groomed for power as early as 1966, the plotting by the British and other Western powers began in earnest in 1969, after Obote had begun his nationalization programme.\nThroughout the first year of his presidency, Amin received key military and financial support from the United Kingdom and Israel. In July 1971 he visited both countries and asked for advanced military equipment, but the states refused to provide hardware unless the Ugandan government paid for it. Amin decided to seek foreign support elsewhere and in February 1972 he visited Libya. Amin denounced Zionism, and in return Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi pledged Uganda an immediate $25 million loan to be followed by more lending from the Libyan\u2013Ugandan Development Bank. Over the following months Amin successively removed Israeli military advisers from his government, expelled all other Israeli technicians, and finally broke diplomatic relations. Gaddafi also mediated a resolution to long-standing Ugandan\u2013Sudanese tensions, with Amin agreeing to stop backing Anyanya rebels in southern Sudan and instead recruit the former guerilla fighters into his army.\nFollowing the expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 1972, most of whom were of Indian descent, India severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The same year, as part of his \"economic war\", Amin broke diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom and nationalized all British-owned businesses. The United Kingdom and Israel ceased all trade with Uganda, but this commercial gap was quickly filled by Libya, the United States, and the Soviet Union.\nThe Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev grew increasingly interested in Uganda as a strategic counterbalance to perceived Chinese influence in Tanzania and Western influence in Kenya. It dispatched a military mission to Uganda in November 1973. While it could not supply the financial level available from the Western powers, the Soviet Union opted to provide Amin with military hardware in exchange for his support. The Soviet Union quickly became Amin's largest arms supplier, sending Uganda tanks, jets, artillery, missiles, and small arms. By 1975, it was estimated that the Soviets had provided Amin's government with $12 million in economic assistance and $48 million in arms. Amin also sent several thousand Ugandans to Eastern Bloc countries for military, intelligence, and technical training, especially Czechoslovakia. East Germany was involved in the General Service Unit and the State Research Bureau, the two agencies that were most notorious for terror. During the Ugandan invasion of Tanzania in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence of its involvement with these agencies.\nIn December 1973, Amin launched a sarcastic 'Save Britain Fund' during the 1973\u20131975 recession to \"save and assist our former colonial masters from economic catastrophe\", while offering emergency food supplies and urging Ugandans to donate. In 1974, he offered to host and mediate negotiations to end the conflict in Northern Ireland, believing that Uganda's position as a former British colony made it apt to do so.\nIn June 1976, Amin allowed an Air France airliner from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolution\u00e4re Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3\u20134 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos flew in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; seven hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and one Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu (the commander of the unit), were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda. In retaliation for Kenya's assistance in the raid, Amin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda.\nUganda under Amin embarked on a large military build-up, which raised concerns in Kenya. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of Soviet-made arms \"en route\" to Uganda at the port of Mombasa. Tension between Uganda and Kenya reached its climax in February 1976, when Amin announced that he would investigate the possibility that parts of southern Sudan and western and central Kenya, up to within of Nairobi, were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The Kenyan Government responded with a stern statement that Kenya would not part with \"a single inch of territory\". Amin backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and armoured personnel carriers along the Kenya\u2013Uganda border. Amin's relations with Rwanda were tense, and during his tenure he repeatedly jeopardized its economy by denying its commercial vehicles transit to Mombasa and made multiple threats to bomb Kigali.\nWar with Tanzania and deposition.\nIn January 1977 Amin appointed General Mustafa Adrisi Vice President of Uganda. That year, a split in the Uganda Army developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to Adrisi, who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners, particularly Sudanese, from the military. The growing dissatisfaction in the Uganda Army was reflected by frequent coup attempts; Amin was even wounded during one of them, namely Operation Mafuta Mingi in June 1977. By 1978, the number of Amin's supporters and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed as a result of the years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile. In early 1978, Adrisi was severely injured in a car accident and flown to Cairo for treatment. While he was there, Amin stripped him of his positions as Minister of Defense and Minister of Home Affairs and denounced him for retiring senior prison officials without his knowledge. Amin then proceeded to purge several high-ranking officials from his government and took personal control of several ministerial portfolios. The shakeup caused political unrest and especially angered Adrisi's followers, who believed that the car accident was a failed assassination attempt.\nIn November 1978, troops loyal to Adrisi mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Fighting consequently broke out along that border, and the Uganda Army invaded Tanzanian territory under unclear circumstances. According to several experts and politicians, Amin directly ordered the invasion in an attempt to distract the Ugandan military and public from the crisis at home. Other accounts suggest, however, that Amin had lost control of parts of the Uganda Army, so Amin's sanction for the invasion was a \"post-facto\" action to save face regarding troops who had acted without his orders. In any case, Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of initiating the war against Uganda after the hostilities had erupted, and proclaimed the annexation of a section of Kagera when the Ugandan invasion initially proved to be successful. However, as Tanzania began to prepare a counter-offensive, Amin reportedly realized his precarious situation, and attempted to defuse the conflict without losing face. The Ugandan President publicly suggested that he and Nyerere participate in a boxing match which, in lieu of military action, would determine the outcome of the conflict. Nyerere ignored the message.\nIn January 1979, Nyerere mobilized the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, joined by several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, despite military help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The President reportedly made several trips abroad to other countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the war, attempting to enlist more foreign support. He made few public appearances in the final months of his rule, but spoke frequently on radio and television. Following a major defeat in the Battle of Lukaya, parts of the Uganda Army command reportedly urged Amin to step down. He angrily refused and declared: \"If you don't want to fight, I'll do it myself.\" He consequently fired chief of staff Yusuf Gowon. However, Amin was forced to flee the Ugandan capital by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. After a short-lived attempt to rally some remnants of the Uganda Army in eastern Uganda which reportedly included Amin proclaiming the city of Jinja his country's new capital, he fled into exile. By the time of his removal from power, Amin had become deeply unpopular in Uganda. The symbols of his rule, his pictures, and buildings associated with him were subject to vandalism during and after the war.\nBounty.\nUpon Amin's fleeing into exile, the October 1979 issue of \"Soldier of Fortune\" Magazine offered a bounty of $10,000 in gold to anyone providing information that leads to the capture alive of the former President of Uganda, Idi Amin. Robert K. Brown, the magazine's publisher was quoted as saying \u201cWe take exception to the kind of individual Amin is. He should be brought to trial and, after being tried by a jury of his peers, punished.\u201d \nExile.\nAmin first escaped to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for staying out of politics. Amin lived for a number of years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin on 4 June 1980, and secured the first interview with him since his deposition. While in exile, Amin funded remnants of his army that fought in the Ugandan Bush War. Though he continued to be a controversial figure, some of Amin's former followers as well as several rebel groups continued to fight in his name for decades and occasionally advocated for his amnesty and even his restoration to the Ugandan Presidency. During interviews he gave during his exile in Saudi Arabia, Amin held that Uganda needed him and never expressed remorse for the brutal nature of his regime.\nIn January 1989, Amin left his exile without authorization by the Saudi Arabian government and flew alongside one of his sons to Zaire. There, he intended to mobilize a rebel force to reconquer Uganda which was engulfed in another civil war at the time. The rest of his family stayed in Jeddah. Despite using a false Zairean passport, Amin was easily recognized upon arriving with Air Za\u00efre at N'djili Airport and promptly arrested by Zairean security forces. The Zairean government reacted unfavorably to Amin's arrival and attempted to expel him from the country. At first, Saudi Arabia refused to allow him to return, as its government was deeply offended that he had \"abused their hospitality\" by leaving without permission, and doing so for political reasons. The Zairean government wanted neither to extradite Amin to Uganda where the ex-president faced murder charges nor keep him in Zaire, thereby straining international relations. As a result, Amin was initially expelled to Senegal from where he was supposed to be sent to Saudi Arabia, but the Senegalese government sent him back to Zaire when Saudi Arabia continued to refuse Amin a visa. Following appeals by Moroccan King Hassan II, the Saudi Arabian government finally relented and allowed Amin to return. In return, Amin had to promise to never again participate in any political or military activities, nor give interviews. He consequently spent the remainder of his life in Saudi Arabia.\nIn the final years of his life, Amin reportedly ate a fruitarian diet. His daily consumption of oranges earned him the nickname \"Dr Jaffa\" among Saudi Arabians.\nIllness and death.\nOn 19 July 2003, Amin's fourth wife, Nalongo Madina, reported that he was in a coma and near death at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from kidney failure. She pleaded with the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, to allow him to return to Uganda for the remainder of his life. Museveni replied that Amin would have to \"answer for his sins the moment he was brought back\". Amin's family eventually decided to disconnect life support and Amin consequently died at the hospital in Jeddah on 16 August 2003. He was buried in Ruwais Cemetery in Jeddah in a simple grave, without any fanfare.\nAfter Amin's death, David Owen revealed that during his term as the British Foreign Secretary (1977 to 1979), he had proposed having Amin assassinated. He has defended this, arguing: \"I'm not ashamed of considering it, because his regime goes down in the scale of Pol Pot as one of the worst of all African regimes\".\nFamily and associates.\nIdi Amin married at least six women, three of whom he divorced. He married his first wife, Malyamu, in March 1962 and his second wife, Kay, in May 1966. In 1967, he married Nora, and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he announced on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Kay and Nora. Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya. In 1974, Kay Amin died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered. Nora fled to Zaire in 1979; her current whereabouts are unknown.\nIn July 1975, Amin staged a \u00a32million wedding to 19-year-old Sarah Kyolaba, a go-go dancer with the \"Revolutionary Suicide Mechanised Regiment Band\", nicknamed \"Suicide Sarah\". The wedding was held during the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit meeting in Kampala, and the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, served as Amin's best man. Before she met Amin, Sarah was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he vanished and it is not clear if he was beheaded, or detained after fleeing to Kenya. The couple had four children and enjoyed rally race driving Amin's Citro\u00ebn SM, with Sarah as navigator. Sarah was a hairdresser in Tottenham when she died in 2015.\nBy 1993, Amin was living with the last nine of his children and one wife, Mama a Chumaru, the mother of the youngest four of his children. His last known child, daughter Iman, was born in 1992. According to the \"Daily Monitor\", Amin married again a few months before his death in 2003.\nAmin fathered as many as 60 children. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Amin's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal Security Organisation. Another of Amin's sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected.\nSarah Kyolaba's third child, Faisal Wangita (born in 1983 in Uganda; according to himself born in 1981 in Saudi Arabia) was involved in a brutal gang murder in Camden, North London, in 2006. In connection with this, he was sentenced to five years' detention in 2007, for conspiracy to wound, conspiracy to possess offensive weapons and violent disorder. He had been convicted for possession of offensive weapons, theft and fraud in the years before.\nIn early 2007, the award-winning film \"The Last King of Scotland\" prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar Amin said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin's 40 official children by seven official wives.\nAmong Amin's closest associates was the Briton Bob Astles. Isaac Maliyamungu was an instrumental affiliate and one of the more feared officers in Amin's army.\nCharacter.\nNicknames.\nOver the course of his career, Amin gained numerous nicknames, many of them derogatory:\nErratic behavior, self-bestowed titles and media portrayal.\nAs the years progressed, Amin's behavior became more erratic, unpredictable, and strident. After the United Kingdom broke off all diplomatic relations with his regime in 1977, Amin declared that he had defeated the British, and he conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). His full self-bestowed title ultimately became: \"His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular\", in addition to his officially stated claim of being the uncrowned king of Scotland. He never received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) or the Military Cross (MC). He conferred a doctorate of law on himself from Makerere University as well as the Victorious Cross (VC), a medal made to emulate the British Victoria Cross.\nAmin became the subject of rumours, including a widespread belief that he was a cannibal. Amin reportedly also boasted that he kept the severed heads of political enemies in his freezer, although he said that human flesh was generally \"too salty\" for his taste.\nDuring Amin's time in power, popular media outside of Uganda often portrayed him as an essentially comic and eccentric figure. Julius Harris emphasized Amin's allegedly clownish side in \"Victory at Entebbe\", while Yaphet Kotto drew more praise for projecting Amin's sinister nature in \"Raid on Entebbe\". In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a \"Time\" magazine article described him as a \"killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet\". The comedy-variety series \"Saturday Night Live\" aired four Amin sketches between 1976 and 1979, including one in which he was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease. In 1979, radio host Don Imus made multiple on-air telephone calls in an attempt to talk to Amin, and later hosted a phony interview with him that was deemed \"very dirty\". In a \"Benny Hill Show\" episode transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed Amin sitting behind a desk that featured a placard reading \"ME TARZAN, U GANDA\".\nThe foreign media were often criticized by Ugandan exiles and defectors for emphasizing Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior. Other commentators even suggested that Amin had deliberately cultivated his eccentric reputation in the foreign media as an easily parodied buffoon in order to defuse international concern over his administration of Uganda. Ugandan soldier and rebel Patrick Kimumwe argued that Amin's \"clowning conceal[ed] a ruthless extinction of human rights\" in Uganda. Journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey wrote, \"facile explanations of Amin's regime, as either a one-man show or a lawless and ruthless band of killers, do not get at the heart of the power structure.\"\nLegacy.\nGender historian Alicia Decker wrote that the \"deeply embedded culture of militarism in Uganda is undoubtedly Amin's most enduring legacy.\" In the immediate aftermath of his deposition, war correspondent Al J Venter stated that Ugandans still spoke about Amin \"with a certain amount of awe, now laced with venom\". His reputation in Uganda has been viewed over the decades following his rule in more complex ways than in the international community. Some Ugandans have praised him as a \"patriot\" and supported his decision to expel Asians from the country. At the time of his death, he was particularly well-regarded in north-western Uganda. One of Amin's sons, Jaffar Remo, criticized the negative public perception of his father and called for a commission to investigate the veracity of the abuses committed under his rule.\nIn popular culture.\nDuring the 1970s, while Amin was at the height of his infamy, British comic actor John Bird starred on the album \"The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin\", with lyrics based on Alan Coren's anti-Amin \"Punch\" columns. In 1975 the satirical single \"Amazin' Man\", from the album, was released on the Transatlantic label. The record stayed for 12 weeks in the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number 26.\nA 1974 documentary film \"\" by director Barbet Schroeder was made with the support and participation of Idi Amin. \"Rise and Fall of Idi Amin\" (1981) is a Kenyan film that details the history of Idi Amin's reign. This film popularized many rumours about Amin's brutality, such as his alleged mutilation of one of his wives. Amin is played by Joseph Olita, who reprised this role in \"Mississippi Masala\" (1991), a film about romance between African and Asian-Americans following Amin's 1972 expulsion of Asians from Uganda.\nAmin is the subject of English journalist Giles Foden's novel \"The Last King of Scotland\" (1998), which focuses on Idi Amin's Uganda through the eyes of a young Scottish physician. The book was adapted into a 2006 feature film, starring Forest Whitaker as Amin. For his performance, Whitaker was named the Best Lead Actor at the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Movie Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70843", "revid": "48176176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70843", "title": "Hafez al-Assad", "text": "President of Syria (1971\u20132000)\nHafez al-Assad (6 October 1930\u00a0\u2013 10 June 2000) was a Syrian politician and military officer who served as the president of Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000. He was previously the prime minister from 1970 to 1971 as well as the regional secretary of the regional command of the Syrian regional branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and secretary general of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party from 1970 to 2000. Assad was a key participant in the 1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat, which brought the Syrian regional branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party to power in the country, a power that lasted until the fall of the regime in 2024, then led by his son Bashar.\nAfter the 1963 coup, the new leadership appointed Assad as the commander of the Syrian Air Force. In February 1966 Assad participated in a second coup, which toppled the traditional leaders of the Ba'ath Party. Assad was appointed defence minister by the new government. Four years later Assad initiated a third coup, which ousted Marxist regime of Salah Jadid, and appointed himself as leader of Syria. Assad imposed various changes to the Ba'athist foreign policy after seizing power, such as abandoning Salah Jadid's policy of exporting \"socialist revolution\" and strengthening Syria's foreign relations with countries that his predecessor had deemed \"reactionary\". Assad made an alliance with the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War in return for support against Israel, while keeping ties with many Western European &amp; Gulf Arabian countries. While he officially kept the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one \u201cArab nation\u201d as he termed it, such as being part of the Federation of Arab Republics, he sought to paint Syria as the defender of the Palestinians against Israel. \nAssad quickly consolidated his power. Right after Nasser\u2019s death, he sought to reconciliate Syria with the other Arab countries, which have been harmed under Jadid\u2019s rule. He also tried to form new ties with countries from both camps in the Cold War. As a result, he got economic support from OPEC members during the Oil embargo, as a show of support to his war against Israel in 1973, the October War. While Syria remained a one-party system, Ba'athist decision-making authority that had previously been collegial was reduced in favour of empowering the president\u2019s absolute control over the country. To maintain his personalistic rule, a cult of personality centred on Assad and his family was created by the president and the Ba'ath party. Assad ordered an Arabization campaign on Kurdish areas of Syria and started intervention in Lebanon in 1976, which resulted in the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. During his rule, his regime crushed an Islamist uprising led by the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood rebels through a series of crackdowns culminating in the Hama massacre, which led to two thirds of the city of Hama being destroyed. His regime was accused of numerous human rights violations, including opening prison death camps.\nAssad's initial preferred successor as president was his brother Rifaat, but Rifaat attempted to seize power in 1983\u20131984 when Hafez had a health scare and he was subsequently exiled. Assad's next choice of successor was his eldest son, Bassel. However, Bassel died in a highspeed car crash in 1994, and Assad turned to his third choice\u2014his younger son Bashar, who at that time was a medical student in the UK, with no political experience. The move to appoint a member of his own family as his successor was met with criticism in some quarters of the Syrian ruling class, but Assad persisted with his plan and demoted officials who opposed this succession. Assad died in June 2000 and Bashar succeeded him as president, serving until he was overthrown in December 2024.\nEarly life, education and early career.\nEarly life.\nHafez al-Assad was born on 6 October 1930, in Qardaha, a town in the north-west of Syria. He was born into a poor Alawite peasants family belonging to the Kalbiyya tribe of Alawites. Later, Assad recalled at the congresses of the Peasants' General Union: \"I had a passion for threshing the harvest... But I took part in all the phases of farming..., lived your emotions and understand what your life signifies. I still have mental pictures of the injustices of the time. No matter how far the past sinks away, it is necessary to keep these images alive in our minds, not to nurse hatred against anyone but to see into them, for what we endured forms an essential part of the way we view things and of the foundation on which we build the present and the future.\" \nHis paternal grandfather, Sulayman al-Wahhish, gained the nickname \"al-Wahhish\" (wild beast) for his strength. Hafez al-Assad's parents were Na'isa Shalish and Ali al-Assad. His father married twice and had eleven children. Hafez was his ninth son and the fourth from his second marriage.\nBy the 1920s, Ali was respected locally and was initially opposed to the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, a French-ruled League of Nations mandate officially established in 1923. Nevertheless, Ali Sulayman later cooperated with the French administration and was appointed to an official post. Local residents called him \"al-Assad\" (the lion) for his accomplishments and, in 1927, he made the nickname his surname.\nEducation and early political career.\nAlawites initially opposed a united Syrian state (since they thought their status as a religious minority would endanger them). After the French left Syria in 1946, many Syrians mistrusted the Alawites because of their alignment with France. Assad left his Alawite village, beginning his education at the age of nine in Sunni-dominated Latakia. He became the first in his family to attend high school, but in Latakia, Assad faced anti-Alawite bias from Sunnis. He was an excellent student, winning several prizes at around the age of 14. Assad lived in a poor, predominantly Alawite part of Latakia; he even had to interrupt his studies for a while, since his father did not have enough money to pay for it (but later he was able to return). to fit in, he approached political parties that welcomed Alawites. These parties (which also espoused secularism) were the Syrian Communist Party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) and the Arab Ba'ath Party; Assad joined the Ba'ath in 1946, whereas some of his friends belonged to the SSNP. The Ba'ath (Renaissance) Party espoused a pan-Arabist, socialist ideology.\nAssad proved an asset to the party, organizing Ba'ath student cells and carrying the party's message to the poor sections of Latakia and to Alawite villages. He was opposed by the Muslim Brotherhood, which allied itself with wealthy and conservative Sunni Muslim families. Assad's high school accommodated students from rich and poor families, and Assad was joined by poor, anti-establishment Sunni Muslim youth from the Ba'ath Party in confrontations with students from wealthy Brotherhood families. He made many Sunni friends, some of whom later became his political allies.\nWhile still a teenager, Assad became increasingly prominent in the party as an organizer and recruiter, head of his school's student-affairs committee from 1949 to 1951 and president of the Union of Syrian Students. During his political activism in school, he met many men who would later serve him when he became president. Thanks to Assad and his comrades, the regional Ba'ath Party branch, through demonstrations and boycotts, succeeded in nationalizing the formerly French-controlled tobacco company \"La Compagnie Libano-Syrienne des Tabacs,\" also known as R\u00f4gie, in 1951. The company had already earned the hatred of the residents of Latakia for its total control over the most profitable and fertile lands, control over prices for its products, and its monopoly.\nAir Force career: 1950\u20131958.\nAfter graduating from high school, Assad aspired to be a medical doctor, but his father could not pay for his study at the Jesuit Saint Joseph University in Beirut. Instead, in 1950, he decided to join the Syrian Armed Forces. Assad entered the Homs Military Academy, which offered free food, lodging and a stipend. He wanted to fly, and entered the flying school in Aleppo in 1950.\nAssad graduated in 1955, after which he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Syrian Air Force. Upon graduation from flying school, he won a best-aviator trophy, and shortly afterwards was assigned to the Mezzeh air base near Damascus. He married Anisa Makhlouf in 1957, a distant relative of the powerful Makhlouf family.\nIn 1955, the military split in a revolt against President Adib Shishakli. Hashim al-Atassi, head of the National Bloc and briefly president after Sami al-Hinnawi's coup, returned as president and Syria was again under civilian rule. After 1955, Atassi's hold on the country was increasingly shaky. As a result of the 1955 election, Atassi was replaced by Shukri al-Quwatli, who was president before Syria's independence from France. The Ba'ath Party grew closer to the Communist Party not because of shared ideology, but a shared opposition to the West. At the academy, Assad met Mustafa Tlass, his future minister of Defence.\nIn 1955, Assad was sent to Egypt for a further six months of training. When Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal in 1956, Syria feared retaliation from the United Kingdom, and Assad flew in an air-defense mission. He was among the Syrian pilots who flew to Cairo to show Syria's commitment to Egypt. After finishing a course in Egypt the following year, Assad returned to a small airbase near Damascus. During the Suez Crisis, he also flew a reconnaissance mission over northern and eastern Syria. In 1957, as squadron commander, Assad was sent to the Soviet Union for training in flying MiG-17s. He spent ten months in the Soviet Union, during which he fathered a daughter (who died as an infant while he was abroad) with his wife.\nIn 1958, Syria and Egypt formed the United Arab Republic (UAR), separating themselves from Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey (who were aligned with the United Kingdom). This pact led to the rejection of Communist influence in favour of Egyptian control over Syria. All Syrian political parties (including the Ba'ath Party) were dissolved, and senior officers\u2014especially those who supported the Communists\u2014were dismissed from the Syrian armed forces. Assad, however, remained in the military and rose quickly through the ranks. After reaching the rank of captain, he was transferred to Egypt, continuing his military education with the future president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak.\nRunup to 1963 coup: 1958\u20131963.\nAssad was not content with a professional military career, regarding it rather as a gateway to politics. After the creation of the UAR, Ba'ath Party leader Michel Aflaq was forced by Nasser to dissolve the party. During the UAR's existence, the Ba'ath Party experienced a crisis for which several of its members\u2014mostly young\u2014blamed Aflaq. To resurrect the Syrian Regional Branch of the party, Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid, Assad and others established the Military Committee. In 1957\u201358 Assad rose to a dominant position in the Military Committee, which mitigated his transfer to Egypt. After Syria left the UAR in September 1961, Assad and other Ba'athist officers were removed from the military by the new government in Damascus, and he was given a minor clerical position at the Ministry of Transport.\nAssad played a minor role in the failed 1962 military coup, for which he was jailed in Lebanon and later repatriated. That year, Aflaq convened the 5th National Congress of the Ba'ath Party (where he was re-elected as the Secretary-General of the National Command) and ordered the re-establishment of the party's Syrian Regional Branch. At the Congress, the Military Committee (through Umran) established contacts with Aflaq and the civilian leadership. The committee requested permission to seize power by force, and Aflaq agreed to the conspiracy. After the success of the Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat led by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to launch a Ba'athist military coup in March 1963 against President Nazim al-Qudsi (which Assad helped plan).\nThe coup was scheduled for 7 March, but postponed until the next day. During the coup Assad led a small group to capture the Dumayr airbase, northeast of Damascus. His group was the only one that encountered resistance. Some planes at the base were ordered to bomb the conspirators, and because of this Assad hurried to reach the base before dawn. Because the 70th Armored Brigade's surrender took longer than anticipated, however, he arrived in broad daylight. When Assad threatened the base commander with shelling, the commander negotiated a surrender; Assad later claimed that the base could have withstood his forces.\nEarly Ba'ath Party rule: 1963\u20131970.\nAflaqite leadership: 1963\u20131966.\nMilitary work.\nNot long after Assad's election to the Regional Command, the Military Committee ordered him to strengthen the committee's position in the military establishment. Assad may have received the most important job of all, since his primary goal was to end factionalism in the Syrian military and make it a Ba'ath monopoly; as he said, he had to create an \"ideological army\". To help with this task, Assad recruited Zaki al-Arsuzi, who indirectly (through Wahib al-Ghanim) inspired him to join the Ba'ath Party when he was young. Arsuzi accompanied Assad on tours of military camps, where Arsuzi lectured the soldiers on Ba'athist thought. In gratitude for his work, Assad gave Arsuzi a government pension. Assad continued his Ba'athification of the military by appointing loyal officers to key positions and ensuring that the \"political education of the troops was not neglected\". He demonstrated his skill as a patient planner during this period. As Patrick Seale wrote, Assad's mastery of detail \"suggested the mind of an intelligence officer\".\nAssad was in charge of the Syrian Air Force. By the end of 1964 he was named commander of the Air Force, with the rank of major general. Assad gave privileges to Air Force officers, appointed his confidants to senior and sensitive positions and established an efficient intelligence network. Air Force Intelligence, under the command of Muhammad al-Khuli, became independent of Syria's other intelligence organizations and received assignments beyond Air Force jurisdiction. Assad prepared himself for an active role in the power struggles that lay ahead.\nPower struggle and 1966 coup.\nIn the aftermath of the 1963 coup, at the First Regional Congress (held 5 September 1963) Assad was elected to the Syrian Regional Command (the highest decision-making body in the Syrian Regional Branch). While not a leadership role, it was Assad's first appearance in national politics; in retrospect, he said he positioned himself \"on the left\" in the Regional Command. Khalid al-Falhum, a Palestinian who would later work for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), met Assad in 1963; he noted that Assad was a strong leftist \"but was clearly not a communist\", committed instead to Arab nationalism.\nDuring the 1964 Hama riot, Assad voted to suppress the uprising violently if needed. The decision to suppress the Hama riot led to a schism in the Military Committee between Muhammad Umran and Jadid. Umran opposed force, instead wanting the Ba'ath Party to create a coalition with other pan-Arab forces. Jadid desired a strong one-party state, similar to those in the communist countries of Europe. Assad, as a junior partner, kept quiet at first but eventually allied himself with Jadid. Why Assad chose to side with him has been widely discussed; he probably shared Jadid's radical ideological outlook. Having lost his footing on the Military Committee, Umran aligned himself with Aflaq and the National Command; he told them that the Military Committee was planning to seize power in the party by ousting them. Because of Umran's defection, Rifaat al-Assad (Hafez's brother) succeeded Umran as commander of a secret military force tasked with protecting Military Committee loyalists.\nIn its bid to seize power the Military Committee allied themselves with the regionalists, a group of cells in the Syrian Regional Branch that refused to disband in 1958 when ordered to do so. Although Aflaq considered these cells traitors, Assad called them the \"true cells of the party\"; this again highlighted differences between the Military Committee and the National Command headed by Aflaq. At the Eighth National Congress in 1965 Assad was elected to the National Command, the party's highest decision-making body. From his position as part of the National Command, Assad informed Jadid on its activities. After the congress, the National Command dissolved the Syrian Regional Command; Aflaq proposed Salah al-Din al-Bitar as prime minister, but Assad and Brahim Makhous opposed Bitar's nomination. According to Seale, Assad abhorred Aflaq; he considered him an autocrat and a rightist, accusing him of \"ditching\" the party by ordering the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958. Assad, who also disliked Aflaq's supporters, nevertheless opposed a show of force against the Aflaqites. In response to the imminent coup Assad, Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh left for London.\nIn the 1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat, the Military Committee overthrew the National Command. The coup led to a permanent schism in the Ba'ath movement, the advent of neo-Ba'athism and the establishment of two centers of the international Ba'athist movement: one Iraqi- and the other Syrian-dominated.\nJadid as strongman: 1966\u20131970.\nBeginning.\nAfter the coup, Assad was appointed Minister of Defense. This was his first cabinet post, and through his position, he would be thrust into the forefront of the Syrian\u2013Israeli conflict. His government was radically socialist, and sought to remake society from top to bottom. Although Assad was a radical, he opposed the headlong rush for change. Despite his title, he had little power in the government and took more orders than he issued. Jadid was the undisputed leader at the time, opting to remain in the office of Assistant Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command instead of taking executive office (which had historically been held by Sunnis). Nureddin al-Atassi was given three of the four top executive positions in the country: President, Secretary-General of the National Command and Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command. The post of prime minister was given to Yusuf Zu'ayyin. Jadid (who was establishing his authority) focused on civilian issues and gave Assad \"de facto\" control of the Syrian military, considering him no threat.\nDuring the failed coup d'\u00e9tat of late 1966, Salim Hatum tried to overthrow Jadid's government. Hatum (who felt snubbed when he was not appointed to the Regional Command after the February 1966 coup d'\u00e9tat) sought revenge and the return to power of Hammud al-Shufi, the first Regional Secretary of the Regional Command after the Syrian Regional Branch's re-establishment in 1963. When Jadid, Atassi and Regional Command member Jamil Shayya visited Suwayda, forces loyal to Hatum surrounded the city and captured them. In a twist of fate, the city's Druze elders forbade the murder of their guests and demanded that Hatum wait. Jadid and the others were placed under house arrest, with Hatum planning to kill them at his first opportunity. When word of the mutiny spread to the Ministry of Defense, Assad ordered the 70th Armored Brigade to the city. By this time Hatum, a Druze, knew that Assad would order the bombardment of Suwayda (a Druze-dominated city) if Hatum did not accede to his demands. Hatum and his supporters fled to Jordan, where they were given asylum. How Assad learned about the conspiracy is unknown, but Mustafa al-Hajj Ali (head of military intelligence) may have telephoned the Ministry of Defense. Due to his prompt action, Assad earned Jadid's gratitude.\nIn the aftermath of the attempted coup Assad and Jadid purged the party's military organization, removing 89 officers; Assad removed an estimated 400 officers, Syria's largest military purge to date. The purges, which began when the Ba'ath Party took power in 1963, had left the military weak. As a result, when the Six-Day War broke out, Syria had no chance of victory.\nSeizing power.\nThe Arab defeat in the Six-Day War, in which Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, provoked a furious quarrel among Syria's leadership. The civilian leadership blamed military incompetence, and the military responded by criticizing the civilian leadership (led by Jadid). Several high-ranking party members demanded Assad's resignation, and an attempt was made to vote him out of the Regional Command, the party's highest decision-making body. The motion was defeated by one vote, with Abd al-Karim al-Jundi (who the anti-Assad members hoped would succeed Assad as defense minister) voting, as Patrick Seale put it, \"in a comradely gesture\" to retain him. Assad's failure as defense minister in the war was linked to his still-insufficient qualifications - after all, he got the job rather because he was considered a reliable ally of Jadid: in addition, the horrific weakness of the Syrian army left no chance of victory. During the end of the war, the party leadership freed Aflaqites Umran, Amin al-Hafiz and Mansur al-Atrash from prison. Shortly after his release, Assad was approached by dissident Syrian military officers to oust the government; he refused, believing that a coup at that time would have helped Israel, but not Syria.\nThe war was a turning point for Assad (and Ba'athist Syria in general), and his attempted ouster began a power struggle with Jadid for control of the country. Until then Assad had not shown ambition for high office, arousing little suspicion in others. From the 1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat to the Six-Day War in 1967, Assad did not play a leading role in politics and was usually overshadowed by his contemporaries. As Patrick Seale wrote, he was \"apparently content to be a solid member of the team without the aspiration to become number one\". Although Jadid was slow to see Assad's threat, shortly after the war Assad began developing a network in the military and promoted friends and close relatives to high positions.\nDifferences with Jadid.\nAssad believed that Syria's defeat in the Six-Day War was Jadid's fault, and the accusations against himself were unjust. By this time Jadid had total control of the Regional Command, whose members supported his policies. Assad and Jadid began to differ on policy; Assad believed that Jadid's policy of a people's war (an armed-guerrilla strategy) and class struggle had failed Syria, undermining its position. Although Jadid continued to champion the concept of a people's war even after the Six-Day War, Assad opposed it. He felt that the Palestinian guerrilla fighters had been given too much autonomy and had raided Israel constantly, which in turn sparked the war. Jadid had broken diplomatic relations with countries he deemed reactionary, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Because of this, Syria did not receive aid from other Arab countries. Egypt and Jordan, which participated in the war, received \u00a3135\u00a0million per year for an undisclosed period.\nWhile Jadid and his supporters prioritised socialism and the \"internal revolution\", Assad wanted the leadership to focus on foreign policy and the containment of Israel. The Ba'ath Party was divided over several issues, such as how the government could best use Syria's limited resources, the ideal relationship between the party and the people, the organization of the party and whether the class struggle should end. These subjects were discussed heatedly in Ba'ath Party conclaves, and when they reached the Fourth Regional Congress the two sides were irreconcilable.\nAssad wanted to \"democratize\" the party by making it easier for people to join. Jadid was wary of too large a membership, believing that the majority of those who joined were opportunists. Assad, in an interview with Patrick Seale in the 1980s, stated that such a policy would make Party members believe they were a privileged class. Another problem, Assad believed, was the lack of local government institutions. Under Jadid, there was no governmental level below the Council of Ministers (the Syrian government). When the Iraqi Regional Branch (which continued to support the Aflaqite leadership) took control of Iraq in the 17 July Revolution, Assad was one of the few high-level politicians wishing to reconcile with them; he called for the establishment of an \"Eastern Front\" with Iraq against Israel in 1968. Jadid's foreign policy towards the Soviet Union was also criticised by Assad, who believed it had failed. In many ways the relationship between the countries was poor, with the Soviets refusing to acknowledge Jadid's scientific socialism and Soviet newspapers calling him a \"hothead\". Assad, on the contrary, called for greater pragmatism in decision-making.\n\"Duality of power\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt a meeting someone raised the case of X. Should he not be brought back? Assad gave the questioner a hard look but said nothing. A little later the subject came up again and this time Assad said: I've heard something disagreeable about this officer. When he was on a course in England in 1954, his brother wrote asking for help for their sick mother. X took a \u00a35 note out of his pocket, held it up and said he wouldn't part with it to save her life. Anyone who can't be loyal to his mother is not going to be loyal to the air force.\n\u2014General Fu'ad Kallas on the importance in which Assad laid on personal loyalty\nThe conflict between Assad and Jadid became the talk of the army and the party, with a \"duality of power\" noted between them. Shortly after the failed attempt to expel Assad from the Regional Command, he began to consolidate his position in the military establishment\u2014for example, by replacing Chief of Staff Ahmad al-Suwaydani with his friend Mustafa Tlass. Although Suwaydani's relationship with Jadid had deteriorated, he was removed because of his complaints about \"Alawi influence in the army\". Tlass was later appointed Assad's Deputy Minister of Defense (his second-in-command). Others removed from their positions were Ahmad al-Mir (a founder and former member of the Military Committee, and former commander of the Golan Front) and Izzat Jadid (a close supporter of Jadid and commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade).\nBy the Fourth Regional Congress and Tenth National Congress in September and October 1968, Assad had extended his grip on the army, and Jadid still controlled the party. At both congresses, Assad was outvoted on most issues, and his arguments were firmly rejected. While he failed in most of his attempts, he had enough support to remove two socialist theoreticians (Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Brahim Makhous) from the Regional Command. However, the military's involvement in party politics was unpopular with the rank and file; as the gulf between Assad and Jadid widened, the civilian and military party bodies were forbidden to contact each other. Despite this, Assad was winning the race to accumulate power. As Munif ar-Razzaz (ousted in the 1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat) noted, \"Jadid's fatal mistake was to attempt to govern the army through the party\".\nWhile Assad had taken control of the armed forces through his position as Minister of Defense, Jadid still controlled the security and intelligence sectors through Abd al-Karim al-Jundi (head of the National Security Bureau). Jundi\u2014a paranoid, cruel man\u2014was feared throughout Syria. In February 1969, the Assad-Jadid conflict erupted in violent clashes through their respective proteges: Rifaat al-Assad (Hafez's brother and a high-ranking military commander) and Jundi. The reason for the violence was Rifaat al-Assad's suspicion that Jundi was planning an attempt on Assad's life. The suspected assassin was interrogated and confessed under torture. Acting on this information, Rifaat al-Assad argued that unless Jundi was removed from his post he and his brother were in danger.\nFrom 25 to 28 February 1969, the Assad brothers initiated \"something just short of a coup\". Under Assad's authority, tanks were moved into Damascus and the staffs of \"al-Ba'ath\" and \"al-Thawra\" (two-party newspapers) and radio stations in Damascus and Aleppo were replaced with Assad loyalists. Latakia and Tartus, two Alawite-dominated cities, saw \"fierce scuffles\" ending with the overthrow of Jadid's supporters from local posts. Shortly afterwards, a wave of arrests of Jundi loyalists began. On 2 March, after a telephone argument with head of military intelligence Ali Duba, Jundi committed suicide. When Zu'ayyin heard the news he wept, saying \"we are all orphaned now\" (referring to his and Jadid's loss of their protector). Despite his rivalry with Jundi, Assad is said to have also wept when he heard the news.\nAssad was now in control, but he hesitated to push his advantage. Jadid continued to rule Syria, and the Regional Command was unchanged. However, Assad influenced Jadid to moderate his policies. Class struggle was muted, criticism of reactionary tendencies of other Arab states ceased, some political prisoners were freed, a coalition government was formed (with the Ba'ath Party in control) and the Eastern Front espoused by Assad was formed with Iraq and Jordan. Jadid's isolationist policies were curtailed, and Syria re-established diplomatic relations with many of its foes. Around this time, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Houari Boumediene's Algeria and Ba'athist Iraq began sending emissaries to reconcile Assad and Jadid.\n1970 Coup d\u2019etat.\nAssad began planning to seize power shortly after the failed Syrian military intervention in the Black September, a power struggle between the PLO and the Hashemite monarchy. While Assad had been in \"de facto\" command of Syrian politics since 1969, Jadid and his supporters still held the trappings of power. After attending Nasser's funeral, Assad returned to Syria for the Emergency National Congress (held on 30 October). At the congress Assad was condemned by Jadid and his supporters, the majority of the party's delegates. However, before attending the congress Assad ordered his loyal troops to surround the building housing the meeting. Criticism of Assad's political position continued in a defeatist tone, with the majority of delegates believing that Assad had lost the battle. Assad and Tlass were stripped of their government posts at the congress; these acts had little practical significance.\nWhen the National Congress ended on 12 November 1970, Assad ordered loyalists to arrest leading members of Jadid's government. Although many mid-level officials were offered posts in Syrian embassies abroad, Jadid refused: \"If I ever take power, you will be dragged through the streets until you die.\" Assad imprisoned him in Mezze prison until his death. The coup was calm and bloodless; the only evidence of change to the outside world was the disappearance of newspapers, radio and television stations. A Temporary Regional Command was soon established, and on 16 November the new government published its first decree.\nPremiership and presidency: 1970\u20132000.\nDomestic events and policies.\nConsolidating power.\nAssad quickly and successfully consolidated his power in what became known as Assadization. Assad was able to do it thanks to Al-Jama'a, an informal group of Assadist men that formed in the 1960s and remained loyal to Assad, helping him rise to the very top of power. According to Patrick Seale, Assad's rule \"began with an immediate and considerable advantage: the government he displaced was so detested that any alternative came as a relief\". He first tried to establish national unity, which he felt had been lost under the leadership of Aflaq and Jadid. Assad differed from his predecessor at the outset, visiting local villages and hearing citizen complaints. The Syrian people felt that Assad's rise to power would lead to change; one of his first acts as ruler was to visit Sultan al-Atrash, father of the Aflaqite Ba'athist Mansur al-Atrash, to honor his efforts during the Great Arab Revolution. He made overtures to the Writers' Union, rehabilitating those who had been forced underground, jailed or sent into exile for representing what radical Ba'athists called the reactionary classes: \"I am determined that you shall no longer feel strangers in your own country.\" Although Assad did not democratize the country, he eased the government's repressive policies. Assad was approved as president in a referendum on 12 March 1971 and was formally inaugurated on 14 March. He became the only ruler of Syria who came from a peasant family, which added to his initial popular support. In later years, Assad often cited his peasant origins as evidence of his closeness to the people, especially when he was attacked by his opponents.\nHe cut prices for basic foodstuffs 15 percent, which won him support from ordinary citizens. He lived in a modest house and worked 15 hours a day. Jadid's security services were purged, some military criminal investigative powers were transferred to the police, and the confiscation of goods under Jadid was reversed. Restrictions on travel to and trade with Lebanon were eased, and Assad encouraged growth in the private sector. While Assad supported most of Jadid's policies, he proved more pragmatic after he came to power. \nMost of Jadid's supporters faced a choice: continue working for the Ba'ath government under Assad, or face repression. Assad made it clear from the beginning \"that there would be no second chances\". However, later in 1970, he recruited support from the Ba'athist old guard who had supported Aflaq's leadership during the 1963\u20131966 power struggle. An estimated 2,000 former Ba'athists rejoined the party after hearing Assad's appeal, among them party ideologist Georges Saddiqni and Shakir al-Fahham, a secretary of the founding, 1st National Congress of the Ba'ath Party in 1947. Assad ensured that they would not defect to the pro-Aflaqite Ba'ath Party in Iraq with the Treason Trials in 1971, in which he prosecuted Aflaq, Amin al-Hafiz and nearly 100 followers (most \"in absentia\"). The few who were convicted were not imprisoned long, and the trials were primarily symbolic.\nAt the 11th National Congress, Assad assured party members that his leadership was a radical change from that of Jadid, and he would implement a \"corrective movement\" to return Syria to the true \"nationalist socialist line\". Unlike Jadid, Assad emphasised \"the advancement of which all resources and manpower [would be] mobilised [was to be] the liberation of the occupied territories\". This would mark a major break with his predecessors and would, according to Raymond Hinnebusch, dictate \"major alterations in the course of the Ba'thist state\".\nInstitutionalization.\nAssad turned the presidency, which had been known simply as \"head of state\" under Jadid, into a position of power during his rule. In many ways, the presidential authority replaced the Ba'ath Party's failed experiment with organised, military Leninism; Syria became a hybrid of Leninism and Gaullist constitutionalism. According to Raymond Hinnebusch, \"as the president became the main source of initiative in the government, his personality, values, strengths, and weaknesses became decisive for its direction and stability. Arguably Assad's leadership gave the government an enhanced combination of consistency and flexibility which it hitherto lacked.\"\nAssad institutionalised a system where he had the final say, which weakened the powers of the collegial institutions of the state and party. As fidelity to the leader replaced ideological conviction later in his presidency, corruption became widespread. The state-sponsored cult of personality became pervasive; as Assad's authority strengthened at his colleagues' expense, he became the sole symbol of the government.\nWhile Assad did not rule alone, he increasingly had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of the political elite would question a decision of his, and those who did were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad's handling of the Islamist uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba'ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in communist states. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress\u2014with the National Congress the \"de jure\" superior body\u2014but the Regional Congress had \"de facto\" authority. The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba'athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria's foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker National Progressive Front.\nEconomy.\nAssad called his domestic reforms a Corrective Movement, and it achieved some results. He introduced Ta'addudiyya and Infiraj policies, aimed at limited economic and political liberalization, and tried to modernize Syria's agricultural and industrial sectors; one of his main achievements was the completion of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River in 1974. One of the world's largest dams, its reservoir was called Lake al-Assad. The reservoir increased the irrigation of arable land, provided electricity, and encouraged industrial and technical development in Syria. Many peasants and workers received increased income, social security, and better health and educational services. The urban middle class, which had been hurt by the Jadid government's policy, had new economic opportunities.\nBy 1977 it was apparent that despite some success, Assad's political reforms had largely failed. This was partly due to Assad's foreign policy, failed policies, natural phenomena, and corruption. Chronic socioeconomic difficulties remained, and new ones appeared. Inefficiency, mismanagement, and corruption in the government, public, and private sectors, illiteracy, poor education (particularly in rural areas), increasing emigration by professionals, inflation, a growing trade deficit, a high cost of living and shortages of consumer goods were among problems faced by the country. The financial burden of Syria's involvement in Lebanon since 1976 contributed to worsening economic problems, encouraging corruption and a black market. The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1976-1980) set ambitious goals but failed to achieve most of them, as well as Fifth (1981-1985) and Sixth (1986-1990) Plans. The emerging class of entrepreneurs and brokers became involved with senior military officers\u2014including Assad's brother Rifaat\u2014in smuggling from Lebanon, which affected government revenue and encouraged corruption among senior government officials.\nDuring the early 1980s, Syria's economy worsened; by mid-1984, the food crisis was severe, and the press was full of complaints. Assad's government sought a solution, arguing that food shortages could be avoided with careful economic planning. The food crisis continued through August, despite government measures. Syria lacked sugar, bread, flour, wood, iron, and construction equipment; this resulted in soaring prices, long queues and rampant black marketeering. Smuggling goods from Lebanon became common. Assad's government tried to combat the smuggling, encountering difficulties due to the involvement of his brother Rifaat in the corruption. In July 1984, the government formed an effective anti-smuggling squad to control the Lebanon\u2013Syria borders. The Defense Detachment commanded by Rifaat al-Assad played a leading role in the smuggling, importing $400,000 worth of goods a day. The anti-smuggling squad seized $3.8\u00a0million in goods during its first week.\nThe Syrian economy grew five to seven percent during the early 1990s; exports increased, the balance of trade improved, inflation remained moderate (15\u201318 percent) and oil exports increased. In May 1991 Assad's government liberalized the Syrian economy in so-called \"Al-Ta`addudiyya Al-Iqtisadiyya\" campaign, which stimulated domestic and foreign private investment. Most foreign investors were Arab states around the Persian Gulf since Western countries still had political and economic issues with the country. The Gulf states invested in infrastructure and development projects; because of the Ba'ath Party's socialist ideology, Assad's government did not privatize state-owned companies.\nSyria fell into recession during the mid-1990s. Several years later, its economic growth was about 1.5 percent. This was insufficient since population growth was between 3 and 3.5 percent. Another symptom of the crisis was statism in foreign trade. Syria's economic crisis coincided with a recession in world markets. A 1998 drop in oil prices dealt a major blow to Syria's economy; when oil prices rose the following year, the Syrian economy partially recovered. In 1999, one of the worst droughts in a century caused a drop of 25\u201330 percent in crop yields compared with 1997 and 1998. Assad's government implemented emergency measures, including loans and compensation to farmers and the distribution of free fodder to save sheep and cattle. However, those steps were limited and had no measurable effect on the economy.\nAssad's government tried to decrease population growth, but this was only marginally successful. One sign of economic stagnation was Syria's lack of progress in talks with the EU on an agreement. The main cause of this failure was the country's difficulty in meeting EU demands to open the economy and introduce reforms. Marc Pierini, head of the EU delegation in Damascus, said that if the Syrian economy was not modernised it would not benefit from closer ties to the EU. Assad's government gave civil servants a 20-percent pay raise on the anniversary of the corrective movement that brought him to power. Although the foreign press criticised Syria's reluctance to liberalize its economy, Assad's government refused to modernize the bank system, permit private banks and open a stock exchange.\nSectarianism.\nWhen Assad came to power, he increased Alawite dominance of the security and intelligence sectors to a near-monopoly. The coercive framework was under his control, weakening the state and party. According to Hinnebusch, the Alawite officers around Assad \"were pivotal because as personal kinsmen or clients of the president, they combined privileged access to him with positions in the party and control of the levers of coercion. They were, therefore, in an unrivalled position to act as political brokers and, especially in times of crisis, were uniquely placed to shape outcomes\". The leading figures in the Alawite-dominated security system had family connections; Rifaat al-Assad controlled the Struggle Companies, and Assad's brother-in-law Adnan Makhlouf was his second-in-command as Commander of the Presidential Guard. Other prominent figures were Ali Haydar (special-forces head), Ibrahim al-Ali (Popular Army head), Muhammad al-Khuli (head of Assad's Air Force Intelligence Directorate from 1970 to 1987) and Military Intelligence head Ali Duba. Assad controlled the military through Alawites such as Generals Shafiq Fayadh (commander of the 3rd Division), Ibrahim Safi (commander of the 1st Division) and Adnan Badr Hassan (commander of the 9th Division). During the 1990s, Assad further strengthened Alawite dominance by replacing Sunni General Hikmat al-Shihabi with General Ali Aslan as chief of staff. The Alawites, with their high status, appointed and promoted based on kinship and favor rather than professional respect. Therefore, an Alawite elite emerged from these policies. Anti-Sunni orientation of his Alawite regime also pushed Assad to pursue closer relations with Shia Iran.\nDuring the early years of his rule, some of Assad's elite had appeared non-sectarian; prominent Sunni figures at the beginning of his rule were Abdul Halim Khaddam, Shihabi, Naji Jamil, Abdullah al-Ahmar and Mustafa Tlass. However, none of these people had a power base distinct from that of Assad. Although Sunnis held the positions of Air Force Commander from 1971 to 1994 (Jamil, Subhi Haddad and Ali Malahafji), General Intelligence head from 1970 to 2000 (Adnan Dabbagh, Ali al-Madani, Nazih Zuhayr, Fuad al-Absi and Bashir an-Najjar), Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army from 1974 to 1998 (Shihabi) and defense minister from 1972 until after Assad's death (Tlass), none had power separate from Assad or the Alawite-dominated security system. When Jamil headed the Air Force, he could not issue orders without the knowledge of Khuli (the Alawite head of Air Force Intelligence). After the failed Islamist uprising, Assad's reliance on his relatives intensified; before that, his Sunni colleagues had some autonomy. A defector from Assad's government said, \"Tlass is in the army but at the same time seems as if he is not of the army; he neither binds nor loosens and has no role other than that of the tail in the beast.\" Another example was Shihabi, who occasionally represented Assad. However, he had no control in the Syrian military; Ali Aslan, First Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations during most of his tenure, was responsible for troop maneuvers. Although the Sunnis were in the forefront, the Alawites had the power.\nMilitarization.\nFrom the very beginning of his rule, Assad pursued an active policy of militarizing the Syrian state and its society - his goal was to build a strong traditional army (with the support of the USSR) to fight Israel. Assad gave a very high priority to building a strong military and preparing it for a confrontation with Israel, both for offensive and defensive purposes and to enable him to politically negotiate the return of the Golan Heights from a position of military strength. He allocated up to 70 percent of the annual budget to the military build-up and received large quantities of modern arms from the Soviet Union: Eventually, with the help of it, Assad built a large and professional military equipped with modern tanks, airplanes and long-range ground-to-ground missiles capable of launching chemical warheads into most Israeli cities. The Syrian Arab Army, which was mainly a conscripted force, increased from 50,000 personnel in 1967 to 225,000 in 1973 and to over 500,000 in 1986, and its air and armored fleets were among the largest in the world. Already high military spending has steadily increased, burdening the Syrian economy.\nThe policy of general militarization also affected the civil sphere of the country: militaristic propaganda was very widespread, especially in schools and educational institutions (where students were taught military tactics and the use of weapons), and Assad himself was often depicted in portraits in military uniform and often wore it. It is believed that military education in Syrian schools was introduced in the 1970s by Hafez al-Assad, although the preconditions for this had been there since the Ba'ath Party came to power. Students were required to wear military uniforms (which were standard for Syrian schools at the time) and go to military camps known as moaskar for 15 days, where they were further introduced to soldier's life and were under the command of military officers. Thus, taking into account only the soldiers of the Syrian army, Syria was already the 4th country in the world in terms of militarization per capita, despite the fact that even more people in the country knew how to own a weapon, from school days.\nArab Belt project.\nFrom 1973 to 1976, under Assad's orders, an Arabization campaign known as the \"Arab Belt\" was carried out in northeastern Syria. Assad government called campaign \"Plan to establish model state farms in the Jazira region\"\".\" The aim of the campaign was to change the ethnic composition of north-east Syria in favor of the Arabs and to the detriment of the local inhabitants, the Kurds. It involved the seizure of land which was then settled with Arabs displaced by the creation of Lake Assad. The programme was implemented in 1973; forcibly deporting around 140,000 Kurds from 332 villages and confiscating their lands around a 180-mile strip. Tens of thousands of Arab settlers coming from Raqqa were then granted these lands to establish settlements. The area of the project was a strip of land - almost 15\u00a0km in breadth - that extended over 375\u00a0km in length; across the north-eastern boundary-regions of Syria with Turkey and Iraq. \nThe Arabs were provided with weapons and divided between more than 50 so-called model farms in the Jazira Region and to the north of Raqqa. Twelve were built each around Qamishli and Al-Malakiyah and sixteen around Ras al Ayn. The Kurdish village names of the area were replaced by Arabic names not necessarily related to the traditions and history of the region. These Arabs are named as Maghmurin (\u0645\u063a\u0645\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0646 Ma\u0121m\u016br\u012bn, which is affected by flooding). The campaign has eventually faded out in 1976, but the deported Kurds were not allowed to return.\nIslamist uprising.\nBackground.\nAssad's pragmatic policies indirectly led to the establishment of a \"new class\", and he accepted this while it furthered his aims against Israel. When Assad began pursuing a policy of economic liberalization, the state bureaucracy began using their positions for personal gain. The state gave implementation rights to \"much of its development program to foreign firms and contractors, fueling a growing linkage between the state and private capital\". What ensued was a spike in corruption, which led the political class to be \"thoroughly embourgeoised\". The channeling of external money through the state to private enterprises \"created growing opportunities for state elites' self-enrichment through corrupt manipulation of state-market interchanges. Besides outright embezzlement, webs of shared interests in commissions and kickbacks grew up between high officials, politicians, and business interests\". The Alawite military-security establishment got the greatest share of the money; the Ba'ath Party and its leaders ruled a new class, defending their interests instead of those of peasants and workers (whom they were supposed to represent). This, coupled with growing Sunni disillusionment with what Hinnebusch calls \"the regime's mixture of statism, rural and sectarian favouritism, corruption and new inequalities\", fueled the growth of the Islamic movement. Because of this, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria became the vanguard of anti-Ba'athist forces.\nThe Brotherhood had historically been a vehicle for Islamism during its introduction to the Syrian political scene during the 1960s under the leadership of Mustafa al-Siba'i. After Siba'i's imprisonment, under Isam al-Attar's leadership the Brotherhood developed into the ideological antithesis of Ba'athist rule. However, the Ba'ath Party's organizational superiority worked in its favor; with Attar's enforced exile, the Muslim Brotherhood was in disarray. It was not until the 1970s that the Muslim Brotherhood established a clear, central collective authority for its organization under Adnan Saad ad-Din, Sa'id Hawwa, Ali Sadr al-Din al-Bayanuni and Husni Abu. Because of their organizational capabilities, the Muslim Brotherhood grew tenfold from 1975 to 1978 (from 500 to 700 in Aleppo); nationwide, by 1978 it had 30,000 followers.\nEvents.\nThe Islamist uprising began in the mid-to-late 1970s, with attacks on prominent members of the Ba'ath Alawite elite. As the conflict worsened, a debate in the party between hard-liners (represented by Rifaat al-Assad) and Ba'ath liberals (represented by Mahmoud al-Ayyubi) began. The Seventh Regional Congress, in 1980, was held in an atmosphere of crisis. The party leadership\u2014with the exception of Assad and his proteges\u2014were criticised severely by party delegates, who called for an anti-corruption campaign, a new, clean government, curtailing the powers of the military-security apparatus and political liberalization. With Assad's consent, a new government (headed by the presumably clean Abdul Rauf al-Kasm) was established with new, young technocrats. The new government failed to assuage critics, and the Sunni middle class and the radical left (believing that Ba'athist rule could be overthrown with an uprising) began collaborating with the Islamists.\nBelieving they had the upper hand in the conflict, beginning in 1980 the Islamists began a series of campaigns against government installations in Aleppo; the attacks became urban guerrilla warfare. The government began to lose control in the city and, inspired by events, similar disturbances spread to Hama, Homs, Idlib, Latakia, Deir ez-Zor, Maaret-en-Namen and Jisr esh-Shagour. Those affected by Ba'athist repression began to rally behind the insurgents; Ba'ath Party co-founder Bitar supported the uprising, rallying the old, anti-military Ba'athists. The increasing threat to the government's survival strengthened the hard-liners, who favored repression over concessions. Security forces began to purge all state, party and social institutions in Syria, and were sent to the northern provinces to quell the uprising. When this failed, the hard-liners began accusing the United States of fomenting the uprising and called for the reinstatement of \"revolutionary vigilance\". The hard-liners won the debate after a failed attempt on Assad's life in June 1980, and began responding to the uprising with state terrorism later that year. Under Rifaat al-Assad, Islamic prisoners at the Tadmur prison were massacred, membership in the Muslim Brotherhood became a capital offence and the government sent a death squad to kill Bitar and Attar's former wife. The military court began condemning captured prisoners, which \"sometimes degenerated into indiscriminate killings\". Little care was taken to distinguish Muslim Brotherhood hard-liners from their passive supporters, and violence was met with violence.\nUltimately this culminated in the 1982 Hama massacre when the government crushed the uprising. Helicopter gunships, bulldozers, and artillery bombardment razed the city, killing thousands of people. The Ba'ath government withstood the uprising, not because of popular support, but because the opposition was disorganised and had little urban support. Throughout the uprising, the Sunni middle class continued to support the Ba'ath Party because of its dislike of political Islam. After the uprising the government resumed its version of militaristic Leninism, reverting the liberalization introduced when Assad came to power. The Ba'ath Party was weakened by the uprising; democratic elections for delegates to the Regional and National Congresses were halted, and open discussion within the party ended. The uprising made Syria more totalitarian than ever, and strengthened Assad's position as undisputed leader of Syria.\n1983\u20131984 succession crisis.\nIn November 1983 Assad, a diabetic, had a heart attack complicated by phlebitis; this triggered a succession crisis. On 13 November, after visiting his brother in the hospital, Rifaat al-Assad reportedly announced his candidacy for president; he did not believe Assad would be able to continue ruling the country. When he did not receive support from Assad's inner circle, he made, in the words of historian Hanna Batatu, \"abominably lavish\" promises to win them over.Until his 1985 ouster, Rifaat al-Assad was considered the face of corruption by the Syrian people. Although highly paid as Commander of Defense Companies, he accumulated unexplained wealth. According to Batatu, \"there is no way that he could have permissibly accumulated the vast sums needed for the investments he made in real estate in Syria, Europe and the United States\".\nAlthough it is unclear if any top officials supported Rifaat al-Assad, most did not. He lacked his brother's stature and charisma, and was vulnerable to charges of corruption. His 50,000-strong Defense Companies were viewed with suspicion by the upper leadership and throughout society; they were considered corrupt, poorly disciplined and indifferent to human suffering. Rifaat al-Assad also lacked military support; officers and soldiers resented the Defense Companies' monopoly of Damascus' security, their separate intelligence services and prisons and their higher pay. He did not abandon the hope of succeeding his brother, opting to take control of the country through his post as Commander of Defense Companies. In what became known as the \"Poster War\", personnel from the Defense Companies replaced posters of Assad in Damascus with those of Rifaat al-Assad. The security service, still loyal to Hafez, responded by replacing Rifaat al-Assad's posters with Hafez's. The poster war lasted for a week until Assad's health improved.\nShortly after the poster war, all of Rifaat al-Assad's proteges were removed from positions of power. This decree nearly sparked a clash between the Defense Companies and the Republican Guard on 27 February 1984, but conflict was avoided by Rifaat al-Assad's appointment as one of three Vice Presidents on 11 March. He acquired this post by surrendering his position as Commander of Defense Companies to a Hafez supporter. Rifaat al-Assad was succeeded as Defense Companies head by his son-in-law. During the night of 30 March, Rifaat ordered Defense Company loyalists to seal Damascus off and advance to the city. The Republican Guard was put on alert in Damascus, and 3rd Armored Division commander Shafiq Fayadh ordered troops outside Damascus to encircle the Defense Companies blocking the roads into the city. Rifaat al-Assad's plan might have succeeded if Special Forces commander Ali Haydar supported him, but Haydar sided with the president. Assad punished Rifaat al-Assad with exile, allowing him to return in later years without a political role. The Defense Companies were reduced by 30,000\u201335,000 men, and their role was assumed by the Republican Guard. Makhluf, the Republican Guard commander was promoted to major general, and Hafez's son Bassel al-Assad, then an army major, became influential in the guard. Assad recovered and returned to his work routine, holding numerous meetings with diplomats. However, his deteriorating health was noticeable to everyone\u2014he had lost weight and turned pale.\nForeign policy.\nYom Kippur War.\nPlanning.\nSince the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War, Assad was convinced that the Israelis had won the war by subterfuge; after gaining power, his top foreign-policy priority was to regain the Arab territory lost in the war. Assad reaffirmed Syria's rejection of the 1967 UN Security Council Resolution 242 because he believed it stood for the \"liquidation of the Palestine question\". He believed, and continued to believe until long into his rule, that the only way to get Israel to negotiate with the Arabs was through war.\nWhen Assad took power, Syria was isolated; planning an attack on Israel, he sought allies and war material. Ten weeks after gaining power, Assad visited the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership was wary of supplying the Syrian government, viewing Assad's rise to power with a reserve and believing him to lean further West than Jadid did. While he soon understood that the Soviet relationship with the Arabs would never be as deep as the United States' relationship with Israel, he needed its weapons. Unlike his predecessors (who tried to win Soviet support with socialist policies), Assad was willing to give the Soviets a stable presence in the Middle East through Syria, access to Syrian naval bases (giving them a role in the peace process) and help in curtailing American influence in the region. The Soviets responded by sending arms to Syria. The new relationship bore fruit, and between February 1971 and October 1973 Assad met several times with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.\nAssad believed that Syria would have no chance in a war against Israel without Egyptian participation. He believed that if the United Arab Republic had not collapsed, the Arabs would already have liberated Palestine. For a war against Israel, Syria needed to establish another front. However, by this time Syria's relations with Egypt and Jordan were shaky at best. Planning for war began in 1971 with an agreement between Assad and Anwar Sadat. In the beginning, the renewed Egyptian\u2013Syrian alliance was based upon the proposed Federation of Arab Republics (FAR), a federation initially encompassing Egypt, Libya, Sudan (which left soon after FAR's first summit) and Syria. Assad and Sadat used the FAR summits to plan war strategy, and by 1971 they had appointed Egyptian General Muhammad Sadiq supreme commander of both armies. From 1972 to 1973, the countries filled their arsenals and trained their armies. In a secret meeting of the Egyptian\u2013Syrian Military Council from 21 to 23 August 1973, the two chiefs of staff (Syrian Youssef Chakkour and Egyptian Saad el-Shazly) signed a document declaring their intention to go to war against Israel. During a meeting of Assad, Sadat and their respective defense ministers (Tlass and Hosni Mubarak) on 26\u201327 August, the two leaders decided to go to war together.\nEgypt went to war for a reason different from Syria's. While Assad wanted to regain lost Arab territory, Sadat wished to strengthen Egypt's position in its peace policy toward Israel. The Syrians were deceived by Sadat and the Egyptians, which would play a major role in the Arab defeat. Egyptian Chief of Staff Shazly was convinced from the beginning that Egypt could not mount a successful full-scale offensive against Israel; therefore, he campaigned for a limited war. Sadat knew that Assad would not participate in the war if he knew his real intentions. Since the collapse of the UAR, the Egyptians were critical of the Ba'athist government; they saw it as an untrustworthy ally.\nThe war.\nAt 14:05 on 6 October 1973, Egyptian forces (attacking through the Sinai Peninsula) and Syrian forces (attacking the Golan Heights) crossed the border into Israel and penetrated the Israeli defense lines. The Syrian forces on the Golan Heights met with more intense fighting than their Egyptian counterparts, but by 8 October had broken through the Israeli defenses. The early successes of the Syrian army were due to its officer corps (where officers were promoted because of merit and not politics) and its ability to handle advanced Soviet weaponry: tanks, artillery batteries, aircraft, man-portable missiles, the Sagger anti-tank weapon and the 2K12 Kub anti-aircraft system on mobile launchers. With the help of these weapons, Egypt and Syria defeated Israel's armor and air supremacy. Egypt and Syria announced the war to the world first, accusing Israel of starting it, mindful of the importance of avoiding appearing as the aggressor (Israel accused the Arab powers of starting the Six-Day War when they launched Operation Focus). In any case, early Syrian successes helped rectify the loss of face they had suffered following the Six-Day War.\nThe main reason for the reversal of fortune was Egypt's operational pause from 7 to 14 October. After capturing parts of the Sinai, the Egyptian campaign halted and the Syrians were left fighting the Israelis alone. The Egyptian leaders, believing their war aims accomplished, dug in. While their early successes in the war had surprised them, War Minister General Ahmad Ismail Ali advised caution. In Syria, Assad and his generals waited for the Egyptians to move. When the Israeli government learned of Egypt's modest war strategy, it ordered an \"immediate continuous action\" against the Syrian military. According to Patrick Seale, \"For three days, 7, 8, and 9 October, Syrian troops on the Golan faced the full fury of the Israeli air force as, from first light to nightfall, wave after wave of aircraft swooped down to bomb, strafe and napalm their tank concentration and their fuel and ammunition carriers right back to the Purple Line.\" By 9 October, the Syrians were retreating behind the Purple Line (the Israeli\u2013Syrian border since the Six-Day War). By 13 October the war was lost, but in contrast to the Six-Day War, the Syrians were not crushed; this earned Assad respect in Syria and abroad.\nOn 14 October, Egypt began a limited offensive against Israel for political reasons. Sadat needed Assad on his side for his peace policy with Israel to succeed, and military action as a means to an end. The renewed Egyptian military offensive was ill-conceived. A week later, due to Egyptian inactivity, the Israelis had organised and the Arabs had lost their most important advantage. While the military offensive gave Assad hope, this was an illusion; the Arabs had already lost the war militarily. Egypt's behavior during the war caused friction between Assad and Sadat. Assad, still inexperienced in foreign policy, believed that the Egyptian\u2013Syrian alliance was based on trust and failed to understand Egypt's duplicity. Although it was not until after the war that Assad would learn that Sadat was in contact with American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger almost daily during the war, the seeds of distrust had been sown. Around this time, Sadat called for an American-led ceasefire agreement between Egypt, Syria, and Israel; however, he was unaware that under Kissinger's tenure the United States had become a staunch supporter of Israel.\nOn 16 October, Sadat\u2014without telling Assad\u2014called for a ceasefire in a speech to the People's Assembly, the Egyptian legislative body. Assad was not only surprised but could not comprehend why Sadat trusted \"American goodwill for a satisfactory result\". Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited Cairo, urging Sadat to accept a ceasefire without the condition of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. While Sadat was reluctant at first, Kosygin returned on 18 October with satellite images showing 300 Israeli tanks in Egyptian territory. The blow to Sadat's morale was such that he sent a cable to Assad, obliquely saying that all hope was lost. Assad, who was in a better position, was still optimistic. Under Soviet influence, Egypt called for a ceasefire on 22 October 1973, direct negotiations between the warring parties and the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 242. The ceasefire resolution did not call for Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories. Assad was annoyed since he had not been informed beforehand of Sadat's change in policy (which affected them both). On 23 October the Syrian government accepted the ceasefire, spelling out its understanding of UN Resolution 338 (withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories and the safeguarding of Palestinian rights).\nLebanese Civil War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe did not go into Lebanon to achieve any regional ambitions, nor for any selfish or opportunistic motives. On the contrary, it was at the expense of our economy and our daily bread.\n\u2014Assad, reviewing Syria's intervention in Lebanon\nSyria intervened in Lebanon in 1976 during the civil war, which began in 1975. With the Egyptian\u2013Israeli peace accords, Syria was the only neighboring state which threatened Israel. Syria initially tried to mediate the conflict; when that failed, Assad ordered the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), a regular force based in Syria with Syrian officers, troops into Lebanon to restore order. Around this time, the Israeli government opened its borders to Maronite refugees in Lebanon to strengthen its regional influence. Clashes between the Syria-loyal PLA and militants occurred throughout the country. Despite Syrian support and Khaddam's mediation, Rashid Karami (the Sunni Muslim Prime Minister of Lebanon) did not have enough support to appoint a cabinet.\nIn early 1976 Assad was approached by Lebanese politicians for help in forcing the resignation of Suleiman Frangieh, the Christian President of Lebanon. Although Assad was open to change, he resisted attempts by some Lebanese politicians to enlist him in Frangieh's ouster; when General Abdul Aziz al-Ahd\u0101b attempted to seize power, Syrian troops stopped him. In the meantime, radical Lebanese leftists were gaining the upper hand in the military conflict. Kamal Jumblatt, leader of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), believed that his strong military position would compel Frangieh's resignation. Assad did not wish a leftist victory in Lebanon which would strengthen the position of the Palestinians. He did not want a rightist victory either, instead of seeking a middle-ground solution which would safeguard Lebanon and the region. When Jumblatt met with Assad on 27 March 1976, he tried to persuade him to let him \"win\" the war; Assad replied that a ceasefire should be in effect to ensure the 1976 presidential elections. Meanwhile, on Assad's orders Syria sent troops into Lebanon without international approval.\nWhile Yasser Arafat and the PLO had not officially taken a side in the conflict, several PLO members were fighting with the LNM. Assad attempted to steer Arafat and the PLO away from Lebanon, threatening him with a cutoff of Syrian aid. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement. When Frangieh stepped down in 1976, Syria pressured Lebanese members of parliament to elect Elias Sarkis president. One-third of the Lebanese members of parliament (primarily supporters of Raymond Edde) boycotted the election to protest American and Syrian interference.\nOn 31 May 1976, Syria began a full-scale intervention in Lebanon to (according to the official Syrian account) end bombardment of the Maronite cities of Qubayat and Aandqat. Before the intervention, Assad and the Syrian government were one of several interests in Lebanon; afterward, they were the controlling factors in Lebanese politics. On Assad's orders, the Syrian troop presence slowly increased to 30,000. Syria received approval for the intervention from the United States and Israel to help them defeat Palestinian forces in Lebanon. The Ba'athist group As-Sa'iqa and the PLA's Hitt\u012bn brigade fought Palestinians who sided with the LNM.\nWithin a week of the Syrian intervention, Christian leaders issued a statement of support. Muslim leaders established a joint command of all Palestinian groups except As-Sa'iqa, which was driven by the PLO to its stronghold near the main airport. Shortly afterward, As-Sa'iqa and other leftist Damascus forces were absorbed by the Syrian military. On 8 June 1976 Syrian forces were pushed back from Sidon, encountering stiff resistance in Beirut from the LNM. Assad's actions angered much of the Arab world however and the sight of Syria trying to eliminate the PLO brought criticism upon him. There was considerable hostility to Assad's alliance with the Maronites in Syria. As a result, the Syrian government asked the Arab League to assist in the conflict. The Arab League began to meditate, establishing the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) for peacekeeping. Syrian strategy at this point was to gradually weaken the LNM and its Palestinian collaborators, continuing to support the Christian militia. However, the Syrians were unable to capture the LNM's stronghold of Aley before the Arab League called for a ceasefire on 17 October. The Arab League strengthened the ADF to 30,000 troops, most Syrian. While some heavy fighting continued, by December 1976 and January 1977 most Palestinian and Lebanese groups had disposed of their heavy weaponry. According to Charles Winslow, the \"main phase\" of the Lebanese Civil War had ended by 1977; until the early 1990s most violence was attributed to the turf, proxy, inter-communal and state wars.\nAssad used terrorism and intimidation to extend his control over Lebanon. Jumblatt died in a 1977 assassination allegedly ordered by Syria; in 1982, Syrian agents assassinated Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel (who was helped to power by the Israelis during the 1982 Lebanon War). Jumblatt and Gemayel had resisted Assad's attempts to dominate Lebanon. Assad caused the failure of the 1983 Lebanon\u2013Israel agreement, and by proxy guerrilla warfare forced the Israeli Defense Forces to withdraw to southern Lebanon in 1985. Terrorism against Palestinians and Jordanian targets during the mid-1980s thwarted the rapprochement between King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO, slowing Jordanian\u2013Israeli cooperation in the West Bank.\nHindawi affair.\nIn April 1986, an attempt was made to blow up El Al Flight 016 heading to Israel by Jordanian citizen Nezar Nawwaf al-Mansur al-Hindawi (through his girlfriend Anne-Marie Murphy), but it was unsuccessful. After Hindawi gave the girl a bag of explosives on the flight (which was discovered by security guards), he went to the Syrian embassy and there asked for assistance. The ambassador passed him to the embassy security men, who took him to their lodgings, where they tried to change his appearance by cutting and dyeing his hair. For an unknown reason, early the next morning, 18 April, Hindawi fled from the Syrians and gave himself up to the British police.\nHe was interrogated intensively for a number of days: during the interrogation, Hindawi claimed to have arranged the plot with high-ranking officers in Syrian Air Force intelligence a year earlier in Damascus, where he was given Syrian papers and instructions for operating the explosive. He supposedly conducted a training run back in England before returning again to Syria for final details and preparation. Hindawi said that the explosive was delivered to him in the Royal Garden Hotel in London on 5 April, less than two weeks prior to the attempted bombing. This story is supported by the fact that Hindawi had first sought refuge in the Syrian embassy after learning of the failed bombing, and that Syrian officials were in the process of altering his appearance before he fled again. Also, British intelligence had previously intercepted Syrian communications with Hindawi's name, Hindawi was using genuine Syrian documents although he was not Syrian, and Hindawi's original escape plan involved leaving England with Syrian agents working on Syrian Arab Airlines.\nLater, Hindawi began to claim that everything was planned by Mossad, but most countries accepted the first version of events about Syria's involvement. After the court found Hindawi guilty, the then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher broke off diplomatic relations with Syria. Following this, the United States and Canada recalled their ambassadors from Syria. The European Community also imposed minor sanctions.\nGulf War.\nWhen Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Assad sided with Kuwait and considered Iraq's aggression as a serious threat to Syria's interests. Assad and Saddam had long detested each other, and Assad felt that Syria would be the next target of Saddam if he won in Kuwait. As a result, Syria joined the US-led coalition and sent up to 20,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia.\nPolitical assassinations.\nWhen Hafez al-Assad came to power, he did not limit his authority to purging Syrian institutions; in addition, his regime organized assassinations and political murders of his potential (and proven) enemies who did not support either Assad or his policies. Moreover, the assassination attempts organized by the Assad regime affected not only Syrians and not only those who live in Syria.\nOn his deathbed in May of 2000, Assad said that Mahmoud Al-Zoubi had betrayed him. He did not say what the betrayal was but demanded that \"an investigation be conducted and that he be held accountable.\" The next day, at an emergency meeting of the Ba'ath Party, Zoubi was expelled from its membership. The next day, at an emergency meeting of the Ba'ath Party, Zoubi was expelled from the party. The next day, on May 25, the Damascus police chief came to him and allegedly shot him in his own apartment - the official version was that Zoubi committed suicide.\nLebanon.\nMuhammad Umran was a Assad's longtime opponent, with whom he had had disagreements since 1964, and had considerable influence on the minds of the Syrian military, so Assad believed that killing him would help strengthen his own family's power. On March 4, 1972, in the Lebanese city of Tripoli, men shot and killed Umran.\nSalim Lawzi was a Lebanese journalist and founder of al Hawadeth magazine. His criticism of the Syrian role in Lebanese Civil War escalated leading to serious threats on his life. The Hawadeth main building was destroyed during the war. Fearing for his life due to the threats he was receiving, Lawzi chose self-exile in London, from where he continued editing his magazine.But After his mom died, he decided to return for funerals. After descending in Beirut International Airport, he was kidnapped by gunmen on the Airport Road on 25 February 1980. His heavily bruised tortured body was found nine days later on 4 March 1980 in Aramoun, on the outskirts of Beirut. Forensic reports found heavy signs of torture, including a broken and dislocated right arm, maimed and disjointed writing hand, fingers burnt and blackened through use of acid and phosphoric substances, pens pierced into abdomen and intestines (obvious messages in mutilation for other critics of Syria) and an assassination-style bullet in the head. Alleged perpetrator was the Syrian intelligence agents.\nKhalil Akkawi was the leader of the Islamic Unification Movement lived in Lebanese Tripoli. Syrian Military Intelligence killed Khalil Akkawi in February 9, 1986, because he refused to fight the Lebanese Forces. Three supporters of Akkawi's Islamic Tawheed, or Islamic Unification Movement, were slain in gunfights with Syrian troopers after his burial. In the 1980s, Syrian intelligence services were very active in assassination attempts (mostly successful) against their opponents in Lebanon.\nEurope.\nEven earlier, Salah ad-Din al-Bitar had been sentenced to death in absentia by the new government, and had fled to Beirut. Later, in 1978, Assad pardoned him and allowed him to return to Syria. However, a quarrel and conflict soon broke out between them again, and Bitar fled to Paris. Bitar launched a press campaign against the Syrian government from his exile in Paris, attacking it in a new magazine which he entitled \"al-Ihyaa al-Arabi\", in an echo of the name he and Aflaq had adopted almost forty years before. He was also rumored to be in contact with Syrian opposition figures in Baghdad. Bitar was killed by Syrian secret services in Paris on July 21, 1980. As he was exiting the elevator to enter his office, his assassin fired two shots to the back of his head.\nAl-Tantawi was the wife of former Muslim Brotherhood director general Issam al-Attar and lived in Aachen, Germany. In March 1981, her father, Ali Al-Tantawi, called her, saying that she was in serious danger (in the form of assassins sent by Assad after her and her husband). An hour later, a neighbor knocked on her door at gunpoint - Tantawi, hearing a familiar voice, opened the door and was immediately killed by two men.\nPolitical ideology and beliefs.\nAssad was originally a devout pan-Arabist and was greatly inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser and his ideas. However, over time, his ideology shifted towards a mix of Arab nationalism and Syrian nationalism. \nAs a result, his ideas and methods of ruling the state became known as Assadism. Assadism is considered a later and more personalized version of radical neo-Ba'athism, which places Hafez al-Assad at the center as the founder and father of the modern Syrian nation. Assadism's policies were a strange mixture of Syrian-Arab nationalism, radical socialism (until the 1990s), secularism, militarism and a personality cult around Hafez: Assadism exalted the person of Hafez and portrayed his wisdom as \"beyond the comprehension of the average citizen\". Unlike Jadid's neo-Ba'athism, Assadism did not promote atheism and relied on more traditional ideas, for example rejecting the doctrine of exporting socialist revolution and the Maoist strategy of \"people's war\". Assadism supported the formation of a strong standard army (rather than the support of proxy forces, as was the case under Jadid), and the formation of a coalition with non-Ba'athist organizations in Syria (which was also rejected by the Jadid regime), which eventually resulted in the formation of the National Progressive Front. Syrian state propaganda cast Assadism as a neo-Ba'athist current that evolved Ba'athist ideology with the needs of the modern era.\nAutocracy, succession, and death.\nAssad's first choice of successor was his brother Rifaat al-Assad, an idea he broached as early as 1980, and his brother's coup attempt weakened the institutionalised power structure on which he based his rule. Instead of changing his policy, Assad tried to protect his power by honing his governmental model. He gave a larger role to Bassel al-Assad, who was rumored to be his father's planned successor; this kindled jealousy within the government.At a 1994 military meeting, Chief of Staff Shihabi said that since Assad wanted to normalize relations with Israel, the Syrian military had to withdraw its troops from the Golan Heights. Haydar replied angrily, \"We have become nonentities. We were not even consulted.\" When he heard about Haydar's outburst, Assad replaced Haydar as Commander of Special Forces with the Alawite Major General Ali Habib. Haydar also reportedly opposed dynastic succession, keeping his views secret until after Bassel's death in 1994 (when Assad chose Bashar al-Assad to succeed him); he then openly criticised Assad's succession plans.\nAbdul Halim Khaddam, Syria's foreign minister from 1970 to 1984, opposed dynastic succession on the grounds that it was not socialist. Khaddam has said that Assad never discussed his intentions about succession with members of the Regional Command. By the 1990s, the Sunni faction of the leadership was aging; the Alawites, with Assad's help, had received new base. The Sunnis were at a disadvantage since many were opposed to any kind of dynastic succession.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter [Assad's] illness [in 1983] this matter was too sensitive to be discussed. His love for the family was even stronger than his duty as president. The decision was very wrong. This decision was in total contradiction to all laws and regulations in Syria. In the late 1990s, when he was becoming sicker, this sentiment grew stronger and stronger.\n\u2014Abdul Halim Khaddam, on Assad's succession plans\nAfter returning to Syria, Bashar al-Assad enrolled in the Homs Military Academy. He was quickly promoted to Brigadier Commander, and served for a time in the Republican Guard. He studied most military subjects, \"including a tank battalion commander, command and staff\" (the latter two of which were required for a senior command in the Syrian army). Bashar al-Assad was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1997, and to colonel in January 1999. Official sources ascribe Bashar's rapid promotion to his \"overall excellence in the staff officers' course, and in the outstanding final project he submitted as part of the course for command and staff\". With Bashar's training, Assad appointed a new generation of Alawite security officers to secure his succession plans. Shihabi's replacement by Aslan as Chief of Staff on 1 July 1998\u2014Shihabi was considered a potential successor by the outside world\u2014marked the end of the long security-apparatus overhaul.Skepticism of Assad's dynastic-succession plan was widespread within and outside the government, with critics noting that Syria was not a monarchy. By 1998 Bashar had made inroads into the Ba'ath Party, taking over Khaddam's Lebanon portfolio (a post he had held since the 1970s). By December 1998 Bashar al-Assad had replaced Rafic al-Hariri, Prime Minister of Lebanon and one of Khaddam's proteges, with Salim al-Huss. Several Assad proteges, who had served since 1970 or earlier, were dismissed from office between 1998 and 2000. They were sacked not because of disloyalty to Assad, but because Assad thought they would not fully support Bashar al-Assad's succession. \"Retirees\" included Muhammad al-Khuli, Nassir Khayr Bek and Ali Duba. Among the new appointees (Bashar loyalists) were Bahjat Sulayman, Major General Hassan Khalil and Major General Assef Shawkat (Assad's son-in-law).\nBy the late 1990s, Assad's health had deteriorated. American diplomats said Assad had difficulty staying focused and seemed tired during their meetings; he was seen as incapable of functioning for more than two hours a day. Because of his increasing seclusion from state affairs, the government became accustomed to working without his involvement in day-to-day affairs. Nearly all of his administrative tasks and even much of the important decision making was allegedly being delegated to his daughter, Bushra, who set up her own office next to her father in the Presidential Palace. Bushra, long believed to have been Assad's favorite child and, had it not been for her gender, preferred candidate for succession, had a negative view towards Bashar's ability to succeed Hafez and was allegedly mounting her own attempt at amassing power to succeed him. His spokesperson ignored the speculation, and Assad's official routine in 1999 was basically unchanged from the previous decade. Assad continued to conduct meetings, traveling abroad occasionally; he visited Moscow in July 1999.\nOn 26 March 2000, Assad embarked on another rare foreign trip to Geneva to meet with American president Bill Clinton.On 10 June 2000, at the age of 69, Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack while on the telephone with Lebanese prime minister Salim al-Huss. A period of 40 days of mourning was declared in Syria and 7 days in Lebanon thereafter. Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, Libya, Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Kuwait and Qatar announced three days of national mourning. His funeral was held three days later. The Israeli prime minister said that with the death of Assad, an era has ended in the Middle East. \nAssad was buried in his hometown of Qardaha alongside his son Bassel, in what became known as the \"Immortal Leader's Mausoleum\". After Hafez al-Assad's death, power was transferred to his son Bashar al-Assad with the support of Ba'ath loyalists, making Syria the first Arab republic to establish a dynastic system. \nOn 11 December 2024, after the overthrow of his son Bashar following 13 years of civil war, rebels set fire and burned Hafez al-Assad's tomb inside the mausoleum. Videos of armed men burning Assad's grave and urinating on it were published online. On 28 April 2025, videos and photos on social media showed his grave being exhumed by unidentified individuals. His remains were reportedly transferred to an unknown location.\nLegacy.\nHafez al-Assad was one of the key figures in the Middle East, who exerted considerable influence on the politics of the entire region. However, opinions about him and his actions are mixed. As the New York Times put it, \"No lasting peace could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive largely due to his stubborn role in demanding back every inch of Syrian territory.\" Assad was able to build a stable state: his domestic policies of expanding infrastructure, medical and educational services, strengthening central authority, and intensive militarization of society, and foreign policy, which consisted of a consistent fight \"against imperialism and Israel,\" have turned Syria into a closed regional power, whose views could not be ignored. His ability to get out of difficult situations, convince others and achieve favorable conditions for himself greatly impressed many diplomats who interacted with him. As The New York Times mentioned, \"Mr. Assad most sought to create a legacy, remaking Syria into a power among the Arabs rather than a political football\".\nCritics of Hafez al-Assad and a number of law enforcement organizations have called his regime a brutal dictatorship responsible for the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people and have repeatedly condemned his totalitarian state for gross human rights violations. Assad deployed repressive measures ranging from censorship to violent methods of state terror such as mass murders, deportations and practices such as torture, which were unleashed collectively upon the civilian population. For example, SS-Haupsturmfuhrer Alois Brunner, who played a significant role in the implementation of the Holocaust as the right-hand man of Adolf Eichmann, assisted al-Assad in organizing the Ba'athist secret police and trained them on Nazi Germany's torture practices. A 1983 report published by Amnesty International revealed that Assad regime routinely committed mass-executions of alleged dissidents and engaged in the extensive torture of prisoners of conscience. Various torture methods in Syrian prisons include electrocutions, ablazing, sexual violence, castration, etc. Assad left behind a hereditary dictatorship that eventually sparked a civil war and a personality cult even more widespread than in Maoist China or Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1943 he became active in a campaign to control the spread of contagious tropical diseases in Haiti. His patients affectionately called him \"Papa Doc,\" a moniker that he used throughout his life. Duvalier served as Minister for Public Health and Labor under the administration of Dumarsais Estim\u00e9.\nDuvalier was elected president in the 1957 general election on a populist and black nationalist platform. After thwarting a military coup d'\u00e9tat in July 1958, his regime rapidly became more autocratic. Duvalier was unanimously \"re-elected\" in a 1961 presidential election in which he was the only candidate. Afterwards, he consolidated his power step by step, culminating in 1964 when he declared himself president for life after another sham referendum and election.\nAn undercover government death squad, the Tonton Macoute (), indiscriminately tortured or killed Duvalier's opponents; the Tonton Macoute was thought to be so pervasive that Haitians became highly fearful of expressing any form of dissent, even in private. The Tonton Macoute eventually came to number 300,000 and more than half of the government budget was allocated to the group as well as the Presidential Guard. Duvalier further sought to solidify his rule by incorporating elements of Haitian mythology, most prominently Voudou, into a personality cult. \nDuvalier remained in power until his death in 1971 and was succeeded by his son, Jean\u2011Claude, who was nicknamed \"Baby Doc.\"\nEarly life and career.\nDuvalier was born in Port-au-Prince in 1907, the son of Duval Duvalier, justice of the peace, teacher and journalist, whose family came from Martinique, and His aunt, Madame Florestal, raised him as a child. He completed a degree in medicine from the University of Haiti in 1934, and served as staff physician at several local hospitals. He spent a year at the University of Michigan studying public health and in 1943, became active in a United States\u2013sponsored campaign to control the spread of contagious tropical diseases, helping the poor to fight typhus, yaws, malaria and other tropical diseases that had ravaged Haiti for years. His patients affectionately called him \"Papa Doc\", a moniker that he used throughout his life.\nThe racism and violence that occurred during the United States occupation of Haiti, which began in 1915, inspired black nationalism among Haitians and left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier. He was also aware of the latent political power of the poor black majority and their resentment against the small mulatto (black and white mixed-race) elite. Duvalier supported Pan-African ideals, and became involved in the \"\" movement of Haitian author Jean Price-Mars, both of which led to his advocacy of Haitian Vodou, an ethnological study of which later paid enormous political dividends for him. In 1938, Duvalier co-founded the journal \"Les Griots\". On 27 December 1939, he married , with whom he had four children: Marie\u2011Denise, Nicole, Simone, and Jean\u2011Claude.\nPolitical rise.\nIn 1946, Duvalier aligned himself with President Dumarsais Estim\u00e9 and was appointed Director General of the National Public Health Service. In 1949, he served as Minister of Health and Labor, but when Duvalier opposed Paul Magloire's 1950 coup d'\u00e9tat, he left the government and resumed practicing medicine. His practice included taking part in campaigns to prevent yaws and other diseases. In 1954, Duvalier abandoned medicine, hiding out in Haiti's countryside from the Magloire regime. In 1956, the Magloire government was failing, and although still in hiding, Duvalier announced his candidacy to replace him as president. By December 1956, an amnesty was issued and Duvalier emerged from hiding, and on 12 December 1956, Magloire conceded defeat. \nThe two frontrunners in the 1957 campaign for the presidency were Duvalier and Louis\u00a0D\u00e9joie, a mulatto landowner and industrialist from the north. During their campaigning, Haiti was ruled by five temporary administrations, none lasting longer than a few months. Duvalier promised to rebuild and renew the country and rural Haiti solidly supported him as did the military. \nHe resorted to \"\" populism, stoking the majority Afro-Haitians' irritation at being governed by the few mulatto elite, which is how he described his opponent, D\u00e9joie.\nFran\u00e7ois Duvalier was elected president on 22 September 1957. Duvalier received 679,884 votes to D\u00e9joie's 266,992. Even in this election, however, there are multiple first-hand accounts of voter fraud and voter \nPresidency.\nConsolidation of power.\nAfter being elected president in 1957, Duvalier exiled most of the major supporters of D\u00e9joie. He had a new constitution adopted that year.\nDuvalier promoted and installed members of the black majority in the civil service and the army. In July 1958, three exiled Haitian army officers and five American mercenaries landed in Haiti and tried to overthrow Duvalier; all were killed. Although the army and its leaders had quashed the coup attempt, the incident deepened Duvalier's distrust of the army, an important Haitian institution over which he did not have firm control. He replaced the chief-of-staff with a more reliable officer and then proceeded to create his own power base within the army by turning the Presidential Guard into an elite corps aimed at maintaining his power. After this, Duvalier dismissed the entire general staff and replaced it with officers who owed their positions, and their loyalty, to him. \nIn 1959, Duvalier created a rural militia, the \"\" (, )\u2014commonly referred to as the Tonton Macoute after a Haitian Creole bogeyman\u2014to extend and bolster support for the regime in the countryside. The \"Macoute\", which by 1961 was twice as big as the army, never developed into a real military force but was more than just a secret police.\nIn the early years of his rule, Duvalier was able to take advantage of the strategic weaknesses of his powerful opponents, mostly from the mulatto elite. These weaknesses included their inability to coordinate their actions against the regime, whose power had grown increasingly strong.\nIn the name of nationalism, Duvalier expelled almost all of Haiti's foreign-born bishops, an act that earned him excommunication from the Catholic Church. In 1966, he persuaded the Holy See to allow him permission to nominate the Catholic hierarchy for Haiti. Duvalier now exercised more power in Haiti than ever.\nHeart attack and Barbot affair.\nOn 24 May 1959, Duvalier suffered a massive heart attack, possibly due to an insulin overdose; he had been a diabetic since early adulthood and also suffered from heart disease and associated circulatory problems. During the heart attack, he was comatose for His physician believed that he had suffered neurological damage during these events, harming his mental health and perhaps explaining his subsequent actions.\nWhile recovering, Duvalier left power in the hands of Cl\u00e9ment Barbot, leader of the Tonton Macoute. Upon his return to work, Duvalier accused Barbot of trying to supplant him as president and had him imprisoned. In April 1963, Barbot was released and began plotting to remove Duvalier from office by kidnapping his children. The plot failed and Duvalier then ordered a nationwide search for Barbot and his fellow conspirators. During the search, Duvalier was told that Barbot had transformed himself into a black dog, which prompted Duvalier to order that all black dogs in Haiti be put to death. The Tonton Macoute captured and killed Barbot in July 1963. In other incidents, Duvalier ordered the head of an executed rebel packed in ice and brought to him so he could commune with the dead man's spirit. Peepholes were carved into the walls of the interrogation chambers, through which Duvalier watched Haitian detainees being tortured and submerged in baths of sulfuric acid; sometimes, he was in the room during the torture.\nConstitutional changes.\nIn 1961, Duvalier began violating the provisions of the 1957 constitution. First, he replaced the bicameral legislature with a unicameral body. Then he called a new presidential election in which he was the sole candidate, though his term was to expire in 1963 and the constitution prohibited re-election. The election was flagrantly rigged; the official tally showed a total of 1,320,748 \"yes\" votes for another term for Duvalier, with none opposed. Upon hearing the results, he proclaimed, \"I accept the people's will. ... As a revolutionary, I have no right to disregard the will of the \"The New York Times\" commented, \"Latin America has witnessed many fraudulent elections throughout its history but none has been more outrageous than the one which has just taken place in Haiti\". On 14 June 1964, a constitutional referendum made Duvalier \"President for Life\", a title previously held by seven Haitian presidents; it also changed the flag and coat of arms from blue and red to black and red, with the black symbolising the country's ties to Africa. This referendum was also blatantly rigged; an implausible 99.9% voted in favor, which should have come as no surprise since all the ballots were premarked \"yes\". The new document granted Duvalier\u2014or \"\", as he was called\u2014absolute powers as well as the right to name his successor.\nForeign relations.\nUnited States.\nHis relationship with the United States proved difficult. In his early years, Duvalier rebuked the United States for its friendly relations with Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo (assassinated in 1961) while ignoring Haiti. The Kennedy administration (1961\u20131963) was particularly disturbed by Duvalier's repressive and totalitarian rule and allegations that he misappropriated aid money, at the time a substantial part of the Haitian budget, and a U.S. Marine Corps mission to train the Tonton Macoute. The U.S. thus halted most of its economic assistance in mid-1962, pending stricter accounting procedures, with which Duvalier refused to comply. Duvalier publicly renounced all aid from Washington on nationalist grounds, portraying himself as a \"principled and lonely opponent of domination by a \nDuvalier misappropriated millions of dollars of international aid, including US$15\u00a0million annually from the United States. He transferred this money to personal accounts. Another of Duvalier's methods of obtaining foreign money was to gain foreign loans, including US$4\u00a0million from \nAfter the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, which Duvalier later claimed resulted from a curse that he had placed on Kennedy, the U.S. eased its pressure on Duvalier, grudgingly accepting him as a bulwark against communism. Duvalier attempted to exploit tensions between the U.S. and Cuba, emphasizing his anti-communist credentials and Haiti's strategic location as a means of winning U.S. support:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCuba.\nAfter Fulgencio Batista (a friend of Duvalier) was overthrown in the Cuban Revolution, Duvalier worried that new Cuban leader Fidel Castro would provide a safe haven for Haitian dissidents.\nDuvalier enraged Castro by voting against the country in an Organization of American States\u00a0(OAS) meeting and subsequently at the United Nations, where a trade embargo was imposed on Cuba. Cuba answered by breaking off diplomatic relations and Duvalier subsequently instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of communists. This move severed Haitian relations with Cuba for 38 years until the two countries re-established relations in 1997.\nDominican Republic.\nDuvalier's relationship with the neighboring Dominican Republic was always tense: in his early years, Duvalier emphasized the differences between the two countries. In April 1963, relations were brought to the edge of war by the political enmity between Duvalier and Dominican president Juan Bosch. Bosch, a leftist, provided asylum and support to Haitian exiles who had plotted against the Duvalier regime. Duvalier ordered his Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican Embassy in P\u00e9tion-Ville, with the goal of arresting a Haitian army officer believed to have been involved in Barbot's plot to kidnap Duvalier's children. The Dominican president reacted with outrage, publicly threatened to invade Haiti, and ordered army units to the border. However, as Dominican military commanders expressed little support for an invasion of Haiti, Bosch refrained from the invasion and sought mediation through \nEthiopia.\nIn 1966, Duvalier hosted the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie\u00a0I, in what would be the only visit of a foreign head of state to Haiti under Duvalier. During the visit, the two discussed bilateral agreements between their two nations and the economic shortcomings brought about by international pressure. Duvalier awarded Haile Selassie the Necklace of the Order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines the Great, and the emperor, in turn, bestowed upon Duvalier the Great Necklace of the Order of the Queen of Sheba.\nNigeria and Biafra.\nDuring the Nigerian Civil War, Duvalier granted diplomatic recognition to Biafra during its war against Nigeria, making Haiti one of few countries that recognized Biafra. Duvalier's decision to recognize Biafra was influenced by his anti-communist foreign policy and by Haiti's historical connection to the Igbo people, the predominant ethnic group of Biafra.\nInternal policies.\nRepression.\nDuvalier's government was one of the most repressive in the Western Hemisphere. During his 14-year rule, he murdered and exiled numerous political opponents; estimates of those killed are as high as 60,000. Attacks on Duvalier from within the military were treated as especially serious. When bombs were detonated near the Presidential Palace in 1967, Duvalier had nineteen officers of the Presidential Guard executed in Fort Dimanche. A few days later, Duvalier gave a public speech during which he read the attendance sheet with the names of all 19 officers killed. After each name, he said \"absent\". After reading the whole list, Duvalier remarked that \"all were shot\".\nHaitian communists and even suspected communists bore the brunt of the government's repression. Duvalier targeted them to reassure the U.S. that he was not communist: Duvalier was exposed to communist and leftist ideas early in his life and rejected them. On 28 April 1969, Duvalier instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of all communists. A new law declared that \"Communist activities, no matter what their form, are hereby declared crimes against the security of the State.\" Those convicted of Communist activity were subject to execution, and faced having their property confiscated.\nSocial and economic policies.\nDuvalier employed intimidation, repression, and patronage to supplant the old mulatto elites with a new elite of his own making. Corruption\u2014in the form of government rake-offs of industries, bribery, extortion of domestic businesses, and stolen government funds\u2014enriched the dictator's closest supporters. Most of them held sufficient power to intimidate the members of the old elite, who were gradually co-opted or eliminated.\nMany educated professionals fled Haiti for New York City, Miami, Montreal, Paris and several French-speaking African countries, exacerbating an already serious lack of doctors and teachers. Some of the highly skilled professionals joined the ranks of several UN agencies to work in development in newly independent nations such as Ivory\u00a0Coast and the Congo.\nThe government confiscated peasant landholdings and allotted them to members of the militia, who had no official salary and made their living through crime and The dispossessed fled to the slums of the capital where they would find only meager incomes to feed themselves. Malnutrition and famine became endemic.\nNonetheless, Duvalier enjoyed significant support among Haiti's majority black rural population, who saw in him a champion of their claims against the historically dominant mulatto elite. During his 14 years in power, he created a substantial black middle class, chiefly through government patronage. Duvalier also initiated the development of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier Airport with the help of US grant money. The airport is now known as Toussaint\u00a0Louverture International Airport after the leader of the Haitian Revolution.\nPersonality cult and \"Vodou\".\nDuvalier fostered his cult of personality and claimed that he was the physical embodiment of the island nation. He also revived the traditions of \"Vodou\", later using them to consolidate his power with his claim of being a \"Vodou\" priest himself. In an effort to make himself even more imposing, Duvalier deliberately modeled his image on that of Baron\u00a0Samedi, one of the \"lwa\", or spirits, of Haitian Vodou. He often donned sunglasses in order to hide his eyes and talked with the strong nasal tone associated with the \"lwa\". The regime's propaganda stated that \"Papa Doc was one with the \"lwa\", Jesus Christ and God himself\". The most celebrated image from the time shows a standing Jesus Christ with a hand on the shoulder of a seated Papa Doc, captioned, \"I have chosen him\". Duvalier declared himself an \"immaterial being\" as well as \"the Haitian flag\" soon after his first election. In 1964, he published a catechism in which the Lord's Prayer was heavily reworded to praise Duvalier instead of God.\nDuvalier also held in his closet the head of former opponent Blucher Philogenes, who tried to overthrow him in 1963. He believed another political enemy, Cl\u00e9ment Barbot, was able to change at will into a black dog and had the militia begin killing black dogs on sight in the capital.\nDeath and succession.\nFran\u00e7ois Duvalier died of heart disease and diabetes on 21 April 1971 aged 64. His 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier, nicknamed \"Baby Doc\", succeeded him as president.\nOn 8 February 1986, when the Duvalier regime fell, a crowd attacked Duvalier's mausoleum, throwing boulders at it, chipping off pieces from it, and breaking open the crypt. Duvalier's coffin was not inside, however. A prevailing rumor in the capital, according to \"The New York Times\", was that his son had removed the remains when he fled to Paris in a U.S. Air Force transport plane the day before.\nBooks and films.\nMany books have been written about the Duvalier era in Haiti, the best known of which is Graham Greene's novel \"The Comedians\". Duvalier, however, dismissed the piece and referred to its author as \"a cretin, a stool pigeon, sadistic, unbalanced, perverted, a perfect ignoramous [\"sic\"], lying to his heart's content, the shame of proud and noble England, a spy, a drug addict, and a torturer\". The book was later made into a film. Greene himself was declared \"persona non grata\" and barred from entering Haiti.\nAlan Whicker featured Duvalier in a 1969 episode of \"Whicker's World\", which included an interview with the president. Made by Yorkshire Television, the documentary is deeply revealing of Duvalier's character and of the state of Haiti in 1969.\nThe first authoritative book on the subject was \"Papa Doc: Haiti and its Dictator\" by Al Burt and Bernard Diederich, published in 1969, though several others by Haitian scholars and historians have appeared since Duvalier's death in 1971. One of the most informative, Patrick Lemoine's \"Fort\u2011Dimanche: Dungeon of Death\", dealt specifically with victims of Fort Dimanche, the prison which Duvalier used for the torture and murder of his political opponents.\nIn 2007, John Marquis wrote \"Papa Doc: Portrait of a Haitian Tyrant\", which relied in part on records from a 1968 espionage trial in Haiti to detail numerous attempts on Duvalier's life. The trial's defendant, David Knox, was a Bahamian director of information. Knox lost and was sentenced to death, but he was later granted amnesty.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70847", "revid": "35614125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70847", "title": "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy", "text": "Spectroscopic technique\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the very topmost 50\u201360 atoms, 5\u201310\u00a0nm of any surface. It belongs to the family of photoemission spectroscopies in which electron population spectra are obtained by irradiating a material with a beam of X-rays. XPS is based on the photoelectric effect that can identify the elements that exist within a material (elemental composition) or are covering its surface, as well as their chemical state, and the overall electronic structure and density of the electronic states in the material. XPS is a powerful measurement technique because it not only shows what elements are present, but also what other elements they are bonded to. The technique can be used in line profiling of the elemental composition across the surface, or in depth profiling when paired with ion-beam etching. It is often applied to study chemical processes in the materials in their as-received state or after cleavage, scraping, exposure to heat, reactive gasses or solutions, ultraviolet light, or during ion implantation.\nChemical states are inferred from the measurement of the kinetic energy and the number of the ejected electrons. XPS requires high vacuum (residual gas pressure \"p\" ~ 10\u22126 Pa) or ultra-high vacuum (p &lt; 10\u22127 Pa) conditions, although a current area of development is ambient-pressure XPS, in which samples are analyzed at pressures of a few tens of millibar.\nWhen laboratory X-ray sources are used, XPS easily detects all elements except hydrogen and helium. The detection limit is in the parts per thousand range, but parts per million (ppm) are achievable with long collection times and concentration at top surface.\nXPS is routinely used to analyze inorganic compounds, metal alloys, polymers, elements, catalysts, glasses, ceramics, paints, papers, inks, woods, plant parts, make-up, teeth, bones, medical implants, bio-materials, coatings, viscous oils, glues, ion-modified materials and many others. Somewhat less routinely XPS is used to analyze the hydrated forms of materials such as hydrogels and biological samples by freezing them in their hydrated state in an ultrapure environment, and allowing multilayers of ice to sublime away prior to analysis.\nBasic physics.\nBecause the energy of an X-ray with particular wavelength is known (for Al K\u03b1 X-rays, \"E\"photon = 1486.7 eV), and because the emitted electrons' kinetic energies are measured, the electron binding energy of each of the emitted electrons can be determined by using the photoelectric effect equation,\nformula_1,\nwhere \"E\"binding is the binding energy of the electron measured relative to the sample Fermi level, \"E\"photon is the energy of the X-ray photons being used, \"E\"kinetic is the kinetic energy of the electron as measured by the instrument (spectrometer) and formula_2 is a work function of spectrometer. This equation is essentially a conservation of energy equation. The spectrometer work function term formula_2 is a constant instrumental factor under the assumption that the sample and spectrometer have a common Fermi level, i.e., they are electrically connected, which is achieved by grounding the sample. \nHistory.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz discovered but could not explain the photoelectric effect, which was later explained in 1905 by Albert Einstein (Nobel Prize in Physics 1921). Two years after Einstein's publication, in 1907, P.D. Innes experimented with a R\u00f6ntgen tube, Helmholtz coils, a magnetic field hemisphere (an electron kinetic energy analyzer), and photographic plates, to record broad bands of emitted electrons as a function of velocity, in effect recording the first XPS spectrum. Other researchers, including Henry Moseley, Rawlinson and Robinson, independently performed various experiments to sort out the details in the broad bands. After WWII, Kai Siegbahn and his research group in Uppsala (Sweden) developed several significant improvements in the equipment, and in 1954 recorded the first high-energy-resolution XPS spectrum of cleaved sodium chloride (NaCl), revealing the potential of XPS. A few years later in 1967, Siegbahn published a comprehensive study of XPS, bringing instant recognition of the utility of XPS and also the first hard X-ray photoemission experiments, which he referred to as Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). In cooperation with Siegbahn, a small group of engineers (Mike Kelly, Charles Bryson, Lavier Faye, Robert Chaney) at Hewlett-Packard in the US, produced the first commercial monochromatic XPS instrument in 1969. Siegbahn received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1981, to acknowledge his extensive efforts to develop XPS into a useful analytical tool. In parallel with Siegbahn's work, David Turner at Imperial College London (and later at Oxford University) developed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for molecular species using helium lamps.\nMeasurement.\nA typical XPS spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected at a specific binding energy. Each element produces a set of characteristic XPS peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron configuration of the electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1\"s\", 2\"s\", 2\"p\", 3\"s\", etc. The number of detected electrons in each peak is directly related to the amount of element within the XPS sampling volume. To generate atomic percentage values, each raw XPS signal is corrected by dividing the intensity by a \"relative sensitivity factor\" (RSF), and normalized over all of the elements detected. Since hydrogen is not detected, these atomic percentages exclude hydrogen.\nQuantitative accuracy and precision.\nXPS is widely used to generate an empirical formula because it readily yields excellent quantitative accuracy from homogeneous solid-state materials. Absolute quantification requires the use of certified (or independently verified) standard samples, and is generally more challenging, and less common. Relative quantification involves comparisons between several samples in a set for which one or more analytes are varied while all other components (the sample matrix) are held constant. Quantitative accuracy depends on several parameters such as: signal-to-noise ratio, peak intensity, accuracy of relative sensitivity factors, correction for electron transmission function, surface volume homogeneity, correction for energy dependence of electron mean free path, and degree of sample degradation due to analysis. Under optimal conditions, the quantitative accuracy of the atomic percent (at%) values calculated from the major XPS peaks is 90\u201395% for each peak. The quantitative accuracy for the weaker XPS signals, that have peak intensities 10\u201320% of the strongest signal, are 60\u201380% of the true value, and depend upon the amount of effort used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (for example by signal averaging). Quantitative precision (the ability to repeat a measurement and obtain the same result) is an essential consideration for proper reporting of quantitative results.\nDetection limits.\nDetection limits may vary greatly with the cross section of the core state of interest and the background signal level. In general, photoelectron cross sections increase with atomic number. The background increases with the atomic number of the matrix constituents as well as the binding energy, because of secondary emitted electrons. For example, in the case of gold on silicon where the high cross section Au4f peak is at a higher kinetic energy than the major silicon peaks, it sits on a very low background and detection limits of 1ppm or better may be achieved with reasonable acquisition times. Conversely for silicon on gold, where the modest cross section Si2p line sits on the large background below the Au4f lines, detection limits would be much worse for the same acquisition time. Detection limits are often quoted as 0.1\u20131.0 % atomic percent (0.1% = 1 part per thousand = 1000 ppm) for practical analyses, but lower limits may be achieved in many circumstances.\nDegradation during analysis.\nDegradation depends on the sensitivity of the material to the wavelength of X-rays used, the total dose of the X-rays, the temperature of the surface and the level of the vacuum. Metals, alloys, ceramics and most glasses are not measurably degraded by either non-monochromatic or monochromatic X-rays. Some, but not all, polymers, catalysts, certain highly oxygenated compounds, various inorganic compounds and fine organics are. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources produce a significant amount of high energy Bremsstrahlung X-rays (1\u201315 keV of energy) which directly degrade the surface chemistry of various materials. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources also produce a significant amount of heat (100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C) on the surface of the sample because the anode that produces the X-rays is typically only 1 to away from the sample. This level of heat, when combined with the Bremsstrahlung X-rays, acts to increase the amount and rate of degradation for certain materials. Monochromatised X-ray sources, because they are farther away (50\u2013100\u00a0cm) from the sample, do not produce noticeable heat effects. In those, a quartz monochromator system diffracts the Bremsstrahlung X-rays out of the X-ray beam, which means the sample is only exposed to one narrow band of X-ray energy. For example, if aluminum K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.43 eV, centered on 1,486.7 eV (\"E\"/\u0394\"E\" = 3,457). If magnesium K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.36 eV, centered on 1,253.7 eV (\"E\"/\u0394\"E\" = 3,483). These are the intrinsic X-ray line widths; the range of energies to which the sample is exposed depends on the quality and optimization of the X-ray monochromator. Because the vacuum removes various gases (e.g., O2, CO) and liquids (e.g., water, alcohol, solvents, etc.) that were initially trapped within or on the surface of the sample, the chemistry and morphology of the surface will continue to change until the surface achieves a steady state. This type of degradation is sometimes difficult to detect.\nMeasured area.\nMeasured area depends on instrument design. The minimum analysis area ranges from 10 to 200 micrometres. Largest size for a monochromatic beam of X-rays is 1\u20135\u00a0mm. Non-monochromatic beams are 10\u201350\u00a0mm in diameter. Spectroscopic image resolution levels of 200\u00a0nm or below has been achieved on latest imaging XPS instruments using synchrotron radiation as X-ray source.\nSample size limits.\nInstruments accept small (mm range) and large samples (cm range), e.g. wafers. The limiting factor is the design of the sample holder, the sample transfer, and the size of the vacuum chamber. Large samples are laterally moved in x and y direction to analyze \nwider area. \nAnalysis time.\nTypically ranging 1\u201320 minutes for a broad survey scan that measures the amount of all detectable elements, typically 1\u201315 minutes for high resolution scan that reveal chemical state differences (for a high signal/noise ratio for count area result often requires multiple sweeps of the region of interest), 1\u20134 hours for a depth profile that measures 4\u20135 elements as a function of etched depth (this process time can vary the most as many factors will play a role). The time to complete a measurement is generally dependent on the brilliance of the X-ray source.\nSurface sensitivity.\nXPS detects only electrons that have actually escaped from the sample into the vacuum of the instrument. In order to escape from the sample, a photoelectron must travel through the sample. Photo-emitted electrons can undergo inelastic collisions, recombination, excitation of the sample, recapture or trapping in various excited states within the material, all of which can reduce the number of escaping photoelectrons. These effects appear as an exponential attenuation function as the depth increases, making the signals detected from analytes at the surface much stronger than the signals detected from analytes deeper below the sample surface. Thus, the signal measured by XPS is an exponentially surface-weighted signal, and this fact can be used to estimate analyte depths in layered materials.\nChemical states and chemical shift.\nThe ability to produce chemical state information, i.e. the local bonding environment of an atomic species in question from the topmost few nanometers of the sample makes XPS a unique and valuable tool for understanding the chemistry of the surface. The local bonding environment is affected by the formal oxidation state, the identity of its nearest-neighbor atoms, and its bonding hybridization to the nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor atoms. For example, while the nominal binding energy of the C1\"s\" electron is 284.6 eV, subtle but reproducible shifts in the actual binding energy, the so-called \"chemical shift\" (analogous to NMR spectroscopy), provide the chemical state information.\nChemical-state analysis is widely used for carbon. It reveals the presence or absence of the chemical states of carbon, in approximate order of increasing binding energy, as: carbide (-C2\u2212), silane (-Si-CH3), methylene/methyl/hydrocarbon (-CH2-CH2-, CH3-CH2-, and -CH=CH-), amine (-CH2-NH2), alcohol (-C-OH), ketone (-C=O), organic ester (-COOR), carbonate (-CO32\u2212), monofluoro-hydrocarbon (-CFH-CH2-), difluoro-hydrocarbon (-CF2-CH2-), and trifluorocarbon (-CH2-CF3), to name but a few.\nChemical state analysis of the surface of a silicon wafer reveals chemical shifts due to different formal oxidation states, such as: n-doped silicon and p-doped silicon (metallic silicon), silicon suboxide (Si2O), silicon monoxide (SiO), Si2O3, and silicon dioxide (SiO2). An example of this is seen in the figure \"High-resolution spectrum of an oxidized silicon wafer in the energy range of the Si 2\"p\" signal\".\nInstrumentation.\nThe main components of an XPS system are the source of X-rays, an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with mu-metal magnetic shielding, an electron collection lens, an electron energy analyzer, an electron detector system, a sample introduction chamber, sample mounts, a sample stage with the ability to heat or cool the sample, and a set of stage manipulators.\nThe most prevalent electron spectrometer for XPS is the hemispherical electron analyzer. They have high energy resolution and spatial selection of the emitted electrons. Sometimes, however, much simpler electron energy filters \u2013 the cylindrical mirror analyzers are used, most often for checking the elemental composition of the surface. They represent a trade-off between the need for high count rates and high angular/energy resolution. This type consists of two co-axial cylinders placed in front of the sample, the inner one being held at a positive potential, while the outer cylinder is held at a negative potential. Only the electrons with the right energy can pass through this setup and are detected at the end. The count rates are high but the resolution (both in energy and angle) is poor.\nElectrons are detected using electron multipliers: a single channeltron for single energy detection, or arrays of channeltrons and microchannel plates for parallel acquisition. These devices consists of a glass channel with a resistive coating on the inside. A high voltage is applied between the front and the end. An incoming electron is accelerated to the wall, where it removes more electrons, in such a way that an electron avalanche is created, until a measurable current pulse is obtained.\nLaboratory based XPS.\nIn laboratory systems, either 10\u201330\u00a0mm beam diameter non-monochromatic Al K\u03b1 or Mg K\u03b1 anode radiation is used, or a focused 20\u2013500 micrometer diameter beam single wavelength Al K\u03b1 monochromatised radiation. Monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-rays are normally produced by diffracting and focusing a beam of non-monochromatic X-rays off of a thin disc of natural, crystalline quartz with a &lt;1010&gt; orientation. The resulting wavelength is 8.3386 angstroms (0.83386\u00a0nm) corresponding to a 1486.7 eV photon energy. Aluminum K\u03b1 X-rays have an intrinsic full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.43 eV, centered at 1486.7 eV (\"E\"/\u0394\"E\" = 3457). For a well\u2013optimized monochromator, the energy width of the monochromated aluminum K\u03b1 X-rays is 0.16 eV, but energy broadening in common electron energy analyzers (spectrometers) produces an ultimate energy resolution on the order of FWHM=0.25 eV which is the ultimate energy resolution of most commercial systems. Under practical conditions, high energy-resolution settings produce peak widths (FWHM) between 0.4 and 0.6 eV for various elements and some compounds. For example, in a spectrum obtained for one minute at 20 eV pass energy using monochromated aluminum K\u03b1 X-rays, the Ag 3\"d\"5/2 peak for a clean silver film or foil will typically have a FWHM of 0.45 eV. Non-monochromatic magnesium X-rays have a wavelength of 9.89 angstroms (0.989\u00a0nm) which corresponds to a photon energy of 1253 eV. The energy width of the non-monochromated X-ray is roughly 0.70 eV, which is the ultimate energy resolution of a system using non-monochromatic X-rays. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources do not use any crystal to diffract the X-rays allowing all primary X-rays lines and the full range of high-energy Bremsstrahlung X-rays (1\u201312 keV) to reach the surface. The ultimate energy resolution (FWHM) when using a non-monochromatic Mg K\u03b1 source is 0.9\u20131.0 eV, which includes some contribution from spectrometer-induced broadening.\nSynchrotron based XPS.\nA breakthrough has been brought about in the last decades by the development of large scale synchrotron radiation facilities. Here, bunches of relativistic electrons kept in orbit inside a storage ring are accelerated through bending magnets or insertion devices like wigglers and undulators to produce a high brilliance and high flux photon beam. The beam is orders of magnitude more intense and better collimated than typically produced by anode-based sources. Synchrotron radiation is also tunable over a wide wavelength range, and can be made polarized in several distinct ways. This way, photon can be selected yielding optimum photoionization cross-sections for probing a particular core level. The high photon flux, in addition, makes it possible to perform XPS experiments also from low density atomic species, such as molecular and atomic adsorbates.\nSemiconductor manufacturing XPS.\nSemiconductor manufacturing nodes prior to the 90 nm process node tended to use silicon dioxide or oxide-nitride-oxide stacks for the transistor gate, which could be controlled using optical techniques such as ellipsometry. For some technology designs beginning with the 90nm process node, compositional analysis of films around the gate oxides became critical with the proliferation of plasma nitride SiON gate dielectrics. During this period it was found that small shifts in the nitride composition of the transistor gate resulted in undesirable shifts to the electrical properties of the devices being manufactured. XPS metrology tools designed to be used in the factory during the processing of the wafers are well suited for the measurement and control of the composition of these SiON films. By the 65 nm process node high-\u03ba materials were being used regularly in the semiconductor industry and XPS tooling in the factory became more commonplace to add capability compared with traditional optical techniques. These tools have also found use on thin metal films such as Aluminum oxide and Titanium Nitride to ensure uniform compositions over time as well as to monitor any contaminants, both of which may impact the desired electrical characteristics (for example, Titanium to Nitrogen ratio, or oxygen concentration within an aluminum film).\nWhile inline semiconductor XPS metrology tools share the same basic principles as their laboratory based counterparts, these automated tools are more limited in functionality and capability. These tools do not have the ability to adjust the beam angle, and the beam size is reduced to enable the measurement to take place on small test structures on the wafer, further reducing the intensity available. Due to the high vacuum required for the electron beam and sample chamber, throughput (measured in wafers per hour) is significantly reduced compared with traditional optical based techniques used to measure thickness and is therefore undesirable to use unless compositional analysis is necessary for control.\nMore recent iterations of inline semiconductor XPS tools have begun to incorporate a secondary X-ray fluorescence (XRF) detector to enable the measurement of films which would normally be too thick for traditional XPS tooling. Because XPS tools generate X-rays with an Aluminum source, these are considered low energy XRF tools, and are therefore not as capable as the heavy element sources found in traditional XRF tooling both in terms of total depth penetration as well as which materials are possible to measure.\nData processing.\nPeak identification.\nThe number of peaks produced by a single element varies from 1 to more than 20. Tables of binding energies that identify the shell and spin-orbit of each peak produced by a given element are included with modern XPS instruments, and can be found in various handbooks and websites. Because these experimentally determined energies are characteristic of specific elements, they can be directly used to identify experimentally measured peaks of a material with unknown elemental composition.\nBefore beginning the process of peak identification, the analyst must determine if the binding energies of the unprocessed survey spectrum (0\u20131400 eV) have or have not been shifted due to a positive or negative surface charge. This is most often done by looking for two peaks that are due to the presence of carbon and oxygen.\nCharge referencing insulators.\nCharge referencing is needed when a sample suffers a charge induced shift of experimental binding energies to obtain meaningful binding energies from both wide-scan, high sensitivity (low energy resolution) survey spectra (0\u20131100 eV), and also narrow-scan, chemical state (high energy resolution) spectra. Charge induced shifting is normally due to a modest excess of low voltage (\u22121 to \u221220 eV) electrons attached to the surface, or a modest shortage of electrons (+1 to +15 eV) within the top 1\u201312\u00a0nm of the sample caused by the loss of photo-emitted electrons. If, by chance, the charging of the surface is excessively positive, then the spectrum might appear as a series of rolling hills, not sharp peaks as shown in the example spectrum.\nCharge referencing is performed by adding a \"Charge Correction\" to each of the experimentally measured peaks. Since various hydrocarbon species appear on all air-exposed surfaces, the binding energy of the hydrocarbon C (1s) XPS peak is used for the charge correction of all energies obtained from non-conductive samples or conductors that have been deliberately insulated from the sample mount. The peak is normally found between 284.5 eV and 285.5 eV. The 284.8 eV binding energy is routinely used as the reference energy for charge referencing insulators, so that the charge correction is the difference between 284.8 eV and the experimentally measured C (1s) peak position.\nConductive materials and most native oxides of conductors should never need charge referencing. Conductive materials should never be charge referenced unless the topmost layer of the sample has a thick non-conductive film. The charging effect, if needed, can also be compensated by providing suitable low energy charges to the surface by the use of low-voltage (1\u201320 eV) electron beam from an electron flood gun, UV lights, low-voltage argon ion beam with low-voltage electron beam (1\u201310 eV), aperture masks, mesh screen with low-voltage electron beams, etc.\nPeak fitting.\nThe process of peak-fitting high energy resolution XPS spectra is a mixture of scientific knowledge and experience. The process is affected by instrument design, instrument components, experimental settings and sample variables. Before starting any peak-fit effort, the analyst performing the peak-fit needs to know if the topmost 15\u00a0nm of the sample is expected to be a homogeneous material or is expected to be a mixture of materials. If the top 15\u00a0nm is a homogeneous material with only very minor amounts of adventitious carbon and adsorbed gases, then the analyst can use theoretical peak area ratios to enhance the peak-fitting process. Peak fitting results are affected by overall peak widths (at half maximum, FWHM), possible chemical shifts, peak shapes, instrument design factors and experimental settings, as well as sample properties:\nTheoretical aspects.\nQuantum mechanical treatment.\nWhen a photoemission event takes place, the following energy conservation rule holds:\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the photon energy, formula_6 is the electron binding energy (with respect to the vacuum level) prior to ionization, and formula_7 is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. If reference is taken with respect to the Fermi level (as it is typically done in photoelectron spectroscopy) formula_6 must be replaced by the sum of the binding energy relative to the Fermi level, formula_9, and the sample work function, formula_10 .\nFrom the theoretical point of view, the photoemission process from a solid can be described with a semiclassical approach, where the electromagnetic field is still treated classically, while a quantum-mechanical description is used for matter.\nThe one\u2014particle Hamiltonian for an electron subjected to an electromagnetic field is given by (in SI units):\nformula_11,\nwhere formula_12 is the electron wave function,\nformula_13 are the electron charge and mass, formula_14 is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field, and formula_15 is the unperturbed potential of the solid.\nIn the Coulomb gauge (formula_16), the vector potential commutes with the momentum operator \n(formula_17), so that the expression in brackets in the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\nformula_18\nActually, neglecting the formula_19 term in the Hamiltonian, we are disregarding possible photocurrent contributions. Such effects are generally negligible in the bulk, but may become important at the surface.\nThe quadratic term in formula_14 can be instead safely neglected, since its contribution in a typical photoemission experiment is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the first term .\nIn first-order perturbation approach, the one-electron Hamiltonian can be split into two terms, an unperturbed Hamiltonian formula_21, plus an interaction Hamiltonian formula_22, which describes the effects of the electromagnetic field:\nformula_23\nIn time-dependent perturbation theory, for an harmonic or constant perturbation, the transition rate between the initial state formula_24 and the final state formula_25 is expressed by Fermi's Golden Rule:\nformula_26,\nwhere formula_27 and formula_28 are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian in the initial and final state, respectively, and formula_5 is the photon energy. Fermi's Golden Rule uses the approximation that the perturbation acts on the system for an infinite time. This approximation is valid when the time that the perturbation acts on the system is much larger than the time needed for the transition. It should be understood that this equation needs to be integrated with the density of states formula_30 which gives:\nformula_31\nIn a real photoemission experiment the ground state core electron binding energy cannot be directly probed, because the measured one incorporates both initial state and final state effects, and the spectral linewidth is broadened owing to the finite core-hole lifetime (formula_32).\nAssuming an exponential decay probability for the core hole in the time domain (formula_33), the spectral function will have a Lorentzian shape, with a FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) formula_34 given by:\nformula_35\nFrom the theory of Fourier transforms, formula_34 and formula_32 are linked by the indeterminacy relation:\nformula_38\nThe photoemission event leaves the atom in a highly excited core ionized state, from which it can decay radiatively (fluorescence) or non-radiatively (typically by \"Auger\" decay).\nBesides Lorentzian broadening, photoemission spectra are also affected by a Gaussian broadening, whose contribution can be expressed by\nformula_39\nThe Gaussian linewidth formula_40 of the spectra depends on the experimental energy resolution, vibrational and inhomogeneous broadening.\nThe first effect is caused by the non perfect monochromaticity of the photon beam, resulting in a finite bandwidth, and by the limited resolving power of the analyzer. The vibrational component is produced by the excitation of low energy vibrational modes both in the initial and in the final state. Finally, inhomogeneous broadening can originate from the presence of unresolved core level components in the spectrum.\nTheory of core level photoemission of electrons.\nInelastic mean free path.\nIn a solid, inelastic scattering events also contribute to the photoemission process, generating electron-hole pairs which show up as a tail on the high energy side of the main photoemission peak. Due to scattering, the electron intensity can be written in the Beer\u2013Lambert form\nformula_41\nwhere formula_42 is the electronic inelastic mean free path (IMFP). Here, formula_43 is the distance to the sample surface. The IMFP generally depends rather weakly on material, but strongly on the photoelectron kinetic energy formula_44. Quantitatively we can fit the IMFP by\nformula_45\nwhere formula_46 is the thickness of one monolayer, as given by the number density formula_47 as formula_48. The above formula is a fit to a compilation of experimental data for pure elements. For anorganic and organic compounds, its numerical factors are different, see the paper by Seah and Dench (1979).\nPlasmonic effects.\nIn some cases, energy loss features due to plasmon excitations are also observed. This can either be a final state effect caused by core hole decay, which generates quantized electron wave excitations in the solid (intrinsic plasmons), or it can be due to excitations induced by photoelectrons travelling from the emitter to the surface (extrinsic plasmons).\nDue to the reduced coordination number of first-layer atoms, the plasma frequency of bulk and surface atoms are related by the following equation: \nformula_49,\nso that surface and bulk plasmons can be easily distinguished from each other.\nPlasmon states in a solid are typically localized at the surface, and can strongly affect IMFP.\nVibrational effects.\nTemperature-dependent atomic lattice vibrations, or phonons, can broaden the core level components and attenuate the interference patterns in an X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) experiment. The simplest way to account for vibrational effects is by multiplying the scattered single-photoelectron wave function formula_50 by the Debye\u2013Waller factor:\nformula_51,\nwhere formula_52 is the squared magnitude of the wave vector variation caused by scattering,\nand formula_53 is the temperature-dependent one-dimensional vibrational mean squared displacement of the formula_54 emitter. In the Debye model, the mean squared displacement is calculated in terms of the Debye temperature, formula_55, as:\nformula_56\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A partner of William Burnett from Canada, about 1802-1803 Kinzie moved with his wife and child to Chicago, where they were among the first permanent white non-indigenous settlers. Kinzie Street (400N) in Chicago is named for him. Their daughter Ellen Marion Kinzie, born in 1805, was not the first child of European descent born in the settlement. That title goes to Eulalia Pelletier, the granddaughter of Chicago's first permanent non-indigenous settler, Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable.https://\nIn 1812 Kinzie murdered Jean La Lime, who worked as an interpreter at Fort Dearborn in Chicago. This was known as \"the first murder in Chicago\".\nDuring the War of 1812, when living in Detroit, Kinzie was accused of treason by the British and imprisoned on a ship for transport to Great Britain. After escaping, he returned to American territory, settling again in Chicago by 1816. He lived there the rest of his years.\nEarly life and first family.\nKinzie was born in Quebec City, Canada (then in the Colonial Province of Quebec) to John and Anne McKenzie, Scots-Irish immigrants. His father died before Kinzie was a year old, and his mother remarried. In 1773, the boy was apprenticed to George Farnham, a silversmith. Some of the jewelry created by Kinzie has been found in archaeological digs in Ohio.\nBy 1777, Kinzie had become a trader in Detroit, where he worked for William Burnett. As a trader, he became familiar with local Native American peoples and likely learned the dominant language. He developed trading at the Kekionga, a center of the Miami people.\nIn 1785, Kinzie helped rescue two American citizens, sisters, who had been kidnapped in 1775 from Virginia by the Shawnee and adopted into the tribe. One of the girls, Margaret McKinzie, married him; her sister Elizabeth married his companion Clark. Margaret lived with Kinzie in Detroit and had three children with him. After several years, she left Kinzie and Detroit and returned to Virginia with their children. All three of the Kinzie children eventually moved as adults to Chicago.\nIn 1789, Kinzie lost his business in the Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana) and had to move further from the western U.S. frontier. The US was excluding Canadians from trade with the Native Americans in their territory. As the United States settlers continued to populate its western territory, Kinzie moved further west.\nMarriage and move to Chicago.\nOn March 10, 1798, Kinzie married again, to Eleanor Lytle McKillip. By the time they moved to Chicago, about 1802\u20131804, they had a year-old son, John. Eleanor bore him three more children in Chicago: Ellen Marion (born in 1805), Maria Indiana (1807), and Robert Allen (1810).\nIn 1804 Kinzie purchased the former house and lands of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, located near the mouth of the Chicago River. That same year, Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory appointed Kinzie as a justice of the peace.\nWar of 1812.\nAfter American citizens built Fort Dearborn, Kinzie's influence and reputation rose in the area; he was useful because of his relationship with the Native Americans. The War of 1812 began between Great Britain and the United States, and tensions rose on the northern frontier.\nIn June 1812, Kinzie killed Jean La Lime, who worked as an interpreter at Fort Dearborn. He fled to Milwaukee, then in Indian territory. While in Milwaukee, he met with pro-British Indians who were planning attacks on American settlements, including Chicago. Historians speculate that La Lime may have been informed on corruption related to purchasing supplies within the fort and thus been silenced. The case has been called \"Chicago's first murder.\" It has also been proposed that Kinzie attempted to cover up his family's early real estate transactions, substituting Francis May as the original owner (who died after eating at the son's [James] home).\nAlthough worried that Chicago would be on heightened alert, a force of as many as 500 Indians attacked the small garrison of soldiers, their support, and their families near the current intersection of 18th and Calumet, as they fled south along the lakeshore after evacuated the Fort. The Fort Dearborn attack took place on August 15, 1812, and left 53 dead, including women and children. Kinzie and his family, aided by Potawatomi Indians led by Billy Caldwell, escaped unharmed and returned to Detroit. Identifying as a British subject, Kinzie had a strong anti-American streak.\nIn 1813, the British arrested Kinzie and Jean Baptiste Chardonnay, also then living in Detroit, charging them with treason. They were accused of having corresponded with the enemy (the American General Harrison's army) while supplying gunpowder to chief Tecumseh's Indian forces, who were fighting alongside the British. Chardonnay escaped, but Kinzie was imprisoned on a ship for transport to England. When the ship was put into port in Nova Scotia to weather a storm, Kinzie escaped. He returned to American-held Detroit by 1814.\nAlthough he had previously been a British subject, Kinzie switched to the United States. He returned to Chicago with his family in 1816 and lived there until his death in 1828.\nDuring the 1820s, Kinzie served as a justice of the peace for the newly created Pike County, which at the time extended from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan.\nDeath and legacy.\nKinzie suffered a stroke on June 6, 1828, and died a few hours later. Originally buried at the Fort Dearborn Cemetery, Kinzie's remains were moved to City Cemetery in 1835. When the cemetery was closed due to concerns it could contaminate the city's water supply, Kinzie's remains were moved to Graceland Cemetery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1991.\nAfter the Conservative Party won an unexpected victory at the 1970 general election, Whitelaw was appointed as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council by Prime Minister Edward Heath. After the suspension of the Stormont Parliament resulted in the imposition of direct rule, Whitelaw served as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1972 to 1973. He also served under Heath as Secretary of State for Employment from 1973 to 1974 and as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1974 to 1975. \nWhitelaw served Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher throughout her leadership of the Conservative Party as deputy party leader. He served as \"de facto\" Deputy Prime Minister between 1979 and 1988 and as Home Secretary from 1979 to 1983. He stepped down as a Member of Parliament at the 1983 general election, and was appointed as a Member of the House of Lords. He served as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council from 1983 to 1988. He was a captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.\nEarly life.\nWhitelaw was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised at the family home, \"Monklands\", on Thurlow Road in Nairn. He never met his father, William Alexander Whitelaw, born 1892, a member of a Scottish family of the landed gentry, who died in 1919 after service in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in the First World War, when his son was still a baby. Whitelaw was brought up by his mother, Helen, a daughter of Major General Francis Russell, MP for Cheltenham and a military attach\u00e9, and his paternal grandfather William Whitelaw. One of his great-aunts by marriage, born Dorothy Sarah Disraeli, was the niece of former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.\nWhitelaw was educated first at Wixenford School, Wokingham, before passing the entrance exam to Winchester College. From there he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a blue for golf and joined the Officer Training Corps. By chance he was in a summer camp in 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World War and was granted a regular, not wartime, commission in the British Army, in the Scots Guards, later serving in the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, a separate unit from the Guards Armoured Division. He commanded Churchill tanks in Normandy during the Second World War and during Operation Bluecoat in late July 1944. His was the first Allied unit to encounter German \"Jagdpanther\" tank destroyers, being attacked by three out of the twelve Jagdpanthers which were in Normandy.\nThe battalion's second-in-command was killed when his tank was hit in front of Whitelaw's eyes; Whitelaw succeeded to this position, holding it, with the rank of major, throughout the advance through the Netherlands into Germany and until the end of the war. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions at Caumont; a photograph of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery pinning the medal to his chest appears in his memoirs. After the end of the war in Europe, Whitelaw's unit was to have taken part in the invasion of Japan, but the Pacific War ended before this. Instead he was posted to Palestine, before leaving the army in 1946 to take care of the family estates of Gartshore and Woodhall in Lanarkshire, which he inherited on the death of his grandfather.\nPolitical career.\nFollowing early defeats as a candidate for the constituency of East Dunbartonshire in 1950 and 1951, Whitelaw was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Penrith and The Border at the 1955 general election and represented that constituency for 28 years. He held his first government posts under Harold Macmillan as a Lord of the Treasury (government whip) between 1961 and 1962 and then under Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour between 1962 and 1964. After the Conservatives lost the 1964 election, Douglas-Home appointed Whitelaw as Opposition Chief Whip. He was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1967.\nHeath government, 1970\u20131974.\nWhen the Conservatives returned to power in 1970 under Edward Heath, Whitelaw was made Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. Upon the imposition of direct rule in March 1972, he became the first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, serving in that capacity until November 1973. During his time in Northern Ireland he introduced Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners. He attempted to negotiate with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, meeting its Chief of Staff Se\u00e1n Mac Stiof\u00e1in in July 1972. The talks ended in an agreement to change from a seven-day truce to an open-ended truce; however, this did not last long. As a briefing for prime minister Heath later noted, Whitelaw \"found the experience of meeting and talking to Mr Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in very unpleasant\". Mac Stiof\u00e1in in his memoir complimented Whitelaw, saying he was the only Englishman ever to pronounce his name in Irish correctly.\nIn 1973, Whitelaw left Northern Ireland\u2014shortly before the Sunningdale Agreement was reached\u2014to become Secretary of State for Employment, and confronted the National Union of Mineworkers over its pay demands. This dispute was followed by the Conservative Party losing the February 1974 general election. Also in 1974, Whitelaw became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.\nIn opposition, 1974\u20131979.\nSoon after Harold Wilson's Labour Party returned to government, Heath appointed Whitelaw as deputy leader of the opposition and chairman of the Conservative Party. Following a second defeat in the October 1974 general election, during which Whitelaw had accused Wilson of going \"round and round the country stirring up apathy\", Heath was forced to call a leadership election in 1975. Whitelaw loyally refused to run against Heath; however, and to widespread surprise, Margaret Thatcher narrowly defeated Heath in the first round. Whitelaw stood in his place and lost convincingly against Thatcher in the second round. The vote polarised along right\u2013left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects.\nWhitelaw managed to maintain his position as deputy leader until the 1979 general election, when he was appointed Home Secretary. In an unofficial capacity, he also served as Deputy Prime Minister in Thatcher's new government.\nHome Secretary, 1979\u20131983.\nThatcher admired Whitelaw and appointed him Home Secretary in her first Cabinet, later writing of him \"Willie is a big man in character as well as physically. He wanted the success of the Government which from the first he accepted would be guided by my general philosophy. Once he had pledged his loyalty, he never withdrew it\". Thatcher was rumoured to have said that \"every Prime Minister needs a Willie\" and Whitelaw was seen as Thatcher's \"de facto\" Deputy Prime Minister between 1979 and 1988 (though he never formally held the office), to the extent that the then Cabinet Secretary, Robert Armstrong, said that had Thatcher been killed in the Brighton hotel bombing, he thought he would have advised Queen Elizabeth II to send for Whitelaw.\nAs home secretary, Whitelaw adopted a hard-line approach to law and order. He improved police pay and embarked upon a programme of extensive prison building. His four-year tenure in office, however, was generally perceived as a troubled one. His much vaunted \"short, sharp shock\" policy, whereby convicted young offenders were detained in secure units and subjected to quasi-military discipline, won approval from the public but proved expensive to implement. He was home secretary during the six-day Iranian Embassy siege in April\u2013May 1980.\nIn March 1981, he approved Wolverhampton Metropolitan Borough Council's 14-day ban on political marches in the borough in response to a planned National Front demonstration there.\nInner city decay, unemployment and what was perceived at the time as heavy-handed policing of ethnic minorities (notably the application of what some called the \"notorious\" sus law) sparked major riots in London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Leeds, and a spate of disturbances elsewhere. The Provisional IRA escalated its bombing campaign in England.\nHe contemplated resigning after an intruder broke into the Queen's bedroom in 1982 but was dissuaded from doing so. \"We couldn't do without Willie,\" Margaret Thatcher reflected in later years. \"He was a wonderful person.\"\nLeader of the House of Lords, 1983\u20131988.\nTwo days after the 1983 general election, Whitelaw received a hereditary peerage (the first created for 18 years) as Viscount Whitelaw, of Penrith in the County of Cumbria. Thatcher appointed him Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords. Lord Whitelaw faced many challenges in attempting to manage the House of Lords, facing a major defeat over abolition of the Greater London Council within a year of taking over. However, his patrician and moderate style appealed to Conservative peers and his tenure is considered a success.\nDuring his period as her deputy and as Leader of the Lords, Thatcher relied on Whitelaw heavily; she famously announced that \"every prime minister needs a Willie\". He chaired the \"star chamber\" committee that settled the annual disputes between the limited resources made available by Treasury and the spending demands of other government departments. It was Whitelaw, in November 1980, who managed to dissuade Thatcher from going to Leeds to take charge of the Yorkshire Ripper investigation personally.\nResignation.\nFollowing a stroke in December 1987, he felt he had no choice but to resign. Nicholas Ridley argued that Whitelaw's retirement marked the beginning of the end of the Thatcher premiership, as he was no longer around as often to give sensible advice and to moderate her stance on issues, or to maintain a consensus of support in her own Cabinet and parliamentary party. He resigned from the Cabinet on 10 January 1988.\nMarriage and children.\nWhitelaw was married in 1943 to Cecilia Doriel Sprot (later Celia, Viscountess Whitelaw) (1917-2011), a philanthropist, charity worker and horticulturist who had been an ATS volunteer during the Second World War. They had four daughters:\nRetirement and death.\nDuring his retirement and until his death, Whitelaw was the chairman of the board of Governors at St Bees School, Cumbria. He was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1990. He formally resigned as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party in 1991; a farewell dinner was held in his honour on 7 August 1991.\nAfter several years of declining health, Whitelaw died from natural causes at Ennim, his home in Blencow, on 1 July 1999, shortly after his 81st birthday. He had been married for 56 years. Although Whitelaw was given a hereditary peerage, the title became extinct on his death as his daughters were unable to inherit. His home for many years was the mansion of Ennim, just outside the village of Great Blencow near Penrith, Cumbria. He was buried at St. Andrew's Parish Church, Dacre, Cumbria. Whitelaw was an active freemason.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien\nSmith of Wootton Major, first published in 1967, is a novella by J. R. R. Tolkien. It tells the tale of a Great Cake, baked for the once in twenty-four year Feast of Good Children. The Master Cook, Nokes, hides some trinkets in the cake for the children to find; one is a star he found in an old spice box. A boy, Smith, swallows the star. On his tenth birthday the star appears on his forehead, and he starts to roam the Land of Faery. After twenty-four years the Feast comes around again, and Smith surrenders the star to Alf, the new Master Cook. Alf bakes the star into a new Great Cake for another child to find.\nScholars have differed on whether the story is an allegory or is, less tightly, capable of various allegorical interpretations; and if so, what those interpretations might be. Suggestions have included autobiographical allusions such as to Tolkien's profession of philology, and religious interpretations such as that Alf is a figure of Christ. The American scholar Verlyn Flieger sees it instead as a story of Fa\u00ebrie in its own right.\nThis was Tolkien's last major work published before his death in 1973.\nBackground.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien was a scholar of English literature, a philologist and medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages, especially that of Anglo-Saxon England and Northern Europe.\n\"Smith of Wootton Major\" began as an attempt to explain the meaning of Faery by means of a story about a cook and his cake, and Tolkien originally thought to call it \"The Great Cake\". It was intended to be part of a preface by Tolkien to George MacDonald's fairy story \"The Golden Key\".\nPlot summary.\nThe village of Wootton Major was well known around the countryside for its annual festivals, which were particularly famous for their culinary delights. The biggest festival of all was the Feast of Good Children. This festival was celebrated only once every twenty-four years: twenty-four children of the village were invited to a party, and the highlight of the party was the Great Cake, a career milestone by which Master Cooks were judged. In the year the story begins, the Master Cook was Nokes, who had landed the position more or less by default; he delegated much of the creative work to his apprentice Alf. Nokes crowned his Great Cake with a little doll jokingly representing the Queen of Faery. Various trinkets were hidden in the cake for the children to find; one of these was a star the Cook discovered in the old spice box.\nThe star was not found at the Feast, but was swallowed by a blacksmith's son. The boy did not feel its magical properties at once, but on the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on his forehead, and became his passport to Faery. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith like his father, but in his free time he roamed the Land of Faery. The star on his forehead protected him from many of the dangers threatening mortals in that land, and the Folk of Faery called him \"Starbrow\". The book describes his many travels in Faery, until at last he meets the true Queen of Faery. The identity of the King is also revealed.\nThe time came for another Feast of Good Children. Smith had possessed his gift for most of his life, and the time had come to pass it on to some other child. So he regretfully surrendered the star to Alf, and with it his adventures into Faery. Alf, who had become Master Cook long before, baked it into the festive cake once again for another child to find. After the feast, Alf retired and left the village; and Smith returned to his forge to teach his craft to his now-grown son.\nPublication history.\nThe story was first published in the United Kingdom as a stand-alone book by George Allen &amp; Unwin on 9 November 1967, with 11 black and white illustrations and a coloured jacket illustration by Pauline Baynes. Tolkien had asked Baynes to limit her palette to black and white, as she had done for \"Farmer Giles of Ham\"; he was pleased with the result.\n\"Smith of Wootton Major\" was first published in the United States by Houghton Mifflin the same year. It was reprinted in 1969 by Ballantine together with \"Farmer Giles of Ham\".\nThe 2005 edition, edited by Verlyn Flieger, includes a previously unpublished essay by Tolkien, explaining the background and just why the elf-king spent so long in Wootton Major. It also explains how the story grew from this first idea into the published version.\nThe story was republished in 2021 together with \"Farmer Giles of Ham\", \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", and \"Leaf by Niggle\" as \"Tales from the Perilous Realm\".\nAnalysis.\nAllegory.\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that \"defeat hangs heavy\" in the story, while Tolkien called it \"an old man's book\", with presage of bereavement. Shippey adds that when Tolkien presents images of himself in his writings, as with Niggle, the anti-hero of \"Leaf by Niggle\" and Smith, there is \"a persistent streak of alienation\". While Tolkien had stated that the story was \"not 'allegory'\", he had immediately added \"though it is capable of course of allegorical interpretation at certain points\". Shippey presents evidence in support of the claim.\nCapable of allegorical interpretation.\nJosh B. Long, in \"Tolkien Studies\", states that for Tolkien, \"allegorical interpretation\" was not the same as allegory, as interpretations come from a free interchange between text and reader, whereas allegory is imposed by the author. Long sees both religious \"undertones\" in the story, and autobiographical elements. He notes that the Catholic writer Joseph Pearce took the story as a parable, and that Flieger accepts \"a level of allegory\" but not the philological version proposed by Shippey. Instead, the Hall would be the church, Cook would be the parson, and cooking would be \"personal religion\". Or, Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans suggest, Alf is a figure of Christ, the king of a heavenly realm who arrives as a child and grows to be a man. Martin Sternberg sees the story as religious, with experiences of the numinous and \"traditional mystical ideas and motifs\". Long's interpretation likens the story's Faery Queen to the Virgin Mary, with the lilies \"near the lawn\" as her symbol; Alf as Christ; the Great Cake perhaps as a Twelfth-cake for Epiphany; Nokes as a fool or \"a kind of anti-Tolkien\"; and Smith, a \"lay Christian\".\nVisit to Fa\u00ebrie.\nFlieger opposes viewing \"Smith of Wootton Major\" as an allegory, instead seeking comparisons with Tolkien's other fantasies. She argues that the story had sufficient \"bounce\" that no allegorical explanation was necessary, and indeed that such explanation detracts from the story of travels in the land of \"Faery\" and the element of mystery. She likens the \"first Cook\" to a whole series of \"Tolkien's far-traveled characters\", namely Alboin Errol, Edwin Lowdham, Frodo Baggins, E\u00e4rendil, \u00c6lfwine-Eriol \"and of course Tolkien himself\u2014all the Elf-friends.\" \nFurther, Flieger sees \"thematic connections\" between the story and the \"dark power and ... echoes of a past too deep to forget\" of his poem \"The Sea-Bell\" (1962, with a history going back to his 1934 \"Looney\"). The two works share a distinctive feature: a \"prohibition against the return to Fa\u00ebrie.\" She states, however, that the two works describe the prohibition in differing moods and at different times. \"The Sea-Bell\" was written at the beginning of Tolkien's career, \"cry[ing] for lost beauty\"; \"Smith of Wootton Major\" almost at its end, \"an autumnal acceptance of things as they are\". She comments, too, that \"The Sea-Bell\" could be a \"corrective\" reply to J. M.

Wright had joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in his home town of Portadown around 1975. After spending several years in prison, he became a Protestant fundamentalist preacher. Wright resumed his UVF activities around 1986 and, in the early 1990s, replaced Robin Jackson as commander of that organisation's Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Wright was involved in the sectarian killings of up to 20 Catholics but was never convicted for any.\nIn 1994, the UVF and other paramilitary groups called a ceasefire. Wright became a staunch opponent of the Northern Ireland peace process, seeing it as a sell-out to Irish nationalists and republicans. Wright drew media attention during the Drumcree standoffs of 1995 and 1996, when he supported the Protestant Orange Order's demand to march their traditional route through the Catholic district of Portadown.\nDuring the July 1996 Drumcree crisis, Wright's unit carried out several attacks, including a sectarian murder. For breaking the ceasefire, Wright's Portadown unit was stood down by the UVF leadership. He was expelled from the UVF and threatened with assassination unless he immediately left Northern Ireland. Wright ignored these threats and formed the LVF with most of his brigade, becoming its leader. The LVF carried out a string of killings of Catholic civilians, while allegedly profiting from extortion and narcotics trafficking.\nIn January 1997, Wright was arrested for making death threats against a woman, and that March was convicted and sent to the Maze Prison. While imprisoned, Wright continued to direct the LVF. On 27 December 1997, Wright was assassinated by Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners with a gun smuggled into the prison. An inquiry into Wright's death concluded that serious failings had been shown in the prison authorities. It has been alleged that Wright was a police informant who received help from the Special Branch.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Stephen \"Billy\" Wright, named after his grandfather, was born in Wolverhampton, England on 7 July 1960 to David Wright and Sarah McKinley, Ulster Protestants from Portadown, Northern Ireland. He was the only son of five children. Before Wright's birth, his parents had moved to England when they fell out with many of their neighbours after his grandfather had challenged tradition by running as an Independent Unionist candidate and defeated the local Official Unionist MP. The Wright family had a long tradition in Northern Ireland politics; Billy's great-grandfather Robert Wright had once served as a Royal Commissioner. His father found employment in the West Midlands industrial city of Wolverhampton.\nIn 1964, the family returned to Northern Ireland and Wright soon came under the influence of his maternal uncle Cecil McKinley, a member of the Orange Order. About three years later, Wright's parents separated and his mother decided to leave her children behind when she transferred once more to England. None of the Wright siblings would ever see their mother again. Wright and his four sisters (Elizabeth, Jackie, Angela and Connie) were placed in foster care by the welfare authorities. He was raised separately from his sisters in a children's home in Mountnorris, South Armagh (a predominantly Irish republican area). Wright was brought up in the Presbyterian religion of his mother and attended church twice on Sundays. The young Wright mixed with Catholics and played Gaelic football, indicating an amicable relationship with the local Catholic, nationalist population. His family were not extreme Ulster loyalists. Wright's father, while campaigning for an inquest into his son's death, later described loyalist killings as \"abhorrent\". Two of Wright's sisters married Catholic men, one having come from County Tipperary and whom Wright liked. Wright's sister Angela maintained that he personally got on well with Catholics, and that he was only anti-Irish republican and anti-IRA. For a while David Wright cohabitated with Kathleen McVeigh, a Catholic from Garvagh.\nWhilst attending Markethill High School, Wright took a part-time job as a farm labourer where he came into contact with a number of staunchly unionist and loyalist farmers who served with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Reserve or the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The conflict known as the Troubles had been raging across Northern Ireland for about five years by this stage, and many young men such as Wright were swept up in the maelstrom of violence as the Provisional IRA ramped up its bombing campaign and sectarian killings of Catholics by loyalists continued to escalate. During this time Wright's opinions moved towards loyalism and soon he got into trouble for writing the initials \"UVF\" on a local Catholic primary school wall. When he refused to clean off the vandalism, Wright was transferred from the area and sent to live with an aunt in Portadown.\nEarly years in the UVF.\nIn the more strongly loyalist environment of Portadown, nicknamed the \"Orange Citadel\", Wright was, along with other working-class Protestant teenagers in the area, targeted by the loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as a potential recruit. On 31 July 1975, coincidentally the night following the Miami Showband killings, Wright was sworn in as a member of the Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV), the UVF's youth wing. The ceremony was conducted by swearing on the Bible placed on a table beneath the Ulster banner. He was then trained in the use of weapons and explosives. According to author and journalist Martin Dillon, Wright had been inspired by the violent deaths of UVF men Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both of whom were blown up after planting a bomb on board The Miami Showband's minibus. The popular Irish cabaret band had been returning from a performance in Banbridge in the early hours of 31 July 1975 when they were ambushed at Buskhill, County Down by armed men from the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade at a bogus military checkpoint. Along with Boyle and Somerville, three band members had died in the attack when the UVF gunmen had opened fire on the group following the premature explosion. Boyle and Somerville had allegedly served as role models for Wright. Boyle was from Portadown. However, in his 2003 work \"The Trigger Men\", Dillon broke from this version of events and instead concluded that Wright had actually been sworn into the YCV in 1974 when he was 14 years of age. Wright's sister Angela told Dillon that her brother's decision to join the UVF had in fact had nothing to do with the Miami Showband killings and Dillon then concluded that Wright had encouraged this version of events as he felt linking his own UVF membership to the activities of his heroes Boyle and Somerville added an origin myth to his own life as a loyalist killer.\nIn 1975, shortly after Wright joined the organisation, he was caught in possession of illegal weapons and sentenced to five years in a wing of HMP Maze (Maze Prison) reserved for paramilitary youth offenders. Before his imprisonment Wright was taken to Castlereagh Holding Centre, a police interrogation centre with a notorious reputation for the brutality employed during grilling. According to Wright's sister Angela, he later claimed that he had been subjected to a number of indignities by the interrogating officers, including having a pencil shoved into his rectum. During his spell in prison Wright briefly joined the blanket protest, although he stepped down following an order from the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership), who feared that prisoner participation in the protest was being interpreted as a show of solidarity with the Provisional IRA. Inside the Maze he became the wing commander of H Block 2.\nWright later claimed that his decision to join the YCV had been influenced by the Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright's cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, \"I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. I felt it was my duty to help my people and that is what I have been doing ever since.\"\nLocals say he was also \"indoctrinated\" by local loyalist paramilitaries; however he had personally come to the conclusion that the UVF was the only organisation that had the \"moral right\" to defend the Protestant people.\nWright was released from the Maze Prison in 1980. Whilst inside he had nursed a deep resentment against the British state for having imprisoned him for being a loyalist. He was met in the car park by his aunt and girlfriend. In a final act of defiance against the authorities, Wright raised his face up towards a British Army observation tower on the Maze's perimeter fence and shouted \"Up the UVF\". Following his release, he went to Scotland where he lived for a brief period. He had been there only six weeks when he was taken in for questioning by the Anti-Terrorist Squad based at New Scotland Yard. Although he was not charged with any offences, Wright was nonetheless handed an exclusion order banning him from Great Britain.\nNot long after his release from the Maze Prison, Wright was re-arrested, along with a number of UVF operatives in the area on evidence provided by Clifford McKeown, a \"supergrass\" within the movement. Wright was charged with murder, attempted murder, and the possession of explosives. He was detained in Crumlin Road Prison for ten months. The cases, however, ended without any major convictions after McKeown changed his mind and ceased giving evidence.\nBorn-again Christian.\nWright returned to Portadown and initially tried to avoid paramilitarism. He found a job as an insurance salesman and married his girlfriend Thelma Corrigan, by whom he had two daughters, Sara and Ashleen. He took in his sister Angela's son to be raised alongside his own children when she went to live in the United States. He was regarded as a good father. In 1983, he became a born again Christian and lay preacher in the Free Presbyterian Church and began working as a gospel preacher in County Armagh. He had studied Christianity whilst in prison to pass the time.\nAs a consequence of his religious conversion, Wright eschewed the highlife favoured by many of his loyalist contemporaries such as Johnny Adair and Stephen McKeag, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. He read a lot, including Irish history and theology. In particular he studied the history of Protestantism in Europe. Wright's religious faith had contradictory influences on his life. On the one hand, he argued that his faith drove him to defend the \"Protestant people of Ulster\", while at the same time, he conceded that the cold-blooded murder of non-combatant civilians would ensure his damnation. He spoke of this dilemma during an interview with Martin Dillon: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You can't glorify God and seek to glorify Ulster because the challenges which are needed are paramilitary. That's a contradiction to the life God would want you to lead. If you were to get yourself involved in paramilitary activity in its present form, or the form in which it manifested itself during the Troubles, then I don't think you could walk with God...\n...There's always the hope that in some way, someday \u2013 and there are precedents within scripture \u2013 your hope would be that God would draw you back to him. All those who have the knowledge of Christ would seek to walk with him again. People would say, 'Billy Wright, that's impossible,' but nothing's impossible if you have faith in God. I would hope that he would allow me to come back. I'm not walking with God... Without getting into doctrine, without getting too deep, it is possible to have walked with God and to fall away and still belong to God.\nWhen asked by Dillon whether or not the conflict was a religious war, he replied: \"I certainly believe religion is part of the equation. I don't think you can leave religion out of it\".\nAngela Wright later claimed that her brother had foreseen the September 11 attacks when he told her that as she was living in New York she was abiding in a \"city of sin\"; he then went on to predict that the World Trade Center towers would be destroyed from the air.\nMid-Ulster UVF commander.\nIn the late 1980s, after a five-year absence from the organisation, Wright resumed his UVF activities. This was in consequence of the November 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which angered unionists because it gave the Irish Government an advisory role in Northern Ireland's government. There were frequent raids by the RUC and British Army on his home in Portadown's Corcrain estate. Although he was arrested repeatedly on suspicion of murder and conspiracy, he never faced any charges.\nWright rapidly ascended to a position of prominence within the UVF ranks, eventually assuming leadership of the local Portadown unit. He became commander of the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s, having taken over from his mentor Robin \"the Jackal\" Jackson, who had been the leader since July 1975 and one of Wright's instructors in the use of weaponry. Jackson was implicated in the 1974 Dublin car bombings, the Miami Showband killings and a series of sectarian attacks. Founded in 1972 by its first commander Billy Hanna, the Mid-Ulster Brigade operated mainly around the Portadown and Lurgan areas. It was a self-contained, semi-autonomous unit which maintained a considerable distance from the Brigade Staff in Belfast. Holding the rank of brigadier, Wright directed up to 20 sectarian killings, according to the Northern Ireland security forces, although he was never convicted in connection with any of them.\nIn March 1991, the Mid-Ulster UVF killed three Catholic civilians in the Craigavon mobile shop shootings. The gunman shot two teenage girls in the head, then forced a male customer to lie on the pavement and shot him also. Loyalist sources later told the \"Sunday World\" newspaper the attack had been ordered and planned in Portadown by Billy Wright and Mark Fulton.\nWhile most of Wright's unit's victims were Catholic civilians, some were republican paramilitaries. On 3 March 1991, the Mid-Ulster UVF shot dead three Provisional IRA men, along with a middle-aged civilian, in an ambush outside Boyle's Bar in Cappagh, County Tyrone. Wright was widely blamed by nationalists and much of the press for having led this attack. According to Paul Larkin in his book \"A Very British Jihad: collusion, conspiracy and cover-up in Northern Ireland\", UVF members at Cappagh claimed they had to drag Wright into the car as he became so frenzied once he started shooting that he didn't want to stop. British journalist Peter Taylor, however, stated in his book \"Loyalists\" that reliable UVF sources told him Wright was not involved. The RUC arrested Wright after the shootings. During the interrogation he provided the RUC with an alibi which placed him in Dungannon when the Cappagh attack occurred, and the RUC confirmed this. Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation. \"The Guardian\" newspaper quoted him as saying, \"I would look back and say that Cappagh was probably our best\". The Cappagh attack surprised the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade, as it had been carried out in a village which was an IRA stronghold, a departure from the usual arbitrary killings of Catholic civilians. Wright boasted that he and his Mid-Ulster unit had \"put the East Tyrone Brigade of the IRA on the run\" and \"decimated\" them. But according to authors Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack in their book \"UVF: The Endgame\", the UVF leadership insists Wright was not behind the Cappagh killings, instead it was UVF units from outside Portadown and that the UVF leadership even encouraged the \"King Rat\" myth for the media to help the heat to be taken off the units who were actually responsible for the attack. Furthermore, they state the Mid-Ulster UVF is not just the Portadown unit, but that it is made up of units from Dungannon, south Londonderry, Armagh City, Cookstown, Lurgan and smaller rural units from mid-Ulster.\nThe IRA tried to kill Wright on five occasions. On 23 October 1992 they planted a bomb under his car on West Street, Portadown. Wright found the bomb, which had fallen off, after being told a man was seen crouching beside the car. In June 1994, RUC officers visited Wright to warn him that someone had been seen tampering with his car. The officers were with him while he searched his car, but found nothing. Wright then sat in the car and started it, which detonated a bomb planted in the engine and set the car on fire. He escaped with minor injuries. The North Armagh Brigade of the IRA claimed responsibility.\nAs part of the Northern Ireland peace process, the IRA called a ceasefire in July 1994. This was followed by the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) calling a ceasefire on 13 October 1994. Wright was initially caught up in the euphoria, calling it \"the happiest day of my life\". However he became skeptical of the IRA's ceasefire, and soon he publicly disagreed with the UVF leadership calling their ceasefire. Wright \"detested what he saw as concessions to [Irish] nationalists enshrined in the tentative peace process, and accused the leaders of unionism and loyalism of betraying the cause\". He eventually denounced the peace process as a sell-out.\nJournalist Susan McKay, writing in \"The Guardian\", was one of the first to report that Wright at this time ran a lucrative protection racket and was one of the most significant drug dealers in the Portadown area, primarily in ecstasy.\nKing Rat.\nWright's unit called themselves the \"Brat pack\". The nickname \"King Rat\" was first given to Wright by the Mid-Ulster Ulster Defence Association (UDA) commander Robert John Kerr as a form of pub bantering. According to journalist and author Paul Larkin, Kerr sat inside a pub and jokingly bestowed a nickname on each patron as they entered. When Wright walked through the door, Kerr gave him the sobriquet of \"King Rat\". \"Sunday World\" journalists Martin O'Hagan and Jim Campbell picked up on it and satirically named them the \"rat pack\"; they also used the name \"King Rat\" to identify Wright. Much to Wright's annoyance, the name became popular with the media. In response, Wright had the newspaper's offices bombed and issued a death threat to O'Hagan and anyone who worked for the paper.\nIn an interview with Martin Dillon, he blamed the police raids, republican death threats and the \"King Rat\" nickname as factors which eventually caused the break-up of his marriage. He nevertheless maintained cordial relations with his ex-wife, Thelma, whom he described as a \"good Christian\".\nDrumcree standoff.\nThe Drumcree conflict, stemming from an Orange Order protest at Drumcree Church after their parade had been banned from marching through the predominantly nationalist Catholic Garvaghy area of Portadown, returned to the headlines in 1995 with trouble expected in Wright's Portadown stronghold. Just before the July marching season Irish government representative Fergus Finlay held a meeting with Wright in which the latter pledged his loyalty to the peace process and David Ervine in particular, although Wright also warned Finlay that loyalist views had to be respected. Cracks began to show however as Wright felt that the UVF response to the trouble had been inordinately low-key whilst his taste for the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) strategy also began to wane as the party moved increasingly towards a form of socialism, an ideology repugnant to Wright. A further problem arose when Wright, who by that time was a popular loyalist figure across Northern Ireland, travelled to the Shankill Road in Belfast in late 1995 to try to overturn a ban preventing an Orange Order parade entering a neighbouring Catholic area. Wright had hoped to bring local UVF units onto the streets of the Shankill to force an overturning of the ban but the Shankill commanders refused to put their units at Wright's disposal, having assured the British authorities that they would not in a series of secret negotiations. Wright returned to Portadown in disgust, accusing the Belfast UVF of having surrendered. Nonetheless, when Wright was arrested in late 1995 for intimidation he was still on good terms with the UVF, whose magazine \"Combat\" called for his release.\nIn January 1996, Wright once again travelled to Belfast where he dropped a verbal bombshell by announcing that the Mid-Ulster Brigade would no longer operate under the authority of the Brigade Staff. That same year Wright was ordered to attend a meeting called by the Brigade Staff at \"the Eagle\", their headquarters above a chip shop (bearing the same name) on the Shankill Road, to answer charges of alleged drug dealing and being a police informer. The latter accusation came about after the loss of a substantial amount of weapons from the Mid-Ulster Brigade and a large number of its members had been arrested. Wright refused to attend and continued to flout Brigade Staff authority.\nFollowing the decision by RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley to ban the Orange parade through the Garvaghy Road area of Portadown in the summer of 1996, a protest campaign of road blockages and general disruption was organised across Northern Ireland by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The protests, which led to a reversal of the ban, saw no official UVF involvement although Wright, despite not being a member of the Orange Order, was personally involved and led a sizeable force of his men to Drumcree. Wright and the Mid-Ulster Brigade attracted considerable attention from the global media as they made a show of strength and defended the Orangemen's right to march their traditional route. The brigade manned the barricades, and brought homemade weapons to the church; among these was a mechanical digger and a petrol tanker. There was intelligence that Wright and his unit had planned to attack the British Army and police who were blocking the Orangemen's passage. Television cameras broadcast Wright directing rioters on Drumcree hill against the security forces. Wright even held a meeting with one of the central figures in the operation, UUP leader David Trimble, and he was often seen in the company of Harold Gracey, Grand Master of the Portadown District Orange Lodge.\nWright stood around , had close-cropped blond hair and cold, pale blue eyes.\nPeter Taylor had been at Drumcree that July and got a close-up view of Wright. Taylor described Wright as a \"charismatic leader\". Clad in neat jeans, white T-shirt and wearing a single gold earring, he displayed a muscular build. Flanked by two bodyguards, Wright's sudden appearance at Drumcree had inspired much admiration from the young boys and girls who were present. Journalist David McKittrick in the \"Belfast Telegraph\" described Wright as having been heavily tattooed, who walked with a \"characteristic strut that radiated restrained menace\"; and had a \"bullet head, close-cropped with small ears and deep-set, piercing eyes\". Martin Dillon, who had interviewed him in his home in Portadown, admitted that he had been pleasant and charming throughout the interview, yet throughout the encounter Dillon had \"sensed a dark side to his character\". Wright was also considered to have been a \"political thinker and capable strategist\".\nAs a result of the Belfast leadership's inaction, Wright ordered several killings on his own initiative. On 9 July 1996, at the height of the Drumcree standoff, the dead body of Catholic taxi driver, Michael McGoldrick, was found in his cab in a remote lane at Aghagallon, near Lurgan, a day after having picked up a fare in the town. He had been shot five times in the head. Both the UVF and the UDA released statements emphatically denying involvement in McGoldrick's killing. According to PUP leader David Ervine, Wright had ordered the killing for the purpose of incriminating the UVF Brigade Staff by making it appear as if they had sanctioned it. To further Wright's ploy, a handgun had been sent down to the Mid-Ulster Brigade from the Shankill UVF arms dump, but as the weapon had no forensic history the plot backfired. Several years later, Clifford McKeown, the former supergrass, was convicted of the murder of McGoldrick. McKeown, who had claimed that the killing was a birthday present for Wright, was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for his involvement in the murder.\nLeader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force.\nWright, along with the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade, was stood down on 2 August 1996 by the UVF's Brigade Staff for the unauthorised attack on McGoldrick, insubordination, and undermining the peace process. Wright was expelled from the UVF and also threatened with execution by the Combined Loyalist Military Command if he did not leave Northern Ireland.\nWright expressed the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat in an interview with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:\nMy heart goes out to my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, but at the end of the day no one will force their opinions down my throat \u2013 no one.\nOther units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the deadline attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. The security services reported that every lodge and band participating stopped near Billy Wright so that members could shake his hand. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech.\nIgnoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's \"mythical stature\" amongst loyalists \"provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF\" in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: \"I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I would like to say is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'\". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the UDA. Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.\nThey were joined by other loyalists disaffected by the peace process, giving them a maximum strength estimated at around 250 activists. They operated outside the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ignored the ceasefire order of October 1994. Wright denounced the UVF leadership as \"communists\", for the left wing inclinations of some of their public statements about reconciliation with nationalists. Wright was strongly anti-communist and his belief in this was increased by a series of meetings he held with representatives of far right Christian groups from the southern states of the US. From these meetings, organised by Pastor Kenny McClinton, Wright was introduced to conspiracy theories about the role of communists in bringing down Christian morality, ideas that appealed to him. In a somewhat similar vein, Wright also enjoyed close relations with a Bolton-based cell of activists belonging to the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 and had members of this group staying in Portadown during the build-up to the Drumcree stand-off in 1997. The UVF in its turn, regarded Wright setting up a rival loyalist organisation in the Mid-Ulster area as \"treason\". Members of the Belfast UVF often contemptuously referred to Wright as \"Billy Wrong\", with one UVF leader suggesting that Wright was motivated by \"religious zealotry and blind bigotry\". The LVF was proscribed by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam in June 1997.\nWright personally devised the LVF's codename of \"Covenant\" which was used to claim its attacks. The LVF published a document stating their aims and objectives\nThe use of the Ulster conflict as a crucible for far-reaching, fundamental and decisive change in the United Kingdom constitution. To restore Ulster's right to self-determination. To end Irish nationalist aggression against Ulster in whatever form. To end all forms of Irish interference in Ulster's internal affairs. To thwart the creation and/or implementation of any All-Ireland/All-Island political super-structure regardless of the powers vested in such institutions. To defeat the campaign of de-Britishization and Gaelicisation of Ulster's daily life.\nImprisonment.\nDespite a series of sectarian murders and attacks on Catholic property by the LVF from 1996 to early 1997 (although they were not claimed by the organisation), Wright was not arrested until January 1997. He was charged with committing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, and making death threats against a woman, Gwen Read. This threat followed an altercation with Read's family and LVF members. On 7 March he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for both offences and initially imprisoned at HMP Maghaberry. On 18 March, he was visited by DUP politician Peter Robinson (who later became First Minister of Northern Ireland in 2008). During the meeting, Wright told Robinson he believed an attempt on his life by republicans was imminent.\nHe was sent to the Maze in April 1997. He demanded and was granted an LVF section in C and D wings of H-block 6 (H6) for himself and 26 fellow inmates. INLA prisoners were housed in the A and B wings, and the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP, the political wing of the INLA) warned there would be trouble if the prisoners were not kept segregated. In August 1997, LVF prisoners, led by Wright, rioted over their visiting accommodation in the Maze.\nWright continued to direct LVF operations from the prison, although his deputy Mark \"Swinger\" Fulton served as its nominal leader. LVF membership increased during Wright's imprisonment; by October 1997, membership in the organisation was between 150 and 200, many of them former UVF members disillusioned with the ceasefire. It was afterwards discovered that he had kept an irregular diary whilst in prison. On some of the pages he had made subtle threats to Catholic human rights solicitor Rosemary Nelson (killed in 1999 by a Red Hand Defenders car bomb) and her client, IRA prisoner Colin Duffy, charged with killing two RUC constables (the charges against Duffy were later dropped). Wright's appeal was scheduled to be heard in February 1998.\nAssassination.\nA tense situation existed within the Maze Prison. INLA inmates had told staff \"they intend given a chance to take out the LVF\". The Prison Officers Association said precautions had been put in place to ensure inmates from the two groups did not come into contact with each other. Prison officers, however, had grave concerns over security measures in H Block 6, where Wright and the LVF were housed. The situation was made more volatile because, unlike the IRA, the UVF, and the UDA, neither the LVF nor the INLA were on ceasefire.\nThe decision to kill Wright inside the Maze was made in mid-December 1997 at an INLA \"Ard Chomhairle\" which was attended by the INLA Chief of Staff. The assassination was to be carried out in retaliation for the LVF killing of Catholic civilian Gerry Devlin which had taken place shortly before. On 16 December a senior INLA member who had been at the \"Ard Chomhairle\" went to the Maze to pay a visit to the Officer Commanding of the INLA at H Block 6.\nOn the morning of Saturday 27 December 1997, just before 10.00 a.m., Wright was assassinated by INLA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. The operation was undertaken by three INLA volunteers \u2013 Christopher \"Crip\" McWilliams, John \"Sonny\" Glennon and John Kennaway \u2013 armed with two smuggled pistols, a PA63 semi-automatic and a .22 Derringer. He was shot in the forecourt outside H Block 6 as he sat in the back of a prison van (alongside another LVF prisoner, Norman Green and one prison officer acting as escort) on his way to the visitor's complex where he had an arranged visit with his girlfriend, Eleanor Reilly. John Glennon had been pretending to paint a mural in the sterile area between A and B wings which placed him in a position to see and hear what happened in the forecourt. Upon hearing the announcement over the prison Tannoy system that Wright and Green had been called for their respective visits, Glennon gave a pre-arranged signal to his two waiting accomplices. They moved into position at the A wing turnstile; Glennon ran into the canteen and he mounted a table situated beneath a window which gave him a clearer view of the block forecourt. When he saw Wright entering the van at 9.59 a.m. he gave a second pre-arranged signal, which was: \"Go, go, go\".\nThe three INLA men rushed through the turnstile leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they climbed onto the roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men who jumped in front of the car, however, the driver, John Park, thinking that he and the other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were shut by a prison guard believing it to be an escape attempt. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van were armed.\nWhile an unarmed Kennaway physically restrained the driver, Glennon, armed with the Derringer, gave cover beside the van as McWilliams opened the side door on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: \"Armed INLA volunteers\". With a smile on his face, he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing the side door beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver, running to a corner. Wright had been in the middle of a conversation, discussing the \"cost of Christmas\", with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to \"fuck up and sit in his seat\" and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to \"get down\", but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He slumped against the legs of Green. After screaming \"they shot Billy\", Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was taken to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt as of INLA leadership's orders. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and on arrival in A Wing, negotiations ensued between the volunteers and prison staff, assisted by the prison chaplain. The 3 men then proceeded to hand over all equipment and materials used in the operation. The three volunteers were then arrested at the prison reception. Upon being charged, Volunteer McWilliams issued a short statement which had been agreed beforehand with the leadership of the INLA if and when the operation against Wright proved successful. This brief statement read:\nBilly Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [Maze].\nAftermath.\nThat night, LVF gunmen opened fire on a disco frequented by Catholic teenagers in Dungannon. Four civilians were wounded and one, a former Provisional IRA member, was killed. Police believed that the disco itself was the intended target.\nFour masked and armed LVF men maintained a vigil beside Wright's body which was displayed in an open coffin prior to his paramilitary funeral which took place in Portadown on 30 December. The LVF ordered all shops in the town to shut as a mark of respect; bus and taxi services were also suspended, and the Union Jack flew at half-mast. The media was kept at a distance. After a private service inside Wright's Brownstown home, the funeral cort\u00e8ge, led by a lone bagpiper, proceeded to Seagoe Cemetery, away. Thousands of mourners were in attendance as the hearse containing Wright's coffin moved through the crowded streets, flanked by a guard of honour and preceded by women bearing floral wreaths. The Reverend John Gray of the Free Presbyterian Church officiated at the graveside service. Wright's friend, the former UDA member Pastor Kenny McClinton, also delivered an oration in which he eulogised Wright as having been \"complicated, articulate, and sophisticated\". LVF gunmen fired a volley of shots over his flag-draped coffin.\nWright's close friend and deputy, Mark \"Swinger\" Fulton assumed control of the LVF leadership after Wright's death.\nThe LVF became more closely tied to the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) organisation that was led by Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair. \nThe LVF committed a series of attacks on Catholic civilians, which it termed a \"measured military response\" in response to Billy Wright's death. Other loyalist paramilitary groups also sought to avenge his killing. On 19 January 1998 the UDA's South Belfast Brigade shot dead Catholic taxi driver Larry Brennan outside his company offices in the Lower Ormeau Road. Martin O'Hagan, the \"Sunday World\" journalist whom Wright especially disliked, was killed in September 2001 by the Red Hand Defenders, a cover-name used by the UDA and LVF.\nOn 20 October 1998, Christopher McWilliams, John Glennon, and John Kennaway were convicted of murdering Billy Wright, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life. The three men had pleaded not guilty. Although they were sentenced to life imprisonment, they only served two years of their sentence due to the early release provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.\nInquiry and allegations.\nThe nature of Wright's killing, within a high security prison, has led to speculation that the authorities colluded with the INLA to have him killed as he was a danger to the emerging peace process. Four days before his death, Wright himself believed that he would shortly be killed within the Maze Prison by agents of the British and Irish governments in collusion with loyalist informers and the INLA. The INLA strongly denied these rumours, and published a detailed account of the assassination in the March/April 1999 issue of \"The Starry Plough\" newspaper. Wright's father, David, had campaigned for a public inquiry into his son's murder and had appealed for help to the Northern Ireland, British and Irish authorities for help in the matter. The murder was investigated by the Cory Collusion Inquiry and it was recommended that the UK Government launch an inquiry into the circumstances of Wright's death. The Cory Inquiry concluded that \"whatever criticism might properly be made regarding the reprehensible life and crimes of Billy Wright, it is apparent that he met his death bravely\", and described his killing as \"brutal and cowardly\".\nJune 2005 saw the Billy Wright inquiry open, chaired by Lord MacLean. Also sitting on the inquiry were academic professor Andrew Coyle from the University of London and the former Anglican Bishop of Hereford, the Right Reverend John Oliver. On 14 September 2010, the findings of the panel were released publicly at Stormont House in Belfast and found that there was no evidence of collusion between the authorities and the INLA. The inquiry, which had cost \u00a330 million, did find a number of failings within the security of the prison. There was the main question of how the weapons were smuggled inside the prison to the killers. There was also the issue regarding the decision to house the INLA and LVF in H Block 6, when it was known that they were deadly rivals, neither of which was on ceasefire, and the INLA had vowed to kill Wright given the opportunity. McWilliams and Kennaway had been transferred to the Maze from Maghaberry the previous May. One month before their transfer, when Wright had still been at Maghaberry, they had organised an unsuccessful hostage-taking incident at the prison. This was meant to end in the assassination of Wright; he was subsequently moved to the Maze. Other questions were raised after the discovery that on the morning of the killing, Prison Officer Raymond Hill was stood down from his post in the watchtower overlooking A and B wings of H-Block 6 where the INLA prisoners were housed. The CCTV camera placed in the area was also found to have been nonfunctioning for several days prior to the shooting. The visitors lists for 27 December 1997 had been circulated in both the LVF and INLA wings the day before thereby giving Wright's assassins time to prepare for the killing as the list clearly stated that Wright was scheduled to receive a visit on 27 December. The LVF prison van had been parked outside the INLA wing that morning instead of following the normal procedure which was to park outside the LVF wing. And the gates leading from the forecourt were automatically locked as soon as the killers were spotted on the roof. This had prevented the van from driving off and thus effectively trapped Wright in the rear.\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\" before his own death, one of the killers, John Kennaway said the security inside the Maze was \"a joke\". He claimed the weapons had been smuggled to McWilliams and Glennon inside nappies. He added that as soon as the \"screws\" [prison officers] had seen the INLA men on A wing's roof, they assumed the men were staging an escape and sounded the alarm system. The gates were automatically locked-down therefore preventing the van from leaving. Kennaway suggested that had the prison officers not seen them and quickly sounded the alarm, the van could have driven away in time and Wright might have escaped with his life.\nShortly before the findings of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's \"Live Tonight\" the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, \"It was obvious he [Wright] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him to get out of the country \u2013 that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared.\" When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, \"You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it \u2013 something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go \u2013 the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives\". McDonald expressed his belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.\nOn 30 September 2011, Billy's father David Wright died in Portadown at the age of 78. After his funeral service at the Killicomain Baptist Church, he was buried, like Billy, in Seagoe Cemetery. Up until his death, he had continued to profess his belief that there had been state collusion in his son's killing. He denounced the findings of the inquiry released in 2010 as a \"total whitewash and a failure to get at the truth\".\nAlleged links with RUC Special Branch.\nThere are allegations that RUC Special Branch colluded with Billy Wright, providing him with information on suspected IRA members as well as alibis and protection. Before his assassination in 2001, journalist Martin O'Hagan revealed to fellow journalist Paul Larkin that a high-ranking RUC officer had told him Wright received help from RUC Special Branch, and bore the code name \"Bertie\". Some in the UVF also suspected that Wright was a police informer. An IRA Intelligence officer told Larkin that Wright was selected and trained by Special Branch to take over from Robin Jackson, also an alleged Special Branch agent.\nA former member of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade, Laurence Maguire, claimed that police gave Wright information on targets, and that he was nearby in a car when some meetings with police took place \"up alleyways\". Maguire further claimed that the UVF believed that Wright was a \"state agent\". Two senior security sources also told a BBC \"Spotlight\" team that Wright was working for the police.\nLoyalist icon.\nFor years after his death, Wright's image adorned murals in housing estates in Portadown and elsewhere throughout Northern Ireland. However, one of the most well-known of these, that on a wall near Portadown F.C.'s Shamrock Park home ground, was removed in 2006 with a mural of George Best painted in its stead. Wright is regarded as a martyr and hero by hardline loyalist bitter enders; many of whom have tattoos bearing his likeness. Some of Wright's more ardent devotees have his likeness on their private parts. His successor Mark \"Swinger\" Fulton had one tattooed over his heart. Most of these tattoos were created by a Bolton-based member of Combat 18, who tattooed many LVF supporters with Wright's image at houses in Portadown's loyalist estates whilst visiting for the Twelfth.\nOne teenage girl in North Belfast set up a shrine to Wright in her bedroom complete with his photographs. She explained to a journalist, \"I'm not interested in pop stars. Billy was a real Loyalist hero and I like to go to sleep at night looking at him\". Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: \"He [Wright] did what he had to do to ensure that our faith and culture were kept intact.\" In the immediate aftermath of Wright's killing, Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to \"avenge\" Wright's death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. In a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF, the West Belfast UDA later referenced Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF. Despite this, the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie \"Legs\" Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a \"bastard\". Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair's part as Wright was already well-established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name.\nThe \"Belfast Telegraph\" newspaper summed up Wright as having been \"one of the most fear-inspiring loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland since the Shankill Butchers in the 1970s\". Peter Taylor offered an alternative insight into the reputation of Billy Wright by suggesting that popular myth had laid many killings and atrocities at Wright's door when there was actually little evidence to back them up.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"stadtholder\" was the replacement of the duke or count of a province during the Burgundian and Habsburg period (1384 \u2013 1581/1795).\nThe title was used for the highest executive official of each province performing several duties, such as appointing lower administrators and maintaining peace and order, in the early Dutch Republic. As multiple provinces appointed the same \"stadtholder\", the \"stadtholder\" of the powerful province of Holland at times functioned as the \"de facto\" head of state of the Dutch Republic as a whole during the 16th to 18th centuries, in an effectively hereditary role. For the last half century of its existence, it became an officially hereditary title under Prince William IV of Orange. His son, Prince William V, was the last \"stadtholder\" of all provinces of the Republic, until fleeing French revolutionary troops in 1795. His son, William I of the Netherlands, in 1815 became the first sovereign king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe title \"stadtholder\" is roughly comparable to the historical titles of Lord Protector in England, Statthalter in the Holy Roman Empire and Governor-general of Norway. In English sources, it is sometimes translated as either \"steward\", \"lieutenant\" or even \"governor\".\nEtymology.\n\"Stadtholder\" means \"steward\". Its component parts literally translate as \"place holder,\" from Latin \"locum tenens\", or as a direct cognate, \"stead holder\" (in modern Dutch \"stad\" means \"city\", but the older meaning of \"stad\" \u2013 also \"stede\" \u2013 was \"place\", and it is a cognate of English \"stead\", as \"instead of\"); it was a term for a \"steward\" or \"lieutenant\". However, this is not the word for the military rank of lieutenant, which is in Dutch.\nHistory.\nSeventeen Provinces.\n\"Stadtholder\"s in the Middle Ages were appointed by feudal lords to represent them in their absence. If a lord had several dominions (or, being a vassal, fiefs), some of these could be ruled by a permanent \"stadtholder\", to whom was delegated the full authority of the lord. A \"stadtholder\" was thus more powerful than a governor, who had only limited authority, but the \"stadtholder\" was not a vassal himself, having no title to the land. The local rulers of the independent provinces of the Low Countries (which included the present-day Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) made extensive use of \"stadtholder\"s, e.g. the Duke of Guelders appointed a \"stadtholder\" to represent him in Groningen.\nIn the 15th century the Dukes of Burgundy acquired most of the Low Countries, and the constituent parts (duchies, counties, lordships) of these Burgundian Netherlands mostly each had their own \"stadtholder\", appointed by the Duke in his capacity of duke, count or lord.\nIn the 16th century, the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, also King of Spain, who had inherited the Burgundian Netherlands, completed this process by becoming the sole feudal overlord: Lord of the Netherlands. Only the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and two smaller territories (the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy and the Duchy of Bouillon) remained outside his domains. \"Stadtholder\"s continued to be appointed to represent Charles and King Philip II, his son and successor in Spain and the Low Countries (the electoral Imperial title would be held by his brother Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and his heirs in the separate Austrian branch of Habsburgs). Due to the centralist and absolutist policies of Philip, the actual power of the \"stadtholder\"s strongly diminished, compared to the \"landvoogd (es)\" or governor-general.\nDutch Republic.\nWhen, in 1581, during the Dutch Revolt, seven of the Dutch provinces declared their independence with the Act of Abjuration, the representative function of the \"stadtholder\" became obsolete in the rebellious northern Netherlands \u2013 the feudal lord himself having been abolished \u2013 but the office nevertheless continued in these provinces who now united themselves into the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The United Provinces were struggling to adapt existing feudal concepts and institutions to the new situation and tended to be conservative in this matter, as they had after all rebelled against the king to defend their ancient rights. The \"stadtholder\" no longer represented the lord but became the highest executive official, appointed by the States of each province. Although each province could assign its own \"stadtholder\", most \"stadtholder\"s held appointments from several provinces at the same time. The highest executive and legislative power was normally exerted by the sovereign States of each province, but the \"stadtholder\" had some prerogatives, such as being the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The stadtholder also appointed lower officials and sometimes had the ancient right to affirm the appointment (by co-option) of the members of regent councils or choose \"burgomasters\" from a shortlist of candidates. As these councils themselves appointed most members of the States, the \"stadtholder\" could very indirectly influence the general policy. In Zeeland, the Princes of Orange, who after the Dutch Revolt most often held the office of \"stadtholder\" there, held the dignity of \"First Noble\", and were as such a member of the States of that province, because they held the title of Marquis of Veere and Flushing as one of their patrimonial titles.\nOn the Republic's central 'confederal' level, the \"stadtholder\" of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland was normally also appointed Captain-General of the Dutch States Army and Admiral-General of the confederate fleet, though no \"stadtholder\" ever actually commanded a fleet in battle. In the army, he could appoint officers by himself; in the navy only affirm appointments of the five admiralty councils. Legal powers of the \"stadtholder\" were thus rather limited, and by law he was a mere official. His real powers, however, were sometimes greater, especially given the martial law atmosphere of the 'permanent' Eighty Years War. Maurice of Orange after 1618 ruled as a military dictator, and William II of Orange attempted the same.\nThe leader of the Dutch Revolt was William the Silent (William I of Orange); he had been appointed \"stadtholder\" in 1572 by the States of the first province to rebel, Holland, as a replacement of the royal \"stadtholder\" (He had previously held the post as an appointee of Philip II.). His personal influence and reputation was subsequently associated with the office and transferred to members of his house. After his assassination, however, there was a short-lived move to install Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester as governor-general of Elizabeth I before Maurice in 1590 became \"stadtholder\" of five provinces, a position he would hold until his death (his cousin William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg held the post in the remaining two provinces, Friesland and Groningen).\nTensions nonetheless persisted between Orangists and republicans in the United Provinces, sometimes exploding into direct conflict. Maurice in 1618 and William III from 1672 replaced entire city councils with their partisans to increase their power: the so-called \"Changings of the Legislative\" (\"Wetsverzettingen\"). By intimidation, the \"stadtholder\"s tried to extend their right of affirmation, while they also attempted to add the remaining stadholderships like Friesland and Groningen to their other holdings. In reaction, the regents in Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel, after the death of William II in 1650, appointed no \"stadtholder\", and banned his son William from the stadtholdership by an Act of Seclusion, something overcome by popular feeling during the catastrophic events of 1672, the Dutch Year of Disaster (\"Rampjaar\"), when the future William III of England was swept to power. After the death of William III in 1702 they again abstained from appointing a \"stadtholder\". These periods are known as the First Stadtholderless Period and the Second Stadtholderless Period.\nAfter the French invasion of 1747, the regents were forced by a popular movement to accept William IV, Prince of Orange, \"stadtholder\" of Friesland and Groningen, as \"stadtholder\" in the other provinces. On 22 November 1747, the office of \"stadtholder\" was made hereditary (\"erfstadhouder\") everywhere (previously only in Friesland). As William (for the first time in the history of the Republic) was \"stadtholder\" in all provinces, his function accordingly was restyled .\nAfter William IV's death in 1751, his infant son was duly appointed \"stadtholder\" under the regency of his mother. The misgovernment of this regency caused much resentment, which issued in 1780 in the Patriot movement, seeking to permanently limit the powers of the stadholderate. The Patriots first took over many city councils, then the States of the province of Holland, and ultimately raised civil militias to defend their position against Orangist partisans, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Through Prussian military intervention in 1787, Prince William V of Orange was able to suppress this opposition, and many leaders of the Patriot movement went into exile in France. The stadtholderate was strengthened with the Act of Guarantee (1788).\nAbolition and transition to sovereign kingdom.\nThe exiles returned with French armies in the winter of 1795 and overcame the frozen Dutch Water Line. William V fled to England, and the office of \"stadtholder\" was abolished that year, when the French revolutionary forces installed the Batavian Republic. Similarly, while from 1572 in the Southern Netherlands the Habsburg lords continued to appoint provincial \"stadtholders\" for the region, this ceased when they were annexed by France in 1794. In 1806, Napoleon established the Kingdom of Holland, putting his younger brother Louis on the throne. He abdicated his throne in 1810 in favour of his son Louis II. He ruled for nine days, until his uncle Napoleon took charge himself, annexing the kingdom to the French Empire, until its fall in 1813.\nSoon after the French army withdrew from the Netherlands, William Frederick, the son of William V, was invited by the Triumvirate of 1813 to become the first 'Sovereign Prince'. William had been living in exile in London during the French occupation. On 13 November 1813 he returned to the Netherlands to accept the invitation. On 16 March 1815 he assumed the title of King of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAs political model.\nThe stadtholderate was taken as a political model by the Founding Fathers of the United States with regard to the executive powers \u2013 Oliver Ellsworth for example arguing that without its influence in the United Provinces, \"their machine of government would no more move than a ship without wind\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the closest relative of \"Bombyx mandarina\", the wild silk moth. Silkworms are the larvae of silk moths. The silkworm is of particular economic value, being a primary producer of silk. The silkworm's preferred food are the leaves of white mulberry, though they may eat other species of mulberry, and even leaves of other plants. Domestic silk moths are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths, which are other species of \"Bombyx\", are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.\nSericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has existed for at least 5,000 years in China, whence it spread to India, Korea, Nepal, Japan, and then the West. The conventional process of sericulture kills the silkworm in the pupal stage. The domestic silk moth was domesticated from the wild silk moth \"Bombyx mandarina\", which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domestic silk moth derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.\nSilk moths were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic period. Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated \"Bombyx mori\" and the wild \"Bombyx mandarina\" can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids. It is unknown if \"B. mori\" can hybridize with other \"Bombyx\" species. Compared to most members in the genus \"Bombyx\", domestic silk moths have lost their coloration as well as their ability to fly.\nTypes.\nMulberry silkworms can be divided into three major categories based on seasonal brood frequency. Univoltine silkworms produce only one brood a season, and they are generally found in and around Europe. Univoltine eggs must hibernate through the winter, ultimately cross-fertilizing in spring. Bivoltine varieties are normally found in East Asia, and their accelerated breeding process is made possible by warmer climates. In addition, there are polyvoltine silkworms found only in the tropics. Their eggs typically hatch within 9 to 12 days, meaning there can be up to eight generations of larvae throughout the year. Mulberry silkworms are highly sensitive to environmental variables, and diapause - a physiological arrest in development - can be significantly influenced by photoperiod, temperature and humidity. Recent studies have also reported the occurrence of non-diapause eggs in bivoltine races, indicating a more flexible diapause expression than previously understood.\nDescription and life cycle.\nLarvae.\nEggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae. Larvae have a preference for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not monophagous, since they can eat other species of \"Morus\", as well as some other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange. There are five instars before pupation.\nPupae (cocoon).\nAfter they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow, and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the pupal phase of their life cycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the salivary glands. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other Lepidoptera produce cocoons, but only a few\u00a0\u2014 the Bombycidae, in particular the genus \"Bombyx\", and the Saturniidae, in particular the genus \"Antheraea\"\u00a0\u2014 have been exploited for fabric production.\nThe cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from long. The fibers are fine and lustrous, about 10\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. The number of cocoons required to produce a final yield of silk is approximately ; at least of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.\nIf the animal survives through the pupal phase of its life cycle, it releases proteolytic enzymes to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which reduces the value of the silk threads, although these damaged silk cocoons are still used as \"stuffing\" available in China and elsewhere in the production of duvets, jackets, and other purposes. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled in water. The heat kills the silkworms, and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm is eaten.\nAs the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the pupa, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. Mahatma Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the \"ahimsa\" philosophy \"not to hurt any living thing\". This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute, and an extension of this principle has led to the modern production practice known as Ahimsa silk, which is wild silk (from wild and semiwild silk moths) made from the cocoons of moths that are allowed to emerge before the silk is harvested.\nMoth.\nThe moth is the adult phase of the silk worm's life cycle. Silk moths have a wingspan of and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (due to carrying many eggs). All adult Bombycidae moths have reduced mouthparts and do not feed.\nThe wings of the silk moth develop from larval imaginal disks. The moth is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild \"B. mandarina\" and other \"Bombyx\" species, whose males fly to meet females. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved as their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. \nThe legs of the silk moth develop from the silkworm's larval (thoracic) legs. Developmental genes like Distalless and extradenticle have been used to mark leg development. In addition, removing specific segments of the thoracic legs at different ages of the larva resulted in the adult silk moth not developing the corresponding adult leg segments.\nResearch.\nDue to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a model organism in the study of lepidopteran and general arthropod biology. Fundamental findings on genetics, pheromones, hormones, brain structures, and physiology have been made with the silkworm. One example of this was the molecular identification of the first known pheromone, bombykol, which required extracts from 500,000 individuals, due to the small quantities of pheromone produced by any individual silkworm.\nMany research works have focused on the genetics of silkworms and the possibility of genetic engineering. Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described. Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide. One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet. Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins. \"Bombyx mori\" females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the synaptonemal complex (and not crossovers) during meiosis. In the oocytes of \"B. mori\", meiosis is completely achiasmate (lacking crossovers). Even though synaptonemal complexes are formed during the pachytene stage of meiosis in \"B. mori\", crossing-over homologous recombination does not occur between the paired chromosomes.\nKraig Biocraft Laboratories\nhas used research from the Universities of Wyoming and Notre Dame in a collaborative effort to create a silkworm that is genetically altered to produce spider silk. In September 2010, the effort was announced as successful.\nResearchers at Tufts developed scaffolds made of spongy silk that feel and look similar to human tissue. They are implanted during reconstructive surgery to support or restructure damaged ligaments, tendons, and other tissue. They also created implants made of silk and drug compounds which can be implanted under the skin for steady and gradual time release of medications.\nResearchers at the MIT Media Lab experimented with silkworms to see what they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the silkworms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape. Using this knowledge they built a silk pavilion with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.\nSilkworms have been used in antibiotic discovery, as they have several advantageous traits compared to other invertebrate models. Antibiotics such as lysocin E, a non-ribosomal peptide synthesized by \"Lysobacter\" sp. RH2180-5 and GPI0363 are among the notable antibiotics discovered using silkworms.\nIn addition, antibiotics with appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters were selected that correlated with therapeutic activity in the silkworm infection model.\nSilkworms have also been used for the identification of novel virulence factors of pathogenic microorganisms. A first large-scale screening using transposon mutant library of \"Staphylococcus aureus\" USA300 strain was performed which identified 8 new genes with roles in full virulence of \"S. aureus\". Another study by the same team of researchers revealed, for the first time, the role of YjbH in virulence and oxidative stress tolerance in vivo.\nDomestication.\nThe domestic species \"B. mori\", compared to the wild species (e.g., \"B. mandarina\"), has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also to living in crowded conditions. The domestic silk moths cannot fly, so the males need human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments have also been lost, so the domestic silk moths are leucistic, since camouflage is not useful when they only live in captivity. These changes have made \"B. mori\" entirely dependent upon humans for survival, and it does not exist in the wild. The eggs are kept in incubators to aid in their hatching.\nBreeding.\nSilkworms were first domesticated in China more than 5,000 years ago.\nSilkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworms from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity, the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (this lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors, including genetics.\nHobby raising and school projects.\nIn the U.S., teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising domestic silk moths in the classroom as a science project. Students have a chance to observe complete life cycles of insects from eggs to larvae to pupae to moths. Other than the U.S., this domestic silk moth is utilized in educational settings in several countries, including China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Iran, and Taiwan.\nGenome.\nThe full genome of the domestic silk moth was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium. Draft sequences were published in 2004.\nThe genome of the domestic silk moth is mid-range with a genome size around 432 million base pairs. A notable feature is that 43.6% of the genome are repetitive sequences, most of which are transposable elements. At least 3,000 silkworm genes are unique, and have no homologous equivalents in other genomes. The silkworm's ability to produce large amounts of silk correlates with the presence of specific tRNA clusters, as well as some clustered sericin genes. Additionally, the silkworm's ability to consume toxic mulberry leaves is linked to specialized sucrase genes, which appear to have been acquired from bacterial genes.\nIn 2018, Illumina's short reads for 137 strain genomes were published. In 2022, Nanopore's long reads for 545 strain genomes were published.\nAs food.\nSilk moth pupae are edible insects and are eaten in some cultures:\nIn China, silkworms have also been proposed for cultivation by taikonauts as space food on long-term missions.\nIn culture.\nChina.\nIn China, a legend indicates the discovery of the silkworm's silk was by an ancient empress named Leizu, the wife of the Yellow Emperor, also known as Xi Lingshi. She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.\nThe Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, \"hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry\", probably in the first half of the first century AD. About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms hidden in a hollow stick out of China, selling the secret to the eastern Romans.\nVietnam.\nAccording to a Vietnamese folk tale, silkworms were originally a beautiful housemaid running away from her gruesome masters and living in the mountain, where she was protected by the mountain god. One day, a lecherous god from the heaven came down to Earth to seduce women. When he saw her, he tried to rape her but she was able to escape and was hidden by the mountain god. The lecherous god then tried to find and capture her by setting a net trap around the mountain. With the blessing of Guanyin, the girl was able to safely swallow that net into her stomach. Finally, the evil god summons his fellow thunder and rain gods to attack and burn away her clothes, forcing her to hide in a cave. Naked and cold, she spit out the net and used it as a blanket to sleep. The girl died in her sleep, and as she wished to continue to help other people, her soul turned into silkworms.\nMedia.\nBombyx Mori is the name of a fictitious novel in \"The Silkworm\", a \"Cormoran Strike\" detective novel written by JK Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.\nFeeding.\n\"Bombyx mori\" is essentially monophagous, exclusively eating mulberry leaves (\"Morus\" spp.). By developing techniques for using artificial diets, the amino acids needed for development are known. The various amino acids can be classified into five categories:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70868", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70868", "title": "Flamethrower", "text": "Ranged incendiary device\nA flamethrower is a ranged incendiary device designed to project a controllable jet of fire. First deployed by the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century AD, flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I, and more widely in World War II as a tactical weapon against fortifications.\nMost military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either heated oil or diesel, but commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane. Gases are safer in peacetime applications because their flames have less mass flow rate and dissipate faster and often are easier to extinguish.\nApart from the military applications, flamethrowers have peacetime applications where there is a need for controlled burning, such as in sugarcane harvesting and other land-management tasks. Various forms are designed for an operator to carry, while others are mounted on vehicles.\nMilitary use.\nModern flamethrowers were first used during the trench warfare conditions of World War I and their use greatly increased in World War II. They can be vehicle-mounted, as on a tank, or man-portable.\nThe man-portable flamethrower consists of two elements\u2014the backpack and the gun. The backpack element usually consists of two or three cylinders. In a two-cylinder system, one cylinder holds compressed, inert propellant gas (usually nitrogen), and the other holds flammable liquid, typically some form of petrochemical. A three-cylinder system often has two outer cylinders of flammable liquid and a central cylinder of propellant gas to maintain the balance of the soldier carrying it. The gas propels the liquid fuel out of the cylinder through a flexible pipe and then into the gun element of the flamethrower system. The gun consists of a small reservoir, a spring-loaded valve, and an ignition system; depressing a trigger opens the valve, allowing pressurized flammable liquid to flow and pass over the igniter and out of the gun nozzle. The igniter can be one of several ignition systems: A simple type is an electrically heated wire coil; another used a small pilot flame, fueled with pressurized gas from the system.\nFlamethrowers were primarily used against battlefield fortifications, bunkers, and other protected emplacements. A flamethrower projects a stream of flammable liquid, rather than flame, which allows bouncing the stream off walls and ceilings to project the fire into unseen spaces, such as inside bunkers or pillboxes. Typically, popular visual media depict the flamethrower as short-ranged and only effective for a few metres (due to the common use of propane gas as the fuel in flamethrowers in movies, for the safety of the actors). Contemporary flamethrowers can incinerate a target some from the operator; moreover, an unignited stream of flammable liquid can be fired and afterwards ignited, possibly by a lamp or other flame inside the bunker.\nFlamethrowers pose many risks to the operator. The first disadvantage is the weapon's weight and length, which impairs the soldier's mobility. The weapon is limited to only a few seconds of burn time, since it uses fuel very quickly, requiring the operator to be precise and conservative. Flamethrowers using a fougasse-style explosive propellant system also have a limited number of shots. The weapon is very visible on the battlefield, which causes operators to become immediately singled out as prominent targets, especially for snipers and designated marksmen. Flamethrower operators were rarely taken prisoner, especially when their target survived an attack by the weapon; captured flamethrower users were in some cases summarily executed.\nThe flamethrower's effective range is short in comparison with that of other battlefield weapons of similar size. To be effective, flamethrower soldiers must approach their target, risking exposure to enemy fire. Vehicular flamethrowers also have this problem; they may have considerably greater range than a man-portable flamethrower, but their range is still short compared with that of alternative weapons.\nThe risk of a flamethrower operator being caught in the explosion of their weapon due to enemy hits on the tanks is exaggerated in films. In some cases, the pressure tanks have exploded and killed the operator when hit by bullets or grenade shrapnel. In the documentary \"Vietnam in HD\", platoon sergeant Charles Brown tells of how one of his men was killed when his flamethrower was hit by grenade shrapnel during the battle for Hill 875.\nThe pressurizer is filled with a non-flammable gas that is under high pressure. If this tank ruptures, it might knock the operator forward as it was expended in the same way a pressurized aerosol can bursts outward when punctured. The fuel mixture in the containers is difficult to light, which is why magnesium-filled igniters are required when the weapon is fired. When pierced by a bullet, a metal can filled with diesel or napalm will merely leak unless the round is an incendiary type that may ignite the mixture inside.\nThe best way to minimize the disadvantages of flame weapons was to mount them on armoured vehicles. The Commonwealth and the United States were the most prolific users of vehicle-mounted flame weapons; the British and Canadians fielded \"Wasps\" (Universal Carriers fitted with flamethrowers) at infantry battalion level, beginning in mid-1944, and eventually incorporating them into infantry battalions. Early tank-mounted flamethrower vehicles included the \"Badger\" (a converted Ram tank) and the \"Oke\", used first at Dieppe.\nOperation.\nIn a propane-operated flamethrower, the gas is expelled through the gun assembly by its own pressure and is ignited at the exit of the barrel through piezo ignition.\nLiquid-operated flamethrowers use a smaller tank with a pressurized gas to expel the flammable liquid fuel. The propellant gas is fed to two tubes. The first opens in the fuel tanks providing the pressure necessary for expelling the liquid. The other tube leads to an ignition chamber behind the exit of the gun assembly, where it is mixed with air and ignited through piezo ignition. This pre-ignition line is the source of the flame seen in front of the gun assembly in movies and documentaries. As the fuel passes through the flame, it is ignited and propelled towards the target.\nHistory.\nAncient Greece.\nThe concept of projecting fire as a weapon has existed since ancient times. During the Peloponnesian War, Boeotians used some kind of a flamethrower trying to destroy the fortification walls of the Athenians during the Battle of Delium.\nRoman Empire.\nIn 107\u00a0AD the Romans used a flamethrower against the Dacians; the device was similar to the one used at Delium.\nLater, during the Byzantine era, sailors used rudimentary hand-pumped flamethrowers on board their naval ships. Greek fire, extensively used by the Byzantine Empire, is said to have been invented by Kallinikos of Heliopolis, probably about 673 AD. Byzantine texts described weapons, used by Byzantine land forces, which were shooting Greek fire and called cheirosiphona (\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1, meaning hand-held siphons, singular \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf). The flamethrower found its origins in a device consisting of a hand-held pump that shot bursts of Greek fire via a siphon-hose and a piston which ignited it with a match, similar to modern versions, as it was ejected. An illustration in Poliorcetica of Hero of Byzantium display a soldier with a portable flamethrower. Byzantines also used ceramic hand grenades filled with Greek fire.\nGreek fire, used primarily at sea, gave the Byzantines a substantial military advantage against enemies such as members of the Arab Empire (who later adopted the use of Greek fire). An 11th-century illustration of its use survives in the John Skylitzes manuscript.\nChina.\nThe \"Pen Huo Qi\" (\"fire spraying device\") was a Chinese piston flamethrower that used a substance similar to petrol or naphtha, invented around 919\u00a0AD during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The earliest reference to Greek fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his \"Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms\". In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' that could not be doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu (\u6797\u79b9) in his \"Wu-Yue Beishi\" (\u5433\u8d8a\u5099\u53f2), hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire. Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from China's contact in the 'southern seas', with Arabia (\u5927\u98df\u570b \"Dashiguo\"). In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River) in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and a downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame (as referred to in the \"Wujing Zongyao\" manuscript of 1044). In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976 AD, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. Documented also in later Chinese publications, illustrations and descriptions of mobile flamethrowers on four-wheel push carts appear in the \"Wujing Zongyao\", written in 1044 (its illustration redrawn in 1601 as well). Advances in military technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile neighbours to the north, including the Mongols.\nIslamic World.\nAb\u016b \u02bfAbdall\u0101h al-Khw\u0101razm\u012b in \"Maf\u0101t\u012b\u1e25 al\"-\"\u02bfUl\u016bm\" (\u201cKeys to the Sciences\u201d) ca. 976\u00a0AD mentions the \"b\u0101b al-midfa\" and the \"b\u0101b al-mustaq\" which he said were parts of naphtha-throwers and projectors (\"al-naff\u0101t\u0101t wa al-zar\u0101q\u0101t\"). Book of Ingenious Mechanical Device (\"Kit\u0101b f\u012b ma 'rifat al-\u1e25iyal al-handasiyya\") of 1206 by Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari mentioned about ejectors of naphtha (\"zar\u0101q\u0101t al-naft\").\nSiege of Malta.\nDuring the Great Siege of Malta the defenders used a type of flamethrower known as Trump, consisting of a tube loaded with sulphur resin and linseed oil. It produced a flame that was several yards long\nVietnam.\nThe book H\u1ed3 tr\u01b0\u1eddng khu c\u01a1 by Dao Duy Tu describes a flamethrowing weapon called the fire tiger \"The fire-thrower is also called fire-tiger, has a large bulb about one meter long, when in battle it shoots fire, the tube shoots out pine resin, if it hits something, it immediately catches fire...\". \"Because the fire burns fiercely, it is called fire-tiger\". These weapons were later used by the Tay Son Army.\n18th century.\nIn 1702, the Prussian Army tested P. Lange's \"hose-fire-spray\" (Schlangen-Brand-Spritze) who produced a jet of fire wide and long; two years later it was rejected as useless.\nPeter the Great's chief engineer Vasily Dmitrievich Korchmin designed various incendiary weapons, such as incendiary rockets and furnaces for heating cannonball; two Russian ships the \u201cSvyatoy Yakov\u201d and \u201cLandsou\u201d were armed with flamethrower tubes designed by him. He also developed instructions for their use together with the Tsar.\nIn the 1750s a French engineer named Dupre, developed a new flammable mixture; it was tested in LeHavre and set fire to a sloop. During the British shelling of LeHavre in 1759, the French War Minister tried to obtain authorization to use this fuel.\n19th century.\nAlthough flamethrowers were never used in the American Civil War, \"Greek Fire\" shells were produced and used by Union troops during the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor.\nDuring the 1871 siege of Paris, French chemist Marcellin Berthelot suggested pumping flaming petroleum at Prussian troops.\nIn 1898 Russian captain Sigern-Korn experimented with burning jets of kerosene for defensive use; in theory, they would be fired from parapets of fortifications. The idea was abandoned due to technical issues\nEarly 20th century.\nDuring the siege of Port Arthur, Japanese combat engineers used hand pumps to spray kerosene into Russian trenches. Once the Russians were covered with the flammable liquid, the Japanese would throw bundles of burning rags at them.\nBefore WW1, German pioneers used the Brandr\u00f6hre M.95 a weapon consisting of a sheet metal tube ( wide and long) filled with an incendiary mixture, and a friction igniter activated by a lanyard. The Brandr\u00f6hre was designed to be used against enemy casemates; a long pole was used to reach the target and the lanyard was pulled to ignite the fuel; producing a long stream of fire. Those weapons were deployed in six-man teams and were limited by their short range. In theory the Brandr\u00f6hre was replaced by the flamethrower in 1909 but it was still in use in WW1; it was used during the assaults on Fort du Camp-des-Romains in 1914 and Fort Vaux in 1916.\nBernhard Reddeman, a German military officer and former fireman, converted steam powered fire engines into flamethrowers; his design was demonstrated in 1907.\nThe English word \"flamethrower\" is a loan-translation of the German word \"Flammenwerfer\", since the modern flamethrower was invented in Germany. The first flamethrower, in the modern sense, is usually credited to Richard Fiedler. He submitted evaluation models of his \"Flammenwerfer\" to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple igniting wick device in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some . It was a single-shot weapon\u2014for burst firing, a new igniter section was attached each time. In 1905 Fiedler's flamethrower was demonstrated to the Prussian Committee of Engineers. In 1908 Fiedler started working with Reddeman and made some adjustments to the design; an experimental pioneer company was created to further test the weapon.\nIt was not until 1911 that the German Army accepted their first real flamethrowing device, creating a specialist regiment of twelve companies equipped with Flammenwerfer Apparent. Despite this, use of fire in a World War I battle predated flamethrower use, with a petrol spray being ignited by an incendiary bomb in the Argonne-Meuse sector in October 1914.\nThe flamethrower was first used in World War I on 26 February 1916 when it was briefly used against the French outside Verdun. On 30 July 1915 it was first used in a concerted action, against British trenches at Hooge, where the lines were apart\u2014even there, the casualties were caused mainly by soldiers being flushed into the open and then shot rather than from the fire itself. After two days of fighting the British had suffered casualties of 31 officers and 751 other ranks.\nThe success of the attack prompted the German Army to adopt the device on all fronts. Flamethrowers were used in squads of six during battles, at the start of an attack destroying the enemy and to the preceding the infantry advance.\nThe flamethrower was useful at short distances but had other limitations: it was cumbersome and difficult to operate and could only be safely fired from a trench, which limited its use to areas where the opposing trenches were less than the maximum range of the weapon, namely apart\u2014which was not a common situation; the fuel would also only last for about a minute of continuous firing.\nThe Germans deployed flamethrowers during the war in more than 650 attacks.\nThe Ottoman Empire received 30 flamethrowers from Germany during the war.\nGerman flamethrowers were also used by Bulgarian forces.\nAustria-Hungary adopted German designs; but also developed its own flamethrowers in 1915. These included the M.15 Flammenwerfer, which required a crew of three men and was too unwieldy for offensive use; a defensive model and a more portable model were also produced. Austro-Hungarian flamethrowers were unreliable and long hoses were used to prevent the shooter from igniting the fuel tank\nThe British experimented with flamethrowers in the Battle of the Somme, during which they used experimental weapons called \"Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors\", named for their inventor, William Howard Livens, a Royal Engineers officer. This weapon was enormous and completely non-portable. The weapon had an effective range of , which proved effective at clearing trenches, but with no other benefit the project was abandoned.\nTwo Morriss static flamethrowers were mounted in HMS \"Vindictive\" and several Hay portable flamethrowers were deployed by the Royal Navy during the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918. A British newspaper report of the action referred to the British flamethrowers only as \"flammenwerfer\", using the German word.\nThe French Army deployed the Schilt family of flamethrowers, which were also used by the Italian Army.\nIn 1931 the S\u00e3o Paulo Public Force created an assault car section. The first vehicle to be incorporated was a tank built from a Caterpillar Twenty Two tractor, featuring a turret mounted flamethrower and four Hotchkiss machineguns on the hull. It was used in combat during the Constitutionalist Revolution, routing federal troop from a bridge in an engagement in Cruzeiro.\nIn the interwar period, at least four flamethrowers were used in the Chaco War by the Bolivian Army, during the unsuccessful assault on the Paraguayan stronghold of Nanawa in 1933. During the battle of Kilometer 7 to Saavedra, Major Walther Kohn rode in a flamethrower equipped tankette; due to heat he exited the tank to fight on foot and was killed in combat.\nWorld War II.\nThe flamethrower was used extensively during World War II. In 1939, the Wehrmacht first deployed man-portable flamethrowers against the Polish Post Office in Danzig. Subsequently, in 1942, the U.S. Army introduced its own man-portable flamethrower. The vulnerability of infantry carrying backpack flamethrowers and the weapon's short range led to experiments with tank-mounted flamethrowers (flame tanks), which were used by many countries.\nAxis use.\nGermany.\nThe Germans made considerable use of the weapon (\"Flammenwerfer\" 35) during their invasion of the Netherlands and France, against fixed fortifications. World War II German army flamethrowers tended to have one large fuel tank with the pressurizer tank fastened to its back or side. Some German army flamethrowers occupied only the lower part of its wearer's back, leaving the upper part of his back free for an ordinary rucksack.\nFlamethrowers soon fell into disfavour. Flamethrowers were extensively used by German units in urban fights in Poland, both in 1943 in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and in 1944 in the Warsaw Uprising (see the Stroop Report and the article on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising). With the contraction of the Third Reich during the latter half of World War II, a smaller, more compact flamethrower known as the Einstossflammenwerfer 46 was produced.\nGermany also used flamethrower vehicles, most of them based on the chassis of the Sd.Kfz. 251 half track and the Panzer II and Panzer III tanks, generally known as \"Flammpanzers\".\nThe Germans also produced the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, a flame-mine or flame fougasse, based on a Soviet version of the weapon. This was essentially a disposable, single use flamethrower that was buried alongside conventional land mines at key defensive points and triggered by either a trip-wire or a command wire. The weapon contained around of fuel, that was discharged within a second, to a second and a half, producing a flame with a range. One defensive installation found in Italy included seven of the weapons, carefully concealed and wired to a central control point.\nFinland.\nDuring the Winter War Finland adopted the Italian Lanciafiamme Modello 35 as the Liekinheitin M/40; 176 flamethrowers were ordered but only 28 arrived before the end of the war.\nThose flamethrowers were not used in the Winter War; but were issued to engineers during the Continuation War along with captured ROKS-2 flamethrowers\nOT-130 and OT-133 flame tanks were captured from the Soviet Union and issued at the start of the Continuation War; they were considered impratical and later retrofitted with cannons.\nIn 1944 they developed and adopted the Liekinheitin M/44.\nItaly.\nItaly employed man-portable flamethrowers and L3 Lf flame tanks during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935 to 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, and during World War II. The L3 Lf flame tank was a CV-33 or CV-35 tankette with a flamethrower operating from the machine gun mount. In the Northern Africa Theatre, the L3 Lf flame tank found little to no success. An L6 Lf flametank was also developed using the L6/40 light tank platform.\nJapan.\nJapan used man-portable flamethrowers to clear fortified positions, in the Battle of Wake Island, Corregidor, Battle of the Tenaru on Guadalcanal and Battle of Milne Bay.\nRomania.\nFlamethrowers were also used by the Royal Romanian Army. They were also planned to become self-propelled; the Mare\u0219al tank destroyer was planned to have a command vehicle version armed with machine guns and a flamethrower.\nAllies.\nBritain and the Commonwealth.\nThe British World War II army flamethrowers, \"Ack Packs\", had a doughnut-shaped fuel tank with a small spherical pressurizer gas tank in the middle. As a result, some troops nicknamed them \"lifebuoys\". It was officially known as Flamethrower, Portable, No 2.\nExtensive plans were made in 1940\u20131941 by the Petroleum Warfare Department to use flame fougasse static flame projectors in the event of an invasion, with around 50,000 barrel-based incendiary mines being deployed in 7,000 batteries throughout Southern England.\nThe British hardly used their man-portable systems, relying on Churchill Crocodile tanks in the European theatre. These tanks proved very effective against German defensive positions, and caused official Axis protests against their use. This flamethrower could produce a jet of flame exceeding . There are documented instances of German units summarily executing any captured British flame-tank crews.\nIn the Pacific theatre, Australian forces used converted Matilda tanks, known as Matilda Frogs.\nUnited States.\nIn the Pacific theatre, the U.S. Army used M-1 and M-2 flamethrowers to clear stubborn Japanese resistance from prepared defenses, caves, and trenches. Starting in New Guinea, through the closing stages on Guadalcanal and during the approach to and reconquest of the Philippines and then through the Okinawa campaign, the Army deployed hand-held, man-portable units.\nOften flamethrower teams were made up of combat engineer units, later with troops of the chemical warfare service. The Army fielded flamethrower units, and the Army's Chemical Warfare Service pioneered tank mounted flamethrowers on Sherman tanks (CWS-POA H-4). All the flamethrower tanks on Okinawa belonged to the 713th Provisional Tank Battalion, which was tasked with supporting all U.S. Army infantry. All Pacific mechanized flamethrower units were trained by Seabee specialists with Col. Unmacht's CWS Flamethrower Group in Hawaii.\nThe U.S. Army used flamethrowers in Europe in much smaller numbers, though they were available for special employments. Flamethrowers were deployed during the Normandy landings in order to clear Axis fortifications. Also, most boat teams on Omaha Beach included a two-man flamethrower team.\nThe Army also used the backpack-type M2A1-7 and M2-2 flamethrowers, finding them useful in clearing Japanese trench and bunker complexes. The well known use of the man portable flamethrower was against the formidable defenses at Tarawa in November 1943. The Army pioneered the use of Ronson-equipped M-3 Stuart tanks in the Marianas. These were known as flame tanks. Though effective, they lacked the armour to safely engage fortifications and were phased out in favour of the better-armoured M4 Sherman tanks. Flamethrower Shermans were produced at Schofield Barracks by Seabees attached to the Chemical Warfare Service under Col. Unmacht. CWS designated M4s with \"CWS-POA-H\" for \"Chemical Warfare Service Pacific Ocean Area, Hawaii\" plus a flamethrower number. The Army had deployed large flamethrowers mounted on LVT-4 AMTRACs at Peleliu. Late in the war, both services operated LVT-4 and \u22125 flametanks in limited numbers. The Army still used their infantry-portable systems, despite the arrival of adapted Sherman tanks with the Ronson system (cf. ).\nIn cases where the Japanese were entrenched in deep caves, the flames often consumed the available oxygen, suffocating the occupants. Many Japanese troops interviewed post war said they were terrified more by flamethrowers than any other American weapon. Flamethrower operators were often the first U.S. troops targeted.\nSoviet Union.\nThe FOG-1 and \u22122 flamethrowers were stationary devices used in defense. They could also be categorized as a projecting incendiary mine. The FOG had only one cylinder of fuel, which was compressed using an explosive charge and projected through a nozzle. The November 1944 issue of the US War Department \"Intelligence Bulletin\" refers to these \"Fougasse flame throwers\" being used in the Soviet defense of Stalingrad. The FOG-1 was directly copied by the Germans as the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42.\nUnlike the flamethrowers of the other powers during World War II, the Soviets were the only ones to consciously attempt to camouflage their infantry flamethrowers. With the ROKS-2 flamethrower this was done by disguising the flame projector as a standard-issue rifle, such as the Mosin\u2013Nagant, and the fuel tanks as a standard infantryman's rucksack. This was to try to stop the flamethrower operator from being specifically targeted by enemy fire. This \"rifle\" had a working action which was used to cycle blank igniter cartridges.\n1945\u20131980.\nUS military.\nThe United States Marines used flamethrowers in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The M132 armored flamethrower, an M113 armored personnel carrier with a mounted flamethrower, was successfully used in the conflict.\nFlamethrowers have not been in the U.S. arsenal since 1978, when the Department of Defense unilaterally stopped using them\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009\u2060the last American infantry flamethrower was the Vietnam-era M9-7. They have been deemed of questionable effectiveness in modern combat, though some have made the case for their tactical employment.\nU.S. army flamethrowers developed up to the M9 model. In the M9 the propellant tank is a sphere below the left fuel tank and does not project backwards.\nIsrael.\nCrude homemade flamethrowers were built by Irgun in the late 1940s.\nChina.\nThe PLA adopted the Type 74 flamethrower, a copy of the Soviet LPO-50. It was later used in the Sino-Vietnamese War.\nVietnam.\nLPO-50 and Type 74 flamethrowers were used by NVA forces during the Vietnam War.\nIraq.\nThe Iraqi army used LPO-50 flamethrowers during the Iran-Iraq War.\nPost-1980s.\nNon-flamethrower incendiary weapons remain in modern military arsenals. Thermobaric weapons may have been fielded in Afghanistan by the United States (2008) and have been used by Russia in Ukraine (2022). The U.S. and U.S.S.R. both developed a rocket launcher specifically for the deployment of incendiary munitions, respectively the M202 FLASH and the RPO \"Rys\" ancestor of the RPO-A Shmel.\nVietnam.\nThe Type 74 is still being used by the Vietnamese Army.\nFrench assault on Ouv\u00e9a cave (1988).\nOn 22 April 1988, Kanak rebels took 36 French hostages in Ouv\u00e9a island, New Caledonia, most of them gendarms and military personnel. On 5 May, after weeks of fruitless negotiations, a team of gendarms and paratroopers from the French Army launched a rescue operation. During the assault, a rebel machine gun position was neutralized using a flamethrower. All hostages were eventually set free.\nProvisional IRA.\nIn 1981 the FBI foiled an attempt by New York-based gun runner George Harrison to smuggle an M2 flamethrower to Ireland for the IRA. In the Troubles, during the mid-1980s, the IRA smuggled in Soviet LPO-50 military flamethrowers (supplied to them by the Libyan government) into Northern Ireland. An IRA team riding on an improvised armoured truck used one of these flamethrowers, among other weapons, to storm a British Army permanent checkpoint in Derryard, near Rosslea, on 13 December 1989. Some months later, on 4 March 1990, the IRA attacked an RUC station in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, using an improvised flamethrower consisting of a manure-spreader towed by a tractor to spray of a petrol/diesel mix to engulf the base in flames, and then opened fire with rifles and an anti-tank rocket launcher. Another IRA unit carried two attacks in less than a year with another improvised flamethrower towed by a tractor on a British Army watchtower, the Borucki sangar, in Crossmaglen, County Armagh, also in the early 1990s. The first incident occurred on 12 December 1992, when the bunker was manned by Scots Guards, and the second on 12 November 1993. The device used as launcher was also a manure spreader, which doused the facility with fuel, ignited few seconds later by a small explosion. In the 1993 action, a nine-metre-high fireball engulfed the tower for seven minutes. The four Grenadier Guards inside the outpost were rescued by a Saxon armoured vehicle. Incendiary improvised devices were also proven by the republican paramilitaries, such as an IRA grenade attack on a British Army patrol on 4 April 1993 in Carrickmore, County Tyrone; the device consisted of of semtex and of petrol; the bomb exploded, but the fuel failed to ignite. A soldier was thrown several metres across the road by the blast.\nBrazil.\nAs of 2003 the locally made Hydroar T1M1 flamethrower was still being used by the 1\u00ba Batalh\u00e3o de For\u00e7as Especiais.\nChina.\nThe Chinese Army still issues the Type 74 flamethrower.\nDuring an operation to hunt down the militant group responsible for the 2015 Aksu colliery attack, after using tear gas and flash grenades to no avail, Chinese paramilitary forces resorted to flamethrowers to root out suspected militants who were hiding in a cave.\nIraq conflict.\nCaptain Shannon Johnson requested Colonel John A. Toolan to supply his company with flamethrowers during the Second Battle of Fallujah; however no flamethrowers were issued. The People's Mujahedin of Iran claimed flamethrowers were used in the 2013 Camp Ashraf massacre.\nItaly.\nAs of 2012 the locally made T-148/B flamethrower was still being used by the Italian Army.\nMyanmar.\nFlamethrowers have been used by the Tatmadaw during attacks on Rohingya villages during the Rohingya genocide.\nRusso-Ukrainian War.\nOn 8 February 2017, separatist leader Mikhail 'Givi' Tolstykh was killed when an RPO-A Shmel rocket-assisted flamethrower was fired at his office in Donetsk.\nOn 21 November 2022, nine months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian sources claim that artillery and \"heavy flamethrowers\" were employed against a Ukrainian concentration of troops near Kupyansk, Kharkiv Oblast. Russian sources use the term \"heavy flamethrowers\" to describe TOS-1 multiple thermobaric rocket launchers.\nGaza war and its spillovers.\nDuring the Gaza war footage was published of IDF bulldozer fitted with flame throwers burning down buildings in Gaza, in the 2025 Boulder fire attack the Egyptian attacker used a makeshift flamethrower to attack a solidarity walk for the hostages taken from Israel\nInternational law.\nThe use of flamethrowers in war is not generally banned. However, the United Nations Protocol on Incendiary Weapons does forbid the use of incendiary weapons, including flamethrowers, against civilians or against forests unless the terrain is being used to conceal combatants or other military objectives.\nOwning a personal flamethrower.\nIn the United States, private ownership of a flamethrower is not restricted by federal law, because a flamethrower is a tool, not a firearm. Flamethrowers are legal in 48 states and restricted in California and Maryland.\nIn California, unlicensed possession of a flame-throwing device\u2014statutorily defined as \"any non-stationary and transportable device designed or intended to emit or propel a burning stream of combustible or flammable liquid a distance of at least \" H&amp;W 12750 (a)\u2014is a misdemeanor punishable with a county jail term not exceeding one year \"or\" with a fine not exceeding $10,000 (CA H&amp;W 12761). Licenses to use flamethrowers are issued by the state fire marshal, and they may use any criteria for issuing or not issuing that license which is deemed fit, but must publish those criteria in the California Code of Regulations, Title 11, Section 970 et seq.\nIn the United Kingdom, flamethrowers are \"prohibited weapons\" under section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 and article 45(1)(f) of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 and possession of a flamethrower would carry a sentence of up to ten years' imprisonment. On 16 June 1994, a man attacked school pupils at Sullivan Upper School, just outside Belfast, with a home-made flamethrower.\nA South African inventor brought the Blaster car-mounted flamethrower to market in 1998 as a security device to defend against carjackers. It has since been discontinued, with the inventor moving on to pocket-sized self-defence flamethrowers.\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc. and owner of SpaceX, developed a \"not a flamethrower\" for public sale through his business, The Boring Company, selling 20,000 units. This device uses liquid propane gas rather than a stream of gasoline, making it more akin to a torch, like those commonly available at home and garden centers.\nOther uses.\nFlamethrowers are occasionally used for igniting controlled burns for land management and agriculture. For example, in the production of sugar cane, where canebrakes are burned to get rid of the dry dead leaves which clog harvesters, and incidentally kill any lurking venomous snakes. More commonly, a driptorch or a flare (fusee) is used.\nU.S. troops allegedly used flamethrowers on the streets of Washington, D.C. (mentioned in a December 1998 article in the \"San Francisco Flier\"), as one of several clearance methods used for the surprisingly large amount of snow that fell before the presidential inauguration of John F. Kennedy. A history article on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notes, \"In the end, the task force employed hundreds of dump trucks, front-end loaders, sanders, plows, rotaries, and allegedly flamethrowers to clear the way\".\nFlamethrowers were employed by U.S. combat engineers during the Iraq War; they were used to clear brush and eliminate hiding spots for insurgents.\nA squad armed with backpack flamethrowers had an important part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony. They had one big tank each. They could make a flame about long.\nIn April 2014 it was reported by South Korea's \"Chosun Ilbo\" newspaper without confirmation that a North Korean government official, O Sang-Hon, Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Public Security, was executed by flamethrower.\nIn August 2016 it was reported that the Islamic State used flamethrowers to execute six of its commanders in Tal Afar as punishment for their attempt to escape to Syria.\nIt has been known for police to fill a \"flamethrower\", not with flammable liquid, but rather with tear gas dissolved in water as a riot-control device; see Converted Flamethrower 40.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider Western ideas of religion and philosophy, including capitalism, patriarchy, and globalization, sometimes through \"resacralising\" and reconnecting with nature.\nThe movement is typified by leaderless resistance organizations such as Earth First!, which subscribe to the idea of taking direct action in defense of Mother Nature including civil disobedience, ecotage and monkeywrenching. Movements such as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and Earth Liberation Army (ELA) also take this form of action, although focusing on economic sabotage, rather than civil disobedience. Radical environmentalists can include earth liberationists, as well as anarcho-primitivists, animal liberationists, bioregionalists, deep ecologists, eco-nationalism, ecopsychologists, green anarchists, and less often anti-globalization and anti-capitalist protesters, ecofeminists, neo-Pagans, Third Positionists, and Wiccans. This does not mean that everyone subscribing to those beliefs and values should be considered a radical environmentalist.\nHistory.\nWhile many people believe that the first significant radical environmentalist group was Greenpeace, which made use of direct action beginning in the 1970s to confront whaling ships and nuclear weapons testers, others within the movement, argues as Earth Liberation Front (ELF) prisoner Jeff \"Free\" Luers, suggests that the movement was established centuries ago. He often writes that the concept of \"eco-defence\" was born shortly after the existence of the human race, claiming it is only recently that within the modern development of human society, and individuals losing touch with the earth and its wild roots, that more radical tactics and political theories have emerged.\nThe alternative tactic of using explosive and incendiary devices was established in 1976 by John Hanna and others as the Environmental Life Force (ELF), also now known as the \"original ELF\". The group conducted a campaign of armed actions in northern California and Oregon, later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the Salinas, California airport on May Day, 1977. It wasn't until over a decade and a half later that this form of guerrilla warfare resurfaced as the Earth Liberation Front using the same ELF acronym.\nIn 1980 Earth First! was founded by Dave Foreman and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the Edward Abbey novel \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\", Earth First! made use of such techniques as treesitting and treespiking to stop logging companies, as well as other activities targeted towards mining, road construction, suburban development and energy companies.\nThe organization were committed to nonviolent ecotage techniques from the group's inception, with those that split from the movement in the 1990s including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) in 1992, naming themselves after the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) who formed in the 1970s. Three years later in Canada, inspired by the ELF in Europe the first \"Earth Liberation\" direct action occurred, but this time as the Earth Liberation Army (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and monkeywrenching as a tool, although no guidelines had been published.\nThe ELF gained national attention for a series of actions which earned them the label of eco-terrorists, including the burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado in 1998 that the ALF also claimed credit for \u2014and the burning of an SUV dealership in Oregon in 1999. The defendants in the case were later charged in the FBI's \"Operation Backfire\", along with other arsons and cases, which were later named by environmentalists as the Green Scare; alluding to the Red Scare, periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks several laws were passed increasing the penalties for ecoterrorism, and hearings were held in Congress discussing the activities of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action since both groups forbid harming human or non-human life. It was then announced in 2003 that \"eco-terrorist\" attacks, known as \"ecotage\", had increased from the ELF, ELA and the \"Environmental Rangers\", another name used by activists when engaging in similar activity. In 2005 the FBI announced that the ELF was America's greatest domestic terrorist threat, responsible for over 1,200 \"criminal incidents\" amounting to tens of millions of dollars in damage to property, with the United States Department of Homeland Security confirming this regarding the ALF and ELF.\nPlane Stupid then was launched in 2005, in an attempt to combat the growing airport expansions in the UK using direct action with a year later the first Camp for Climate Action being held with 600 people attending a protest called \"Reclaim Power\" converging on Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire and attempted to shut it down. There were thirty-eight arrests, with four breaching the fence and the railway line being blocked.\nRadical environmentalism has been called a new religious movement by Bron Taylor (1998). Taylor contends that \"Radical environmentalism is best understood as a new religious movement that views environmental degradation as an assault on a sacred, natural world.\"\nSome writers have used it to refer to the hypothetical danger of future dystopian governments, which might resort to fascist radical environmentalist policies in order to deal with environmental issues. Themes of eco-fascism and radical environmentalism can be found in movies and literature like \"Soylent Green\", \"Hunger Games\", \"Z.P.G.\", and \"My Diary from 2091\".\nOffshoots.\nSeveral philosophies have arisen from ideas in radical environmentalism that include deep ecology, ecofeminism, social ecology and bioregionalism.\nDeep Ecology is attributed to Arne Naess and is defined as \"a normative, ecophilosophical movement that is inspired and fortified in part by our experience as humans in nature and in part by ecological knowledge.\"\nA rising Deep Ecologist among radical environmentalist circles is Pentti Linkola, regarded as the founder of ecofascism, and author of the book \"Can Life Prevail? A Radical Approach to the Environmental Crisis\".\nEcofeminism originated in the 1970s and draws a parallel between the oppression of women in patriarchal societies and the oppression of the environment.\nSocial Ecology is an idea attributed to Murray Bookchin, who argued that in order to save the environment, human society needed to copy the structure of nature and decentralize both socially and economically.\nBioregionalism is a philosophy that focuses on the practical application of Social Ecology, and theorizes on \"building and living in human social communities that are compatible with ecological systems\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He shot Gandhi in the chest three times at point blank range at a multi-faith prayer meeting in Birla House in New Delhi on 30 January 1948.\nGodse was a member of the political party, the Hindu Mahasabha; and a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary volunteer organization; and a popularizer of the work of his mentor Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who had created the ideology of Hindutva.\nGodse had two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi in 1944 before he succeeded the third time. After the 1948 assassination, Godse claimed Gandhi favoured the political demands of British India's Muslims during the partition of India of 1947. Soon after Mahatma Gandhi had fallen from the fatal shots at the prayer meeting, and while the attendant crowd was in shock, Godse was grasped and restrained by Herbert Reiner Jr., a vice-consul at the new American embassy in Delhi who was also attending; eventually, Godse was taken away by the police. Godse had plotted the assassination with Narayan Apte and six others. After a trial that lasted over a year, Godse was sentenced to death on 8 November 1949. Although pleas for clemency were made by Gandhi's two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, they were turned down by India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel, and Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and Godse was executed at the Ambala Central Jail on 15 November 1949.\nEarly life.\nNathuram Vinayakrao Godse was born into a Maharashtrian Chitpavan Brahmin family. His father, Vinayak Vamanrao Godse, was a postal employee; his mother was Lakshmi (n\u00e9e Godavari). At birth, he was named Ramachandra. Nathuram was given his name due to his parents' fear that a curse targeted their male children, caused by the loss of their three previous sons. Young Ramachandra was therefore brought up as a girl for the first few years of his life, including having his nose pierced and being made to wear a nose-ring (\"nath\" in Marathi). It was then that he earned the nickname \"Nathuram\" (literally \"Ram with a nose-ring\"). After his younger brother was born, they switched to treating him as a boy.\nGodse attended the local school at Baramati through the fifth standard, after which he was sent to live with an aunt in Pune so that he could study at an English-language school.\nPolitical career and beliefs.\nGodse dropped out of high school and became an activist with Hindu nationalist organisations Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS; National Volunteer Organisation) and Hindu Mahasabha, although the exact dates of his membership are uncertain.\nRSS membership.\nGodse joined RSS in Sangli (Maharashtra) in 1932 as a \"boudhik karyawah\" (ground worker), and simultaneously remained a member of the Hindu Mahasabha, both right-wing organisations. He often wrote articles in newspapers to publicise his thoughts. During this time, Godse and M. S. Golwalkar, later RSS chief, often worked together, and they translated Babarao Savarkar's book \"Rashtra Mimansa\" into English. They had a falling out when Golwalkar took the entire credit for this translation. In the early 1940s, Godse formed his own organisation, \"Hindu Rashtra Dal\" on the Vijayadashami day of 1942, though he continued to remain a member of the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha.\nIn 1946, Godse claimed to have left the RSS and moved to the Hindu Mahasabha over the issue of the partition of India. However, historical sources do not corroborate this claim; an investigation published by The Caravan in January 2020 revealed that up until his final days, Godse was listed as a member in records kept by the RSS of meetings that took place long after he was supposed to have left the organisation. His family has also said that he had never left the RSS, highlighting that he held membership at the RSS as well as the Hindu Mahasabha. Godse's 1946 claim is also refuted by his first deposition in Marathi after he assassinated Gandhi, where he says that while he did join the Hindu Mahasabha, \"I remained active in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\"\nAssassination of Mahatma Gandhi.\nIn May 1944, Godse attempted to assassinate Gandhi with a knife. He led a group of 15 to 20 young men who rushed at Gandhi during a prayer meeting at Panchgani. Godse and his group was prevented by the crowds from reaching Gandhi. He was released due to Gandhi's own policy of declining to press criminal charges.\nIn September 1944, Godse again led another group to block Gandhi's passage from Sevagram to Mumbai. This time Godse was arrested with a dagger and he uttered threats to kill Gandhi. He was released again owing to Gandhi's policy of not pressing criminal charges.\nAt 05:05 pm on 30 January 1948, as Gandhi made his way to a prayer meeting on a raised lawn behind Birla House, a mansion in New Delhi, where he was staying, Godse stepped out of the crowd flanking his path to the dais. He fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest. Gandhi fell immediately, sending the attendant crowd into a state of shock. Herbert Reiner Jr., a 32-year-old vice-consul at the new American embassy in Delhi, was the first to rush forward and grasp Godse by the shoulders, spinning him into the arms of some military personnel, who disarmed him. Reiner then held Godse by the neck and shoulders until he was taken away by the military and police. Reiner reported later that in the moments before he apprehended him, Godse looked a little stunned at how easily he had carried out his plan. Gandhi was taken back to his room in Birla House, where he died soon thereafter.\nTrial and execution.\nGodse was put on trial at the Punjab High Court, at Peterhoff, Shimla. On 8 November 1949, he was sentenced to death. Although pleas for commutation were made by Gandhi's two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, they were turned down by India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and Godse was hanged at Ambala Central Jail on 15 November 1949.\nAftermath.\nMillions of Indians mourned Gandhi's assassination; the Hindu Mahasabha was vilified and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was temporarily banned.\nThe RSS has consistently denied any connection with Godse. It has maintained, contrary to evidence and accounts cited earlier, that Godse \"left RSS in the mid-1930s\". However, Nathuram Godse's brother Gopal Godse stated that all the Godse brothers were members of the RSS at the time of the assassination and blamed the RSS for disowning them. The other members of the Godse family too have denied that he ever left the RSS. He remained in the position of \"boudhik karyawah\" (intellectual worker) in the RSS until his death.\nTerrorist act.\nThe assassination Mahatma Gandhi has been portrayed in retrospect as an act of Hindutva fanatical terror. In the 2011 book \"Godse's Children: Hindutva Terror in India\", journalist Subhash Gatade called the assassination \"the first terrorist act in independent India\", and, as one scholar put it, \"the harbinger of 'Hindutva terrorism' in India\". In a 2012 review of Gatade's work, author Rohini Hensman concurred that if terrorism is defined as violence in pursuit of a political goal, then \"the assassination of Gandhi could indeed be seen as a terrorist act\".\nAttempts at image rehabilitation.\n\"Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy\" (This is Nathuram Godse Speaking) is a two-act play written in the Marathi language by Pradeep Dalvi. It is based on the book \"May It Please Your Honour\" written by Nathuram's brother Gopal Godse. According to Karline McLain, the play \"enacts Godse's defense plea\" and thus \"explores the assassination of Gandhi and the trial of Godse from Godse's point of view.\nIn 2014, following the Bharatiya Janata Party's rise to power, the Hindu Mahasabha began attempts to rehabilitate Godse and portray him as a patriot. It requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to install a bust of Godse. It created a documentary film \"Desh Bhakt Nathuram Godse\" (Patriot Nathuram Godse) for release on the death anniversary of Gandhi on 30 January 2015.\nThere were attempts to build a temple for Godse and to celebrate 30 January as a \"Shaurya Diwas\" (\"Bravery Day\"). A civil suit was filed in Pune Court asking for a ban on the documentary film.\nIn May 2019, in the lead up to the final phase of Indian elections, BJP's candidate from Bhopal, Pragya Thakur, called Godse a \"patriot\". Facing intense backlash, she apologised later.\nAs Hindutva politics became more widespread in India, there have been attempts to commemorate Godse. The city of Meerut was proposed to be renamed after him but the possibility of such a name change was ruled out by the District Magistrate.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kelley was a scryer who worked with Dee in his magical investigations. The language is integral to the practice of Enochian magic.\nThe language found in Dee's and Kelley's journals encompasses a limited textual corpus. Linguist Donald Laycock, an Australian Skeptic, studied the Enochian journals, and argues against any extraordinary features. The untranslated texts of the \"Liber Loagaeth\" manuscript recall the patterns of glossolalia rather than true language. Dee did not distinguish the \"Liber Loagaeth\" material from the translated language of the \"Calls\", which is more like an artificial language. This language was called Angelical by Dee and later came to be referred to as \"Enochian\" by subsequent writers. The phonology and grammar resemble English, though the translations are not sufficient to work out any regular morphology. Some Enochian words resemble words and proper names in the Bible, but most have no apparent etymology.\nDee's journals also refer to this language as \"Celestial Speech\", \"First Language of God-Christ\", \"Holy Language\", or \"Language of Angels\". He also referred to it as \"Adamical\" because, according to Dee's angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The term \"Enochian\" comes from Dee's assertion that the Biblical patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.\nHistory.\nAccording to Tobias Churton in his text \"The Golden Builders\", the concept of an Angelic or antediluvian language was common during Dee's time. If one could speak the language of angels, it was believed one could directly interact with them.\nSeeking contact and reported visions.\nIn 1581, Dee mentioned in his personal journals that God had sent \"good angels\" to communicate directly with prophets. In 1582, Dee teamed up with the seer Edward Kelley, although Dee had used several other seers previously. With Kelley's help as a scryer, Dee set out to establish lasting contact with the angels. Their work resulted, among other things, in the reception of Angelical, now more commonly known as Enochian.\nThe reception started on March 26, 1583, when Kelley reported visions in the crystal of a 21-lettered alphabet. A few days later, Kelley started receiving what became the book \"Liber Loagaeth\" (\"Book [of] Speech from God\"). The book consists of 49 great letter tables, or squares made of 49 by 49 letters. (However, each table has a front and a back side, making 98 tables of 49\u00d749 letters altogether.) Dee and Kelley said the angels never translated the texts in this book.\nReceiving the \"Angelic Keys\".\nAbout a year later, at the court of King Stephen B\u00e1thory in Krak\u00f3w, where both alchemists stayed for some time, another set of texts was reportedly received through Kelley. These texts comprise 48 poetic verses with English translations, which in Dee's manuscripts are called , or \"Angelic Keys\". Dee was apparently intending to use these \"Keys\" to open the \"Gates of Understanding\" represented by the magic squares in \"Liber Loagaeth\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your Doctrine delivered, which is contained in 49 Tables. In 49 voices, or callings: which are the Natural Keys to open those, not 49 but 48 (for one is not to be opened) Gates of Understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge to move every Gate...\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But you shall understand that these 19 Calls are the Calls, or entrances into the knowledge of the mystical Tables. Every Table containing one whole leaf, whereunto you need no other circumstances.\u2014\u200a\nPhonology and writing system.\nThe phonology of Enochian is \"thoroughly English\", apart from difficult sequences such as \"bdrios\", \"excolphabmartbh\", \"longamphlg\", \"lapch\", etc. \nThe language was recorded primarily in Latin script. However, individual words written in Enochian script \"appear sporadically throughout the manuscripts\". There are 21 letters in the script; one of those 21 may appear with or without a diacritic dot. Dee mapped these letters of the \"Adamical alphabet\" onto 22 of the letters of the English alphabet, treating U and V as positional variants (as was common at the time) and omitting the English letters J, K, and W. The Enochian script is written from right to left in John Dee's diary. Different documents have slightly different forms of the script. The alphabet also shares many graphical similarities to a script, also attributed to the prophet Enoch, that appeared in the \"Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam\" of Johannes Pantheus, a copy of which Dee is known to have owned.\nEnochian orthography closely follows Early Modern English orthography, for example in having soft and hard \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8g\u27e9, and in using digraphs \u27e8ch\u27e9, \u27e8ph\u27e9, \u27e8sh\u27e9, and \u27e8th\u27e9 for the sounds , , , and . Laycock mapped Enochian orthography to its sound system and says, \"the resulting pronunciation makes it sound much more like English than it looks at first sight\". However, the difficult strings of consonants and vowels in words such as \"ooaona\", \"paombd\", \"smnad\" and \"noncf\" are the kind of pattern one gets by joining letters from a text together in an arbitrary pattern. As Laycock notes, \"The reader can test this by taking, for example, every tenth letter on this page, and dividing the string of letters into words. The 'text' created will tend to look rather like Enochian.\"\nThe Enochian letters, with their letter names and English equivalents as given by Dee, and pronunciations as reconstructed by Laycock, are as follows. Modern pronunciation conventions vary, depending on the affiliations of the practitioner.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA number of fonts for the Enochian script are available. They use the ASCII range, with the letters assigned to the codepoints of their English equivalents.\nGrammar.\nMorphology.\nThe grammar is for the most part without articles or prepositions. Adjectives are quite rare. Aaron Leitch identifies several affixes in Enochian, including \"-o\" (indicating 'of') and \"-ax\" (which functions like \"-ing\" in English). Leitch observes that, unlike English, Enochian appears to have a vocative case, citing Dee's note in the margin of the First Table of \"Loagaeth\" \u2013 \"Befes the vocative case of Befafes\".\nCompounds.\nCompounds are frequent in the Enochian corpus. Modifiers and indicators are typically compounded with the nouns and verbs modified or indicated. These compounds can occur with demonstrative pronouns and conjunctions, as well as with various forms of the verb 'to be'. The compounding of nouns with adjectives or other verbs is less common. Compounds may exhibit variant spellings of the words combined.\nConjugation.\nConjugation can result in spelling changes which can appear to be random or haphazard. Due to this, Aaron Leitch has expressed doubt as to whether Enochian actually has conjugations. The very scant evidence of Enochian verb conjugation seems quite reminiscent of English, including the verb 'to be' which is highly irregular.\nLaycock reports that the largest number of forms are recorded for 'be' and for \"goh-\" 'say':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNote that \"christeos\" 'let there be' might be from 'Christ', and if so is not part of a conjugation.\nFor negation of verbs, two constructions are attested: e.g. \"chis ge\" 'are not' (\"chis\" 'they are') and \"ip uran\" 'not see' (\"uran\" 'see').\nPronouns.\nWhile Enochian does have personal pronouns, they are rare and used in ways that can be difficult to understand. Relative possessive pronouns do exist but are used sparingly.\nAttested personal pronouns (Dee's material only):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemonstrative pronouns: \"oi\" 'this', \"unal\" 'these, those', \"priaz(i)\" 'those'.\nSyntax.\nWord order closely follows English, except for the dearth of articles and prepositions. Adjectives, although rare, typically precede the noun as in English.\nVocabulary and corpus.\nLaycock notes that there are about 250 different words in the corpus of Enochian texts, more than half of which occur only once. A few resemble words in the Bible \u2013 mostly proper names \u2013 in both sound and meaning. For example, \"luciftias\" \"brightness\" resembles Lucifer \"the light-bearer\"; \"babalond\" \"wicked, harlot\" resembles Babylon. Leitch notes a number of root words in Enochian. He lists \"Doh\", \"I\", \"Ia\", \"Iad\", among others, as likely root words.[] While the \"Angelic Keys\" contain most of the known vocabulary of Enochian, dozens of further words are found throughout Dee's journals.\nThousands of additional, undefined words are contained in the \"Liber Loagaeth\". Laycock notes that the material in \"Liber Loagaeth\" appears to be different from the language of the 'Calls' found in the \"Angelic Keys\", which appear to have been generated from the tables and squares of the \"Loagaeth\". According to Laycock:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The texts in the \"Loagaeth\" show patterning \"characteristically found in certain types of meaningless language (such as glossolalia), which is often produced under conditions similar to trance. In other words, Kelley may have been 'speaking in tongues'. [...] there is no evidence that these early invocations are any form of 'language' [...] at all.\nDictionaries.\nThere have been several compilations of Enochian words made to form Enochian dictionaries. A scholarly study is Donald Laycock's \"The Complete Enochian Dictionary\". Also useful is Vinci's \"Gmicalzoma: An Enochian Dictionary\".\nRepresentation of numbers.\nThe number system is inexplicable. It seems possible to identify the numerals from 0 to 10:\nHowever, Enochian texts contain larger numbers written in alphabetical form, and there is no discernible system behind them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs Laycock put it, \"the test of any future spirit-revelation of the Enochian language will be the explanation of this numerical system.\"\nRelation to other languages.\nDee believed Enochian to be the Adamic language universally spoken before the confusion of tongues. However, modern analysis shows Enochian to be an English-like constructed language. Word order closely follows English, except for the dearth of articles and prepositions. The very scant evidence of Enochian verb conjugation is likewise reminiscent of English, more so than with Semitic languages such as Hebrew, which Dee said were debased versions of the Enochian language.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Belcher Islands are spread out over almost . Administratively, they belong to the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada.\nThe hamlet of Sanikiluaq, where the majority of the inhabitants of the Belcher Islands live, is on the north coast of Flaherty Island and is the southernmost in Nunavut. Along with Flaherty Island, the other large islands are Kugong Island, Tukarak Island, and Innetalling Island. Other main islands in the 1,500-island archipelago are Moore Island, Wiegand Island, Split Island, Snape Island, and Mavor Island, while island groups include the Sleeper Islands, King George Islands, and Bakers Dozen Islands.\nHistory.\nThe archaeological evidence present on the islands indicates that they were inhabited by the Dorset culture between 500 BCE and 1000 CE. Centuries later, from 1200 to 1500, the Thule people made their presence on the islands.\nThe first European to encounter the islands was English sea explorer Henry Hudson, the namesake of Hudson Bay, who sighted the islands in 1610. In 1670, the islands and the entirety of Hudson Bay drainage basin were designated by the English king, Charles II, as Rupert's Land, managed by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). The islands are likely named after Captain James Belcher, an HBC employee in the early 18th-century, or after Royal Navy Admiral Sir Edward Belcher (1799\u20131877).\nIn the early 19th century, caribou herds which lived on the islands disappeared. In an alternative effort to find warm clothing, the inhabitants of the islands sought the down of eider ducks, seaducks who nest on the island. In 1870, Rupert's Land was ceded to the Northwest Territories.\nBefore 1914, English-speaking cartographers knew very little about the Belcher Islands, which they showed on maps as specks, much smaller than their true extent. In that year a map showing them, drawn by George Weetaltuk, came into the hands of Robert Flaherty, and cartographers began to represent them more accurately.\nCirca 1933, the Hudson's Bay Company opened a fur trade post, which served as an outpost of the Great Whale River post until 1935, when it became a full post. In 1941, a religious movement led by Charley Ouyerack, Peter Sala, and his sister Mina caused the death by blows or exposure of nine persons, an occurrence that came to be known as the Belcher Island Murders. In 1948, the HBC closed its Belcher Islands post.\nIn 1963, the HBC opened a Northern Store on the Belcher Islands, which was named Sanikiluaq from 1978 on. HBC divested the Northern Stores department in 1987 to The North West Company, which still operates a Northern Store at Sanikiluaq.\nIn 1999, when Nunavut was separated from Northwest Territories, the Belcher Islands were included within Nunavut, along with most islands in Hudson Bay.\nGeology.\nGeneral geology.\nThe geologic units of the Belcher Group, which forms the Belcher Islands, were deposited during the Paleoproterozoic. Combined with other Paleoproterozoic units that occur along the edge of the Superior Craton, the Belcher Group forms part of the Circum-Superior Belt.\nFrom youngest to oldest, the Belcher Group is composed of:\nThe oldest part of the Belcher Group, the Kasegalik Formation, was deposited between 2.0185 and 2.0154 billion years ago. The Kasegalik Formation also contains the oldest unambiguous Cyanobacteria microfossils. Much of the Belcher Group strata were deposited under intertidal to shallow-water conditions, although the Mavor Formation formed a platform margin stromatolite reef complex, and the overlying Costello and Laddie formations represent slope and deep basin deposits, respectively. The Kipalu Formation, deposited approximately 1.88 billion years ago, is notable for being a granular iron formation. The Flaherty Formation basalt that composes much of the Belcher Islands was deposited between 1.87 and 1.854 billion years ago, with the overlying Omarolluk and Loaf formations being deposited from 1.854 billion years ago until sometime after 1.83 billion years ago.\nSoapstone.\nThe occurrence of very high-quality soapstone in the Belcher Islands supports a locally significant carving industry. These soapstone occurrences formed when sedimentary rocks of the Belcher Group were intruded by Haig sills and dykes approximately 1.87 billion years ago. Most soapstone is quarried from a site on western Tukarak Island where dolomite of the Costello Formation was intruded by hot magma, with dolomite reacting with quartz and water under intense heat to form talc, calcite, and carbon dioxide:\nOther minerals within the soapstone are largely calcite, dolomite, talc, and clinochlore, with minor amounts of ilmenite.\nAlthough most soapstone has been sourced from two quarries, the relatively widespread occurrence of Haig intrusions within the Belcher Islands suggests that there may be many more possible sources of high-quality soapstone not yet discovered.\nFlora.\nSeveral species of willow (\"Salix\") form a large component of the native small shrubbery on the archipelago. These include rock willow (\"Salix vestita\"), bog willow (\"S.\u00a0pedicellaris\"), and Labrador willow (\"S.\u00a0argyrocarpa\"), as well as naturally occurring hybrids between \"S.\u00a0arctica\" and \"S.\u00a0glauca\". Trees cannot grow on the islands because of a lack of adequate soil.\nFauna.\nThe main wildlife consists of belugas, walrus, caribou, common eiders and snowy owls all of which can be seen on the island year round. There is also a wide variety of fish that can be caught such as Arctic char, cod, capelin, lump fish, and sculpin. The historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and the eider is the subject of a feature-length Canadian documentary film called \"People of a Feather\". The director, cinematographer and biologist Joel Heath, spent seven years on the project, writing biological articles on the eider.\nIn 1998, the Belcher Island caribou (\"Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus\") herd numbered 800.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prior to 2021, it was known as the Arizona League (AZL). Along with the Florida Complex League (FCL), it forms the lowest rung on the North American minor-league ladder.\nACL teams play at the minor league spring training complexes of their parent Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs and are owned by those parent clubs. Admission is not charged and no concessions are operated at the teams' games. Every Cactus League team fields at least one team in the league. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, although games may also be played at the team's practice fields.\nAs of the 2021 season, there is no league limit to how many players can be on an active roster, but no team can have more than three players with four or more years of minor-league experience. Major-league players on rehabilitation assignments may also appear in the league.\nHistory.\nArizona League.\nThe league began play in 1988 as the Arizona League (AZL) on an experimental basis with four teams playing a 60-game schedule\u2014the teams were affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and a cooperative between the Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners. Games were scheduled in the morning in order to make sure the league did not compete with the Phoenix Firebirds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.\nThe Phoenix Diamondbacks debuted in 1996, the first affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks to start playing professional baseball, two years before their parent club joined Major League Baseball. A crowd of 6,124 attended the Diamondbacks' first game on June 25, 1996, a 15\u20137 loss to the Phoenix Athletics. A number of local dignitaries were at the game, including Buck Showalter and Jerry Colangelo.\nThe Colorado Rockies started their rookie league team a year before starting major league play as well in 1992, sharing a team with the Cubs. The team, composed of the Rockies' first-ever draft picks, received a different level of notoriety than the Diamondbacks for their first rookie league game: as the players wore either Rockies jerseys or Cubs jerseys, the team did not have their uniform pants ready at the start of the season, and had to borrow pants from the Cubs.\nBetween 1998 and 2000 an unaffiliated team composed of young players from the Mexican League played out of the Tucson Electric Park spring training complex, in part to add a fourth team to a southern division. Three Tucson-based teams (the Mexican All-Stars, the Diamondbacks, and the Rockies) would leave the league after the 2000 season, largely due to travel concerns, followed by the White Sox two years later. All three teams later relocated their spring training complexes to the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the Diamondbacks and White Sox reinstated their rookie league teams.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.\nArizona Complex League.\nPrior to the 2021 season, in continuation of MLB's reorganization of the minor leagues, the two US-based complex leagues were renamed, with the Arizona League becoming the Arizona Complex League (ACL).\nFor 2025, the league consists of 17 teams. Beginning in 2024, the schedule was changed from a season which ran from late-June through late-August to a season which runs from early-May through late-July. This change also made it so the league would no longer feature players drafted in the current year's draft, which in 2021 was changed to take place during the All-Star Weekend in mid-July.\nTeams.\nTeams in the league are not referred to by their home city, but simply by their parent club's name. A prefix of ACL (previously AZL or Arizona League) is typically used to differentiate the team from its parent club and other farm teams with the same nickname. City names have been used previously instead of a prefix, such as with the Peoria Padres and Peoria Mariners. Franchises that field more than one team use differentiating suffixes, typically based on team colors (e.g. Blue and Gold). As of the 2025 season,[ [update]] no major league club fields more than one ACL team.\nChampions.\nLeague champions have been determined by different means since the league's formation in 1988. Prior to 1998, the league champion was the team with best record over the course of the season. Since 1998, the season has been split into two half-seasons. From 1998 to 2008, the teams with the best records in each half faced off to decide the league champion. If the same team won both halves, they were automatically crowned champions (only one team accomplished this, the 2005 Arizona League Giants).\nIn 2009, the league split into two divisions, an alignment that was used through the 2012 season. The two teams in each division with the best record in each half-season played off for the division championship, and the winners advanced to the final. If the same team won their division in both halves, they advanced directly to the final.\nFrom 2013 to 2019, the six teams who won their division in the first and second half of the season qualified for the playoffs. If a team won both halves, the next best team in that division by overall record qualified for the playoffs. The top two teams by overall record received a bye to the semifinals. All playoff games were single elimination, with the exception of a best-of-three final.\nSince 2022, four teams\u2014three division winners and one wild card team\u2014have qualified for the playoffs seeded by winning percentage regardless of division standing, with seeds 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 3 playing in a single-game semi-final.

Major-league players on rehabilitation assignments may also appear in the league.\nHistory.\nComplex-based baseball leagues, which played before sparse crowds and often scheduled morning games to avoid the summer heat and afternoon thunderstorms, were adopted after the drastic shrinking of minor league baseball during the 1950s and 1960s. MLB teams needed an entry level to professional baseball for 18- and 19-year-old players graduating from high schools or signed from Latin America. They replaced Class C and Class D leagues as the lowest rung on the minor league ladder.\nThe current league was founded in 1964 as the Sarasota Rookie League (SRL) with four teams playing in Sarasota. It was originally intended to be the Gulf Coast division of a statewide rookie league, with the eastern division Cocoa Rookie League based in Cocoa. However, the eastern and western teams never played each other. The SRL's four teams consisted of squads sponsored by the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Braves, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals. The SRL Braves, managed by Paul Snyder, future Atlanta farm system director, won the championship with a 36\u201323 record.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe league added teams in Bradenton in 1965 and changed its name to the Florida Rookie League.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGulf Coast League.\nThe league adopted Gulf Coast League (GCL) naming for the 1966 season.

The league featured the Beeville Bees/Laredo Oilers (59\u201341), Corpus Christi Seahawks (43\u201358), Kingsville Jerseys/McAllen Palms/Mission Grapefruiters (46\u201352) and Victoria Rosebuds/Edinburg Bobcats (51\u201348) teams.\nThe 1950\u20131953 version of the Gulf Coast League featured the Brownsville Charros, Corpus Christi Aces, Galveston White Caps, Harlingen Capitals, Lake Charles Lakers, Laredo Apaches, Port Arthur Seahawks and Texas City Texans. The Crowley Millers, Jacksonville Jax, Lufkin/Leesville Angels played in the league in 1950. All three versions of the league operated around the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana.\nOn June 21, 2016, the GCL hired Jen Pawol, the first female umpire in Minor League Baseball since 2007, and the first in the GCL since 1978. In 2017, the GCL hired another woman umpire, Emma Charlesworth-Seiler.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being canceled on June 30.\nFlorida Complex League.\nPrior to the 2021 season, in continuation of MLB's reorganization of the minor leagues, the two US-based complex leagues were renamed, with the Gulf Coast League becoming the Florida Complex League (FCL).\nLeague format.\nThe league plays a 52- to 56-game season that traditionally began in mid-June and concluded in late August.

Arizona Fall League rosters are filled by many of the top prospects in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) who are assigned by their parent clubs.\nStructure.\nThe six teams of the AFL are organized in two three-team divisions. Each AFL team is affiliated with five teams in Major League Baseball (MLB), and each MLB team provides seven players from their Minor League Baseball affiliates, yielding 35-man rosters. Specific players are invited (not assigned) to play in the AFL by their parent club. The league provides an environment for top prospects to advance their development, in a setting that MLB governs and monitors, as opposed to other offseason leagues (such as the Puerto Rican Winter League) located outside of the contiguous United States.\nPlayer eligibility has changed over time; as of 2008, each MLB organization could only provide one player below the Double-A level, and before 2019 there were service-time limits for any players on the 40-man roster of an MLB team, but as of 2021 all players within an MLB organization are eligible. Free agents are not eligible. The seven players each MLB organization provides consist of four pitchers and three position players. Positional needs for each AFL team (e.g. catchers) are coordinated between player development directors of the affiliated MLB organizations via a \"position draft\". An MLB organization can assign more than three position players; such players serve as a taxi squad for the AFL team and are limited to playing two games each week.\nPlay generally begins in early October (10/7 for 2024) and runs until mid-November, although play continued into early December for the first five seasons that the league operated. Each team plays approximately 30 games; schedule length has varied somewhat during the league's history. Following the end of the league's regular season, the two division winners meet in a championship game.\nPlayers wear uniforms of their respective MLB parent club, along with an AFL team-specific hat. The league had its own team-specific uniforms before 1998 and in 2019. The manager, pitching coach, and hitting coach of each AFL team are provided by MLB organizations on a rotating basis.\nEach team plays home games at its own ballpark, each of which currently has a seating capacity in excess of 10,000 spectators. For the 2019 season, only four venues were used due to ballpark renovation work.\nThe league has organized an annual all-star game since 2006. Initially known as the \"Rising Stars Showcase\", it has been branded as the \"Fall Stars Game\" since at least 2013. Included in the 2022 season was the Homerun derby. Players for the game are selected by league staff, scouting and farm directors, and MLB.com writers.\nHistory.\nThe league's inaugural season was 1992, during which each team played a 54-game schedule that ended in early December. The divisions and teams that season were:\nThe league's first game was played on October 6, 1992, with the Grand Canyon Rafters defeating the Scottsdale Scorpions, 6\u20134.\nBefore the 1994 season, the Javelinas relocated from Tucson to Peoria, to limit travel distances to the Phoenix metropolitan area. All teams have been located in greater Phoenix since then.\nSince 1995, when the Diamondbacks became the Desert Dogs, no team has changed its nickname. However, each team has changed its location at least once during its history. The most recent change was by the Desert Dogs, who moved from Phoenix to Glendale in 2013.\nFor the 1998 season, organizers rostered players onto each Arizona Fall League team from a single division in MLB:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2007, the United States national baseball team and China national baseball team played several games against AFL teams; both teams were later competitors in baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2019, the Mesa Solar Sox participated in the \"Vamos a Tucson\" Mexican Baseball Fiesta in early October, facing teams of the Mexican Pacific League.\nIn 2019, the league adopted a new logo. In 2020, the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA number of future MLB All-Stars have had stints in the Arizona Fall League; over 300, per the league's website. These include David Wright (2003), Dustin Pedroia (2004), Andre Ethier (2005), Bryce Harper (2010\u20132011), Nolan Arenado (2011), Mike Trout (2011), Mookie Betts (2013), Aaron Judge (2014), Gleyber Torres (2016), and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. (2017). In 1994, Michael Jordan played for Scottsdale during his time away from the NBA. Similarly, former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow played for Scottsdale in 2016 during his foray into professional baseball.\nCurrent teams.\nEach stadium hosts one or two of its MLB affiliates, denoted in bold, during spring training.\nEach listed city is in Arizona. Team affiliations reflect the 2025 season.\nResults by season.\nResults for each team since the league's inaugural 1992 season are listed below. Teams are listed by their nicknames only, independent of location, as various team locations have changed over time. Tie games are not listed, as they are excluded from winning percentage calculations, which determine division standings.

Prolific writers from the city include Geraldine Brooks, Jackie French, Kathy Lette, Phillip Knightley and Richard Neville.\nThe largest library in Sydney is the State Library of New South Wales, which holds over 4.7 million items, including two million books, and hosts free exhibitions in its gallery spaces. Most local government areas within Sydney have local libraries including the City of Sydney Library with eight local branches, the Bankstown City Library, the Max Webber Library in Blacktown and many others.\nTourism.\nMany of the tourist attractions are scattered all over the city, the most famous and visited being the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Other attractions include the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum of Contemporary Art, White Rabbit Gallery and Sydney Tower.\nSydney's nightlife has declined since the introduction of lockout laws, which call for 1.30am lockouts and 3am last drinks. Prior to the introduction of the laws, Kings Cross was known as the city's red-light district. There are huge celebrations for New Year's Eve and Australia Day in Sydney, including a fireworks display that features the Harbour Bridge.\nMany festivals are held in Sydney, including the Sydney Festival, a celebration of partly free performances throughout January; Vivid Sydney, a festival of light and music held annually in May\u2013June; the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (see below); the annual Sydney Film Festival and many smaller festivals such as Tropfest.\nThere are also several music festivals including Big Day Out, Homebake, The Great Escape, and Stereosonic.\nSport.\nSport is an important part of the culture in Sydney. New South Wales has attracted many international multi-sport events including the 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney. Sydney was also the host of the 1938 British Empire Games. The Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium, is the scene of the annual NRL Grand Final. It also regularly hosts rugby league State of Origin as well as rugby union and soccer internationals. It hosted the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the memorable soccer World Cup qualifier between Australia and Uruguay.\nThe Sydney Cricket Ground traditionally hosts the 'New Year' cricket test match from 2\u20136 January each year. The annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race begins in Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day, whilst the climax of Australia's touring car racing series is the Bathurst 1000, held at the Mount Panorama Circuit near the city of Bathurst in the Western Plains.\nThe Sydney Autumn Racing Carnival features the richest two-year-old horse race in the world, the Golden Slipper Stakes, which is run in April every year. The Medibank International tennis tournament is held in January prior to the Australian Open. The City to Surf foot race is held every August and is one of the largest timed foot races in the world.\nRugby.\nRugby league football has a place with some Sydneysiders, as a sporting and a tradition within the city. This stems back from the earlier colonial days of the city where the city and its cultural were largely dictated by wealthy Englishmen whom traditionally played and were supporters of the Rugby code of football, which was largely advertised and passed on to the people of Sydney, including the working class who in back in England largely played soccer. The game quickly grew a working-class following, and has been a Sydney tradition ever since.\nThe headquarters of the Australian Rugby League and National Rugby League (NRL) are in Sydney, which is home to nine of the 16 NRL football clubs (Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Parramatta Eels, Cronulla Sharks, Wests Tigers, Penrith Panthers, Bulldogs and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles), as well as being the northern home of the St George Illawarra Dragons, which is half-based in Wollongong.\nSydney has a local club rugby union competition (the Shute Shield), and a Super Rugby team the NSW Waratahs, who play their games in the city and represent the entire state of New South Wales. They were represented in the defunct Australian Rugby Championship by Sydney Fleet, and Central Coast Rays. The National Rugby Championship has four NSW teams: Sydney Stars, Greater Sydney Rams, North Harbour Rays and NSW Country Eagles. The Australian Rugby Union headquarters are located in Sydney. The Waratahs play out of the Sydney Football Stadium, and when in Sydney the Wallabies play out of Stadium Australia.\nAustralian rules football.\nAustralian rules football, commonly known as Australian Football League (AFL), is a developing game in most of NSW with increasing popularity. In Sydney, local competitions established in 1880 and again in 1903 competed with rugby union football and then rugby league football.\nThe AFL has two teams from Sydney, the Sydney Swans and the Greater Western Sydney Giants. Formerly South Melbourne, the Swans moved up to Sydney in 1982, after hitting financial trouble. The Swans have won two premierships since moving to Sydney (in 2005 and 2012). Attendance for Swans matches has slowly risen since their relocation. The Giants, based in Western Sydney and Canberra, joined the AFL in 2012. The inaugural AFL Women's in 2017 included a GWS Giants team.\nSoccer.\nWhilst having a strong sporting tradition in the field of Rugby League, Sydney also has a long and strong tradition in association football. Early football clubs in Sydney were relatively small, and did not have very large followings, and like the general population of Sydney in the late 1800s the clubs were largely English in nature, but when the Australian government began its immigration policy in years closely following World War II, many immigrants left Europe in search of new homes in Sydney, and Australia in general. These migrant groups who were subject to racism from the existing population took it upon themselves to found their own football clubs, celebrating their particular ethnic communities.\nThe three largest such clubs were founded by the three largest post war immigration groups respectively, they are: Marconi Stallions Football Club (Italian), Sydney Olympic Football Club (Greek), and Sydney United Football Club (Croatian). Along with these larger clubs, there are also many smaller clubs formed by ethnic groups, who also bare suburban names, such as Bankstown City Lions Football Club (Macedonian), Bonnyrigg White Eagles (Serbian), Parramatta Eagles (Maltese), and St. George Saints Football Club (Hungarian). These \"ethnic\" clubs soon began to dominate football in Sydney, drawing large crowd support from their given ethnic groups, and having their fair share of on field success too.\nIn 2005, a new club was founded in Sydney called Sydney FC, who were to be based in central Sydney as opposed to being based at a small suburban stadium, and were founded specifically to attract a multicultural following. They were entered in a new league to be known as the A-League, this would act as the show piece national football competition, contested by similarly formed clubs from other large cities around Australia. In the first 6 years of their existence, Sydney FC have been relatively successful building up a solid support base of around 10,000 members, and sometimes attracting crowds of up to 40,000.\nCricket.\nThe NSW Blues are by far the most successful domestic cricket side in Australia having won the First-class competition 44 times and the One-Day Domestic cup nine times. They occasionally play first-class matches against touring International sides. The team's main home ground is the Sydney Cricket Ground. In the Twenty20 Big Bash League and Women's Big Bash League, the state is represented by the Sydney Sixers, playing at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Sydney Thunder, playing at the Sydney Showground.\nBasketball and netball.\nThe Sydney Kings and Wollongong Hawks are the state's representatives in the National Basketball League (NBL). These teams have all featured in the finals series since 2002\u201303, the Kings winning 3 consecutive premierships in 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304 &amp; 2004\u201305. There are 12 teams in the New South Wales conference of the Australian Basketball Association, the Waratah League. The Sydney Uni Flames play in the Women's National Basketball League. Giants Netball were formed when the Greater Western Sydney Giants football club were given one of the three licenses for new teams for the first season of the Super Netball league in 2017.\nCommunities and subcultures.\nMulticultural communities.\nAreas with a large proportion of people born overseas and with non-English speaking backgrounds include Auburn, Fairfield, Liverpool, and Bankstown. Generally Western European and North American born people have settled around the Lower North Shore, eastern suburbs and Sutherland Shire, the Portuguese in Surry Hills, Arab people around the Lakemba-Auburn region, Indo-Chinese in the south-western suburbs, South Asians around Parramatta and the south east, and North East Asians in major nodes such as Hurstville, Burwood, Ashfield, Strathfield, Chatswood, Eastwood, Campsie and Haymarket.\nLGBTIQ community.\nSydney has a significant LGBTIQ+ community, centred on Oxford Street, and holds the annual Sydney Gay and marcus Lesbian Mardi Gras. The Sydney lesbian community, though still active around Oxford Street, is well established and visible in Newtown and Enmore in Sydney's Inner West. There is also a history of lesbian community congregating in Leichhardt, and other inner west suburbs. The Qtopia Sydney museum, which is situated in the former Darlinghurst police station, hosts exhibits relating to Australian LGBTQ history and the AIDS epidemic.\nThere are two magazines available in Sydney and one website with detailed information on Sydney's lesbian community and night-life. \"LOTL\" and \"Cherry\" magazines are free, monthly, Australia wide, publications which can be found around Oxford Street, Glebe and Newtown. The Sapphic Sydney website was a resource which detailed events and community groups as well as featuring a local business directory.\nThere is also a thriving independent queer publishing community in Sydney publishing magazines such as \"Slit\", \"Dirty Queer\", and \"Spunk\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70889", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70889", "title": "Mona Lisa", "text": "Painting by Leonardo da Vinci\nThe Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.\" The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.\nThe painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the \"Mona Lisa\" after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it became the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.\nThe painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism\u2014a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera \"Mona Lisa\", two early 1930s films (\"The Theft of the Mona Lisa\" and \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\"), and the song \"Mona Lisa\" recorded by Nat King Cole\u2014one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.\nThe \"Mona Lisa\" is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100\u00a0million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023[ [update]].\nTitle and subject.\nThe title of the painting, which is known in English as \"Mona Lisa\", is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain. Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" in Italian is a polite form of address originating as \u2014similar to \"Ma'am\", \"Madam\", or \"my lady\" in English. This became , and its contraction . The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as \"Monna Lisa\" (\"\" being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled \"Mona\".\nLisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, , means \"jocund\" (\"happy\" or \"jovial\"), or literally \"the jocund one\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, Giocondo. In French, the title has the same meaning. Vasari's account of the \"Mona Lisa\" comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo's assistant Sala\u00ec, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named \"la Gioconda\", a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain. Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\"\nThe catalogue raisonn\u00e9 \"Leonardo da Vinci\" (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d'Este being the only plausible alternative. Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the \"Mona Lisa\". Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting, including Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Sala\u00ec, and even Leonardo himself. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that Leonardo imparted an approving smile from his mother, Caterina, onto the \"Mona Lisa\" and other works like \"The Baptism of Christ\", \"Virgin of the Rocks\", and \"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\".\nDescription.\nThe \"Mona Lisa\" bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood. The woman sits markedly upright in a pozzetto armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines. The soft blending (\"sfumato\") creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\".\nThe depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere. Frank Z\u00f6llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\" Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's for the use of a \"loggia\", which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of \"Ginevra de' Benci\".\nThe painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, although some scholars favour a realistic description, and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective. The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo chose to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with \"Ginevra de' Benci\", but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting. The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo, over the Arno river. Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches. Some observers find similarities with the Azzone Visconti Bridge.\n\"Mona Lisa\" has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail. In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that \"Mona Lisa\" was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning. Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.\nThere has been much speculation regarding the painting's sitter and landscape background. For example, Leonardo probably painted his sitter's appearance faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\" Some historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings; this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.\nResearch in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that \"Mona Lisa\"'s smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal. Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well. Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that \"Mona Lisa\"'s landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini. Research in 2023/2024 by geologist and art historian Ann Pizzorusso suggests that the landscape contains \"several recognisable features of Lecco, on the shores of Lake Como in the Lombardy region of northern Italy.\"\nHistory.\nCreation and date.\nOf Leonardo da Vinci's works, the \"Mona Lisa\" is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works\u2014the others being \"Saint Jerome in the Wilderness\", \"Adoration of the Magi\" and \"The Last Supper\"\u2014whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the sitter for the \"Mona Lisa\", by October 1503. It is believed by some that the \"Mona Lisa\" was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence. Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513. According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\". In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Luc\u00e9 near the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise; it is believed that he took the \"Mona Lisa\" with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France. Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517. Leonardo's right hand was paralytic c.\u20091517, which may indicate why he left the \"Mona Lisa\" unfinished.\nCirca 1505, Raphael executed a pen-and-ink sketch, in which the columns flanking the subject are more apparent. Experts universally agree that it is based on Leonardo's portrait. Other later copies of the \"Mona Lisa\", such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design and The Walters Art Museum, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was thought that the \"Mona Lisa\" had been trimmed. By 1993, Frank Z\u00f6llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed; this was confirmed through a series of tests in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Z\u00f6llner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.\nThe record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon states that the \"Mona Lisa\" was executed for the deceased Giuliano de' Medici, Leonardo's steward at Belvedere, Vienna, between 1513 and 1516; this was likely an error. According to Vasari, the painting was created for the sitter's husband, Francesco del Giocondo. A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions (because of the uncertainty concerning its dating and commissioner, as well as its fate following Leonardo's death in 1519, and the difference of details in Raphael's sketch\u2014which may be explained by the possibility that he made the sketch from memory). The hypothetical first portrait, displaying prominent columns, would have been commissioned by Giocondo c.\u20091503, and left unfinished in Leonardo's pupil and assistant Sala\u00ec's possession until his death in 1524. The second, commissioned by Giuliano de' Medici c.\u20091513, would have been sold by Sala\u00ec to Francis I in 1518, and is the one in the Louvre today. Others believe that there was only one true \"Mona Lisa\" but are divided as to the two aforementioned fates. At some point in the 16th century, a varnish was applied to the painting. It was kept at the Palace of Fontainebleau until Louis XIV moved it to the Palace of Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution. In 1797, it went on permanent display at the Louvre.\nRefuge, theft, and vandalism.\nAfter the French Revolution, the painting was moved to the Louvre but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon (d.\u00a01821) in the Tuileries Palace. Although the \"Mona Lisa\" was not widely known outside the art world, in the 1860s, a portion of the French intelligentsia began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), the painting was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.\nIn 1911, the painting was still not popular among the lay-public. On 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. The painting was first reported missing the next day by painter Louis B\u00e9roud. After some confusion as to whether the painting was being photographed somewhere, the Louvre was closed for a week for investigation. French poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated. The real culprit was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia, who had helped construct the painting's glass case. He carried out the theft by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with the painting hidden under his coat after the museum had closed.\nPeruggia was an Italian patriot who believed that Leonardo's painting should have been returned to an Italian museum. Peruggia may have been motivated by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting's theft. After having kept the \"Mona Lisa\" in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to Giovanni Poggi, director of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914. Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy. A year after the theft, \"Saturday Evening Post\" journalist Karl Decker wrote that he met an alleged accomplice named Eduardo de Valfierno, who claimed to have masterminded the theft. Forger Yves Chaudron was to have created six copies of the painting to sell in the US while concealing the location of the original. Decker published this account of the theft in 1932.\nDuring World War II, it was again removed from the Louvre and taken first to the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, then finally to the Mus\u00e9e Ingres in Montauban. Since the 1990s, the painting has been temporarily moved to accommodate renovations to the Louvre on three occasions: between 1992 and 1995, from 2001 to 2005, and again in 2019.\nOn 30 December 1956, Bolivian Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the \"Mona Lisa\" while it was on display at the Louvre. He did so with such force that it shattered the glass case and dislodged a speck of pigment near the left elbow. The painting was protected by glass because a few years earlier a man who claimed to be in love with the painting had cut it with a razor blade and tried to steal it. After this attack, Salvador Dal\u00ed wrote in 1963 an essay titled \"Why they attack the Mona Lisa\", referencing earlier Freud theories.\nSince the 1956 attack, bulletproof glass has been used to shield the painting from any further attacks, and in all subsequent cases the painting was undamaged. On 21 April 1974, while the painting was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, a woman sprayed it with red paint as a protest against that museum's failure to provide access for disabled people. On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a ceramic teacup purchased at the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.\nOn 29 May 2022, a male activist, disguised as a woman in a wheelchair, threw cake at the protective glass covering the painting in an apparent attempt to raise awareness for climate change; the painting was not damaged. The man was arrested and placed in psychiatric care in the police headquarters, and an investigation was opened after the Louvre filed a complaint. On 28 January 2024, two attackers from an environmentalist group threw soup at the painting's protective glass, demanding the right to \"healthy and sustainable food\" and criticizing the contemporary state of agriculture; the painting was not damaged.\nModern analysis.\nIn the early 21st century, French scientist Pascal Cotte hypothesized a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting. He analysed the painting in the Louvre with reflective light technology beginning in 2004, and produced circumstantial evidence for his theory. Cotte admits that his investigation was carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered as definitive proof. The underlying portrait appears to be of a sitter looking to the side, and lacks flanking columns, but it does not fit with historical descriptions of the painting. Both Vasari and Gian Paolo Lomazzo describe the subject as smiling, unlike the subject in Cotte's supposed portrait. In 2020, Cotte published a study alleging that the painting has an underdrawing, transferred from a preparatory drawing via the \"spolvero\" technique.\nConservation.\nThe \"Mona Lisa\" has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that \"the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.\" It has never been fully restored, so the current condition is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had \"acted with a great deal of restraint.\" Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure. Despite the treatments, the \"Mona Lisa\" has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel's warping caused the curators \"some worry\", the 2004\u201305 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.\nPoplar panel.\nAt some point, the \"Mona Lisa\" was removed from its original frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed near the top of the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skillfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth. The picture is kept under strict, climate-controlled conditions in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50%\u00a0\u00b110%, and the temperature is maintained between and . To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of silica gel treated to provide 55% relative humidity.\nFrame.\nBecause the \"Mona Lisa\"'s poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the \"Mona Lisa\" was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004\u201305, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp. The \"Mona Lisa\" has had many different decorative frames in its history. In 1909, the art collector Comtesse de B\u00e9hague gave the portrait its current frame, a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the \"Mona Lisa\". The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, albeit no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.\nCleaning and touch-up.\nThe first and most extensive recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the \"Mona Lisa\" was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, who was responsible for the restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-ups of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eug\u00e8ne Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the \"Mona Lisa\". Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent and to lightly touch up several scratches on the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to \"Mona Lisa\"'s left elbow with watercolour. In 1977, a new insect infestation was discovered in the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.\nDisplay.\nOn 6 April 2005\u2014following a period of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysis\u2014the painting was moved to a new location within the museum's Salle des \u00c9tats. It is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bulletproof glass. Since 2005, the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and a new 20-watt LED lamp that was specially designed for this painting was installed in 2013. The lamp has a colour rendering index of up to 98 and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which could otherwise degrade the painting. The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television. As of 2019, about 10.2\u00a0million people view the painting at the Louvre each year. A new queuing system introduced in 2019 reduces the amount of time museum visitors have to wait in line to see the painting. After going through the queue, a group has about 30 seconds to see the painting.\nOn the 500th anniversary of the master's death, the Louvre held the largest ever single exhibit of Leonardo's works from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020. The \"Mona Lisa\" was not included because it is in such great demand among visitors to the museum; the painting remained on display in its gallery. In 2024, it was decided to place the panel in a separate room. This change will require significant construction changes, including a new entrance to the Louvre and two rooms in the basement under the museum's square courtyard. Due to the renovation, visitors will be able to pass directly to the painting, which will reduce queues at the Louvre.\nLegacy.\nThe \"Mona Lisa\" began influencing contemporary Florentine painting even before its completion. Raphael, who had been to Leonardo's workshop several times, promptly used elements of the portrait's composition and format in several of his works, such as \"Young Woman with Unicorn\" (c.\u20091506), and \"Portrait of Maddalena Doni\" (c.\u20091506). Later paintings by Raphael, such as (1515\u201316) and \"Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione\" (c.\u20091514\u201315), continued to borrow from Leonardo's painting. Zollner states that \"None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the \"Mona Lisa\". It became the definitive example of the Renaissance portrait and perhaps for this reason is seen not just as the likeness of a real person, but also as the embodiment of an ideal.\"\nWhere earlier critics such as Vasari in the 16th century and Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien in the 17th praised the picture for its realism, by the mid-19th century, writers began to regard the \"Mona Lisa\" as imbued with a sense of mystery and romance. In 1859, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote that the \"Mona Lisa\" was a \"sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously\" and that \"Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully.\" Walter Pater's essay of 1869 described the sitter as \"older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her.\"\nBy the early 20th century, some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories. Upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had \"simply become an incubus, and [he] was glad to be rid of her.\" Jean Metzinger's \"Le go\u00fbter (Tea Time)\" was exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne and was sarcastically described as \"la Joconde \u00e0 la cuiller\" (Mona Lisa with a spoon) by art critic Louis Vauxcelles on the front page of Gil Blas. Andr\u00e9 Salmon subsequently described the painting as \"The Mona Lisa of Cubism\".\nThe avant-garde art world has made note of the \"Mona Lisa\"'s undeniable popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, Dadaists and Surrealists often produce modifications and caricatures. In 1883, \"Le rire,\" an image of a \"Mona Lisa\" smoking a pipe, by Eug\u00e8ne Bataille (Sapeck), was shown at the \"Incoherents\" show in Paris. In 1919, Marcel Duchamp, one of the most influential modern artists, created \"L.H.O.O.Q.\", a \"Mona Lisa\" parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and goatee. Duchamp added an inscription, which when read out loud in French sounds like \"Elle a chaud au cul\" (meaning \"she has a hot ass\"), implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and intended as a Freudian joke. According to Rhonda R. Shearer, the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp's own face.\nSalvador Dal\u00ed, famous for his surrealist work, painted \"Self portrait as Mona Lisa\" in 1954. Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple \"Mona Lisa\"s, called \"Thirty Are Better than One\", following the painting's visit to the United States in 1963. The French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader has created versions of the \"Mona Lisa\" on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style. A 2014 \"New Yorker\" magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the \"Mona Lisa\" smile in an animation showing progressively more maniacal smiles.\nFame.\nIn the 21st century, the \"Mona Lisa\" is considered the most famous painting in the world, a destination painting. Until the 20th century, it was one among many highly regarded artworks. Once part of King Francis I of France's collection, the \"Mona Lisa\" was among the first artworks to be exhibited in the Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. Leonardo began to be revered as a genius, and the painting's popularity grew in the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia praised it as mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale. The Baedeker guide in 1878 called it \"the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre\", but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public.\nThe 1911 theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" and its subsequent return was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting. During the 20th century, it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning, and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in \"300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements\". The \"Mona Lisa\" was regarded as \"just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting's theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.\"\nFrom December 1962 to March 1963, the French government lent it to the United States to be displayed in New York City and Washington, D.C. It was shipped on the new ocean liner SS \"France\". In New York, an estimated 1.7\u00a0million people queued \"in order to cast a glance at the \"Mona Lisa\" for 20 seconds or so.\" While exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting was nearly drenched in water because of a faulty sprinkler; the painting's bullet-proof glass case protected it. In 1974, the painting was exhibited in Tokyo and Moscow. In 2014, 9.3\u00a0million people visited the Louvre. Former director Henri Loyrette reckoned that \"80\u00a0percent of the people only want to see the \"Mona Lisa\".\"\nFinancial worth.\nBefore the 1962\u20131963 tour, the painting was assessed for insurance at $100\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), making it, in practice, the most highly-valued painting in the world. The insurance was not purchased; instead, more was spent on security. In 2014, a France 24 article suggested that the painting could be sold to help ease the national debt, although it was observed that the \"Mona Lisa\" and other such art works were prohibited from being sold by French heritage law, which states that, \"Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise.\"\nCultural depictions.\nCultural depictions of the \"Mona Lisa\" include: \nEarly versions and copies.\n\"Prado Museum La Gioconda\".\nA version of \"Mona Lisa\" known as (\"Woman by Leonardo da Vinci's hand\", Museo del Prado, Madrid) was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo. Since its restoration in 2012, it is now thought to have been executed by one of Leonardo's pupils in his studio at the same time as \"Mona Lisa\" was being painted. The Prado's conclusion that the painting is probably by Sala\u00ec (1480\u20131524) or by Melzi (1493\u20131572) has been called into question by others. The restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original \"Mona Lisa\", leading to the speculation that it is part of the world's first stereoscopic pair; however, a 2017 report demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.\n\"Isleworth Mona Lisa\".\nA version of the \"Mona Lisa\" known as the \"Isleworth Mona Lisa\" was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation. It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\". The current scholarly consensus on attribution is unclear. Some experts, including Frank Z\u00f6llner, Martin Kemp, and Luke Syson denied the attribution to Leonardo; professors such as Salvatore Lorusso, Andrea Natali, and John F Asmus supported it; others like Alessandro Vezzosi and Carlo Pedretti were uncertain.\n\"Hermitage Mona Lisa\".\nA version known as the \"Hermitage Mona Lisa\" is in the Hermitage Museum and it was made by an unknown 16th-century artist.\n\"Mona Lisa\" illusion.\nIf a person being photographed looks into the camera lens, the image produced provides an illusion that viewers perceive as the subject looking at them, irrespective of the photograph's position. It is presumably for this reason that many people, while taking photographs, ask subjects to look at the camera rather than anywhere else. In psychology, this is known as the \"\"Mona Lisa\" illusion\", which was named after the famous painting that also presents the same illusion.\nFeatures of the golden ratio.\nThe painting has features of the golden ratio and reveals several Golden triangles as well as the Golden spiral.\nIn \"Figure 1\", the point formula_1 (Mona Lisa's left eye) divides the lines formula_2 and formula_3 in the golden ratio.\nThe triangles formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9 are golden triangles, because in each of these six triangles base and legs are in the golden ratio to each other.\nThe Golden spiral is shown in Figure 2. It is positioned so that it starts at Mona Lisa's right wrist and touches the top of her head. The tip of her nose then forms the point towards which the spiral converges.\nThere is little evidence to suggest that Leonardo intentionally used the golden ratio in the painting according to Walter Isaacson.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70891", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70891", "title": "Otto Rank", "text": "Austrian psychoanalyst (1884\u20131939)\nOtto Rank (; ; n\u00e9 Rosenfeld; 22 April 1884 \u2013 31 October 1939) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, writer, and philosopher. Born in Vienna, he became one of Sigmund Freud's closest collaborators, served as secretary of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and edited leading psychoanalytic journals while publishing studies of myth and creativity. His book \"The Trauma of Birth\" (1924) proposed that the anxiety of birth precedes the Oedipus complex, coined the term \"pre-Oedipal,\" and triggered a decisive break with Freud's developmental theory. Rank established psychotherapy practices in Paris and New York, where he promoted relationship-based treatment that emphasized emotional presence in the analytic encounter. He influenced existential and humanistic therapy, social work, and action learning, and his ideas on creativity and the double continue to inform psychological and cultural criticism.\nEarly life and Freud's circle.\nRank was born Otto Rosenfeld in 1884 to a Jewish artisan family in Vienna. He impressed Freud in 1905 with a study of the Lohengrin legend, which led to Rank's appointment as secretary of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and the movement's first salaried post. Encouraged by Freud, Rank completed gymnasium later in life, earned a doctorate in literature from the University of Vienna in 1912, and published his thesis on the Lohengrin saga as the first Freudian dissertation issued as a book. He joined Freud's confidential \"committee\" to defend psychoanalysis, served as managing director of the movement's publishing house, and helped edit \"Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse\" and \"Imago\". Rank extended psychoanalytic interpretation to legend, myth, and art, culminating in works such as \"The Myth of the Birth of the Hero\" and \"The Double\".\nCareer.\nThe Trauma of Birth and break with Freud.\nRank published \"Das Trauma der Geburt\" in 1924, arguing that the shock of separation at birth shapes art, myth, religion, and therapy before the Oedipus complex forms. The book proposed a pre-Oedipal stage and challenged Freud's view that the Oedipus complex is the nucleus of neurosis and culture. Freud maintained that libido organized emotion and likened analytic work to \"the draining of the Zuyder Zee,\" whereas Rank centered change on the relational experience of separation anxiety. In a 1930 self-analysis Rank observed that the \"pre-Oedipal super-ego\" had been emphasized by Melanie Klein without crediting his priority.\nTherapeutic innovations.\nBetween 1920 and 1924 Rank collaborated with S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi on approaches that favored immediacy and emotional reciprocity in the consulting room. They warned that Freud's technical recommendations produced \"an unnatural elimination of all human factors in the analysis\" and called for therapy grounded in lived experience. Analysts such as Sandor Rado later recalled how training minimized patients' emotional lives and focused on classifying drives, a tendency Rank viewed as a distortion of psychoanalysis' human potential. Freud described libido as the engine of emotion and likened the analytic task to draining primitive feeling from the patient, reinforcing distance over relationship.\nRank countered that emotions are relational and that therapy should cultivate the creative will rather than uproot feeling. Commentators such as Fred Weinstein and Ernest Becker argued that classical analysis never resolved this confusion about emotion, while Ferenczi's diary recorded similar misgivings from within Freud's circle.\nLater life and influence.\nRank left Vienna in 1926 and divided his time between Paris and the United States, where he lectured, practiced psychotherapy, and continued to write on art, myth, and the will. He died of a kidney infection in New York City on 31 October 1939, reportedly remarking \"Komisch\" on his deathbed.\nRank's relationship-centered therapy informed Jessie Taft and Frederick Allen, who developed the functional model at the Pennsylvania School of Social Work and introduced Rank's ideas to Carl Rogers. Rogers credited Rank's New York lectures with shaping client-centered counseling, and Rollo May described Rank as \"the great unacknowledged genius in Freud's circle\" in the foreword to the American lectures. Rank's focus on present-tense encounter also influenced Gestalt therapy, where Paul Goodman praised his post-Freudian ideas on art and creativity, and practitioners such as Erving Polster and Robert Landy adapted his emphasis on the here-and-now to action methods.\nSummary of core ideas.\nTherapeutic philosophy.\nRank interpreted psychotherapy as a collaborative process of learning and unlearning that keeps emotional experience at the center. He argued that the therapeutic relationship lets people discover more creative ways to think, feel, and act in the present while releasing patterns that have turned destructive, treating neurosis as a failure of creativity rather than a retreat from sexuality.\nRank reframed resistance as a creative function. He defined counterwill as a positive force that protects integrity, supports individuation, and helps clients discover the capacity for willing.\nCreativity and growth.\nFor Rank, creative figures such as Rembrandt, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci model the courage to move beyond prior achievements. He praised their willingness to reach \"beyond the ideology which they have themselves fostered,\" treating self renewal as the measure of greatness.\nHe likened unlearning to the labor of birth, insisting that lasting creativity depends on the ability to separate from internalized institutions, beliefs, and fears. In a 1938 lecture, he described life as \"a succession of separations\" that begins with birth and continues through each stage of adaptation, warning that people who cannot release worn out identities become trapped in earlier phases of growth.\nOrganizational applications.\nRank's exploration of creativity continues to shape action learning, an inquiry driven method for problem solving, leadership development, and organizational learning. Drawing on \"Art and Artist\", action learning coaches help teams create a safe container, pose challenging questions, and \"step out of the frame of the prevailing ideology\" so members can examine assumptions and reframe their choices. The process mirrors Rank's view of artistic growth as an ongoing effort to bring new perspectives into being.\nIn organizational settings, action learning uses these insights to help individuals and teams question deeply held identities, experiment with alternative frames, and practice the skill of unlearning together.\nLegacy.\nRank's emphasis on will, relationship, and creativity continues to inform modern psychotherapy, organizational practice, and cultural criticism.\nRank anticipated later object-relations perspectives with his 1926 lecture \"The Genesis of the Object Relation,\" which framed development as a lifelong negotiation between individuation and connection. His analysis of creativity in \"Art and Artist\" linked artistic renewal to the ability to \"step out of the frame\" of settled ideology, a theme that informs Robert Kramer's work on transformative action learning and leadership development.\nErnest Becker drew on Rank's dialectic of \"life fear\" and \"death fear,\" which later inspired terror management theory experiments by Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski. Rank's legacy also reaches into spiritual and transpersonal movements through thinkers such as Matthew Fox and Stanislav Grof, philosophers including Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, and contemporary cultural critics like Naomi Klein, who revisit his ideas about creativity, mortality, and the double.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCorrespondence\nBook-length works about Otto Rank.\nMaster's thesis on Rank.\nJournal series on Rank.\nArticles or chapters about Otto Rank.\nDiary of S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi.\nArticles or chapters on application of Rank's psychoanalysis of art to transformative action learning, leader development and organizational learning.\nOther references."}

It is headed by the secretary of agriculture, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet. The current secretary is Brooke Rollins, who has served since February 13, 2025.\nApproximately 71% of the USDA's $213\u00a0billion budget goes towards nutrition assistance programs administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The largest component of the FNS budget is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as the 'Food Stamp' program), which is the cornerstone of USDA's nutrition assistance. The United States Forest Service is the largest agency within the department, which administers national forests and national grasslands that together comprise about 25% of federal lands.\nOverview.\nThe USDA is divided into eight distinct mission areas, each of which have at least one agency dedicated to the theme of the mission area:\nFarm Production and Conservation (FPAC)\nFood, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNCS)\nFood Safety (FS)\nMarketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP)\nNatural Resources and the Environment (NRE)\nResearch, Education, and Economics (REE)\nRural Development (RD)\nTrade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs (TFAA)\n&lt;ref name=\"Org Chart 9/24/24\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMany of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of the United States and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run by the Food and Nutrition Service. Activities in this program include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides healthy food to over 40\u00a0million low-income and homeless people each month. USDA is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits have been accessed by those experiencing homelessness.\nThe USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets. It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through USAID, foreign governments, international bodies such as World Food Program, or approved nonprofits. The Agricultural Act of 1949, section 416 (b) and Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, also known as Food for Peace, provides the legal basis of such actions. The USDA is a partner of the World Cocoa Foundation.\nHistory.\nThe standard history is Gladys L. Baker, ed., \"Century of Service: The first 100 years of the United States Department of Agriculture\" (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1963).\nOrigins in the Patent Office.\nEarly in its history, the American economy was largely agrarian. Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants and animals for import into the United States. In 1829, by request of James Smithson out of a desire to further promulgate and diffuse scientific knowledge amongst the American people, the Smithsonian Institution was established, though it did not incorporate agriculture. In 1837, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became Commissioner of Patents in the Department of State. He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the Congress and local agricultural societies. In 1839, Congress established the Agricultural Division within the Patent Office and allotted $1,000 for \"the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.\" Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Ellsworth was called the \"Father of the Department of Agriculture\".\nIn 1849, the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created Department of the Interior. In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.\nFormation.\nOn May 15, 1862, Abraham Lincoln established the independent Department of Agriculture through the Morrill Act to be headed by a commissioner without Cabinet status. Staffed by only eight employees, the department was charged with conducting research and development related to \"agriculture, rural development, aquaculture and human nutrition in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms\". Agriculturalist Isaac Newton was appointed to be the first commissioner. Lincoln called it the \"people's department\", since over half of the nation, at the time, was directly or indirectly involved in agriculture or agribusiness.\nIn 1868, the department moved into the new Department of Agriculture Building in Washington, designed by famed D.C. architect Adolf Cluss. Located on the National Mall between 12th Street and 14th SW, the department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants.\nIn the 1880s, varied advocacy groups were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a Department of Commerce and Industry, and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the House of Representatives and Senate passed separate bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor. Finally, in 1889 the Department of Agriculture was given cabinet-level status.\nIn 1887, the Hatch Act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 then funded cooperative extension services in each state to teach agriculture, home economics, and other subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.\nNew Deal era.\nBy the year 1933, the department was well established in Washington and very well known in rural America. In the agricultural field the picture was different. Statisticians created a comprehensive data-gathering arm in the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates. Secretary Henry Wallace, a statistician, further strengthened the expertise by introducing sampling techniques. Professional economists ran a strong Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Most important was the agricultural experiment station system, a network of state partners in the land-grant colleges, which in turn operated a large field service in direct contact with farmers in practically every rural county. The department worked smoothly with a nationwide, well-organized pressure group, the American Farm Bureau Federation. It represented the largest commercial growers before Congress.\nAs late as the Great Depression, farm work occupied a fourth of Americans. Indeed, many young people who moved to the cities in the prosperous 1920s returned to the family farm after the depression caused unemployment after 1929. The USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisted with loans for small landowners, and provided technical advice. Its Bureau of Home Economics, established in 1923, published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther. In the late 1940s, the Pollinating Insect Research unit was established as a part of the alfalfa seed production unit to study bees and other pollinators to improve pollination management.\nModern times.\nOn August 27, 2018, the USDA announced it would be providing U.S. farmers with a farm aid package totaling $4.7\u00a0billion in direct payments to American farmers.\nOn 7 February 2022, the USDA announced the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, a $1 billion program that will test and verify the benefits of climate-friendly agricultural practices.\nIn October 2022, the USDA announced a $1.3 billion debt relief program for about 36,000 farmers who had fallen behind on loan payments or facing foreclosures. The provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 set aside $3.1 billion to help such farmers with high-risk operations caused by USDA-backed loans.\nIn February 2025, the Trump administration fired multiple probationary employees in the USDA, including multiple researchers in the post-doctoral research fellowship in the Agricultural Research Service, a division dedicated to using science to protect the nation's food supply. The USDA said in a statement on February 14, 2025 that it is implementing \"an aggressive plan to optimize its workforce by eliminating positions that are no longer necessary.\" However, a few days later they made another statement stating they had fired people in \"several positions supporting\" highly pathogenic avian influenza, and was \"working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind\" the termination letters given to these people.\nIn March 2025, the USDA cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\nOrganization and Component Staff Level.\nUSDA's offices and agencies are listed below, with full-time equivalent staff levels according to the estimated FY2023 appropriation, as reported in USDA's FY2024 Congressional Budget Justification.\nDiscrimination.\nAllegations have been made that throughout the agency's history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds, denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s. The effect of this discrimination caused a reduction in the number of African American farmers in the United States. Though African American farmers have been the most hit by discriminatory actions by the USDA, women, Native Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities have experienced discrimination in a variety of forms at the hands of the USDA. The majority of these discriminatory actions have occurred through the Farm Service Agency, which oversees loan and assistance programs to farmers.\nIn response to the Supreme Court's ruling of unconstitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Congress enacted the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936, which established the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) which provided service to private landowners and encouraged subsidies that would relieve soil from excessive farming. The SCS in its early days were hesitant, especially in Southern jurisdictions, to hire Black conservationists. Rather than reaching out to Black students in universities for interviews and job opportunities, students had to reach out for the few opportunities granted to Black conservationists.\nAs part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the USDA formally ended racial segregation among its staff. In the 1999 \"Pigford v. Glickman\" class-action lawsuit brought by African American farmers, the USDA agreed to a billion-dollar settlement due to its patterns of discrimination in the granting of loans and subsidies to black farmers. In 2011, a second round of payouts, \"Pigford II,\" was appropriated by Congress for $1.25 billion, although this payout, far too late to support the many who desperately needed financial assistance during 1999 lawsuit, only comes out to around $250,000 per farmer.\nA March 17, 2006 letter from the GAO about the Pigford Settlement indicated that \"the court noted that USDA disbanded its Office of Civil Rights in 1983, and stopped responding to claims of discrimination.\"\n\"Pigford v. Glickman\".\nFollowing long-standing concerns, black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in 1997. An attorney called it \"the most organized, largest civil rights case in the history of the country.\" Also in 1997, black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers. Representatives of the National Black Farmers Association met with President Bill Clinton and other administration officials at the White House. And NBFA's president testified before the United States House Committee on Agriculture.\nIn \"Pigford v. Glickman\", U.S. Federal District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on April 14, 1999. The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers, but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded. Nevertheless, the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2\u00a0billion. Some farmers would have their debts forgiven. Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement. Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement.\nThe NBFA's president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement, including before the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture on September 12, 2000, when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement. It was later revealed that one DoJ staff \"general attorney\" was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers' cases. NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard. The \"Chicago Tribune\" reported in 2004 that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers. In 1920, 1 in 7 U.S. farmers was African-American, and by 2004 the number was 1 in 100. USDA spokesman Ed Loyd, when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers, had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers.\nIn 2006 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases. NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief. NBFA's John Boyd (farmer) secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100\u00a0million in funds to settle late-filer cases. In 2006 a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by Senator George Felix Allen. In 2007 Boyd testified before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary about this legislation. As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers. Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, lent his support to the black farmers' issues in 2007. A bill co-sponsored by Obama passed the Senate in 2007.\nIn early June 2008 hundreds of black farmers, denied a chance to have their cases heard in the \"Pigford\" settlement, filed a new lawsuit against USDA. The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill, reopening black farmers discrimination cases, became law in June 2008. Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers. In October 2008, the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA's handling of discrimination complaints. The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints.\nAfter numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort, Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15\u00a0billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers' cases. NBFA's John W. Boyd Jr., attended the bill-signing ceremony at the White House. As of 2013, 90,000 African-American, Hispanic, female and Native American farmers had filed claims. It was reported that some had been found fraudulent, or transparently bogus. In Maple Hill, North Carolina by 2013, the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 African-Americans being paid, while \"claimants were not required [by the USDA] to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm.\" Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years.\nKeepseagle v. Vilsack.\nIn 1999, Native American farmers, discriminated in a similar fashion to black farmers, filed a class-action lawsuit against the USDA alleging loan discrimination under the ECOA and the APA. This case relied heavily on its predecessor, Pigford v. Glickman, in terms of the reasoning it set forth in the lawsuit. Eventually, a settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the USDA to the amount of up to $760 million, awardable through individual damages claims. These claims could be used for monetary relief, debt relief, and/or tax relief. The filing period began June 29, 2011 and lasted 180 days. Track A claimants would be eligible for up to $50,000, whereas Track B claimants would be eligible for up to $250,000 with a higher standard of proof.\nGarcia v. Vilsack.\nIn 2000, similar to Pigford v. Glickman, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Hispanic farmers alleging that the USDA discriminated against them in terms of credit transactions and disaster benefits, in direct violation of ECOA. As per the settlement, $1.33 billion is available for compensation in awards of up to $50,000 or $250,000, while an additional $160 million is available in debt relief.\n\"Love v. Vilsack\".\nIn 2001, similar to Garcia v. Vilsack, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the same court alleging discrimination on the basis of gender. A Congressional response to the lawsuit resulted in the passing of the Equality for Women Farmers Act, which created a system that would allow for allegations of gender discrimination to be heard against the USDA and enable claims for damages.\nEnvironmental justice initiatives.\nIn their 2012 environmental justice strategy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission and operations. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA's focus on Environmental justice (EJ) in rural communities around the United States, as well as connecting with Indigenous Tribes and ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights. USDA does fund programs with social and environmental equity goals; however, it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.\nBackground.\nOn February 16, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.\" Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Under Executive Order 12898 federal agencies must:\nThe Executive Order also created an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of 11 heads of departments and agencies.\n2012 Environmental Justice Strategy.\nOn February 7, 2012, the USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan identifying new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy that was adopted in response to E.O. 12898. Generally, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities.\nNatural Resources and Environment Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.\nEJ Initiatives in Tribal Communities.\nTribal development.\nUSDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" campaign in tribal areas by increasing Bureau of Indian Education schools' participation in federal nutrition programs, by developing community gardens on tribal lands, and developing tribal food policy councils.\nMore than $6.2 billion in Rural Development funding has been allocated for community infrastructure in Indian country and is distributed via 47 state offices that altogether cover the entire continental United States, Hawaii, and Alaska. Such funding has been used for a variety of reasons:\nTribal relations.\nIn 1997, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) published a resource guide aimed at helping USFS officials with developing and maintaining relations with different tribal governments. To that end, and in coordination with the Forest Service's 4*point American Indian/Alaska Native policy, the resource guide discusses how to:\nThe USFS works to maintain good governmental relationships through regular intergovernmental meetings, acknowledgement of pre*existing tribal sovereignty, and a better general understanding of tribal government, which varies from tribe to tribe. Indian treaty rights and trust responsibilities are honored through visits to tribal neighbors, discussions of mutual interest, and attempts to honor and accommodate the legal positions of Indians and the federal government. Addressing and demonstrating sensitivity to Native religious beliefs and practices includes walking through Native lands and acknowledging cultural needs when implementing USFS activities. Providing research, technology, and assistance to Indian governments is shown through collaboration of ecological studies and sharing of various environmental technologies, as well as the inclusion of traditional Native practices in contemporary operations of the USFS.\nThe Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.\nTribal Services/Cooperatives.\nThe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service provides APHIS Veterinary Services, which serve the tribal community by promoting and fostering safe animal trade and care. This includes prevention of pests and disease from herd and fisheries as well as surveys for diseases on or near Native American lands that can affect traditionally hunted wildlife. The APHIS also provides Wildlife Services, which help with wildlife damage on Native lands. This includes emergency trainings, outreach, consultation, internship opportunities for students, and general education on damage reduction, livestock protection, and disease monitoring.\nMeanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to tribes.\nOther EJ Initiatives.\nTechnical and financial assistance.\nThe NRCS Strike Force Initiative has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program. In 2001, NRCS funded and published a study, \"Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance,\" focused on rural, Southern \"Black Belt\" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.\nThe Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty. USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control. The Rural Utilities Service administers water and wastewater loans, including SEARCH Grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages.\nMapping.\nUSFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits. By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.\nAnother initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator. The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs.\nMeat and poultry hotline.\nThe USDA Meat and Poultry hotline is a toll-free user assistance hotline for consumers to answer inquiries about the safe storage, handling, and preparation of meat, poultry, and egg products that can be reached at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). The Hotline also responds to other issues related to the mission of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which is to ensure that commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged. The hotline operates year-round on weekdays excluding federal holidays (except Thanksgiving) from 10 AM to 6 PM PT. Food safety specialists with home economics, nutrition, and food technology backgrounds staff it. The hotline began on July 1, 1985, and has answered over 2 million calls to date in 2024. The hotline added Spanish support in 2002 and added two hours in April 2017. The hotline can help detect public health threats and has been attributed with increasing American's awareness of foodborne bacteria and how to avoid them.\nThe USDA also offers online text support via \"Ask Karen\".\nOther.\nPrivate sector relationships.\nPart of the USDA's functions includes promoting the economic development of the agricultural sector. In their 2022 strategic plan, they pledged:To maintain a competitive agricultural sector, USDA will support farmers and ranchers' ability to start and maintain profitable businesses as well as offer financial support to producers affected by natural disasters. Furthermore, USDA's research agencies will continue to introduce high-performance plants, animals, and integrated management options that increase the efficiency of farming practices. Lastly, USDA will also provide tools to producers so that they are well-positioned to secure a share of a growing market for agricultural products.The USDA formalized a relationship with the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) in 2018. GFSI is a private organization where members of the Consumer Goods Forum have control over benchmarking requirements in recognition of private standards for food safety. In August 2018, USDA achieved Technical Equivalence against Version 7.1 of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements for their Harmonized GAP Plus + certification programme, where Technical Equivalence is limited to government-owned food safety certification programmes. This is misaligned with U.S. Government Policy and OMB Circular No. A-119 which instructs its agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards before relying upon\u00a0industry standards (private standards) or developing government standards.\nHarmonized GAP Plus+ Standard (V. 3.0) was published in February 2021 with reference to GFSI Guidance Document Version 2020, Part III, ignoring reference to international standards and technical specifications ISO 22000 and ISO T/S 22002-3 Prerequisite Programmes for Farming. The USDA exception to OMB Circular No. A-119 might be attributed to lobbying and influence of Consumer Goods Forum members in Washington, D.C. In November 2021, GFSI announced its Technical Equivalence was under strategic review explaining the assessment has raised concerns across many stakeholders.\nDairy.\nThe USDA monitors American dairy production and markets, for which it has a Dairy Board and a marketing branch known as Dairy Management Incorporated (DMI). Furthermore, the USDA collaborates with United Dairy Industry Association (UDIA), the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board for market information on the industry.\nCOVID-19 relief.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress allocated funding to the USDA to address the disturbances rippling through the agricultural sector. On April 17, 2020, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The American food supply chain had to adapt, and it remains safe, secure, and strong, and we all know that starts with America's farmers and ranchers. This program will not only provide immediate relief for our farmers and ranchers, but it will also allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance to help our fellow Americans in need.\nThis provided $16\u00a0billion for farmers and ranchers, and $3\u00a0billion to purchase surplus produce, dairy, and meat from farmers for distribution to charitable organizations. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), USDA has up to an additional $873.3\u00a0million available in Section 32 funding to purchase a variety of agricultural products for distribution to food banks, $850\u00a0million for food bank administrative costs and USDA food purchases.\nRelated legislation.\nImportant legislation setting policy of the USDA includes the:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also administers programs relating to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and four of the five inhabited insular areas of the United States, as well as programs related to historic preservation. About 75% of federal public land is managed by the department, with most of the remainder managed by the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. The department was created on March 3, 1849. It is headquartered at the Main Interior Building, located at 1849 C Street NW in Washington, D.C.\nThe department is headed by the secretary of the interior, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet. The current interior secretary is Doug Burgum, who was sworn in on February 1, 2025.\nAs of mid-2004, the department managed 507\u00a0million acres (2,050,000\u00a0km2) of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States. It manages 476 dams and 348 reservoirs through the Bureau of Reclamation, 433 national parks, monuments, historical sites, etc. through the National Park Service, and 544 national wildlife refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service. The largest land management agency is the Bureau of Land Management, managing about one-eighth of the land in the United States.\nDespite its name, the Department of the Interior has a different role from that of the interior ministries of other nations, which are usually responsible for police matters and internal security. In the United States, national security and immigration functions are performed by the Department of Homeland Security primarily and the Department of Justice secondarily. The Department of the Interior has often been humorously called \"the Department of Everything Else\" because of its broad range of responsibilities.\nHistory.\nFormation of the department.\nA department for domestic concern was first considered by the 1st United States Congress in 1789, but those duties were placed in the Department of State. The idea of a separate domestic department continued to percolate for a half-century and was supported by presidents from James Madison to James Polk. The 1846\u201348 Mexican\u2013American War gave the proposal new steam as the responsibilities of the federal government grew. Polk's secretary of the treasury, Robert J. Walker, became a vocal champion of creating the new department.\nIn 1849, Walker stated in his annual report that several federal offices were placed in departments with which they had little to do. He noted that the United States General Land Office had little to do with the Treasury and also highlighted the Indian Affairs office, part of the Department of War, and the Patent Office, part of the Department of State. Walker argued that these and other bureaus should be brought together in a new Department of the Interior. A bill authorizing its creation of the department passed the House of Representatives on February 15, 1849, and spent just over two weeks in the Senate. The department was established on March 3, 1849 (9\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://), the eve of President Zachary Taylor's inauguration, when the Senate voted 31 to 25 to create the department. Its passage was delayed by Democrats in Congress who were reluctant to create more patronage posts for the incoming Whig administration to fill. The first secretary of the interior was Thomas Ewing.\nSeveral of the domestic concerns the department originally dealt with were gradually transferred to other departments. For example, the Department of Interior was responsible for water pollution control prior to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Other agencies became separate departments, such as the Bureau of Agriculture, which later became the Department of Agriculture. However, land and natural resource management, American Indian affairs, wildlife conservation, and territorial affairs remain the responsibilities of the Department of the Interior.\nControversies.\nSecretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal of 1921. He was convicted of bribery in 1929, and served one year in prison, for his part in the controversy. A major factor in the scandal was a transfer of certain oil leases from the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy to that of the Department of the Interior, at Fall's behest.\nSecretary of the Interior James G. Watt faced criticism for his alleged hostility to environmentalism, for his support of the development and use of federal lands by foresting, ranching, and other commercial interests, and for banning the Beach Boys from playing a 1983 Independence Day concert on the National Mall out of concerns of attracting \"an undesirable element\". His 1983 resignation was prompted by a speech in which he said about his staff: \"I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.\"\nUnder the Administration of President George W. Bush, the Interior Department's maintenance backlog climbed from $5\u00a0billion to $8.7\u00a0billion, despite Bush's campaign pledges to eliminate it completely. Of the agency under Bush's leadership, Interior Department inspector general Earl Devaney has cited a \"culture of fear\" and of \"ethical failure.\" Devaney has also said, \"Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of Interior.\"\nLaunched in June 2021, the https:// intended to investigate federal Indian boarding school policies and multi-generational impacts of trauma on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children. Released in two volumes, the three year investigation produced the first report in May 2022 and the second and final volume in June 2024. The final report details the severe trauma and cultural disruption inflicted on Native American communities through these schools, which operated from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It highlights the systemic abuse and neglect endured by students, finding 973 children died at the schools and calls for accountability and measures to address the ongoing impact on Native American families and communities to include working closely with tribal nations on the identification and repatriation of the remains.\nFederal Consulting Group.\nThe Federal Consulting Group was a part of the United States Department of the Interior until March 2025 when it was dissolved on the advice of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The group was paid to broker contracts for other parts of the federal government as well as offering consulting, executive coaching, and performance and customer satisfaction measuring services to federal agencies.\nIn 2009 it described itself as part of the National Business Center of the DoI:\nThe Federal Consulting Group provides consultation services aimed at overcoming the organizational challenges of client offices. This is accomplished through assessment and construction of organizational logic models, amongst other methods. The Federal Consulting group consists of three divisions: Consulting, Executive Coaching, and Performance Measurement &amp; Customer Satisfaction. The Consulting and Coaching divisions provide the services indicated by their titles, while the Performance Measurement &amp; Customer Satisfaction division provides clients with access to the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). The ACSI allows federal offices to demonstrate compliance with the President's Management Agenda and the Government Performance and Results Act to the Administration and Congress.\nIn April 2021, the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs entered into an agreement with Federal Consulting Group to oversee a needs assessment of the USAP as relates to allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\nThe group's last address was 1849 C St. NW Room 4342, Washington, DC 20240-0001.\nAmerican Indians.\nWithin the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs handles some federal relations with American Indians, while others are handled by the Office of Special Trustee. The current acting assistant secretary for Indian affairs is Bryan Newland, an enrolled member of the Bay Mills Indian Community.\nThe department has been the subject of disputes over proper accounting for American Indian Trusts set up to track the income and distribution of monies that are generated by the trust and specific American Indian lands, which the government leases for fees to companies that extract oil, timber, minerals, and other resources. Several cases have sought an accounting of such funds from departments within the Interior and Treasury (such as the Minerals Management Service), in what has been a 15-year-old lawsuit. Some American Indian nations have also sued the government over water-rights issues and their treaties with the US. In 2010 Congress passed the Claims Settlement Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291), which provided $3.4\u00a0billion for the settlement of the \"Cobell v. Salazar\" class-action trust case and four American Indian water rights cases.\nOn March 16, 2021, Deb Haaland, serving at that time as a member of Congress for New Mexico, took the oath of office as secretary, becoming the first American Indian to lead an executive department, and the third woman to lead the department.\nOperating units.\n \nAwards.\nDOI Convocation Honor Award is the most prestigious recognition that can be granted by the department.\nThe following awards are presented at the Honor Awards Convocation:\nRegions.\nIn 2018, DOI established 12 organizational regions to be used across the department. These superseded the previous 49 regions used across 8 agencies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70912", "revid": "50717717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70912", "title": "Tape recorder", "text": "Machine for recording sound\nAn audio tape recorder, also known as a tape deck, tape player or tape machine or simply a tape recorder, is a sound recording and reproduction device that records and plays back sounds usually using magnetic tape for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal by moving the tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape in proportion to the audio signal. Tape-recording devices include the reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck, which uses a cassette for storage.\nThe use of magnetic tape for sound recording originated around 1930 in Germany as paper tape with oxide lacquered to it. Prior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present-day magnetic tape recordings.\nMagnetic tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave artists and producers the power to record and re-record audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders, could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality.\nSince some early refinements improved the fidelity of the reproduced sound, magnetic tape has been the highest quality analog recording medium available. As of the first decade of the 21st century, analog magnetic tape has been largely replaced by digital recording technologies.\nHistory.\nWax strip recorder.\nThe earliest known audio tape recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (https://). It employed a strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction and hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener. Both recording and playback styluses, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted vertically so that several recordings could be cut on the same strip.\nWhile the machine was never developed commercially, it somewhat resembled the modern magnetic tape recorder in its design. The tapes and machine created by Bell's associates, examined at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums, became brittle, and the heavy paper reels warped. The machine's playback head was also missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning, they could be placed into working condition.\nThe waxed tape recording medium was later refined by Edison's wax cylinder, and became the first widespread sound recording technology, used for both entertainment and office dictation. However, recordings on wax cylinders were unable to be easily duplicated, making them both costly and time consuming for large-scale production. Wax cylinders were also unable to record more than 2 minutes of audio, a problem solved by gramophone discs.\nCelluloid strip recorder.\nFranklin C. Goodale adapted movie film for analog audio recording. He received a patent for his invention in 1909. The celluloid film was inscribed and played back with a stylus, in a manner similar to the wax cylinders of Edison's gramophone. The patent description states that the machine could store six records on the same strip of film, side by side, and it was possible to switch between them. In 1912, a similar process was used for the Hiller talking clock.\nPhotoelectric paper tape recorder.\nIn 1932, after six years of developmental work, including a patent application in 1931, Merle Duston, a Detroit radio engineer, created a tape recorder capable of recording both sounds and voice that used a low-cost chemically treated paper tape. During the recording process, the tape moved through a pair of electrodes which immediately imprinted the modulated sound signals as visible black stripes into the paper tape's surface. The audio signal could be immediately replayed from the same recorder unit, which also contained photoelectric sensors, somewhat similar to the various sound-on-film technologies of the era.\nMagnetic recording.\nMagnetic recording was conceived as early as 1878 by the American engineer Oberlin Smith and demonstrated in practice in 1898 by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen. Analog magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve the use of a magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal to be amplified and played back through a loudspeaker.\nWire recorders.\nThe first wire recorder was the Telegraphone invented by Valdemar Poulsen in the late 1890s. Wire recorders for law and office dictation and telephone recording were made almost continuously by various companies (mainly the American Telegraphone Company) through the 1920s and 1930s. These devices were mostly sold as consumer technologies after World War II.\nWidespread use of wire recording occurred within the decades spanning from 1940 until 1960, following the development of inexpensive designs licensed internationally by the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio and the Armour Research Foundation of the Armour Institute of Technology (later Illinois Institute of Technology). These two organizations licensed dozens of manufacturers in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Wire was also used as a recording medium in black box voice recorders for aviation in the 1950s.\nConsumer wire recorders were marketed for home entertainment or as an inexpensive substitute for commercial office dictation recorders, but the development of consumer magnetic tape recorders starting in 1946, with the BK 401 Soundmirror, using paper-based tape, gradually drove wire recorders from the market, being \"pretty much out of the picture\" by 1952.\nEarly steel tape recorders.\nIn 1924 a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine. The following year a fellow German, Louis Blattner, working in Britain, licensed Stille's device and started work on a machine which would instead record on a magnetic steel tape, which he called the Blattnerphone. The tape was 6\u00a0mm wide and 0.08\u00a0mm thick, traveling at 5 feet per second; the recording time was 20 minutes.\nThe BBC installed a Blattnerphone at Avenue House in September 1930 for tests, and used it to record King George V's speech at the opening of the India Round Table Conference on 12 November 1930. Though not considered suitable for music the machine continued in use and was moved to Broadcasting House in March 1932, a second machine also being installed. In September 1932, a new model was installed, using 3\u00a0mm tape with a recording time of 32 minutes.\nIn 1933, the Marconi Company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in March 1935. The quality and reliability were slightly improved, though it still tended to be obvious that one was listening to a recording. A reservoir system containing a loop of tape helped to stabilize the speed. The tape was 3\u00a0mm wide and traveled at 1.5\u00a0 meters/second.\nThey were not easy to handle. The reels were heavy and expensive and the steel tape has been described as being like a traveling razor blade. The tape was liable to snap, particularly at joints, which at 1.5\u00a0 meters/second could rapidly cover the floor with loops of the sharp-edged tape. Rewinding was done at twice the speed of the recording.\nDespite these drawbacks, the ability to make replayable recordings proved useful, and even with subsequent methods coming into use (direct-cut discs and Philips-Miller optical film the Marconi-Stilles remained in use until the late 1940s.\nModern tape recorders.\nMagnetic tape recording as we know it today was developed in Germany during the 1930s at BASF (then part of the chemical giant IG Farben) and AEG in cooperation with the state radio RRG. This was based on Fritz Pfleumer's 1928 invention of paper tape with oxide powder lacquered onto it. The first practical tape recorder from AEG was the Magnetophon K1, demonstrated in Berlin, Germany in 1935. Eduard Sch\u00fcller of AEG built the recorders and developed a ring-shaped recording and playback head. It replaced the needle-shaped head which tended to shred the tape. Friedrich Matthias of IG Farben/BASF developed the recording tape, including the oxide, the binder, and the backing material. Walter Weber, working for Hans Joachim von Braunm\u00fchl at the RRG, discovered the AC biasing technique, which radically improved sound quality.\nDuring World War II, the Allies noticed that certain German officials were making radio broadcasts from multiple time zones almost simultaneously. Analysts such as Richard H. Ranger believed that the broadcasts had to be transcriptions, but their audio quality was indistinguishable from that of a live broadcast and their duration was far longer than was possible even with 16\u00a0rpm transcription discs. In the final stages of the war in Europe, the Allies' capture of a number of German Magnetophon recorders from Radio Luxembourg aroused great interest. These recorders incorporated all the key technological features of modern analog magnetic recording and were the basis for future developments in the field.\nCommercialization.\nAmerican developments.\nDevelopment of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex. The equally important development of the magnetic tape medium itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) corporation.\nIn 1938, S.J. Begun left Germany and joined the Brush Development Company in the United States, where work continued but attracted little attention until the late 1940s when the company released the very first consumer tape recorder in 1946: the Soundmirror BK 401.&lt;!\u2014less reliable, but interesting refs: http://esrv.net/brush_bk401.html, http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/brush_bk401.html\u2014&gt; Several other models were quickly released in the following years. Tapes were initially made of paper coated with magnetite powder. In 1947/48 Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company (3M) replaced the paper backing with cellulose acetate or polyester, and coated it first with black oxide, and later, to improve signal-to-noise ratio and improve overall superior quality, with red oxide (gamma ferric oxide).\nAmerican audio engineer John T. Mullin and entertainer Bing Crosby were key players in the commercial development of magnetic tape. Mullin served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was posted to Paris in the final months of WWII. His unit was assigned to find out everything they could about German radio and electronics, including the investigation of claims that the Germans had been experimenting with high-energy directed radio beams as a means of disabling the electrical systems of aircraft. Mullin's unit soon amassed a collection of hundreds of low-quality magnetic dictating machines, but it was a chance visit to a studio at Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt while investigating radio beam rumors, that yielded the real prize.\nMullin was given two suitcase-sized AEG 'Magnetophon' high-fidelity recorders and fifty reels of recording tape. He had them shipped home and over the next two years he worked on the machines constantly, modifying them and improving their performance. His major aim was to interest Hollywood studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.\nMullin gave two public demonstrations of his machines, and they caused a sensation among American audio professionals; many listeners literally could not believe that what they heard was not a live performance. By luck, Mullin's second demonstration was held at MGM Studios in Hollywood and in the audience that day was Bing Crosby's technical director, Murdo Mackenzie. He arranged for Mullin to meet Crosby and in June 1947 he gave Crosby a private demonstration of his magnetic tape recorders.\nCrosby, a top movie and singing star, was stunned by the amazing sound quality and instantly saw the huge commercial potential of the new machines. Live music was the standard for American radio at the time and the major radio networks didn't permit the use of disc recording in many programs because of their comparatively poor sound quality. Crosby disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts 39 weeks a year, preferring the recording studio's relaxed atmosphere and ability to retain the best parts of a performance. He asked NBC to let him pre-record his 1944\u201345 series on transcription discs, but the network refused, so Crosby withdrew from live radio for a year. ABC agreed to let him use transcription discs for the 1946\u201347 season, but listeners complained about the sound quality.\nCrosby realised that Mullin's tape recorder technology would enable him to pre-record his radio show with high sound quality and that these tapes could be replayed many times with no appreciable loss of quality. Mullin was asked to tape one show as a test and was subsequently hired as Crosby's chief engineer to pre-record the rest of the series.\nCrosby's season premiere on 1 October 1947 was the first magnetic tape broadcast in America. He became the first major American music star to use tape to pre-record radio broadcasts, and the first to master commercial recordings on tape. The taped Crosby radio shows were painstakingly edited through tape-splicing to give them a pace and flow that was wholly unprecedented in radio. Soon other radio performers were demanding the ability to pre-record their broadcasts with the high quality of tape, and the recording ban was lifted.\nCrosby invested $50,000 of his own money into the Californian electronics company Ampex, and the six-man concern (headed by Alexander M. Poniatoff, whose initials became part of the company name) soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording, with its Model 200 tape deck, released in 1948 and developed from Mullin's modified Magnetophons. \nTape recording at the BBC.\nThe BBC acquired some Magnetophon machines in 1946 on an experimental basis, and they were used in the early stages of the new Third Programme to record and play back performances of operas from Germany. Delivery of tape was preferred as live relays over landlines were unreliable in the immediate post-war period. These machines were used until 1952, though most of the work continued to be done using the established media.\nIn 1948, a new British model became available from EMI: the BTR1. Though in many ways clumsy, its quality was good, and as it wasn't possible to obtain any more Magnetophons it was an obvious choice.\nIn the early 1950s, the EMI BTR 2 became available; a much-improved machine and generally liked. The machines were responsive, could run up to speed quite quickly, had light-touch operating buttons, forward-facing heads (The BTR 1s had rear-facing heads which made editing difficult), and were quick and easy to do fine editing. It became the standard in recording rooms for many years and was in use until the end of the 1960s.\nIn 1963, the Beatles were allowed to enhance their recordings at the BBC by overdubbing. The BBC didn't have any multi-track equipment; Overdubbing was accomplished by copying onto another tape.\nThe tape speed was eventually standardized at 15\u00a0ips for almost all work at Broadcasting House, and at 15\u00a0ips for music and 7\u00bd\u00a0ips for speech at Bush House.\nBroadcasting House also used the EMI TR90 and a Philips machine which was lightweight but very easy and quick to use. Bush House used several Leevers-Rich models.\nThe Studer range of machines had become the studio recording industry standard by the 1970s, gradually replacing the aging BTR2s in recording rooms and studios. By the mid-2000s tape was pretty well out of use and had been replaced by digital playout systems.\nStandardized products.\nThe typical professional audio tape recorder of the early 1950s used wide tape on reels, with a capacity of . Typical speeds were initially yielding 30 minutes' recording time on a reel. Early professional machines used single-sided reels but double-sided reels soon became popular, particularly for domestic use. Tape reels were made from metal or transparent plastic.\nStandard tape speeds varied by factors of two: 15 and 30 in/s were used for professional audio recording; for home audiophile prerecorded tapes; for audiophile and consumer recordings (typically on reels). and occasionally even and were used for voice, dictation, and applications where very long recording times were needed, such as logging police and fire department calls.\nThe 8-track tape standard, developed by Bill Lear in the mid-1960s, popularized consumer audio playback in automobiles in the USA. Eventually, this standard was replaced by the smaller and more reliable Compact Cassette, which was launched earlier in 1963.\nPhilips's development of the Compact Cassette in 1963 and Sony's development of the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the Compact Cassette was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile-quality recording to the Compact Cassette also contributing to its popularity.\nLater developments.\nSince their first introduction, analog tape recorders have experienced a long series of progressive developments resulting in increased sound quality, convenience, and versatility.\nOperation.\nElectrical.\nDue to electromagnetism, electric current flowing in the coils of the tape head creates a fluctuating magnetic field. This causes the magnetic material on the tape, which is moving past and in contact with the head, to align in a manner proportional to the original signal. The signal can be reproduced by running the tape back across the tape head, where the reverse process occurs \u2013 the magnetic imprint on the tape induces a small current in the read head which approximates the original signal and is then amplified for playback. Many tape recorders are capable of recording and playing back simultaneously by means of separate record and playback heads.\nMechanical.\nModern professional recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with a constant rotational speed drives the capstan. Usually combined with a rubber pinch roller, it ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called torque motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take-up reels during recording and playback functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations, the pinch roller is disengaged and the take-up reel motor produces more torque than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the supply and take-up reels are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts, gears, or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, one motor being used for the capstan and one for driving the reels for playback, rewind, and fast forward.\nLimitations.\nThe storage of an analog signal on tape works well but is not perfect. In particular, the granular nature of the magnetic material adds high-frequency noise to the signal, generally referred to as tape hiss. Also, the magnetic characteristics of tape are not linear. They exhibit a characteristic hysteresis curve, which causes unwanted distortion of the signal. Some of this distortion is overcome by using inaudible high-frequency AC bias when recording. The amount of bias needs careful adjustment for best results as different tape material requires differing amounts of bias. Most recorders have a switch to select this. Additionally, systems such as Dolby noise reduction systems have been devised to ameliorate some noise and distortion problems.\nVariations in tape speed cause wow and flutter. Flutter can be reduced by using dual capstans. The higher the flutter the more noise that can be heard causing the quality of the recording to be worse. Higher tape speeds used in professional recorders are prone to cause \"head bumps\", which are fluctuations in low-frequency response.\nTape recorder variety.\nThere is a wide variety of tape recorders in existence, from small hand-held devices to large multitrack machines. A machine with built-in speakers and audio power amplification to drive them is usually called a \"tape recorder\" or \u2013 if it has no record functionality \u2013 a \"tape player\", while one that requires external amplification for playback is usually called a \"tape deck\" (regardless of whether it can record).\nMultitrack technology enabled the development of modern art music and one such artist, Brian Eno, described the tape recorder as \"an automatic musical collage device.\"\nUses.\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. In August 1948, Los Angeles-based Capitol Records became the first recording company to use the new process.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder, the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948, the invention of the first multitrack tape recorder, brought about another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concr\u00e8te school and avant-garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, which in turn led to the innovative pop music studio-as-an-instrument recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa, the Beatles, and the Beach Boys. Philips advertised their reel-to-reel recorders as an audial family album and pushed families to purchase these recorders to capture and relive memories forever. But the use for recording music slowly but steadily rose as the main function for the tape recorder.\nTape enabled the radio industry for the first time to pre-record many sections of program content such as advertising, which formerly had to be presented live, and it also enabled the creation and duplication of complex, high-fidelity, long-duration recordings of entire programs. It also, for the first time, allowed broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties to undertake comprehensive logging of radio broadcasts for legislative and commercial purposes, leading to the growth of the modern media monitoring industry.\nInnovations, like multitrack recording and tape echo, enabled radio programs and advertisements to be pre-produced to a level of complexity and sophistication that was previously unattainable and tape also led to significant changes to the pacing of program content, thanks to the introduction of the endless tape cartridge.\nWhile they are primarily used for sound recording, tape machines were also important for data storage before the advent of floppy disks and CDs, and are still used today, although primarily to provide backup.\nTape speeds.\nProfessional decks will use higher tape speeds, with 15 and 30\u00a0inches per second being most common, while lower tape speeds are usually used for smaller recorders and cassette players, in order to save space where fidelity is not as critical as in professional recorders. By providing a range of tape speeds, users can trade-off recording time against recording quality with higher tape speeds providing greater frequency response.\nThere are many tape speeds in use in all sorts of tape recorders. Speed may be expressed in centimeters per second (cm/s) or in inches per second (in/s).\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis article incorporates text from the United States National Museum Bulletin, a government publication in the public domain."}
