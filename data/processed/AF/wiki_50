{"id": "65119", "revid": "1071745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65119", "title": "Laozi", "text": "Semi-legendary Chinese philosopher, founder of Taoism\nLaozi ( ; ) was a legendary Chinese philosopher considered to be the author of the \"Tao Te Ching\" (\"Laozi\"), one of the foundational texts of Taoism. The name, literally meaning 'Old Master', was likely intended to portray an archaic anonymity that could converse with Confucianism. Modern scholarship generally regards his biographical details as later inventions and his opus a collaboration of various writers. Traditional accounts addend him as Li Er, born in the 6th-centuryBC state of Chu during China's Spring and Autumn period (c.\u2009770\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009481\u00a0BC). Serving as the royal archivist for the Zhou court at Wangcheng (modern Luoyang), he met and impressed Confucius (c.\u2009551\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009479\u00a0BC) on one occasion, composing the \"Tao Te Ching\" in a single session before retiring into the western wilderness.\nA central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is generally considered the founder of Taoism. He was claimed and revered as the ancestor of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and is similarly honored in modern China as the progenitor of the popular surname Li. In some sects of Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religion, it is held that he then became an immortal hermit. Certain Taoist devotees held that the \"Tao Te Ching\" was the avatar\u00a0\u2013 embodied as a book\u00a0\u2013 of the god Laojun, one of the Three Pure Ones of the Taoist pantheon, though few philosophers believe this.\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\" had a profound influence on Chinese religious movements and on subsequent Chinese philosophers, who annotated, commended, and criticized the texts extensively. In the 20th century, textual criticism by historians led to theories questioning Laozi's timing or even existence, positing that the received text of the \"Tao Te Ching\" was not composed until the Warring States period (c.\u2009475\u00a0\u2013 221\u00a0BC), and was the product of multiple authors.\nName.\n\"L\u01ceoz\u01d0\" is the modern (\"pinyin\") romanization of . In English, a variety of pronunciations and spellings of the Chinese name exist, such as \"Lao-tse\" and \"Lao Tzu\". It is not a personal name, but rather an honorific title, meaning 'old' or 'venerable'. Its structure matches that of other ancient Chinese philosophers, such as Kongzi (Confucius), Mengzi, and Zhuangzi.\nTraditional accounts give Laozi the personal name Li Er (, ), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . Li is a common Chinese surname which also has the meaning 'plum' or 'plum tree' when used as a common noun; there is a legend tying Laozi's birth to a plum tree. Laozi has long been identified with the persona Lao Dan (, ). \"Dan\" similarly means \"Long-Ear\" or \"the Long-Eared One\". The character is the Chinese word for 'ear'.\nLaozi is recorded bearing the courtesy name Boyang (, ), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . The character was the title of the eldest son born to the primary wife, or an uncle of the father's family who was older than one's father, also used as a noble title indicating an aristocratic lineage head with rulership over a small to medium domain, and as a general mark of respect. The character is yang, the solar and masculine life force in Taoist belief. Lao Dan seems to have been used more generally, however, including by Sima Qian in his \"Shiji\" (c.\u200991\u00a0BC), in the \"Zhuangzi\", and by some modern scholars.\nIdentity.\nBy the mid-twentieth century, consensus had emerged among Western scholars that the historicity of a person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the \"Tao Te Ching\" is \"a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands\", with an author being invented afterwards. While multiple authorship over time is typical for early Chinese texts, the book's conspicuous absence of a central Master figure places it in marked contrast with nearly all other early Chinese philosophical works.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], the oldest manuscript containing text from the \"Tao Te Ching\" dates to the late 4th century BC, written on bamboo slips excavated as part of the Guodian Chu Slips. These passages correspond with roughly one third of the received text, and some are placed in the same order. These are mixed in with passages not carried by the transmitted \"Tao Te Ching\", indicating that its makeup was still undergoing revisions and modifications. The oldest manuscripts of the \"Tao Te Ching\" in a complete form by itself were discovered at a tomb in Mawangdui, and date to the early 2nd century BC. Analysis of early commentary on passages that appear in the received \"Tao Te Ching\" supports an accretionary evolution for the text rather than a singular authorship event.\nTraditional accounts.\nThe earliest biographical reference to Laozi is found in the 1st\u2011century\u00a0BC \"Records of the Grand Historian\" by Sima Qian. Multiple accounts of Laozi's biography are presented, with Sima Qian expressing various levels of doubt in his sources.\nIn one account, Sima Qian reports that Laozi was said to be a contemporary of Confucius during the 6th or 5th\u00a0centuryBC. His personal name was Er or Dan. He was born in the village of Quren (, \"Q\u016br\u00e9n l\u01d0\") in the southern state of Chu, within present-day Luyi in Henan. He was said to be the son of the Censor-in-Chief of the Zhou dynasty and Lady Yishou (), and was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal Zhou court. This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time, and he wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west.\nIn another, Laozi was a different contemporary of Confucius called Lao Laizi (), one of the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars, and wrote a book in 15 parts. The story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats an enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong, from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made.\nIn a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th centuryBC reign of the Duke Xian of Qin who grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the \"Tao Te Ching\", although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again. In some later interpretations, the \"Old Master\" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha. Others say he was the Buddha himself.\nThe stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the \"Zhuangzi\". A.C. Graham suggested that the Confucian version of the story presented in the \"Book of Rites\" was the original, which was borrowed and re-interpreted by the followers of Zhuang Zhou. His birthday is popularly held to be the 15th day of the second month of the Chinese calendar. In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son who became a celebrated soldier of Wei during the Warring States period.\n\"Tao Te Ching\".\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\" is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. It is often called the \"Laozi\", and has always been associated with that name. The identity of the person or people who wrote or compiled the text has been the source of considerable speculation and debate throughout history. As with many works of ancient Chinese philosophy, ideas are often explained by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. The \"Tao Te Ching\" stands as an exemplar of this literary form. Unlike most works of its genre, the book conspicuously lacks a central \"master\" character and seldom references historical people or events, giving it an air of timelessness.\n&lt;section begin=\"DDJ themes\" /&gt;The \"Tao Te Ching\" describes the Tao as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act \"unnaturally\", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The \"Tao Te Ching\" intends to lead students to a \"return\" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao. Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.\n\"Wu wei\", literally 'non-action' or 'not acting', is a central concept of the \"Tao Te Ching\". The concept of \"wu wei\" is multifaceted, and reflected in the words' multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean \"not doing anything\", \"not forcing\", \"not acting\" in the theatrical sense, \"creating nothingness\", \"acting spontaneously\", and \"flowing with the moment\".\nThis concept is used to explain \"ziran\", or harmony with the Tao. It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source. \"Tao Te Ching\" used the term broadly with simplicity and humility as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between \"wu wei\" and esoteric practices, such as \"zuowang\" ('sitting in oblivion': emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the \"Zhuangzi\".&lt;section end=\"DDJ themes\" /&gt;\nAlan Chan provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to \"nature\", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of \"wu wei\", free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in \"ignorance\", or \"simple-minded\". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as \"valley spirit\" (, \"g\u01d4sh\u00e9n\") and 'soul' (, \"p\u00f2\"), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.\nInfluence.\nPotential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and Zhuangzi, to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, the other founder of Taoism, had a great deal of influence on Chinese literati and culture. Political theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various antiauthoritarian movements have embraced Laozi's teachings on the power of the weak.\nHan dynasty.\nThe story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the Han dynasty. As Taoism took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the Tao from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the Way of the Celestial Masters, the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the Tao. He is said to have undergone numerous \"transformations\" and taken on guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the \"Old Master\" did not disappear after writing the \"Tao Te Ching\" but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the Tao.\nTaoist myths state that Laozi was a virgin birth, conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree. Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life. Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived 990 years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao.\nTang dynasty.\nDue to his traditional name \"Li Er\", Laozi has been venerated as the ancestor of all subsequent Lis, and many clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi, including the emperors of the Tang dynasty. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi's impact on Chinese culture. Under the Tang, Laozi received a series of temple names of increasing grandeur. In the year 666, Emperor Gaozong named Laozi the \"Supremely Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\" (, \"T\u00e0ish\u00e0ng Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec\"). In 743, Emperor Xuanzong declared him the \"Sage Ancestor\" (, \"Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4\") of the dynasty with the posthumous title of \"Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\" (, \"Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec\"). Emperor Xuanzong also elevated Laozi's parents to the ranks of \"Innately Supreme Emperor\" (, \"Xi\u0101nti\u0101n T\u00e0ish\u00e0ng Hu\u00e1ng\") and \"Innate Empress\" (, \"Xi\u0101nti\u0101n T\u00e0ih\u00f2u\"). In 749, Laozi was further honored as the \"Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Emperor of the Great Way\" (, \"Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4 D\u00e0d\u00e0o Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec\") and then, in 754, as the \"Great Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Heavenly Emperor and Great Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the High and Supreme Great Way\" (, \"D\u00e0 Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4 G\u0101o Sh\u01ceng D\u00e0d\u00e0o J\u012bnqu\u0113 Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng D\u00e0d\u00ec\").\nA seventh-century work, the \"Sandong Zhunang\" (; \"Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns\"), presents Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and a character named Yinxi as the ideal Taoist student. Yinxi follows a formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.\nTamil Nadu.\nIn the Siddhar tradition of Tamil Nadu, the greatly revered Siddhar Bhogar, one of the 18 esteemed Siddhars of yore, is believed to be Laozi and is of Chinese origin. His caste, from obscure references is noted to be \"Cinatecakkuyavar\" or Chinese potter. In his principal book of poetry, the \"Bhogar 7000\", he tells of his travels to China to spread his ideas on spirituality, specifically on the topic of sublimating the sexual energies and using said energies to become self-realised, with a spiritually-minded partner. His Jeeva Samadhi can be found in the southwestern corridor of the Dhandayuthapani Temple, Palani, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu.\nContemporary.\nMany contemporary philosophers have seen Laozi as a proponent of limited government. The right-libertarian economist Murray Rothbard suggested that Laozi was the first libertarian, likening Laozi's ideas on government to Friedrich Hayek's theory of spontaneous order. James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, \"argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.\" Similarly, the Cato Institute's David Boaz includes passages from the \"Tao Te Ching\" in his 1997 book \"The Libertarian Reader\" and noted in an article for the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" that Laozi advocated for rulers to \"do nothing\" because \"without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.\" Philosopher Roderick Long argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier Confucian writers.\nThe anarcho-syndicalist writer and activist Rudolf Rocker praised Laozi's \"gentle wisdom\" and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community in his 1937 book \"Nationalism and Culture\". In his 1910 article for the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", Peter Kropotkin also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially anarchist concepts. More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and Ursula K. Le Guin have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular. In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi \"does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65123", "revid": "50618459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65123", "title": "People's Action Party", "text": "Singaporean political party\nThe People's Action Party (PAP) is a major conservative political party in Singapore and is the governing contemporary political party represented in the 15th Parliament, followed by the opposition Workers' Party (WP).\nThe PAP was established in 1954 as a conventional centre-left party. Following its initial electoral success in 1959, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew sought to reposition the party ideologically toward the centre. In pursuit of this objective, he expelled the party's leftist faction in 1961, during the period of Singapore's merger with Malaysia. Over the course of the 1960s and since then, the PAP continued its ideological shift towards the centre-right. After Singapore's separation from Malaysia and subsequent independence in 1965, the majority of opposition parties, excluding the WP, boycotted the 1968 general election. Consequently, the PAP secured all parliamentary seats in that election. In the ensuing decades, the PAP consolidated its political dominance through successive electoral victories. It consistently formed the executive branch of government and exerted substantial influence over key national institutions, including the country's sole trade union, the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), which is affiliated with the party, as well as the civil service.\nBetween 1965 and 1981, the PAP was the sole political party represented in Parliament. This period of exclusive representation ended with the party's first electoral defeat in a 1981 by-election in the Anson Constituency, where the WP secured the seat. Despite this setback, the PAP has retained its political dominance. In every subsequent general election, the party consistently garnered over 60 percent of the popular vote and secured more than 80 percent of parliamentary seats, achieving landslide victories on each occasion. Having governed continuously for years, the PAP remains the dominant political force in Singapore, effectively operating within the framework of a \"de facto\" one-party state. It has maintained an unbroken two-thirds parliamentary supermajority enabling it to amend the Constitution at will. As of 2025[ [update]], the PAP is the longest-serving uninterrupted ruling party among contemporary multi-party parliamentary democracies and holds the second-longest tenure of any governing party in modern history, surpassed solely by Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed from 1929 to 2000.\nPositioned on the centre-right of Singapore's political spectrum, the PAP espouses a combination of social conservatism and economic liberalism. The party generally advocates free-market principles, favouring policies such as low taxation, the absence of tariffs, limited government expenditure relative to gross domestic product (GDP), minimal economic regulation and the promotion of economic freedom. Nonetheless, the PAP occasionally engages in strategic state intervention, reflecting elements of welfarism. A distinctive feature of its economic approach is the support for the development and expansion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), locally referred to as government-linked corporations (GLCs). These entities were initially established in response to the economic disruptions caused by the British military withdrawal from Singapore in 1971. GLCs played a central role in driving export-oriented industrialisation, fostering economic development and generating employment across key sectors of the economy. On social matters, the PAP endorses communitarian values and civic nationalism. A cornerstone of its social policy is the promotion of national cohesion through the integration of the country's major ethnic groups into a unified Singaporean identity.\nHistory.\nLee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee were involved in the Malayan Forum, a London-based student activist group that was against colonial rule in Malaya in the 1940s and early 1950s. Upon returning to Singapore, the group met regularly to discuss approaches to attain independence in Malayan territories and started looking for like-minded individuals to start a political party. Journalist S. Rajaratnam was introduced to Lee by Goh. Lee was also introduced to several English-educated left-wing students and Chinese-educated union and student leaders while working on the Fajar sedition trial and the National Service riot case.\nFormation.\nThe PAP was officially registered as a political party on 21 November 1954. Members of the first Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the party include a group of trade unionists, lawyers and journalists such as Lee Kuan Yew, Abdul Samad Ismail, Toh Chin Chye, Devan Nair, S. Rajaratnam, Chan Chiaw Thor, Fong Swee Suan, Tann Wee Keng and Tann Wee Tiong. The political party was led by Lee Kuan Yew as its secretary-general, with Toh Chin Chye as its founding chairman. Other party officers include Tann Wee Tiong, Lee Gek Seng, Ong Eng Guan and Tann Wee Keng.\nThe PAP first contested the 1955 general election in which 25 of 32 seats in the legislature were up for election. In this election, the PAP's four candidates gained much support from the trade union members and student groups such as the University Socialist Club, who canvassed for them. The party won three seats, one by its leader Lee Kuan Yew for the Tanjong Pagar division and one by PAP co-founder Lim Chin Siong for the Bukit Timah division. Then 22 years old unionist Lim Chin Siong was and remained the youngest Assemblyman ever to be elected to office. The election was won by the Labour Front headed by David Marshall.\nIn April 1956, Lim and Lee represented the PAP at the London Constitutional Talks along with Chief Minister David Marshall which ended in failure as the British declined to grant Singapore internal self-government. On 7 June 1956, Marshall, disappointed with the constitutional talks, stepped down as Chief Minister as he had pledged to do so earlier if self-governance was not achieved. He was replaced by Lim Yew Hock, another Labour Front member. Lim pursued a largely anti-communist campaign and managed to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly.\nPAP and left-wing members who were communists were criticised for inciting riots in the mid-1950s. Lim Chin Siong, Fong Swee Suan and Devan Nair as well as several unionists were detained by the police after the Chinese middle schools riots. Lim Chin Siong was placed under solitary confinement for close to a year, away from his other PAP colleagues, as they were placed in the Medium Security Prison (MSP) instead. The number of PAP members imprisoned rose in August 1957, when PAP members from the trade unions (viewed as \"communist or pro-communist\") won half the seats in the Central Executive Committee (CEC). The \"moderate\" CEC members, including Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and others, refused to take their appointments in the CEC. Yew Hock's government again made a sweeping round of arrests, imprisoning all the \"communist\" members, before the \"moderates\" re-assumed their office.\nFollowing this, the PAP decided to re-assert ties with the labour faction of Singapore in the hope of securing the votes of working-class Chinese Singaporeans, many of whom were supporters of the jailed unionists. Lee Kuan Yew convinced the incarcerated union leaders to sign documents to state their support for the party and its policies, promising to release the jailed members of the PAP when the party came to power in the next elections. Ex-Barisan Sosialis member Tan Jing Quee claims that Lee was secretly in collusion with the British to stop Lim Chin Siong and the labour supporters from attaining power because of their huge popularity. Quee also states that Lim Yew Hock deliberately provoked the students into rioting and then had the labour leaders arrested. Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths University argued that \"Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal for former political detainees to stand for election\". Lee Kuan Yew eventually accused Lim Chin Siong and his supporters of being communists working for the Communist United Front, but evidence of Lim being a communist cadre was a matter of debate as many documents have yet to be declassified.\nFirst years in government.\nThe PAP eventually won the 1959 general election. The election was also the first one to produce a fully elected parliament and a cabinet wielding powers of full internal self-government. The party has remained in power ever since, winning a majority of seats in every successive general election. Lee, who was chosen to be the first Prime Minister after an internal election within the PAP, would eventually helm this post for the next 31 years, requested the British for the release of the left-wing members of the PAP, including the likes of Lim Chin Siong, Fong Swee Suan, Sandrasegaran Woodhull, James Puthucheary and Devan Nair.\nIn 1961, the Singapore Trades Union Congress (STUC), which had backed the PAP back in 1959, split into the pro-PAP National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the non-affiliated and more leftist Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU). The SATU collapsed in 1963, following the now PAP-led government's crackdown and detention of its leaders during Operation Coldstore and its subsequent official deregistration on 13 November 1963. The NTUC remains as the sole trade union centre in the country today and continues to have a close relationship with the PAP.\nGreat Split of 1961.\nIn 1961, disagreements on the proposed merger plan to form Malaysia and long-standing internal party power struggle led to the split of the left-wing group from the PAP.\nAlthough the \"communist\" faction had been frozen out of ever taking over the PAP, other problems had begun to arise internally. Ong Eng Guan, the former Mayor of the City Council after PAP's victory in the 1957 Singapore City Council election, presented a set of \"16 Resolutions\" to revisit some issues previously explored by Chin Siong's faction of the PAP: abolishing the PPSO, revising the Constitution, and changing the method of selecting cadre members.\nAlthough Ong's 16 Resolutions originated from the left-wing faction led by Lim Chin Siong, that faction had only reluctantly asked the PAP leadership to clarify its position on them, as they still thought that the party with Lee Kuan Yew at the helm was a better alternative than Ong who was regarded as mercurial and a tyrant. However, Lee took the stance taken by the left-wing PAP members as a lack of confidence in his leadership. This issue caused a rift between the \"moderate\" PAP members (led by Lee) and the \"left-wing\" faction (led by Lim).\nOng was then expelled, and he resigned his Assembly seat to challenge the government to a by-election in Hong Lim in April 1961, where he won 73.3% of the vote. This was despite the fact that Lee Kuan Yew had made a secret alliance with Fong Chong Pik, the leader of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), to get the CPM cadres to support the PAP in the by-election.\nBarisan Sosialis.\nThe breakaway group of members formed the Barisan Sosialis with Lim Chin Siong as secretary-general. Aside from the Chinese union leaders, lawyers Thampoe Thamby Rajah and Tann Wee Tiong, several members from the University Socialist Club such as James Puthucheary (uncle of Janil Puthucheary) and Poh Soo Kai joined the party. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.\nMerger years 1963\u20131965.\nAfter gaining independence from Britain, Singapore joined the federation of Malaysia in 1963. Although the PAP was the ruling party in the state of Singapore, the PAP functioned as an opposition party at the federal level in the larger Malaysian political landscape. At that time and until the 2018 general election, the federal government in Kuala Lumpur was controlled by a coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). However, the prospect that the PAP might rule Malaysia agitated UMNO. The PAP's decision to contest federal parliamentary seats outside Singapore and the UMNO decision to contest seats within Singapore breached an unspoken agreement to respect each other's spheres of influence and aggravated PAP\u2013UMNO relations. The clash of personalities between PAP leader Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman resulted in a crisis and led to Rahman forcing Singapore to leave Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Upon independence, the nascent People's Action Party of Malaya, which had been registered in Malaysia on 10 March 1964, had its registration cancelled on 9 September 1965, just a month after Singapore's exit. Those with the now non-existent party applied to register People's Action Party, Malaya which was again rejected by the Malaysian government, before settling with the Democratic Action Party (DAP).\nPost-independence, 1965 to present.\nThe PAP has held an overwhelming majority of seats in the Parliament of Singapore since 1966, when the opposition Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front) resigned from Parliament after winning 13 seats following the 1963 general election, which took place months after a number of their leaders had been arrested in Operation Coldstore based on accusations of being communists affiliated with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).\nIt subsequently achieved a monopoly in an expanding parliament (winning every parliamentary seat) for the next four elections (1968, 1972, 1976 and 1980). Opposition parties returned to the legislature at a 1981 by-election. The 1984 general election was the first election in 21 years in which opposition parties won seats. From then until 2006, the PAP faced four opposition MPs at most. Opposition parties did not win more than four parliamentary seats from 1984 until 2011 when the Workers' Party (WP) won six seats and took away a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) for the first time for any opposition party, as well as until 2020 by which an opposition party had won more than one GRC, which was also achieved by the WP.\nEven so, the PAP still holds a supermajority in the legislature, to the point that Singapore is effectively a dominant party system similar to Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule of the country. With its supermajority, the PAP has always had the ability to amend the Constitution of Singapore at will, including the introduction of multi-member constituencies under the GRC system (in 1988) or the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMPs) scheme (in 1990), which has helped strengthened the government's dominance and control of Parliament.\nLeadership transitions.\nThe longtime governing party of Singapore, spans both past and present, but notably occurred in the mid-1980s where the first generation of PAP leaders in the CEC and the Cabinet of Singapore ceded power to a second generation of leaders.\nFirst to second generation.\nBy 1984, the \"old guard\" (first generation of party leaders) had been governing Singapore for approximately a quarter of a century. Aging leadership was a key concern, and then-Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew sought to groom younger leaders. In a speech on 29 September 1984, Lee argued that though the first generation of leaders was still \"alert and fully in charge\", to hang on to power until they had become feeble would allow power to be wrested from them, with no say in who their successors were.\nOn 30 September, at the Ordinary Party Conference, power was transferred to the second generation of leaders, who were elected to the Central Executive Committee in place of all the old CEC members; of the 14-member CEC, Lee Kuan Yew remained the only \"old guard\" leader.\nAccording to a report to the Library of Congress, the old guard were confident in their \"rectitude\" and discretion in using their extensive political powers for Singapore's common good, but were not as confident in the next generation in doing so. Various limits on executive power were considered, in order to minimise the chances of corruption. These included a popularly elected President of Singapore with substantial, nonceremonial powers. This particular reform was enacted with a constitutional amendment in 1991.\nThe old guard also sought to eschew the use of PAP as a central political institution, seeking to \"depoliticise\" and disperse power among society, and sought to include low-level community leaders in government. A policy of cross-fertilisation was enacted: exchange of leaders, \"elites\" and talent would take place between private and government sectors, civilian and military segments of society, and between the party and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).\nSecond to third generation.\nThe next generation of leaders in the late 1980s was split between the factions of then Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong and the older, more-experienced Goh Chok Tong. Lee Hsien Loong was supported by bureaucrats in the Ministry of Defence and army colleagues in the Singapore Armed Forces; Goh Chok Tong had more influence in the Singapore Civil Service, the Cabinet and government-linked companies.\nLee Kuan Yew himself remained Prime Minister and in the CEC until 1990, when he stepped down in favour of Goh Chok Tong as PM. Lee Hsien Loong became PM in 2004.\nThird to fourth generation.\nOn 23 November 2018, two fourth-generation leadership members (then\u2013Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat and then\u2013Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing) were elected as the First and Second Assistant Secretaries-General; these were, respectively, the second- and third-highest positions in the party. They replaced Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam. This represented a significant step of the leadership transition from the third generation to the fourth generation.\nOn 1 May 2019, Heng Swee Keat was appointed the new and sole Deputy Prime Minister, replacing Teo and Tharman. He was then widely seen as the 4th and next Prime Minister and Secretary-General of PAP succeeding incumbent Lee Hsien Loong. However, on 8 April 2021, Heng unexpectedly announced he would step down as the fourth-generation leader and step aside to pave the way for younger and healthier leaders to take over leadership, citing his health and age as reasons. Several Cabinet members were then seen as possible candidates to succeed Heng, including Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, and Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing.\nOn 14 April 2022, Wong was selected as new leader of PAP's fourth-generation (4G) team, succeeding Heng. Wong received an \"overwhelming majority\" of support in the consultation process, surpassing that of other nominees. His candidacy was unanimously endorsed by the cabinet and subsequently by the PAP MPs at a party caucus on 14 April. On 4 December 2024, he was elected Secretary-General of People's Action Party, with an endorsement from Lee Hsien Loong.\nOrganisation.\nDuring its initial years, the party had adopted a traditional Leninist form of party organisation, together with a vanguard cadre from its labour-leaning faction. The PAP Executive later expelled the leftist faction in 1961, bringing the ideological basis of the party into the centre and later in the 1960s moving further to the right.\nIn the beginning, there were about 500 so-called temporary cadres appointed, however the current number of cadres is unknown, with the register of cadres being kept confidential. In 1988, Wong Kan Seng revealed that there were more than 1,000 cadres.\nCadre members have the right to attend party conferences and to vote for and elect and to be elected into the Central Executive Committee (CEC), the pinnacle of party leaders.\nTo become a party cadre, a party member must be first nominated by the MP in their branch. The candidate will then undergo three sessions of interview, each with four to five ministers or MPs and the appointment is then made by the CEC. About 100 candidates are nominated each year.\nAlternatively, party cadres are recruited based on recommendations by existing PAP cadres, prospective recruits for general election candidates are then internally shortlisted before\nCentral Executive Committee and Secretary-General.\nPolitical power in the party is concentrated in the CEC, led by the secretary-general. The secretary-general of the PAP is the leader of the party. Due to PAP's electoral victories in every general election since 1959, the prime minister of Singapore has been by convention the secretary-general of the PAP since 1959. Key appointments in the CEC are usually Cabinet members.\nFrom 1957 onward, the rules laid down that the outgoing CEC should recommend a list of candidates from which the cadre members can then vote for the next CEC. This has recently changed so that the CEC nominates eight members and the party caucus selects the remaining ten.\nHistorically, the position of Secretary-General was not considered for the office of Prime Minister, but rather the Central Executive Committee held an election to choose the prime minister. There was a contest between PAP Secretary-General Lee Kuan Yew and PAP Treasurer Ong Eng Guan, prior to 1959. Lee subsequently won the leadership and was inaugurated as the first prime minister of Singapore.\nHQ Executive Committee.\nThe next lower level committee is the HQ Executive Committee (HQ EXCO) which performs the party's administration and oversees 14 sub-committees.\nThe sub-committees are the following:\nYoung PAP and internet presence.\nThe Young PAP is the youth-wing of the party, serving as a youth organisation for young adults and students in Singapore who support the PAP and have an interest in politics. The incumbent chairman of the youth-wing is Janil Puthucheary. The YP's predecessor, the PAP Youth Committee, was established in 1986, under Lee Hsien Loong's tenure as chairman. All PAP members under the age of 35 had then been grouped under the Youth Committee. In 1993, the Youth Committee was renamed the Young PAP. In an effort to attract members, then Chairman George Yeo said that people joining the YP could take positions different from central party leadership. The age limit was raised from 35 to 40. Memberships are issued through the PAP branches under each constituency in Singapore. By 2005, the committee had grown to more than 6,000 members. In 2010, then Vice-chairman Zaqy Mohamad said the YP attracts over 1200 new members that year, an increase on the 1000 new members in 2009.\nSince 1995, the youth-wing of the PAP has had an internet presence that aims to \"correct 'misinformation' about Singapore politics or culture\". Under the urging of then Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo, Young PAP took charge of running several online websites to create an online presence for the party. After popular forum Sintercom was shut down in 2001, the Young PAP offered their own forum for moderated discussions. They have since set up various blogs and social media accounts with multimedia content to engage the masses.\nIn February 2007, it was reported by \"The Straits Times\" that the PAP's new media committee chaired by Minister Ng Eng Hen, had initiated an effort to counter critics anonymously on the Internet \"as it was necessary for the PAP to have a voice on cyberspace\". The initiative was divided by two sub-committees, one of which was in charge of strategising the campaigns and is co-headed by Minister Lui Tuck Yew and MP Zaqy Mohamad. The other sub-committee\u2014new media capabilities group led by MPs Baey Yam Keng and Josephine Teo executed the strategies. The initiative was set up after the 2006 general election and also included around 20 IT-savvy PAP activists.\nFriends of the PAP.\nThe PAP has a long-running programme, known as 'Friends of the PAP' by which it enlists individuals and organisations to assist in promoting its political goals. In 2002, secretary-general Goh Chok Tong announced an intention to expand this programme, which at the time was primarily limited to \"establishment figures\" in the public and private sector. He established a related scheme titled \"Young Friends of the PAP\" to attract Singaporeans below the age of 40 as well and explained that the intention was to \"refresh\" the PAP and improve the \"quality\" of PAP's membership. Membership as a 'Young Friend' was by invitation only, and the group was limited to about 500 people.\nAccording to local media reports, the Friends of the PAP programme had \"fallen out of the public consciousness\" after 2002. However, in June 2024, the PAP revived the Friends of the PAP programme and expanded it, now with a renewed focus on local social media influencers, with the intention to connect with a wider and younger audience. The PAP did not respond to media queries about whether the Friends of the PAP programme remained invite-only or what the rules of engagement for members of the programme were.\nRecruitment and retention.\nUnlike many political parties in numerous other countries that rely on grassroots mobilisation and overt rewards for party loyalty, the PAP adopts a highly centralised, top-down and meritocratic approach to candidate recruitment; this is officially to prevent nepotism, cronyism, branch stacking, entryism or any form of primary elections. Rather than progressing through local branches or factional networks, prospective legislators are identified through \"talent spotting\" (executive search) by senior figures in government and industry. This screening mechanism is designed to attract individuals with distinguished records in the civil service, the armed forces, academia, managerial executives from the private sector or non-profit sector, or professional sectors such as engineering, law, finance, mass media and health care. Murali Pillai, a PAP MP, has claimed that the party's \"unique preselection invitation system\" is meant to \"maintain its technocratic, meritocratic, \"realpolitik\" and pragmatic character\", and to \"prevent personalist dictatorships, populism and political polarisation\".\nProspective candidates first emerge through recommendations by PAP activists, corporate leaders, MPs and senior civil servants. Each year, roughly one hundred individuals are invited to \"tea sessions\", a euphemism for informal party interviews seeking candidates in upcoming general elections, with 2 to 3 serving ministers, during which they engage in in-depth discussions lasting up to two and a half hours. Sometimes, the true intent of the interview(s) is initially unbeknownst to attendees. Those shortlisted then face two formal interviews conducted by a high-level panel at party headquarters; successful interviewees meet again with ministers, though final approval rests with the Central Executive Committee (CEC) before the successful interviewees are \"invited to join politics\". In the lead-up to an election, approved candidates are assigned to shadow incumbent MPs, and they receive training in public speaking and media communications.\nFurthermore, a small number of recruits, typically five or six per electoral cycle, are selected for additional psychological assessment. These candidates undergo a day-and-a-half examination of more than 1,000 questions to evaluate their personality and disposition, and are then earmarked as potential ministerial talent. While the PAP presents this elaborate, multi-stage process as a means of upholding \"meritocracy\" by choosing the \"best man or woman for the job\", critics argue that the heavy reliance on elite networks and professional pedigrees renders the system fundamentally elitist and prone to groupthink rather than genuinely open to wider society, especially the working class who may share a different socioeconomic environment and resulting worldview.\nAlthough only a fraction of prospective short-listed candidates are selected to represent the PAP at general elections, not everyone invited to the candidate pipeline accepts the offer. Many decline for personal or professional reasons; some encounter employer restrictions, others face familial opposition or believe that they are unsuited for politics. Likewise, when it comes to retaining serving PAP MPs in Singapore, despite the elevated salaries for ministers and MPs in Singapore, a small number also choose not to seek re-election or step aside before any given election, citing similar personal, family, lifestyle or career considerations.\nIdeology.\nAsian democracy.\nProfessor Hussin Mutalib from the National University of Singapore (NUS) opines that the PAP has often set forth the idea of Asian democracy and values, drawing from a notion of Asian culture and Confucianism to construct ideological bulwarks against Western democracy. He added that for founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, \"Singapore would be better off without Western-style liberal democracy\".\nConsequently, the governance of the PAP has occasionally been characterised by some observers, especially in the West, as semi-authoritarian by liberal democratic standards or having turned Singapore into a nanny state. According to Professor Kenneth Paul Tan from the NUS, the PAP proclaim that many Singaporeans continue to vote for the party as economic considerations, pragmatism and stability triumph over accountability and checks and balances by opposition parties.\nEconomic policies.\nThe party economic ideology has always accepted the need for some welfare spending and for pragmatic economic interventionism. However, free-market policies have been popular since the 1980s as part of the wider implementation of a meritocracy in civil society, and Singapore frequently ranks extremely highly on indices of economic freedom published by economically liberal organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Singapore is also the only Asian country with the top AAA sovereign rating from the \"Big Three\" credit rating agencies of S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch.\nLee Kuan Yew said in 1992: \"Through Hong Kong watching, I concluded that state welfare and subsidies blunted the individual's drive to succeed. I watched with amazement the ease with which Hong Kong workers adjusted their salaries upwards in boom times and downwards in recessions. I resolved to reverse course on the welfare policies which my party had inherited or copied from British Labour Party policies\".\nNotably, since Singapore's independence in 1965, the party has also supported the creation of state-owned enterprises, known within Singapore as Government-linked Corporations (GLCs), in order to jumpstart industrialisation, spearhead economic development and lead to economic growth (primarily job creation) in various sectors of the Singaporean economy as there was a lack of private sector funds and expertise, particularly in the early years of nationhood. Various GLCs were formed to pursue strategic sectors such as in ship building and repair (Sembcorp Marine, Keppel Corporation), aviation and defence (Singapore Airlines, ST Engineering), telecommunications (Singtel), real estate (CapitaLand) and development finance (DBS Bank) amongst others. In addition, various GLCs were set up as private-public partnerships, notable as joint ventures or strategic alliances with foreign companies or investors with relevant expertise, particularly in the petrochemicals and oil refining industries.\nSocial policies.\nSince the early years of the PAP's rule, the idea of survival as a small and vulnerable country with hostile neighbours has been a central theme of Singaporean politics. According to Diane Mauzy and R. S. Milne, most analysts of Singapore have discerned four major ideologies of the PAP, namely pragmatism, meritocracy, multiracialism and Asian values/communitarianism. The PAP also advocates nationalism not based on ethnocentrism, encouraging a united Singaporean identity while also recognising the main ethnic groups that make up the country.\nIn January 1989, then President Wee Kim Wee in his opening address to the 7th Parliament of Singapore stated that Singapore must adopt a set of shared national values. He was of the view that a national ideology was useful to bond Singaporeans together by preserving the cultural heritage of the core communities of Singapore, and upholding certain common values that would capture the essence of being a Singaporean. In response, the government set up a committee as a follow-up to Wee's proposal, and in January 1991, the PAP formally introduced a white paper on \"Shared Values\" for the country, which consists of five national values to forge a national identity. These values were: nation before community and society above self; family as the basic unit of society; regard and community support for the individual; consensus instead of contention, and racial and religious harmony. They were also set as a contrast against the \"more Westernised, individualistic, and self-centred outlook on life\" and to uphold the \"traditional Asian ideas of morality, duty and society\".\nAt an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) dialogue held on 2 July 2015 and chaired by Fareed Zakaria, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about the need to maintain a Jeffersonian natural aristocracy in the system to instill a culture of respect and to avoid anarchy. In November 2019, Lee stated at a party convention that the PAP must not allow the \"disconnect between the masses and the elite seen in other countries to take root in Singapore\". During the election campaign in July 2020, Lee's estranged brother over 38 Oxley Road, Lee Hsien Yang, accused the PAP of elitism as one of his explanations of joining the Progress Singapore Party (PSP). In a 2024 interview, Lee Hsien Loong criticised \"wokeness\", claiming that it \"causes life to be burdensome\" and saying that \"he did not want Singapore to go in that direction\".\nViews on other ideologies.\nParticularly during the climate of the Cold War, the party was openly hostile to communist or left-wing political ideologies despite a brief joint alliance with the pro-labour co-founders of the PAP during the party's early years, who were eventually accused of being communists and arrested. Nevertheless, Singapore formally joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1970 and did not openly align with the Capitalist Bloc. In 1987, as part of Operation Spectrum, the PAP government arrested various individuals under accusations of plotting to overthrow the government and to establish a communist state. Since the 2010s, the party while remaining largely conservative was seen by some observers as to have adopted a more centre-left tack in certain areas in order to remain electorally dominant.\nIn 1976, the PAP formally resigned from the Socialist International (SI) after the Dutch Labour Party had initially proposed to expel the PAP for the Singapore government's internment of political prisoners without trial, and accused it of human rights violations.\nSymbolism.\nThe PAP symbol, which is a red flash and blue circle on white, stands for action inside multicultural unity. It also appears on party flags on parades. PAP members at party rallies have customarily worn a uniform of white shirts and white trousers which symbolises incorruptibility and purity of the party's ideologies of the government. Lee Kuan Yew acknowledged that the Flash and Circle was adopted from the British Union of Fascists, but that the colors where changed to better represent the PAP.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65124", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65124", "title": "Bertel Thorvaldsen", "text": "Danish-Icelandic sculptor (1770\u20131844)\nAlbert Bertel Thorvaldsen (; sometimes given as Thorwaldsen; 19 November 1770 \u2013 24 March 1844) was a Danish-Icelandic sculptor and medalist of international fame, who spent most of his life (1797\u20131838) in Italy. Thorvaldsen was born in Copenhagen into a working-class Danish/Icelandic family, and was accepted to the Royal Danish Academy of Art at the age of eleven. Working part-time with his father, who was a wood carver, Thorvaldsen won many honors and medals at the academy. He was awarded a stipend to travel to Rome and continue his education.\nIn Rome, Thorvaldsen made a name for himself as a sculptor. Maintaining a large workshop in the city, he worked in a heroic neo-classicist style. His patrons resided all over Europe.\nUpon his return to Denmark in 1838, Thorvaldsen was received as a national hero. The Thorvaldsen Museum was erected to house his works next to Christiansborg Palace. Thorvaldsen is buried within the courtyard of the museum. In his time, he was seen as the successor of master sculptor Antonio Canova. Among his more famous public monuments are the statues of Nicolaus Copernicus and J\u00f3zef Poniatowski in Warsaw; the statue of Maximilian I in Munich; and the tomb monument of Pope Pius VII, the only work by a non-Catholic in St. Peter's Basilica.\nEarly life and education.\nThorvaldsen was born in Copenhagen in 1770 (according to some accounts, in 1768), the son of Gottsk\u00e1lk \u00deorvaldsson, an Icelander who had settled in Denmark. His father was a wood-carver at a shipyard, where he made decorative carvings for large ships and was the early source of influence on his son Bertel's development as a sculptor and on his choice of career. Thorvaldsen's mother was Karen Dagnes (her surname is sometimes reported as Gr\u00f8nlund), a Jutlandic peasant girl. His birth certificate and baptismal records have never been found, and the only existing record is of his confirmation in 1787. Thorvaldsen had claimed descent from Snorri Thorfinnsson, the first European born in America.\nThorvaldsen's childhood in Copenhagen was humble. His father had a drinking habit that slowed his career. Nothing is known of Thorvaldsen's early schooling, and he may have been schooled entirely at home. He never became good at writing, and he never acquired much of the knowledge of fine culture that was expected from an artist.\nIn 1781, with the help of some friends, eleven-year-old Thorvaldsen was admitted to Copenhagen's Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\"), first as a draftsman and, from 1786, at the modeling school. At night he would assist his father with wood carving. Among his professors were Nicolai Abildgaard and Johannes Wiedewelt, who are both likely influences for his later neoclassical style.\nAt the academy, he was highly praised for his works. In 1793, he won several prizes, from silver to gold, for a relief of St. Peter healing a crippled beggar. He was consequently granted a royal stipend, enabling him to complete his studies in Rome. Leaving Copenhagen on 30 August on the frigate \"Thetis\", he landed in Palermo in January 1797 and traveled to Naples, where he studied for a month before making his entry to Rome on 8 March 1797. Since the date of his birth had never been recorded, he celebrated this day as his \"Roman birthday\" for the rest of his life.\nCareer.\nIn Rome he lived at the Casa Buti, on the Via Sistina, in front of the Spanish Steps and had his workshop in the stables of the Palazzo Barberini. He was taken under the wing of Georg Zo\u00ebga, a Danish archeologist and numismatist living in Rome. Zo\u00ebga took an interest in seeing to it that the young Thorvaldsen acquired an appreciation of the antique arts. As a frequent guest at Zo\u00ebga's house he met Anna Maria von Uhden, born Magnani. She had worked in Zo\u00ebga's house as a maid and had married a German archeologist. She became Thorvaldsen's mistress and left her husband in 1803. In 1813 she gave birth to a daughter, Elisa Thorvaldsen.\nThorvaldsen also studied with another Dane, Asmus Jacob Carstens whose handling of classic themes became a source of inspiration. Thorvaldsen's first success was the model for a statue of Jason; finished in 1801 it was highly praised by Antonio Canova, the most popular sculptor in the city. But the work was slow in selling and his stipend having run out, he planned his return to Denmark. In 1803, as he was set to leave Rome, he received the commission to execute the Jason in marble from Thomas Hope, a wealthy English art-patron. From that time Thorvaldsen's success was assured, and he did not leave Italy for sixteen years.\nThe marble Jason was not finished until 25 years later, as Thorvaldsen quickly became a busy man. Also in 1803, he started work on \"Achilles and Brise\u00efs\" his first classically themed relief. In 1804 he finished \"Dance of the Muses at Helicon\" and a group statue of \"Cupid and Psyche\" and other important early works such as \"Apollo, Bacchus og Ganymedes\". During 1805, he had to expand his workshop and enlist the help of several assistants. These assistants undertook most of the marble cutting, and the master limited himself to doing the sketches and finishing touches. Commissioned by Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1808 and finished in 1832 a statue of \"Adonis\" is one of the few works in marble carved solely by Thorvaldsen's own hand, and at the same time it is one of the works that is closest to the antique Greek ideals.\nIn the spring of 1818 Thorvaldsen fell ill, and during his convalescence he was nursed by the Scottish lady Miss Frances Mackenzie. Thorvaldsen proposed to her on 29 March 1819, but the engagement was cancelled after a month. Thorvaldsen had fallen in love with another woman: Fanny Caspers. Torn between Mackenzie and Anna Maria Von Uhden, the mother of his daughter Elisa Sophia Carlotta von Uhden Thorvaldsen, Thorvaldsen never succeeded in making Miss Caspers his wife.\nIn 1819, he visited his native Denmark. Here he was commissioned to make the colossal series of statues of Christ and the Twelve Apostles for the rebuilding of Vor Frue Kirke (from 1922 known as the Copenhagen Cathedral) between 1817 and 1829, after its having been destroyed in the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807. These were executed after his return to Rome, and were not completed until 1838, when Thorvaldsen returned with his works to Denmark, being received as a hero.\nDeath.\nTowards the end of 1843 he was prohibited from working for medical reasons, but he began to work again in January 1844. His last composition from 24 March was a sketch for a statue of the \"genie\" in chalk on a blackboard. At night he had dinner with his friends Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger and H. C. Andersen, and he is said to have referred to the finished museum saying: \"Now I can die whenever it is time, because Bindesb\u00f8ll has finished my tomb.\"\nAfter the meal he went to the Copenhagen Royal Theatre where he died suddenly from a heart attack. He had bequeathed a great part of his fortune for the building and endowment of a museum in Copenhagen, and left instructions to fill it with all his collection of works of art and the models for all his sculptures, a very large collection, exhibited to the greatest possible advantage. Thorvaldsen is buried in the courtyard of this museum, under a bed of roses, by his own wish.\nWorks.\nThorvaldsen was an outstanding representative of the Neoclassical period in sculpture. In fact, his work was often compared to that of Antonio Canova and he became the foremost artist in the field after Canova's death in 1822. The poses and expressions of his figures are much more stiff and formal than those of Canova's. Thorvaldsen embodied the style of classical Greek art more than the Italian artist, he believed that only through the imitation of classical art pieces could one become a truly great artist.\nMotifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from Greek mythology, as well as works of classic art and literature. He created portraits of important personalities, as in his statue of Pope Pius VII. Thorvaldsen's statue of Pope Pius VII is found in the Clementine Chapel in the Vatican, for which he was the only non-Italian artist to ever have been commissioned to produce a piece. Because he was a Protestant and not a Catholic, the church did not allow him to sign his work. This led to the story of Thorvaldsen sculpting his own face on to the shoulders of the Pope, however any comparison between Thorvaldsen's portrait and the sculpture will show that this is just a fanciful story built on some smaller similarities.\nHis works can be seen in many European countries, especially in the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, where his tomb is in the inner courtyard. Thorvaldsen's \"Lion Monument\" (1819) is in Lucerne, Switzerland. This monument commemorates the sacrifice of more than six hundred Swiss Guards who died defending the Tuileries during the French Revolution. The monument portrays a dying lion lying across broken symbols of the French monarchy.\nThorvaldsen produced some striking and affecting statues of historic figures, including two in Warsaw, Poland: an equestrian statue of Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski that now stands before the Presidential Palace; and the seated Nicolaus Copernicus, before the Polish Academy of Sciences building\u2014both located on Warsaw's \"Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie\". A replica of the Copernicus statue was cast in bronze and installed in 1973 on Chicago's lakefront along Solidarity Drive in the city's Museum Campus. A statue () of Johannes Gutenberg by Thorvaldsen can be seen in Mainz, Germany.\nMuseums and collections.\nThe Thorvaldsen Museum is the museum in Copenhagen, Denmark where Bertel Thorvaldsen's works are displayed. The museum is located on the small island of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen next to Christiansborg Palace. Designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll, this building was constructed from public collection funds in 1837. The museum displays a collection of the artist's works in marble as well as plaster, including the original plaster models used in the making of cast bronze and marble statues and reliefs, copies of those works that are on display in museums, churches, and at other locations around the world.\nThe museum also features Bertel Thorvaldsen's personal collection of paintings, Greek and Roman sculptures, drawings, and prints the artist collected during his lifetime, as well as personal belongings he used in his work and everyday life.\nOutside Europe, Thorvaldsen is less well known. However, in 1896 an American textbook writer wrote that his statue of the resurrected Christ, commonly referred to as \"Thorvaldsen's Christus\" (created for Vor Frue Kirke), was \"considered the most perfect statue of Christ in the world.\" The statue has appealed to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a 3.4\u00a0m replica is on display at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. There is also a replica of this statue in visitors' centers associated with the LDS Church's temples in Mesa, Arizona, Laie, Hawaii, M\u00e9xico City, Los Angeles, California, Portland, Oregon, Washington D.C., Hamilton, New Zealand, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, along with visitors' centers in Independence, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Illinois. The Christus is also a feature of the visitors' center associated with the church's Rome Italy Temple, where it is displayed alongside Thorvaldsen's statues of the Twelve Apostles also from Vor Frue Kirke. In the Paris France Temple it is an outdoor feature, placed in the courtyard. Additionally, the LDS Church has historically used images of the statue in official church media, with this increasing with its use as a formal symbol, beginning in April 2020.\nAdditional replicas of the \"Christus\" include a full-size replica at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland within its iconic dome, and a full-sized copy in bronze at the Ben H. Powell III family plot in Oakwood Cemetery in Huntsville, Texas as a memorial to the Powell's son Rawley.\nThorvaldsen's \"Christus\" was recreated in Lego by parishioners of a Swedish Protestant church in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s and unveiled on Easter Sunday 2009.\nThorvaldsen's primary mastery was his feel for the rhythm of lines and movements. Nearly all his sculptures can be viewed from any chosen angle without compromise of their impact. In addition, he had the ability to work in monumental size.

This novel is often regarded as one of the peaks of the literature in Catalan language and it played a major role in influencing later writers such as Miguel de Cervantes, who, in the book burning scene of Don Quixote, says \"I swear to you, my friend, this (Tirant lo Blanch) is the best book of its kind in the world\". The novel deals with the adventures of a knight in the Byzantine Empire; it is considered one of the first works of alternate history.\nMartorell apparently was a chivalrous man and suffered an early death due to court intrigue, leaving the novel unfinished. It was prepared for publication by his friend and colleague, Mart\u00ed Joan de Galba.\nBiography.\nMartorell was born in Valencia around the year 1410. According to the historian Jaume Chiner, Martorell's family was originally from Gand\u00eda. His grandfather, Guillem Martorell, was a royal advisor and his father, Francesc Martorell, married to Damiata Abell\u00f3, was butler to King Martin the Humane. A sister of Joanot Martorell, Isabel, was married to Ausi\u00e0s March.\nThere are many biographical details that show Martorell to have been a combative and aggressive knight with a hectic life, marked by various trips and knightly adventures, although most of his disputes, including the challenges to the death, did not go beyond verbal duels. His first appointment of knighthood dates to 1433.\nMartorell spent many years in England (on one of his stays, in 1438, he translated the 12th-century poem \"Guy of Warwick\"), Portugal and Naples, as a result of various knightly disputes of which he was so fond, and about which information exists thanks to the fourteen \"lletres de batalla\" (battle letters, or exchanged letters) that Martorell wrote throughout his life and that were published in the editions of \"Tirante el Blanco\" edited by Mart\u00ed de Riquer in 1969 and 1979.\nThe confrontations Martorell had include the following:\nIn 1454, Martorell traveled to Naples to help Alfonso the Magnanimous.\nHe lived in Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jordi (now Pla\u00e7a de Rodrigo Botet), a neighbor of Joan Ro\u00eds de Corella. After the sale of his estates, his financial ruin increased; Mart\u00ed Joan de Galba, who lived in Valencia, often lent him money because Martorell was in such great need.\nMartorell died in Valencia, leaving no descendants. The date of his death is placed at the beginning of 1465.\nLiterature.\nMartorell had access to a diverse array of books that later became his source of inspiration. On 2 January 1460 he began to write \"Tirant lo Blanch\" (Tirante the White), which he dedicated to Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, whom he met in that country. It was one of the most representative works of the Valencian Golden Age. The novel narrates the war exploits of the knight Tirant and his romance with Carmesina, written with a highly erotic charge. It\u2019s considered the first modern novel in Europe and one of the most important works in all literature. \"Tirant\" was first published in 1490 in Valencia and later in Barcelona. Of these two first editions, four copies have been preserved. Three copies are from the first edition published in Valencia: one is at the University of Valencia, one is in London and one in New York. The fourth preserved copy is of the second edition published in Barcelona. In the first half of the 16th century, the novel was translated into Spanish and Italian, and later into French. It was known by Ariosto, Shakespeare and Cervantes. In fact, \"Tirant lo Blanch\" received praise from Cervantes, who saved the novel from the burning of chivalric books at the home of Alonso Quijano by the priest and the barber in the first part of \"Don Quixote de la Mancha\".\nSome evidence suggests that the work that came out of Nicol\u00e1s Spindeler's printing press in 1490 does not exactly correspond to the original manuscript that Martorell gave to Mart\u00ed Joan de Galba. The original was given to Galba as a pledge for the hundred reales Martorell had received on loan, and which Galba was unable to recover, having died before the deadline stipulated for returning the money.\nThe colophon states that Galba is the translator of the fourth part of the novel; however, that is probably an addition by the printer, since Galba, who was not a writer, died before it was finished printing. Some think instead that Galba merely divided the work into chapters and wrote his own rubrics. Another possibility, though, is that the original version that first circulated in manuscript form for 25 years was subject to some occasional additions, perhaps inspired by Joan Ro\u00eds de Corella.\nMartorell left an unfinished work, \"Guillem de Varoic\", which he had incorporated into the first chapters of \"Tirant\", and a fragment of \"Flor de caballeria\", the latter of possible attribution.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite his stylistic evolution, he is considered one of the leading Catalan authors of the 19th century.\nHe is best known for his novels \"La papallona\" (\"The Butterfly\"), which featured a foreword by \u00c9mile Zola in the French translation; \"L'Escanyapobres\" (\"The Usurer\"), regarded as his masterpiece; and \"La febre d'or\" (\"Gold Fever\"), set in Barcelona during the speculative real estate boom known as promoterism. His novel \"La bogeria\" (\"The Madness\") was translated into English by Douglas Suttle and published by Fum d'Estampa Press in 2020.\nOller also translated works by Leo Tolstoy and Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re into Catalan.\nHis contribution was instrumental in the Catalan literary renaissance known as the Renaixen\u00e7a, and he helped pioneer a modern Catalan prose style.\nBiography.\nNarc\u00eds Oller was the son of Josep Oller i Yxart (1820\u20131848) and Rosa Moragas i Tavern (1821\u20131876). He was orphaned of his father at the age of two and went to live with his mother in the ancestral Moragas house in Valls, where he was educated in a wealthy, enlightened, and liberal environment. He studied law in Barcelona, graduating in 1871. He first worked as a civil servant in the Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona and later set up practice as a procurator. He remained in this profession almost until his death.\nThere are few remarkable events in Oller's life\u2014he himself used to say that he lived \"like a simple bureaucrat\"\u2014and biographical facts had little influence on his literary production. Oller was a moderate liberal, politically close to conservative Catalanism, and socially embedded in the bourgeois class, the world of which he portrayed in detail in his narratives.\nOller began writing at a young age; his early works, written in Spanish, are almost all lost or unpublished. Around 1877 he decided to switch to Catalan: \u201cI finally saw clearly,\u201d he wrote in his \"Mem\u00f2ries liter\u00e0ries\", recalling this period, \u201cthat between the writer and his native language there is a bond so strong that it has no possible substitute.\u201d\nSeveral factors influenced this decision, including the impact of the Jocs Florals of that year (when Jacint Verdaguer\u2019s \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\" was awarded and \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0 was named \"mestre en Gai Saber\") and his participation in literary gatherings, especially the circle around the magazine \"La Renaixen\u00e7a\". He embraced Catalan not only for sentimental or political reasons but also for strictly literary ones. By the late 1870s he was reading \u00c9mile Zola and other contemporary French authors, discovering realism, which in Spanish was already cultivated by writers like Juan Valera and Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s. His close friends, the critics Josep Yxart (who was also his cousin) and Joan Sard\u00e0 i Lloret, persuaded him of the potential of realist and naturalist fiction and encouraged him to adopt these models, which were dominant in Europe at the time. Once converted to realism, Oller saw no other way to reflect his environment faithfully than through the language of the world he depicted\u2014Catalan. This attitude, both in theory and practice, was a constant in his literary career.\nOller enjoyed great respect and esteem among contemporary Spanish authors such as Gald\u00f3s, Pereda, and Valera, with whom he maintained frequent relations. They often urged him to write in Spanish, citing reasons of fame and fortune. Oller, however, fully aware of what writing in Catalan entailed, never agreed.\nIn 1886 a polemic broke out in the Spanish press about the use of Catalan as a literary language, curiously concerning only prose. Gald\u00f3s, for example, wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I understand that the resuscitators of literary Catalan may achieve their aim in poetry, because poetry lives perfectly in ingenuous and uncultivated languages, almost better than in very elaborate ones; but to attempt in Catalan the contemporary novel, which requires an extremely rich and flexible diction, seems absurd to me, with due respect to the distinguished Oller. These statements echoed what Gald\u00f3s had already written to Oller in private letters a couple of years earlier, including the blunt remark: \u201ces tont\u00edsimo que V. escriba en catal\u00e1n\u201d (\u201cit is very foolish for you to write in Catalan\u201d). Oller replied on 14 December 1884 with a letter that amounts to a declaration of principles about his concept of realism: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I write novels in Catalan because I live in Catalonia, I copy Catalan customs and landscapes, and Catalan are the characters I portray. I hear Catalan every day, at all times, as you know we speak here. You cannot imagine a more false and ridiculous effect than what I would feel making them speak in another language, nor can I express the difficulty I would face in trying to find in the Spanish palette, when painting, the colors that are familiar to me in Catalan [\u2026]. Do you not believe that language is a concretion of the spirit? Then how can it be divorced from that fusion of reality and observation that exists in every realist work?\nNovels.\nWithin Ollerian narrative, three stages can be distinguished:\nApprenticeship.\nAt the end of the sixties, Oller had begun to collaborate in the press in Spanish, often using pseudonyms; around 1872 he started a novel, also in Spanish, which he did not finish. Around 1874 he began to consider writing in Catalan and between 1877 and 1878, as we have already seen, he finally chose to write in his language. Thus in 1879 he published the collection of stories \"Croquis del natural\", which was received by critics as a turning point in Catalan narrative of the moment; that same year he won a narrative prize at the Jocs Florals with \"Sor Sanxa\", a prize he won again the following year with \"Isabel de Galceran\".\nThis first stage, of learning and formation, is characterized by the author's permanence within romantic and costumbrist coordinates, although the influence of realism begins to be detected, especially in \"La papallona\" (1882), his first novel and the one that closes this first phase of his production. Transitional work, it is still very much tied to romantic schemes. Thus, the plot \u2014 a feuilleton \u2014 is based on the story of a girl, Toneta, orphaned, poor, naive, illiterate, and sickly, who is seduced and abandoned by a \"papallona\" (womanizer), Llu\u00eds, from a higher social class. The action unfolds in twenty chapters and is set in Barcelona, a working-class Barcelona in which the first symptoms of the profound changes brought by industrialization begin to manifest. The life of the city, however, remains very much linked to costumbrist schemes.\nThe presence of lurid elements, chance, and a moralistic and implausible ending (at the gates of death, Toneta manages to marry the seducer) are elements that reveal the romantic legacy of the novel. However, aspects belonging to the realist line appear, ranging from the accuracy of dialogues and descriptions to the explanation of the biological and psychological background of the protagonist.\nThe novel achieved great critical and public success and was soon translated into several languages (French, Russian, Spanish...). Presented by some critics as the first example of naturalism in Catalonia, \u00c9mile Zola, the theoretician of the movement, remarked in the preface of the French edition of the book that there were notable differences between Oller and this movement: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have read that it comes from us, the French naturalists. For the setting, for the composition of the scenes, for the way of fixing the characters in an environment, yes: but for the soul of the works, for the conception of life, no, by no means. We are positivists and determinists, at least we do not intend to attempt more than experiences on man; and Oller, above all, is a narrator who is moved by his narration, who goes to the depth of understanding, at the risk of departing from truth.\nSituated between Romanticism and Naturalism, \"La Papallona\" meant a significant change within Catalan novelistic: the overcoming of outdated literary schemes and the incorporation of our novel into the realist and naturalist line then predominant in Europe.\nConsolidation.\nThe first edition of the novel \"La papallona\" was published with a prologue by \u00c9mile Zola; the great public response it received gave Oller greater confidence as a narrator and in the literary model he had begun to follow. Thus, between 1883 and 1889, the author's most creative period took place: four novels and several collections of short stories.\nIn 1883, he published the tales \"Notes de color\" and later the novella \"L'Escanyapobres\". The subtitle \"Study of a Passion\", appearing in the first edition of this novel, already indicates a scientific and psychological intention. Set in an imaginary town\u2014Pratbell\u2014undergoing industrialization, it narrates the story of a couple of misers\u2014Oleguer, the \"Escanyapobres\", and his wife Tuies\u2014whose passion for money leads them to isolate themselves and to the tragic death of the protagonist. Greed is viewed not only as a moral flaw (Oleguer's death, caused by his obsession with money, is clearly a \"punishment\") but also as a socially regressive attitude, since it hinders progress and productive investment that enabled the socio-economic transformation of Catalonia at that time.\n\"L'Escanyapobres\" is one of Narc\u00eds Oller's best creations. Here, more than in any of his other novels, imagination plays a very prominent role. On the other hand, it is the work in which sentimentality\u2014always present in Oller\u2014is least important, thanks especially to the use of two narrative techniques: irony and distancing. The latter is evident in the caricaturing\u2014which some critics have described as grotesque\u2014of characters and situations.\n\"Vilaniu\" (1885) was created from the narrative \"Isabel de Galceran\", responding to pressure from some friendly critics. The action takes place in a small provincial town, Vilaniu (a symbolic name that fictionalizes the author's native town: Valls), where the infatuation of a young lawyer for Isabel, the wife of the local boss Galceran, triggers slander, which ultimately causes the misfortune of her family. The plot includes many elements of the social and political life of the historical moment: the \"decline\" of small rural towns, the struggles between liberals and moderates... The novel, which today seems one of the least interesting of the author's works, represents a certain technical regression compared to \"L'Escanyapobres\". Ambitiously conceived, it failed to develop a romantic theme based on realist and naturalist schemes.\n\"La febre d'or\" is the longest of Oller's novels and undoubtedly the most notable as a historical source about an important stage in the country's evolution. In 1890, he published the first volume, written the previous year \"in one rush\", as he said himself. The plan for the work had been prepared for some time, but the news of the imminent publication of the novel \"L'argent\", by Zola, on a similar topic, forced him to hasten its writing and edition. The second volume appeared the same year as the first, and the third in 1892. These circumstances surely contributed to many defects that prevented this novel, one of the author's best, from becoming a fully successful work.\nThe theme idea comes from the stock market fever of 1880\u20131881. Oller confessed that he wanted to \"closely study the history and character of that madness\".\nThus, in the story of Gil Foix and his family, he symbolically exemplifies those historical events.\nThe novel is divided into two parts, with very significant titles: \"La pujada\" (\"The Rise\") (the first twenty chapters) and \"L'estimbada\" (\"The Fall\") (the last fourteen). Oller narrates the rapid economic and social ascent of Gil Foix from the petty bourgeoisie to the upper bourgeoisie thanks to his skillful stock market speculations. \"La febre d'or\" is both the story of particular characters and the story of an entire era of Barcelona. Oller portrays the transformation of an industrial and cosmopolitan city, framed between the stock market fever of the early 1880s and the 1888 Universal Exposition. This was, in Oller's words, a \"titanic effort that showed so well our hidden energies and our thirst for progress, which ignited my imagination, my Catalanism, and my faith placed in this people\".\n\"La bogeria\" (1899), based on a real event (the death of one of his clients), is a study of a psychological phenomenon\u2014madness\u2014its possible causes without reaching any conclusion, and its social consequences. The action takes place between the September Revolution of 1868 and the early years of the Bourbon Restoration, and more specifically during the years of the \"gold fever\". The spatial setting is mainly between Barcelona and Vilaniu.\nThe protagonist, Daniel Serrallonga, is an impetuous young man, an enthusiastic supporter of General Prim, a stock market player, and a litigant obsessed with his family, who slowly goes mad. Technically, the work marks a break with naturalist procedures. Indeed, instead of an omniscient third-person narration, there is a first-person narrator\u2014a witness narrator who plays a secondary but prominent role in the action\u2014and description loses prominence in favor of narration and dialogue. Thematically, however, it is the author's most naturalist novel, since the Zola-influenced theoretical principles of environmental and hereditary determinism are the core of the discussion about Serrallonga's illness.\nThis novel closes Narc\u00eds Oller's most creative period. The works from this period are framed within the realist line from Honor\u00e9 de Balzac to \u00c9mile Zola and aim, overall, to reproduce the reality of the time and country in which the author lived: the Catalonia of the Restoration. The perspective is clearly that of an observer belonging to the ruling social class, and therefore the most remarkable aspect is his examination of the attitudes and ideology of the bourgeoisie. The totalizing will is confirmed by some of his literary procedures, especially the reappearance of characters across different works and the limitation of the geographic space basically to Barcelona and the archetypal town of Vilaniu.\nPilar Prim.\nWhen Oller wrote \"La bogeria\" (1899), Naturalism was already in decline across Europe, and in Catalonia Modernisme (Catalan Modernism) was emerging strongly as a new literary current. He had also lost his literary mentors, critics Yxart and Sard\u00e0, which left him creatively unsettled. These losses, along with evolving aesthetic demands, pushed him toward introspective themes and psychological complexity.\nIt is therefore not surprising that Oller took four or five years before publishing his next novel, \"Pilar Prim\" (1906). In this work he decisively diverges from Naturalist conventions, striving to align with new aesthetic ideals. Thematically, the novel shifts from emerging bourgeois society to the established bourgeoisie of Barcelona, focusing on a widow bound by a marital clause that deprives her of the property's usufruct unless she remains unmarried.\nTechnically, Oller returns to third-person narration (abandoned in \"La bogeria\") and emphasizes descriptive passages in the first part of the novel\u2014mirroring his Realist\u2011Naturalist training\u2014but he transcends the old style through symbolic and psychological depth.\n\"Pilar Prim\" narrates the intimate story of a young widow who, constrained by social conventions\u2014family pressure, moral prejudice, and legal impediments\u2014struggles to follow her emotional desires. The novel incorporates Modernist features such as symbolic naming (the protagonist's name), landscape\u2013mood correlations, indirect interior monologue, and references to Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche.\nAfter \"Pilar Prim\", Oller ceased novel writing. Feeling marginalized by changing literary tastes, his literary output declined. He continued with translations (notably \"Madame X\" by Alexandre Bisson), published short stories and plays, wrote his \"Memoirs\", and prepared his \"Complete Works\" edition.\nShort fiction and other genres.\nOller's short fiction, both in quantity and in the diversity of forms and themes, represents an important part of his work, following broadly the same evolution as his novels. His production in this field comprises six volumes, which gather almost all his short stories and novellas, some of which had first appeared in periodicals before being collected in book form. His earliest collection, \"Croquis del natural\" (1879), already shows Realist tendencies, though Romantic and costumbrista elements still predominate. During his most productive period he published \"Notes de color\" (1883), \"De tots els colors\" (1888) and \"Figura i paisatge\" (1897), titles whose very names highlight the importance Oller placed on descriptive and pictorial elements. Later, after he had abandoned novel writing and most other literary activity, he returned to short fiction with \"Rurals i urbanes\" (1916) and \"Al llapis i a la ploma\" (1918). From 1923 he also contributed several short works to the collection \"La Novel\u00b7la d\u2019Ara\".\nAccording to Alan Yates, within the history of the Catalan short story, Oller's importance is comparable to his role as the founder of the Catalan novel. Although guided by a moralizing impulse and a deliberate search for entertainment, his stories display a wide thematic range. Some are early versions of narratives later expanded into novels, such as \"Un estudiant\", which reappears in \"La papallona\", or \"Isabel de Galceran\", which anticipates themes from \"Vilaniu\". Others\u2014\"Viva Espanya!\", \"Natura\", \"Angoixa\"\u2014explore aesthetic paths that depart from strict realism, suggesting an openness to fantasy, mystery, and the unreal, although Oller usually returned to realistic closure, as critic Ant\u00f2nia Tayadella i Oller has emphasized.\nStylistically, humor predominates in Oller's short fiction\u2014often linked with satire, caricature, or the grotesque\u2014relying especially on antithesis and irony. Taken as a whole, his short stories form a corpus of considerable literary quality that clarifies many of the defining elements of his fiction.\nOller's dramatic works, by contrast, are limited and of little significance: \"Teatre d\u2019aficionats\" (1900), containing short comedies and monologues (largely adaptations of foreign authors), and \"Renyines d\u2019enamorats\" (1926), which includes a two\u2011act play adapted from Moli\u00e8re's \"Le d\u00e9pit amoureux\", three monologues, and \"La brusa\", a brief parody of Maeterlinck's \"La intruse\".\nOf far greater interest are his literary memoirs, \"Mem\u00f2ries liter\u00e0ries\" (subtitled \"Hist\u00f2ria dels meus llibres\"), published posthumously in 1962. For unknown reasons, they omit an entire chapter on Catalan theatre from Modernisme to the First World War. Written in the form of letters to V\u00edctor Catal\u00e0 between 1913 and 1918 (with additions up to 1922), they cover his literary life from the 1870s to 1906. The \"Memoirs\" stand out for their narrative force and vividness, even if the wealth of detail sometimes makes the prose heavy.\nThey are also an extraordinary documentary source on Oller's creative process, the critical reception of his work, his relations with the literary milieu (including rivalries, resentments, and his rupture with younger writers), his contacts with Catalan and Spanish critics and authors, and, more broadly, on the workings of the literary and publishing world of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nRealist Oller.\nWith the shift from Romanticism to Naturalism, Narc\u00eds Oller began writing in Catalan, justifying this change due to the impact of the Jocs Florals of Barcelona in 1887, where he discovered the strong link between writer and language; from 1878 onwards he started to experiment with Catalan, compiling a collection of various short stories by 1879. Realist Oller emerged from a combination of factors, his readings focusing on French realist novelists (from Honor\u00e9 de Balzac to \u00c9mile Zola) and Spanish literature, becoming a supporter of progress. Thanks to Josep Riera i Bertrana, Oller not only connected with \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0 but was also led to consider writing in Catalan.\nZola said to Oller: \"you are not a naturalist, although you know how to place characters within their environment, then you soften your story until you depart from reality.\" Oller found inspiration in the naked contemplation of reality, yet also aimed to discover its poetics. He used the same working method as the realists; in the genesis of \"La febre d'or\" (the novel with the most notes), he drew directly from reality, capturing it, for example, in the stock market. Oller chose characters according to their belonging to his contemporary society, such as \"Sor Sanxa\", which he presented at the Jocs Florals. Oller was idealistic in the 1880s but, influenced by French and Spanish critics and writers, leaned towards realism.\nWith \"La papallona\", published in 1882 with a foreword by Zola Oller made a European leap to the level of Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s or Leo Tolstoy in their respective national literatures. Thanks to the foreword, Oller gained international fame and had the standing to be friends with novelists like Zola, Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Pereda, or Pawlowski. The foreword contains important ideas: Barcelona is described objectively, but the characters are idealized\u2014not in the conception of life\u2014since French naturalists were positivists and determinists concerning human beings. In the French translation's foreword of \"La papallona\", it is said to be the most read but not the best. In 1886, Oller wrote a letter to Zola about reading \"Germinal\", at which point he adopted naturalist-realist parameters; that same year, he traveled to Paris with Zola.\nHe never labeled himself a naturalist, but Valent\u00ed Almirall and Navarro Aliguer reported that Oller introduced naturalism in \"Croquis al natural\" (1879), reflecting the transition from Romanticism to Realism. Oller defined \"naturalist\" as synonymous with realist, i.e., a school based on observation of nature. Oller's work would not be what it is without naturalism, but it cannot be analyzed strictly from an orthodox naturalist perspective. His first contact with Zola as a reader was in the 1870s with the novel \"Une page d'amour\", situated between \"L'Assommoir\" and \"Nana\", a sentimental interlude that does not align with the harsher traits of the series... although he read \"Nana\" even if he could not admit it.\nIn his correspondence, Oller wrote his opinion about Gald\u00f3s's \"Lo prohibido\", realistic portraits; about Gald\u00f3s's \"Fortunata y Jacinta\", he said they were essentially real and lively, full of life and truth, which he sought to achieve in his novels. Oller's geographic documentation was accurate; Yxart and Oller believed reality can only become reality through the artist's personality, meaning Oller was a naturalist as long as the viewpoint was softened.\nWhen Oller described the Catalan realist painter Galofre, he was in fact describing himself: \"a variety of natural beauties of living reality, in love with living reality but also moving.\" Reflecting on the story \"La bufetada\" published in 1884, he said it was inspired by a real case (true, though the character was not a butcher but a master builder). He claimed he had to push reality towards plausibility, to align literary technique with reality. This theorization regarding language in 1877 led to an exchange of letters in which Gald\u00f3s told him to write in Spanish to sell more books, and Oller replied that if he wanted to sell more, he would write in French.\nIn his creative work, Oller employed techniques, motifs, and situations from the naturalist novel; he did not need to read naturalist theoretical texts because he was a great reader of naturalist-realist novels, hence the leitmotifs of the realist novel. When writing novels, Oller had reality as his starting point but was also saturated by the quantity of realist novels read, which he assimilated. His peak was in 1892, though a brief one; creatively, this was when he had the most confidence in the naturalist-realist model.\nIn 1903, Oller published the article \"P\u00e8l i ploma\" where he valued Zola's foreword; this assessment was influenced by the crisis of naturalism itself. In the mid-1890s, Oller experienced artistic disorientation leading to silence (except for a final novel in 1898) due to the deaths of his pillars Yxart and Sard\u00e0; without them, he felt helpless, also because of the changing literary context. The naturalist-realist model was in crisis, and Oller tried to resolve it with \"La bogeria\" and \"Pilar Prim\" but failed. He explained his fascination with Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", reflecting on the length, structure, and composition of the realist novel, thoughts triggered as the realist novel fell into crisis. One reason was the impact of psychological novel techniques from Russian literature. With the rise of Noucentisme, Oller disappeared from public life, but by 1925 it was recognized that the psychological and urban novel models were connected with Oller, specifically with \"Pilar Prim\".\nCharacteristics of Oller's Work.\nMaurici Serrahima, in studying Narc\u00eds Oller's work, highlighted that the novelist's overall literary purpose was \"truth in art,\" that is, \"the search for and reproduction of reality.\" According to the aesthetic principles he followed, this reality had to be necessarily that of his country in the period he lived in. This is reflected in the themes he treats in his work, which collectively serve as a general chronicle of the transformation of Catalan society during the second half of the 19th century and the impact of the changes on both urban and rural life.\nIt is therefore not surprising that throughout his production appear those aspects that, for him, were the most significant of the rapidly developing world in which he was immersed: the construction of the railway, stock market games, the provincialism of small towns, caciquism, political struggles, revolutionary events, the rise of the bourgeoisie, the social and economic crisis of the countryside, and especially the growth of the large city, Barcelona.\nOller had a notable totalizing ambition when reproducing the reality of his time. It is thus curious to note that some of the most important phenomena of industrialization, such as the emergence of the proletariat and class struggle, are almost unnoticed in his work. Workers and their world appear very little in his literature, and even then from a perspective that does not go beyond a traditional and customary view.\nOller's work is often praised for its vivid realism and detailed depiction of Barcelona and other settings. His ability to create immersive and tangible environments is considered one of his major literary strengths.\nThe characters, however, are sometimes described as \u201cslightly idealized.\u201d Oller often emphasizes those aspects of the characters that are more idealizable\u2014in the case of positive characters\u2014or more caricatured\u2014in the case of negative ones. Among his gallery of literary figures, the female characters tend to be the most fully developed psychologically; the male characters often have a more schematic character and a less rich and nuanced personality. Nevertheless, characters such as Daniel Serrallonga from *La bogeria* or Oleguer from *L'Escanyapobres* stand out as remarkable creations.\nOller's idealistic inclination in character portrayal relates to a broader aspect that Sergi Beser i Ort\u00ed, in a key study of the novelist's work, called \"the narrative limitations of Narc\u00eds Oller.\" These limitations depend largely \u201con two innate tendencies in Oller that belong to his most intimate personality and are reflected in his narrative reproduction\u201d: moralism and a sentimentality of romantic origin.\nThis pair of elements, which contrast with the naturalist realism he tried to follow, are constant throughout his work. For Oller, sentiment was the most important thing in humans, and to save it, he resorted to moral criticism of human behaviors. Hence, the critique of moral and social flaws (greed, slander, unjust conventions...) and the reward for the \u201cgood\u201d (even if, as in the case of Toneta in *La papallona*, it is at the threshold of death) and destruction for the \u201cbad.\u201d\nOller's narrative is, according to Beser, \u201cthe result of the confrontation of two difficult cultural and literary worlds to unite: on the one hand, realism bordering on Zola-like naturalism; on the other, a moralizing sentimentality that seems to move towards traditional Romanticism. A critical evaluation of Oller's works shows the writer's failure in those stories that do not overcome this contradiction (*La papallona*, *Vilaniu*) and the quality of those that, for different reasons, manage to resolve it (*L'Escanyapobres*, *La bogeria*), relegate it to a secondary plane (*La febre d'or*), or find a justification for it within a new concept of the novel (*Pilar Prim*).\u201d\nHistorical significance of Oller.\nWhen \"La papallona\" was published in 1882, novel-writing in Catalan was barely twenty years old. To find earlier examples of the genre, one would have to go back to the late 15th century, when \"Tirant lo Blanc\" and \"Curial e G\u00fcelfa\" were written (the manuscript of the latter, discovered in the 19th century, was first published in 1901). Thus, Oller had hardly any predecessors when he decided to cultivate the novel. Before him, only a small production of romantic, costumbrist, and serial novels formed the limited background available. Moreover, these types of novels corresponded to outdated literary models, since across Europe a new kind of novelistic literature was emerging: the realist novel.\nNarc\u00eds Oller was the writer who, overcoming these anachronisms, managed to situate Catalan novel-writing within the most advanced literary currents of his time. Oller is undoubtedly one of the most relevant Catalan novelists and, in the opinion of Sergi Beser, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;holds an important place within the European narrative of the 19th century and, although he is not among the great masters \u2014Balzac, Charles Dickens, Gald\u00f3s, Tolstoi, E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s\u2026\u2014 he is not far behind them; moreover, he represents for Catalan culture what these authors represent for their respective national cultures.\nTo properly evaluate Oller's work, one must consider several factors that conditioned its realization. On one hand, those stemming from his personality: a permanent literary insecurity \u2014partially overcome thanks to the advice and encouragement of his literary friends, especially critics Yxart and Sard\u00e0\u2014 and a certain indolence facilitated by the lack of professional dedication to literature, which sometimes prevented him from pushing forward literary projects and plunged him into periods of doubt or discouragement.\nOn the other hand, there were two problems arising directly from the Catalan cultural context: the imperfection of the literary language (\u201cimpoverished by scant cultivation in recent centuries and at that time subjected to tensions between supporters of colloquial Catalan and defenders of an archaizing language\u201d) and the lack of suitable models for realist narrative. Oller partly replaced the inexistence of an appropriate literary tradition with contemporary French and Spanish novelistic literature.\nThis novelistic literature followed the aesthetic codes of naturalist realism, and Oller adhered to this current. However, it was a conditional adherence. He accepted the composition techniques of the work but rejected the deterministic and materialistic ideology and the purpose of denunciation and social change present in Zola's doctrine. Furthermore, as noted before, moralist sentimentality profoundly conditioned his literary realizations.\nWith all its shortcomings and limitations, Oller made an enormous effort materialized in a work of high literary quality that largely filled the existing void in the novel field, recovering the lost Catalan novelistic tradition and enabling the work of the late 19th century narrators.\nNarc\u00eds Oller today holds an interest that is not merely historicist, an interest that goes beyond his role as the founder of the modern Catalan novel. Today, his best creations (\"L'Escanyapobres\", \"La bogeria\", \"Pilar Prim\", and even his short stories) are reissued with unusual frequency in our literary market. Oller, even eighty years after the publication of his last novel, still connects, like all good narrators, with the public.\nLiterary heritage.\nHistorical Archive of the City of Barcelona.\nThe personal papers and the library of Narc\u00eds Oller were donated free of charge by Joan Oller i Rabassa to the Historical Archive of the City of Barcelona (AHCB) at the end of the Spanish Civil War. An important addition was made on 18 October 1968, when the Archive purchased further documents, among which the original handwritten manuscript of \"Mem\u00f2ries liter\u00e0ries o hist\u00f2ries dels meus llibres\" (\"Literary Memoirs or Stories of My Books\") stands out. Although it had already been published in 1962 by Editorial Aedos in Barcelona, access to the manuscript remained restricted by explicit request of the family. The publication reproduces the manuscript almost in full, with some corrections, except for chapter XVI, which was omitted.\nOller's personal collection, amounting to 5,973 documents, is one of the most important private holdings preserved at the AHCB. Especially significant is the correspondence, with 4,798 letters. The collection comprises: personal and family documents (345 items); copyright documents (35); professional activities (87); manuscripts (170); correspondence (4,798 letters); and press materials (527). A portion of these had already been classified earlier into nine series, registered under the initials NO and the corresponding Roman numeral of the series, followed by the document number\u20143,464 records in total.\nCentre for Studies: Narc\u00eds Oller Society.\nThe Narc\u00eds Oller Society is a non-profit association founded by individuals linked to education (both university and secondary) and to cultural and publishing activities in Valls. Its objectives are to become a reference centre for the dissemination, promotion, and research of Oller's literary heritage; to encourage the study of Oller and modern narrative across Catalonia; and to publicize the author as one of the most relevant figures of nineteenth-century Catalan literature.\nThe Society's main projects include the publication of Oller's complete works, the creation of literary routes, a signposted itinerary through his native city, a centre for interpretation and documentation, and the organization of symposia on narrative, especially in the Alt Camp region.\nNarc\u00eds Oller Literary Route.\nThe Narc\u00eds Oller Society offers a literary route through the old town of Valls aimed at school groups (ESO and Baccalaureate) as well as tourists and visitors. The route, inaugurated in November 2008, allows participants to walk through the most significant places connected with Oller's life and works. Informative plaques and medallions mark the locations, and guides read selected fragments of Oller's writings.\nThe guided tour covers eight emblematic sites in Valls, such as the Pla\u00e7a del Quarter, the Carrer de la Cort, the Pla\u00e7a del Blat, the Arcs de Ca Magran\u00e9, the Pla\u00e7a del Carme, the Pla\u00e7a de l'Oli, the Pla\u00e7a dels Alls, and the El Pati (Valls). At each stop, relevant passages from works such as \"Vilaniu\", \"La febre d'or\" (\"The Gold Rush\"), and \"La bogeria\" (\"Madness\") are read aloud. The full route consists of 11 information points and is also available for self-guided visits using a leaflet provided by the Society.\nLiterary map.\nSeveral key locations in Valls and Barcelona appear in Oller's works. In Valls, the house at Carrer de la Cort no. 25 is believed to be his birthplace, and nearby is the house of Daniel Serrallonga, the protagonist of \"La bogeria\". In \"Vilaniu\", the Montell\u00e0 family residence is set at Pla\u00e7a del Blat, overlooking the square where human tower festivals (\"castells\") take place.\nOther significant sites include the Ortega family house in the nearby woods (which had belonged to Oller's father), frequently mentioned in \"Vilaniu\" and \"La bogeria\"; and the Moragas family summer house, called \"Maiola\" in Oller's writings, a neoclassical building from the early eighteenth century that became a retreat for the well-to-do families of Valls in the nineteenth century. These locations are also linked with Oller's cousin and mentor Josep Yxart. Some of these settings were used in the film adaptation of \"La febre d'or\".\nIn Barcelona, Oller placed scenes of \"La febre d'or\" at the Portal de la Pau, near today's Barceloneta district, and described the demolition of the sea wall and the opening of the city to the sea. He also set parts of \"La bogeria\" in the same area. Finally, the former convent of Santa M\u00f2nica (today the Arts Santa M\u00f2nica Centre) serves as the backdrop for the baptism scene in \"La papallona\" (\"The Butterfly\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He is best known for his novel \"The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk During the World War\", an unfinished novel about a soldier in World War I and a satire on the ineptitude of authority figures. The novel has been translated into about 60 languages, making it the most translated novel in Czech literature.\nLife.\nJaroslav Ha\u0161ek's paternal ancestors were farmers rooted in Mydlovary in South Bohemia. Ha\u0161ek's grandfather from his father's side, Franti\u0161ek Ha\u0161ek, was a member of the Czech Landtag and later also the so-called Kromeriz convention. He was also involved in barricade fights in Prague in 1848. According to some rumors, he worked with Mikhail Bakunin during his stay in Bohemia in 1849.\u00a0\nThe family of his mother, Katherine, n\u00e9e Jare\u0161ov\u00e1, was also from South Bohemia. His grandfather Anton\u00edn Jare\u0161 and his great-grandfather Mat\u011bj Jare\u0161 were pond-keepers of the Schwarzenberg princes in Kr\u010d village No. 32.\nHis father, Josef Ha\u0161ek, a deeply religious mathematics teacher, died early of alcohol intoxication. He put an end to himself due to pain caused by cancer. Poverty then forced his mother Kate\u0159ina with three children to move more than fifteen times.\nAt the age of four, the doctor diagnosed a heart defect and \"stunted thyroid gland\" in little Jaroslav. Because of this, he spent a lot of time in the country, with his grandfather from his mother's side, in the so-called Ra\u017eice dam-house, especially with his younger brother Bohuslav. In his childhood, Jaroslav was jealous of Bohuslav and even tried several times to hurt him as a baby. Later they had an extremely strong relationship and traveled together a lot on foot. Bohuslav drank himself to death one year after Jaroslav's death.\nHa\u0161ek's childhood was ordinary, boyish, imbued with adventures with peers and reading Karl May and Jules Verne. However, this changed when Ha\u0161ek was eleven: the retired sailor N\u011bme\u010dek moved to Lipov\u00e1 Street, where the Ha\u0161eks lived at that time. N\u011bme\u010dek wrapped the teenage Ha\u0161ek around his little finger, pilfered the money that Ha\u0161ek had stolen at home, and began to lead him into bars, including the infamous \"Jedov\u00e1 ch\u00fd\u0161e\" (Poison Hut) on Apolin\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 Street, where he taught him to drink alcohol. In addition, he intentionally had sex with his girlfriend in front of the boy. It was a trauma for Ha\u0161ek. He later remembered these experiences with disgust and remorse. It probably influenced Ha\u0161ek's relationship with women. In his discussions with his comrades in the Russian legions, it is said that he said the following about women:\"Can there be anything worse in the world than such a human pig? I didn't know anything about these things, and yet I felt such disgust and revulsion that it was enough to poison my whole life. I could never look at the woman again, and I have also been afraid of women since then.\"Some theories about Ha\u0161ek's homosexuality, spread mainly by the literary historian Jind\u0159ich Chalupeck\u00fd (the essay \"Podivn\u00fd Ha\u0161ek\" in the book \"Expresionist\u00e9\"), have also originated here, as well as in the testimony of Ha\u0161ek's friend Rudolf \u0160imanovsk\u00fd.\nShortly after Ha\u0161ek began his studies at the grammar school in Je\u010dn\u00e1 Street, his father died. In 1897, he was present at anti-German riots in Prague as a student. He was arrested and the gymnasium teachers forced him to \"voluntarily\" leave the institution. He then trained as a druggist in Koko\u0161ka's drugstore on the corner of Per\u0161t\u00fdn and Martinsk\u00e1 Street, but eventually graduated from the Czech-Slavonic Business Academy in Resslova Street. \n At the academy, he made friends with Ladislav H\u00e1jek, and in 1903 they together wrote and released a parody of the lyrical poetry of May Shouts, in which Ha\u0161ek first laughed at pathos and entered the field of humorous literature.\nAfter graduating in 1902, he was employed by the Slavia Bank; however, he was dismissed on May 28, 1903, for being absent without permission.\nThereafter, he began to earn his living exclusively in journalism and literature. At that time, he also met Czech anarchists. He began to lead a bohemian and vagrant life. Together with his brother Bohuslav, he walked through, among other places, Slovakia and western Galicia (now in Poland). Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek published stories from these trips in \"N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy\".\nIn 1907, he became editor of the anarchist magazine \"Komuna\" and was briefly imprisoned for his work.\nIn the same year, he fell in love with Jarmila Mayerov\u00e1 but, because of his bohemian life, her parents did not consider him a suitable partner for their daughter. When he was arrested for desecrating the Austro-Hungarian flag in Prague, Mayerov\u00e1's parents took her to the countryside in the hope that it would help end their relationship. In response, Ha\u0161ek tried to back out of his radical politics and get permanent work as a writer. In 1908 he edited the \"Women's Horizon\". In 1909 he had sixty-four published short stories. \nIn February 1909, he was appointed editor of Sv\u011bt zv\u00ed\u0159at (The Animal World), a popular bi-weekly magazine that focused on animals and animal breeding. Ha\u0161ek's engagement with the magazine was only the second time in his life that he had been permanently employed, and now he kept the job longer than he had at Banka Slavia, probably around 20 months. \nObtaining permanent employment at\u00a0The Animal World was instrumental in overcoming Jarmila Mayerov\u00e1's parents' resistance to her marrying Ha\u0161ek, and the wedding took place on 23 May 1910. In October 1910, Ha\u0161ek was dismissed as editor of \"The Animal World\" and in November, he and his wife set up his own dog trading business named \"Cynological Institute\", an undertaking that failed after a few months. After a year of marriage, Jarmila returned to her parents after Ha\u0161ek was detained after trying to feign his own death. According to other sources, however, this was a serious attempt at suicide, motivated by the understanding that he was unable to live a marital life. After this attempt, he was briefly hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.\nFrom 1911, he contributed to the \"Czech Word\", then to the \"Torch\", \"Humorist Letters\", \"Nettle\", \"Cartoons\", and for some time led the Institute of Cynology, which inspired his later book \"My Dog Shop\".\nIn 1911, he founded The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law. He founded it with his friends in the Vinohrady pub called \"U zlat\u00e9ho litru\" (The Golden Liter) to parody the political life of that time. He also wrote the satirical work \"Political and Social History of the Party of Mild Progress within the limits of the law\", but it was not published in book form until 1963.\nDuring this period, together with Franti\u0161ek Langer, Emil Artur Longen and Egon Erwin Kisch he co-authored a number of cabaret performances, where he was also the main performer.\nIn the summer of 1912, Ha\u0161ek spent several weeks in a pub in Chot\u011bbo\u0159, where he could not be gotten rid of and the proprietors waited in vain for payment. He described his stay in Chot\u011bbo\u0159 in the stories \"Traitor of the Nation in Chot\u011bbo\u0159\", the \"District Court in Malibor\", and \"How about the birthplace of Ign\u00e1t Herrmann or the Consecration in Krivice\".\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Ha\u0161ek lived with the cartoonist Josef Lada, who later illustrated the \"Good Soldier \u0160vejk\".\nIn February 1915, Ha\u0161ek was called up to the replacement battalion of the 91st Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. With the Regiment's 12th March Battalion, he was in early July transported to the Eastern front in Galicia (now Ukraine). He served on the front until 24 September 1915 when he was captured by the Russians and sent to the Totskoye camp in Orenburg Governorate. Here he joined the Czechoslovak Legion in 1916. Then he was drafted into the 1st Regiment, where he worked as a scribe, emissary of the recruitment committee and gunner. Then he was transferred to the connecting section, machine-gun section (in which he participated in the Battle of Zborov against the Austrians) and the office of the 1st Regiment. From July 1916 to February 1918 he published in the journal \"\u010cechoslovan and Cs. soldier\", and was the author of a number of anti-Bolshevik articles.\nAt the end of February 1918, he joined the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party (forerunner of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, 1921\u20131992). What led Ha\u0161ek to abandon anarchism and to accept socialist ideals has nowhere been clarified. In March, the Czechoslovak legions embarked on their well-known retreat, with the aim of joining the Western Front via Vladivostok. Ha\u0161ek disagreed with this and went to Moscow, where he began to cooperate with the Bolsheviks. In April he transferred from the legions to the Red Army. He was sent to Samara and the following year he was director of the army printer in Ufa, chief of the department for work with foreigners, etc. At the end of 1918 he served as commander of the Chuvash troops in the Red Army and as deputy military commander of the Bugulma district. He then worked in Siberia, where he published several magazines. One of them was also the first magazine in the Buryat language, \"Jur\" (Dawn).\nIn 1920, he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Irkutsk, where he served as a member of the city soviet. In the same year he fell ill with typhoid fever, and in May he married a printing worker named Alexandra Grigorievna Lvova, called Shura, who took care of him after his illness. After his return to Czechoslovakia, he was not tried for polygamy because of the lack of order and recognition of various international treaties in Russia.\nIn December 1920, Ha\u0161ek returned to independent Czechoslovakia. He was initially placed in quarantine in Pardubice, and on 19 December he arrived in Prague with Shura. The Soviets had sent him to Czechoslovakia to organize the communist movement. However, he was prevented from doing so by two circumstances: on the one hand, in support of the , he received from the Russian authorities an amount of 1,500 marks, which, however, was completely devalued by German inflation. In addition, even before Ha\u0161ek's arrival in Prague, Jaroslav Handl\u00ed\u0159, leader of a clutch of Russian agents whom Ha\u0161ek was to contact, was arrested in Czechoslovakia. In this way Ha\u0161ek's interest in communist politics ended and he returned to his bohemian way of life. He visited pubs in Prague and its surroundings, where he wrote his stories. Many stories describing this period were written by Ha\u0161ek's friend Zden\u011bk Mat\u011bj Kud\u011bj.\nOn 25 August 1921 Ha\u0161ek left with his wife Shura and painter Jaroslav Panu\u0161ka for Lipnice nad S\u00e1zavou. By this time he was seriously ill and dangerously obese. In Lipnice he began writing his masterpiece, \"The Fate of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk During the World War\". Eventually he was unable to write, yet he continued to dictate \u0160vejk's chapters in his bedroom. On 3 January 1923, he died of heart disease. The last known photograph was taken in December 1922.\nContradictions and points of interest.\nIn the Czech and Slovak public imagination Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek is fixed as a bohemian, perhaps even the prototypical bohemian of the early twentieth century. In fact, this is largely a legend and represents Ha\u0161ek's self-stylization. An internally disciplined author, Ha\u0161ek was very productive. From his works it is also apparent that he had an extensive (perhaps a little unsystematic) humanistic education.\nIt is most instructive to consider Ha\u0161ek's work in Russia during 1916 to 1920. He has never been and still is not perceived as a mere bohemian or humorist writer in Russia, but, on the contrary, as a very responsible Bolshevik army official and a respected intellectual. He was also a relatively skilled soldier. In 1918 he distinguished himself as a courageous commander of the Czechoslovak Red Army troops in the defense of Samara. Samara was at that time threatened from the direction of Lipyagi station by the Czechoslovak legions, which were fighting alongside the White troops to restore the imperial regime, although the legionnaires tried to maintain essential neutrality and fight against the Bolsheviks only when inevitable. On 8 June 1918, Samara was conquered by the legions. It is possible that at this time, Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek met with Czech \"brothers\" and may have encouraged them to leave the White-Russian party. After the fall of Samara, he was in hiding in a territory controlled by White troops (and Czechoslovak legions) for several months.\nIt is possible that in specific revolutionary Russian conditions, Ha\u0161ek was given the opportunity to assert those aspects of his character that could not manifest themselves in stabilized and essentially small-town Czech conditions. It was also important that Ha\u0161ek was banned by his Party organization from drinking alcohol. He was basically sent to Czechoslovakia with the aim of organizing the communist movement, which also supports the thesis that he had to be perceived as a responsible person and a capable organizer in Soviet Russia.\nA subject of debate and speculation is how Ha\u0161ek behaved in the Red Army, especially at a time when he was a Commissioner \u2013 and deputy commander \u2013 of Bugulma.\nHa\u0161ek had close contact with a number of revolutionaries including Leon Trotsky. Ha\u0161ek's closest collaborators in Russia \u2013 Nikolai Ivanovich Kochkurov (\"Artem Vesely\") or Vladimir Yakovlevich Zazubrin \u2013 later became victims of Stalin's repression.\nThere is also speculation about Ha\u0161ek's mysterious mission to Mongolia, which he probably undertook in Soviet service. The writer Pavel Gan claims that he was there in conjunction with the Chinese revolutionary Chen Chang-Hai, alias Vanya Chang, and was going to go with him to China, for which reason he probably learned solid Chinese.\nA not-well-known aspect of Ha\u0161ek's biography is that after returning to his homeland he found himself somewhat isolated. He was uncomfortable from left to right. After he left communist politics, for example, Stanislav Kostka Neumann described him as a \"traitor to the proletarian revolution.\" For the poet Karel Toman he was branded a \"traitor of the nation\" by his red arm band and refused to shake his hand when he met him in a caf\u00e9 after the war. There were more such hostile reactions. Ha\u0161ek's departure to Lipnice, where he wrote \"\u0160vejk\", was motivated by the hostile atmosphere he met in Prague.\nWorks.\nInitially Ha\u0161ek wrote mainly travel stories, features and humoresques, which he published in magazines. He wrote most of his works in Prague pubs.\nHis prose was based on his own real experiences, confusing investigation of his actual life, because it is not always clear what is true and what is only poetic hyperbole.\nHa\u0161ek hated pretense, sentimentality, settled life, to which he ironically reacted in satiric verse. Another characteristic feature of his work is resistance to moral and literary conventions.\nIn his life, he wrote about 1,200 short stories. Most of his short prose is scattered throughout various magazines and newspapers. Over the years nearly all the stories have been collected and printed in book's form. Some texts may however have been lost, for example, the story \"The History of the Ox.\" There is also a number of texts of which Ha\u0161ek's authorship is likely, but not confirmed.\nWords flowed easily from his pen, but this does not mean that he was not creative. Franti\u0161ek Langer stated that \"he was attracted, controlled, absorbed by writing, driven by his almost passionate passion for his writing.\"\nHis most famous text by far, the four-part humorous novel \"The Fate of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk During the World War\", has been translated into 58 languages and several times filmed and dramatized. Individual parts of the novel have the names: \"In the Background (1921)\", \"At the Front (1922)\", \"Famous Spanking (1922)\" and \"Unfinished Continuation of the Famous Spanking\" (1923). Ha\u0161ek's most important work is associated by many people with congenial illustrations by Josef Lada. Ha\u0161ek did not manage to complete the book. The completion of the work by is far from Ha\u0161ek's original conception. Vanek's completion was based on the continuation of 1921, but was highly criticized (Viktor Dyk, Jaroslav Durych, F. X. \u0160alda etc.). At first, the work had few followers. Ivan Olbracht was probably the first to mark it as a major work in the cultural section of \"Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo\". \"It is one of the best books ever written in the Czech Republic, and Svejk is quite a new type in world literature, equivalent to Don Quixote, Hamlet, Faust, Oblomov, Karamazov,\" Olbracht wrote. Karel \u010capek, Josef \u010capek, Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk and V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, who connected Ha\u0161ek's work with Dadaism, also adopted a positive attitude, as did Dev\u011btsil theoretician Bed\u0159ich V\u00e1clavek. Discussions on the value of the work continued in later years. For example, V\u00e1clav \u010cern\u00fd opposed \u0160vejk, but a wide range of Czech literary theorists, artists, and intellectuals had other views \u2013 the philosopher Karel Kos\u00edk saw the novel as \"an expression of the absurdity of the alienated world\"; he described \u0160vejk as the \"tragic bard of European nihilism. The aesthetist associated \u0160vejk with existentialism; the literary theorist Jind\u0159ich Chalupeck\u00fd described \u0160vejk as the \"tragic bard of European nihilism,\"; and the writer Milan Kundera described the novel as \"the pure irrationality of history.\".\n\u0160vejk has been dramatized several times, Ha\u0161ek himself performed the first dramatization for the \"Revolutionary Scene\"; in 1928 \u0160vejk turned into a theater performance of Ha\u0161ek's friend Max Brod, in 1963 by Pavel Kohout. The international adaptation was achieved by the adaptation of \"Schweik in the Second World War\" by the German playwright and director Bertold Brecht.\nTributes.\nOn 30 April 2013, Google celebrated Jaroslav Hasek's 130th Birthday with a doodle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the organisers of a 2009 Hrabal exhibition in Brno, his biological father was probably Bohumil Blecha (1893\u20131970), a teacher's son a year older than Marie, who was her friend from the neighbourhood. Marie's parents opposed the idea of their daughter marrying Blecha, as he was about to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army. World War I started four months after Hrabal's birth, and Blecha was sent to the Italian front, before being invalided out of service. Blecha's daughter, Drahom\u00edra Blechov\u00e1-Kalvodov\u00e1, says her father told her when she was 18 that Hrabal was her half-brother. Bohumil and his biological father never met formally, according to Blechov\u00e1-Kalvodov\u00e1. Hrabal and Blechov\u00e1-Kalvodov\u00e1 met twice; a dedication on a picture from 1994 says: \"To sister Drahom\u00edra, Hrabal!\"\nHrabal was baptised Bohumil Franti\u0161ek Kili\u00e1n. Until the age of three, he lived mainly with his grandparents, Kate\u0159ina Kili\u00e1nov\u00e1 (born Bartlov\u00e1) (d. 1950) and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Kili\u00e1n (died 1925), a descendant of a French soldier injured at the Battle of Austerlitz, in Brno, while his mother worked in Poln\u00e1 as an assistant book-keeper in the town's brewery. She worked there with her future husband, Franti\u0161ek Hrabal (1889\u2013 1966); one Franti\u0161ek Hrabal was listed as Bohumil's godfather when he was baptised on 4 April 1914, but Franti\u0161ek was also the first name of Bohumil's future step-grandfather, a soft-drinks trader. Franti\u0161ek Hrabal, Hrabal's stepfather, was a friend of Blecha. He is a prominent character in some of Hrabal's most famous fiction work, and in \"Gaps\", the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy, Hrabal wrote that he declined an invitation to meet his biological father and considered Franti\u0161ek Hrabal to be his father.\nMarie and Franti\u0161ek married in February 1917, shortly before Bohumil's second birthday. Hrabal's half-brother, B\u0159etislav Josef Hrabal (1916\u20131985), was born later that year; B\u0159etislav, known as Sl\u00e1vek, is said to have been an excellent raconteur. The family moved in August 1919 to Nymburk, a town on the banks of the Elbe River, where Franti\u0161ek Hrabal became the manager of a brewery. Both Marie and Franti\u0161ek were involved in amateur dramatics, though Marie was more active. Hrabal later recalled having a complex about this, and feeling embarrassed by her being the centre of attention.\nHrabal's uncle was Bohuslav Kili\u00e1n (1892\u20131942), a lawyer, journalist and publisher of the cultural magazines \"Salon\" and \"M\u011bs\u00edc\". The latter had a German version, \"Der Monat\", that was distributed throughout Europe, but not in Nazi Germany.\nIn 1920, Hrabal started primary school in Nymburk. In September 1925, he spent one year at a grammar school in Brno (now Gymn\u00e1zium t\u0159\u00edda Kapit\u00e1na Jaro\u0161e, later attended by Milan Kundera). He failed the first year, and later attended a technical secondary school in Nymburk. There too he struggled to concentrate on his studies, despite extra tutoring from his uncle.\nWartime activities and early adulthood.\nIn June 1934, Hrabal left school with a certificate that said he could be considered for a place at university on a technical course. He took private classes in Latin for a year, passing the state exam in the town of \u010cesk\u00fd Brod with an \"adequate\" grade on 3 October 1935. On 7 October, he registered at Charles University in Prague to study for a law degree. He graduated only in March 1946, as Czech universities were shut down in 1939 and remained so until the end of Nazi occupation. During the war, he worked as a railway labourer and dispatcher in Kostomlaty, near Nymburk, an experience reflected in one of his best-known works, \"Closely Observed Trains\" (). He worked variously as an insurance agent (1946\u201347), a travelling salesman (1947\u201349) and a manual labourer alongside the graphic artist Vladim\u00edr Boudn\u00edk in the Kladno steelworks (1949\u201352, and again briefly, 1953), an experience that inspired the \"total realism\" of texts such as \"Jarmilka\" that he was writing at the time. After a serious injury, he worked in a recycling mill in the Prague district of Libe\u0148 as a paper packer (1954\u201359), before working as a stagehand (1959\u201362) at the S. K. Neumann Theatre in Prague (today Divadlo pod Palmovkou).\nHrabal lived in the city from the late 1940s onward, for much of it (1950\u201373) at 24 Na Hr\u00e1zi ul. in Prague - Libe\u0148; the house was demolished in 1988. In 1956, Hrabal married Eli\u0161ka Plevov\u00e1 (known as \"Pipsi\" to Hrabal, and referred to by that name in some of his works), the 30-year-old daughter of Karel Pleva, procurator and manager of a wood factory in the South Moravian town of B\u0159eclav. In 1965, the couple bought a country cottage in Kersko, near Nymburk; the cottage became home to his numerous cats. Eli\u0161ka died in 1987.\nEarly writing career.\nHrabal began as a poet, producing a collection of lyrical poetry in 1948, entitled \"Ztracen\u00e1 uli\u010dka\". It was withdrawn from circulation when the communist regime was established. In the early 1950s, Hrabal was a member of an underground literary group run by Ji\u0159\u00ed Kol\u00e1\u0159, an artist, poet, critic and central figure in Czechoslovak culture. Another member of the group was the novelist Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd. Hrabal produced stories for the group, but did not seek publication.\nTwo stories by Hrabal (\"Hovory lid\u00ed\") appeared in 1956 as a supplement in the annual \"Report of the Association of Czech Bibliophiles\" (), which had a print-run of 250. Hrabal's first book was withdrawn a week before publication, in 1959. It was eventually published in 1963, as \"Pearls of the Deep\" (). In the same year, he became a professional writer. \"Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age\" () followed in 1964 and \"Closely Observed Trains\" () in 1965.\nBan from publication and later career.\nAfter the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Hrabal was banned from publishing. In 1970, two of his books \u2013 \"Dom\u00e1c\u00ed \u00fakoly\" and \"Poupata\" \u2013 were banned, after they had been printed and bound but before they were distributed. In the following years, he published several of his best known works in samizdat editions (including \"The Little Town Where Time Stood Still\" () and \"I Served the King of England\" ().\nIn 1975, Hrabal gave an interview to the publication \"Tvorba\" in which he made self-critical comments, which enabled some of his work to appear in print, albeit typically in heavily edited form. Hrabal's interlocutors were anonymous in the journal, but it was later discovered that the published interview was at least a third version of the text, and that the more explicitly ideological statements were inserted by editors Karel S\u00fds and Jarom\u00edr Pelc according to contemporary party doctrine. One such passage reads \"...as a Czech writer I am connected to the Czech people, with its Socialist past and future\".\nSome young dissidents were incensed by Hrabal's actions; poet Ivan \"Magor\" Jirous organised an event on Kampa Island at which his books were burned, and the singer Karel Kryl called him a \"whore\". However, his defenders point out that an edited version of a key text, \"Handbook for the Apprentice Palaverer\" (), was published alongside the interview, which ended the ban on publication and permitted his work once again to reach the broader Czechoslovak public. Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk, who had published his work in samizdat and would later continue to do so, defended him, saying that the interview demonstrated that Hrabal was a writer of such standing that he could not be suppressed and the regime had had to acknowledge him. Additionally, some of his writings continued to be printed only in samizdat and as underground editions abroad, including \"Too Loud a Solitude\" () which circulated in a number of samizdat editions until it was finally published officially in 1989. Hrabal avoided political engagement, and he was not a signatory of the Charter 77 civic initiative against the communist regime in 1977.\nHrabal's two best-known novels are \"Closely Observed Trains\" () (1965) and \"I Served the King of England\" (1971), both of which were made into movies by the Czech director Ji\u0159\u00ed Menzel (in 1966 and 2006, respectively). Hrabal worked closely with Menzel on the script for \"Closely Watched Trains\" which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. The two men became close friends and subsequently collaborated on other film projects, including the long-banned 1969 film \"Larks on a String\".\nHrabal was a noted raconteur, and much of his story-telling took place in a number of pubs including, most famously, U zlat\u00e9ho tygra (At the Golden Tiger) on Husova Street in Prague. He met the Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel, the American President Bill Clinton and the US ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright at U zlat\u00e9ho tygra on 11 January 1994.\nDeath.\nHrabal died in February 1997 after falling from a window on the fifth floor of Bulovka Hospital in Prague. Initially, there were reports that he fell while attempting to feed pigeons, though these were rejected by friends including his translator, Susanna Roth, who angrily dismissed the reports as a way of censoring Hrabal even in death. The story was later publicly renounced by professor Pavel Dungl, Bulovka's chief physician. First Roth and later Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mazal noted that suicide recurs as a theme throughout his work, and both Dungl and Mazal said that early in the morning on the day of his death, Hrabal mentioned to Dungl an \"invitation\" he received in his dream from a dead poet and painter, Karel Hlav\u00e1\u010dek, who was buried in a cemetery next to the hospital. Some years later, Professor Dungl said he had no doubts about Hrabal's death being a suicide. He was buried in the cemetery of Hradi\u0161tko near Kersko. According to his wishes, he was buried in an oak coffin marked with the inscription \"\" ('Poln\u00e1 Brewery'), the brewery where his mother and stepfather had met.\nStyle.\nHrabal wrote in an expressive, highly visual style. He affected the use of long sentences; his works \"Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age\" (1964) and \"Vita Nuova\" (1987) consist entirely of one single sentence. Political quandaries and the accompanying moral ambiguities are recurrent themes in his works. Many of Hrabal's characters are portrayed as \"wise fools\" \u2014 simpletons with occasional inadvertently profound thoughts \u2014 who are also given to coarse humour, lewdness, and a determination to survive and enjoy life despite harsh circumstances they found themselves in.\nMuch of the impact of Hrabal's writing derives from his juxtaposition of the beauty and cruelty found in everyday life. Vivid depictions of pain human beings casually inflict on animals (as in the scene where families of mice are caught in a paper compactor) symbolise the pervasiveness of cruelty among human beings. His characterisations also can be comic, giving his prose a baroque or mediaeval tinge. He is known for his \"comic, slightly surreal tales about poor workers, eccentrics, failures, and nonconformists\"; his early stories are about \"social misfits and happily disreputable people\".\nAlongside fellow satirists Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek, Karel \u010capek and Milan Kundera, Hrabal is often described as one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century. Author Ewa Mazierska compared his works to Ladislav Grosman's, in that his literary works typically contained a mixture of comedy and tragedy. His works have been translated into 27 languages.\nWorks.\nIn Czech.\nThe complete works edition of \"Hrabal spisy\" was published in the 1990s in 19 volumes by Pra\u017esk\u00e1 imaginace.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65131", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65131", "title": "Elysium", "text": "Afterlife in Greek mythology\nElysium ( or ), otherwise known as the Elysian Fields (, \"\u0112l\u00fdsion ped\u00edon\"), Elysian Plains or Elysian Realm, is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time and was maintained by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults. It was initially separated from the Greek underworld\u2014the realm of Hades. Only mortals related to the gods and other heroes could be admitted past the river Styx. Later, the conception of who could enter was expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic. They would remain at the Elysian Fields after death, to live a blessed and happy afterlife, and indulge in whatever they had enjoyed in life.\nThe Elysian Fields were, according to Homer, located on the western edge of the Earth by the stream of Oceanus. In the time of the Greek poet Hesiod, Elysium would also be known as the \"Fortunate Isles\", or the \"Isles (or Islands) of the Blessed\", located in the western ocean at the end of the earth (most probably the vicinity of Troy). The Isles of the Blessed would be reduced to a single island by the Theban poet Pindar, describing it as having shady parks, with residents indulging in athletic and musical pastimes.\nThe ruler of Elysium varies from author to author: Pindar and Hesiod name Cronus as the ruler, while the poet Homer in the \"Odyssey\" describes fair-haired Rhadamanthus dwelling there. \"The Isle of the Blessed\" is also featured in the 2nd-century comedic novel \"A True Story\" by Lucian of Samosata.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Elysium\" derives via Latin from the Ancient Greek \"\u0112lysion (pedion)\" \"Elysian (field)\", ultimately of unknown origin. Eustathius of Thessalonica associated the word \"Elysion\" () with \"alyousas\" (itself from the verb \"aly\u014d\", \"to be deeply stirred from joy\") or from \"alyt\u014ds\", synonymous of (, \"incorruptible\"), referring to souls' life in this place. Another suggestion is from the stem \"elyth-\", itself from (\"to come\").\nClassical literature.\nIn Homer's \"Odyssey\", Elysium is described as a paradise:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;to the Elysian plain...where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor heavy storm, nor ever rain, but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrill-blowing West Wind that they may give cooling to men.\u2014\u200a\nThe Greek poet Hesiod refers to the \"Isles of the Blest\" in his didactic poem \"Works and Days\". In his book \"Greek Religion\", Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun: \"Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea, and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep-swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year, far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them\u2014\u200a\nWriting in the 5th century BCE, Pindar's \"Odes\" describes the reward waiting for those living a righteous life:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The good receive a life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance. But in the presence of the honored gods, those who gladly kept their oaths enjoy a life without tears, while the others undergo a toil that is unbearable to look at. Those who have persevered three times, on either side, to keep their souls free from all wrongdoing, follow Zeus' road to the end, to the tower of Cronus, where ocean breezes blow around the island of the blessed, and flowers of gold are blazing, some from splendid trees on land, while water nurtures others. With these wreaths and garlands of flowers they entwine their hands according to the righteous counsels of Rhadamanthys, whom the great father, the husband of Rhea whose throne is above all others, keeps close beside him as his partner\u2014\u200a\nIn Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Aeneas, like Heracles and Odysseus before him, travels to the underworld. Virgil describes those who will travel to Elysium, and those who will travel to Tartarus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Night speeds by, And we, Aeneas, lose it in lamenting. Here comes the place where cleaves our way in twain. Thy road, the right, toward Pluto's dwelling goes, And leads us to Elysium. But the left Speeds sinful souls to doom, and is their path To Tartarus th' accurst.\u2014\u200a\nVirgil goes on to describe an encounter in Elysium between Aeneas and his father Anchises. Virgil's Elysium knows perpetual spring and shady groves, with its own sun and lit by its own stars: \"solemque suum, sua sidera norunt\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In no fix'd place the happy souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The path conducts you to your journey's end.\" This said, he led them up the mountain's brow, And shews them all the shining fields below. They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.\u2014\u200a\nIn the Greek historian Plutarch's \"Life of Sertorius\", Elysium is described as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These are two in number, separated by a very narrow strait; they are ten thousand furlongs distant from Africa, and are called the Islands of the Blest. They enjoy moderate rains at long intervals, and winds which for the most part are soft and precipitate dews, so that the islands not only have a rich soil which is excellent for plowing and planting, but also produce a natural fruit that is plentiful and wholesome enough to feed, without toil or trouble, a leisured folk. Moreover, an air that is salubrious, owing to the climate and the moderate changes in the seasons, prevails on the islands. For the north and east winds which blow out from our part of the world plunge into fathomless space, and, owing to the distance, dissipate themselves and lose their power before they reach the islands; while the south and west winds that envelope the islands sometimes bring in their train soft and intermittent showers, but for the most part cool them with moist breezes and gently nourish the soil. Therefore a firm belief has made its way, even to the Barbarians, that here is the Elysian Field and the abode of the blessed, of which Homer sang. \u2014\u200a\nDiodorus, in his first book, suggested that the Elysian fields which were much celebrated in ancient Greek poetry, corresponded to the beautiful plains in the neighborhood of Memphis which contained the tombs of that capital city of Egypt. He further intimated that the Greek prophet Orpheus composed his fables about the afterlife when he traveled to Egypt and saw the customs of the Egyptians regarding the rites of the dead.\nPost-classical literature.\nElysium as a pagan expression for paradise would eventually pass into usage by early Christian writers.\nIn Dante's epic \"The Divine Comedy\", Elysium is mentioned as the abode of the blessed in the lower world; mentioned in connection with the meeting of Aeneas with the shade of Anchises in the Elysian Fields.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With such affection did Anchises' shade reach out, if our greatest muse is owed belief, when in Elysium he knew his son.\u2014\u200a\nIn the Renaissance, the heroic population of the Elysian Fields tended to outshine its formerly dreary pagan reputation; the Elysian Fields borrowed some of the bright allure of paradise. In Paris, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es retain their name of the Elysian Fields, first applied in the late 16th century to a formerly rural outlier beyond the formal parterre gardens behind the royal French palace of the Tuileries.\nAfter the Renaissance, an even cheerier Elysium evolved for some poets. Sometimes it is imagined as a place where heroes have continued their interests from their lives. Others suppose it is a location filled with feasting, sport, song; Joy is the \"daughter of Elysium\" in Friedrich Schiller's \"Ode to Joy\". The poet Heinrich Heine explicitly parodied Schiller's sentiment in referring to the Jewish Sabbath food cholent as the \"daughter of Elysium\" in his poem \"Princess Shabbat\". \nChristian and classical attitudes to the afterlife are contrasted by Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\" saying, \"This word 'damnation' terrifies not me, For I confound hell in elysium.\"\nIn Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" when Viola says \"My brother he is in Elysium\", she and Elizabethan audiences understood this as Paradise. In Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" Papageno compares being in Elysium to winning his ideal woman: \"Des Lebens als Weiser mich freun, Und wie im Elysium sein.\" (\"Enjoy life as a wiseman, And feel like I'm in Elysium.\")\nMiguel de Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\" describes Dulcinea del Toboso as \"beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields\".\nIn John Ford's 1633 tragedy \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\" Giovanni seals his requited love for his sister Annabella, stating \"And I'de not change it for the best to come: A life of pleasure in Elyzium\".\nModern influence.\nThe term and concept of Elysium has had influence in modern popular culture; references to Elysium can be found in literature, art, film, and music. Examples include the New Orleans neighbourhood of Elysian Fields in Tennessee Williams' \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" as the d\u00e9class\u00e9 purgatory where Blanche Dubois lives with Stanley and Stella Kowalski. New Orleans' Elysian Fields also provides the second-act setting of Elmer Rice's \"The Adding Machine\" and the musical adaptation. In his poem \"Middlesex\", John Betjeman describes how a few hedges \"Keep alive our lost Elysium \u2013 rural Middlesex again\". In his poem \"An Old Haunt\", Hugh McFadden sets an Elysian scene in Dublin's St. Stephen's Green park \"Very slowly solitude slips round me in St. Stephen's Green. I rest: see pale salmon clouds blossom. I'm back in the fields of Elysium\". In \"Spring and All\", William Carlos Williams describes a dying woman's \"elysian slobber/upon/the folded handkerchief\".\nThe \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" in Paris is French for \"Elysian Fields\". The nearby \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace houses the President of the French Republic, for which reason \"l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e\" frequently appears as a metonym for the French presidency, similar to how \"the White House\" can metonymically refer to the American presidency, and \"No.10 Downing Street\" the British prime minister. \"Elysium\" and \"Elysian\" are also used for numerous other names all over the world - examples include Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey; Elysian Park, Los Angeles; Elysian Valley, Los Angeles, California; Elysian, Minnesota; and Elysian Fields, Texas.\nIn Siegfried Sassoon's \"Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man\", Sassoon writes \"The air was Elysian with early summer\". Its use in this context could be prolepsis, as the British countryside he is describing would become the burial ground of his dead comrades and heroes from World War I.\nElysium is referenced in the Schiller poem which inspired Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" (9th symphony, 4th movement) - notably in the excerpt used as the European Anthem. Elysium is also referenced in Mozart's opera \"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\" (\"The Magic Flute\"). It is in Act II when Papageno is feeling very melancholy because he does not have a sweetheart or wife and he is drunk singing the song \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\" (A Girl or a Wife).\nThe 2012 opera \"Dolls of New Albion\", written by Paul Shapera, and its sequels, reference Elysium as an afterlife somewhat accessible to the living, though the living in Elysium are hunted by horrid creatures who guard Elysium.\nBooks.\nIn David Gemmell's Parmennion series (\"Lion of Macedon\" and \"Dark Prince\") and his Troy trilogy, his characters refer to Elysium as the \"Hall of Heroes\".\nIn Masami Kurumada's mythologically themed \"Saint Seiya\" comic books, the Elysium is the setting of the final chapters of the \"Hades\" arc. In it, the Saints, the warriors of Athena's army, traverse the Underworld to defeat its ruler, the ruthless Hades and rescue their kidnapped goddess. The Saints discover that the only way to kill Hades is to destroy his true body, which has rested in Elysium since the ages of myth. The Saints then invade Elysium, which Kurumada depicts as described in Greek mythology, and carry on their mission after a difficult battle with the deity.\nIn the novel, \"This Ruler\", the story takes place at Elysium Hills High School. It is a reference to the mythology that surrounds American education and in particular high school. It also alludes to the teenagers, in the book, being Greek heroes.\nVideo games.\nElysium appears in the \"Fate of Atlantis\" DLC of the 2018 video game, \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey\". In the first part of this DLC, \"The Fields of Elysium\", the misthios travels to Elysium which is ruled by members of the precursor civilisation known as the Isu which were then worshipped as the gods of the Greek pantheon.\nIn 2021, the video game \"Honkai Impact 3rd\" added a roguelike gameplay mode called Elysian Realm. The player follows the character of Raiden Mei as she visits the Realm, known as the underworld where the memories of the last thirteen Flame-Chasers of the Previous Era rest.\nHonours.\nElysian Beach in Antarctica and Elysium Mons on Mars are named after the Elysian Fields, as is the aforementioned \"avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The intervening sequence of nucleotides between the initial sequence and the reverse complement can be any length including zero. For example, 5'---TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA---3' is an inverted repeat sequence. When the intervening length is zero, the composite sequence is a palindromic sequence.\nBoth inverted repeats and direct repeats constitute types of nucleotide sequences that occur repetitively. These repeated DNA sequences often range from a pair of nucleotides to a whole gene, while the proximity of the repeat sequences varies between widely dispersed and simple tandem arrays. The short tandem repeat sequences may exist as just a few copies in a small region to thousands of copies dispersed all over the genome of most eukaryotes. Repeat sequences with about 10\u2013100 base pairs are known as minisatellites, while shorter repeat sequences having mostly 2\u20134 base pairs are known as microsatellites. The most common repeats include the dinucleotide repeats, which have the bases AC on one DNA strand, and GT on the complementary strand. Some elements of the genome with unique sequences function as exons, introns and regulatory DNA. Though the most familiar loci of the repetitive sequences are the centromere and the telomere, a large portion of the repeated sequences in the genome are found among the noncoding DNA.\nInverted repeats have a number of important biological functions. They define the boundaries in transposons and indicate regions capable of self-complementary base pairing (regions within a single sequence which can base pair with each other). These properties play an important role in genome instability and contribute not only to cellular evolution and genetic diversity but also to mutation and disease. In order to study these effects in detail, a number of programs and databases have been developed to assist in discovery and annotation of inverted repeats in various genomes.\nUnderstanding inverted repeats.\nExample of an inverted repeat.\nBeginning with this initial sequence:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5'-TTACG-3'\nThe complement created by base pairing is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3'-AATGC-5'\nThe reverse complement is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5'-CGTAA-3'\nAnd, the inverted repeat sequence is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5'---TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA---3'\n\"nnnnnn\" represents any number of intervening nucleotides.\nVs. direct repeat.\nA direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream. There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.

The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.\n5\u00b4 TTACGTTACG 3\u00b4\n3\u00b4 AATGCAATGC 5\u00b4\nLinguistically, a typical tandem repeat is comparable to stuttering, or deliberately repeated words, as in \"bye-bye\".\nVs. palindrome.\nAn inverted repeat sequence with \"no\" intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream reverse complement is a palindrome. \u00a0 \u00a0 EXAMPLE:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Step 1: start with an inverted repeat: 5' TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA 3'\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Step 2: remove intervening nucleotides: 5' TTACGCGTAA 3'\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This resulting sequence is palindromic because it is the reverse complement of itself.\n5' TTACGCGTAA 3' \u00a0 test sequence (from Step 2 with intervening nucleotides removed)\n3' AATGCGCATT 5' \u00a0 complement of test sequence\n5' TTACGCGTAA 3' \u00a0 reverse complement \u00a0 \u00a0 This is the same as the test sequence above, and thus, it is a palindrome.\nBiological features and functionality.\nConditions that favor synthesis.\nThe diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from transposable elements, which are now understood to \"jump\" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies. Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome. The limited recombination of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as conservative site-specific recombination (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA. Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats. Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites. Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats.\nRegions where presence is obligatory.\nTerminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown. Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells. The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.\nIn the genome.\nTo a large extent, portions of nucleotide repeats are quite often observed as part of rare DNA combinations. The three main repeats which are largely found in particular DNA constructs include the closely precise homopurine-homopyrimidine inverted repeats, which is otherwise referred to as H palindromes, a common occurrence in triple helical H conformations that may comprise either the TAT or CGC nucleotide triads. The others could be described as long inverted repeats having the tendency to produce hairpins and cruciform, and finally direct tandem repeats, which commonly exist in structures described as slipped-loop, cruciform and left-handed Z-DNA.\nCommon in different organisms.\nPast studies suggest that repeats are a common feature of eukaryotes unlike the prokaryotes and archaea. Other reports suggest that irrespective of the comparative shortage of repeat elements in prokaryotic genomes, they nevertheless contain hundreds or even thousands of large repeats. Current genomic analysis seem to suggest the existence of a large excess of perfect inverted repeats in many prokaryotic genomes as compared to eukaryotic genomes.\nFor quantification and comparison of inverted repeats between several species, namely on archaea, see \nInverted repeats in pseudoknots.\nPseudoknots are common structural motifs found in RNA. They are formed by two nested stem-loops such that the stem of one structure is formed from the loop of the other. There are multiple folding topologies among pseudoknots and great variation in loop lengths, making them a structurally diverse group.\nInverted repeats are a key component of pseudoknots as can be seen in the illustration of a naturally occurring pseudoknot found in the human telomerase RNA component. Four different sets of inverted repeats are involved in this structure. Sets 1 and 2 are the stem of stem-loop A and are part of the loop for stem-loop B. Similarly, sets 3 and 4 are the stem for stem-loop B and are part of the loop for stem-loop A.\nPseudoknots play a number of different roles in biology. The telomerase pseudoknot in the illustration is critical to that enzyme's activity. The ribozyme for the \"hepatitis delta virus (HDV)\" folds into a double-pseudoknot structure and self-cleaves its circular genome to produce a single-genome-length RNA. Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed ribosomal frameshifting found in some viruses and required in the replication of retroviruses.\nIn riboswitches.\nInverted repeats play an important role in riboswitches, which are RNA regulatory elements that control the expression of genes that produce the mRNA, of which they are part. A simplified example of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch is shown in the illustration. This riboswitch exists in the mRNA transcript and has several stem-loop structures upstream from the coding region. However, only the key stem-loops are shown in the illustration, which has been greatly simplified to help show the role of the inverted repeats. There are multiple inverted repeats in this riboswitch as indicated in green (yellow background) and blue (orange background). \nIn the absence of FMN, the Anti-termination structure is the preferred conformation for the mRNA transcript. It is created by base-pairing of the inverted repeat region circled in red. When FMN is present, it may bind to the loop and prevent formation of the Anti-termination structure. This allows two different sets of inverted repeats to base-pair and form the Termination structure. The stem-loop on the 3' end is a transcriptional terminator because the sequence immediately following it is a string of uracils (U). If this stem-loop forms (due to the presence of FMN) as the growing RNA strand emerges from the RNA polymerase complex, it will create enough structural tension to cause the RNA strand to dissociate and thus terminate transcription. The dissociation occurs easily because the base-pairing between the U's in the RNA and the A's in the template strand are the weakest of all base-pairings. Thus, at higher concentration levels, FMN down-regulates its own transcription by increasing the formation of the termination structure.\nMutations and disease.\nInverted repeats are often described as \"hotspots\" of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability. Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genome of various organisms. This is exemplified in \"E. coli\", where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities. Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both RNA and DNA that can ultimately cause mutations and disease.\nThe illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two stem-loop structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.\nExtruded cruciforms can lead to frameshift mutations when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats in the form of a palindrome combined with regions of direct repeats on either side. During transcription, slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand can lead to both deletion and insertion mutations. Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound template strand forms a stem-loop that gets \"skipped\" by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.\nAntithrombin deficiency from a point mutation.\nImperfect inverted repeats can lead to mutations through intrastrand and interstrand switching. The antithrombin III gene's coding region is an example of an imperfect inverted repeat as shown in the figure on the right.\nThe stem-loop structure forms with a bump at the bottom because the G and T do not pair up. A strand switch event could result in the G (in the bump) being replaced by an A which removes the \"imperfection\" in the inverted repeat and provides a stronger stem-loop structure. However, the replacement also creates a point mutation converting the GCA codon to ACA. If the strand switch event is followed by a second round of DNA replication, the mutation may become fixed in the genome and lead to disease. Specifically, the missense mutation would lead to a defective gene and a deficiency in antithrombin which could result in the development of venous thromboembolism (blood clots within a vein).\nOsteogenesis imperfecta from a frameshift mutation.\nMutations in the collagen gene can lead to the disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is characterized by brittle bones. In the illustration, a stem-loop formed from an imperfect inverted repeat is mutated with a thymine (T) nucleotide insertion as a result of an inter- or intrastrand switch. The addition of the T creates a base-pairing \"match up\" with the adenine (A) that was previously a \"bump\" on the left side of the stem. While this addition makes the stem stronger and perfects the inverted repeat, it also creates a frameshift mutation in the nucleotide sequence which alters the reading frame and will result in an incorrect expression of the gene.\nPrograms and databases.\nThe following list provides information and external links to various programs and databases for inverted repeats:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is also known under her pen names Isak Dinesen, used in English-speaking countries; Tania Blixen, used in German-speaking countries; Osceola, and Pierre Andr\u00e9zel.\nBlixen is best known for \"Out of Africa\", an account of her life while in Kenya, and for one of her stories, \"Babette's Feast\". Both have been adapted as films and each won Academy Awards. She is also noted, particularly in Denmark and the United States, for her \"Seven Gothic Tales\". Among her later story collections are \"Winter's Tales\" (1942), \"Last Tales\" (1957), \"Anecdotes of Destiny\" (1958) and \"Ehrengard\" (1963). The latter was adapted to film in 2023 as the romantic comedy \".\"\nBlixen was considered several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but failed to win, according to Danish reports, because of the judges' concern with perceptions of favoritism towards Scandinavian writers.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nKaren Christentze Dinesen was born on 17 April 1885 in Rungstedlund, north of Copenhagen. Her father, Wilhelm Dinesen (1845\u20131895), was a writer, army officer, and politician. He served in the Second Schleswig War by Denmark against Prussia, and also joined the French army against Prussia. He later wrote about the Paris Commune. He was from a wealthy family of Jutland landowners closely connected to the monarchy, the established church and conservative politics. He was elected as Member of Parliament. \nHer mother, Ingeborg Westenholz (1856\u20131939), came from a wealthy Unitarian bourgeois merchant family of ship owners. Karen Dinesen was the second oldest in a family of three sisters and two brothers. Her younger brother, Thomas Dinesen, served in the First World War and earned the Victoria Cross. Karen was known to her friends as \"Tanne\".\nDinesen's early years were strongly influenced by her father's relaxed manner and his love of the outdoor life and hunting. He wrote throughout his life and his memoir, \"Boganis Jagtbreve\" (Letters from the Hunt) became a minor classic in Danish literature. \nWhile in his mid-20s, her father lived among the Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin (August 1872 to December 1873), and fathered a daughter. \nOn returning to Denmark, he suffered from syphilis which resulted in bouts of deep depression. He conceived a child out of wedlock with his maid Anna Rasmussen, and was devastated because he had promised his mother-in-law to remain faithful to his wife. He hanged himself on 28 March 1895 when Karen was nine years old.\nKaren Dinesen's life at Rungstedlund changed significantly after her father's death. From the age of 10 years, her life was dominated by her mother's Westenholz family. Unlike her brothers, who attended school, she was educated at home by her maternal grandmother and by her aunt, Mary B. Westenholz. They brought her up in the staunch Unitarian tradition. Her Aunt Bess had significant influence on Dinesen. They engaged in lively discussions and correspondence on women's rights and relationships between men and women.\nDuring her early years, she spent part of her time at her mother's family home, the Mattrup seat farm near Horsens. In later years she visited Folehaveg\u00e5rd, an estate near H\u00f8rsholm that had belonged to her father's family. Longing for the freedom she had enjoyed when her father was alive, she found some satisfaction in telling her younger sister Ellen hair-raising good-night stories, partly inspired by Danish folk tales and Icelandic sagas. In 1905, these led to her \"Grjotgard \u00c5lves\u00f8n og Aud\", in which her literary talent began to emerge. Around this time, she also published fiction in Danish periodicals under the pseudonym Osceola, the name of her father's dog, which she had often walked in her father's company.\nIn 1898, Dinesen and her two sisters spent a year in Switzerland, where she learned to speak French. In 1902, she attended Charlotte Sode's art school in Copenhagen before continuing her studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Viggo Johansen from 1903 to 1906. In her mid-twenties, she also visited Paris, London and Rome on study trips.\nDinesen spent many of her holidays with her paternal cousin's family, the Blixen-Fineckes, in Sk\u00e5ne in the south of Sweden and fell in love with her second cousin, Baron Hans von Blixen-Finecke. When Hans did not reciprocate, she entered a relationship with his twin brother, Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke. The couple announced their engagement on 23 December 1912, to the family's surprise.\nGiven the difficulties both were experiencing in settling in Denmark, the family suggested they should move abroad. Karen's uncle, Aage Westenholz (1859\u20131935) who had made a fortune in Siam, suggested they should go to Kenya to start a coffee farm. He and his sister Ingeborg (Karen's mother) invested 150,000 Danish krone in the venture. Early in 1913, Bror left for Kenya. He was followed by his fianc\u00e9e Karen in December 1913.\nLife in Kenya, 1913\u20131931.\nSoon after Dinesen arrived in Kenya, which at the time was part of British East Africa, she and Blixen were married in Mombasa on 14 January 1914. After her marriage, she became known as Baroness Blixen and she used the title until her then ex-husband remarried in 1929. Bror had attended agricultural college at Alnarp and then managed the Stjetneholm farm within the Nasbyholm estate. During her early years, Karen spent part of her time at her mother's family home, the Mattrup seat farm near Horsens. Karen and Bror planned to raise cattle on their farm, but eventually they became convinced that coffee would be more profitable. The Karen Coffee Company was established by their uncle, Aage Westerholz, who chose the name after his daughter Karen, Blixen's cousin, rather than to create an association with Karen Blixen. The couple soon established their first farm, Mbagathi, in the Great Lakes area.\nDuring First World War fighting between the Germans and the British in East Africa, Bror served in Lord Delamere's patrols along Kenya's border with German Tanganyika and Karen helped transport supplies. The war led to a shortage of workers and supplies. Nevertheless, in 1916, the Karen Coffee Company purchased a larger farm, Mbogani, near the Ngong Hills to the south\u2013west of Nairobi. The property covered of land: were used for a coffee plantation, were used by the natives for grazing, and of virgin forest were left untouched.\nThe land was not well-suited for coffee cultivation, given its high elevation. The couple hired local workers: most were Kikuyu who lived on the farmlands at the time of the couple's arrival, but there were also Wakamba, Kavirondo, Swahili, and Masai. Initially, Bror worked the farm, but it soon became evident that he had little interest in it and preferred to leave running the farm to Blixen while he went on safari. For the first time, English became the language she used daily. About the couple's early life in the African Great Lakes region, Blixen later wrote,Here at long last one was in a position not to give a damn for all conventions, here was a new kind of freedom which until then one had only found in dreams!\nBlixen and her husband were quite different in education and temperament, and Bror Blixen was unfaithful to his wife.\nAccording to Peter Capstick, \"It was not long after Blixen and his wife settled on their farm that he started womanizing.\" Capstick goes on to say, \"His forays into town and his often wild socializing at the Muthaiga Club, coupled with a legendary indiscipline when it came to money and honoring his debts, soon gave the charming Swede a notorious reputation.\"\nAs a consequence, she was diagnosed with syphilis according to her biographer Judith Thurman. She herself attributed her symptoms, in a letter to her brother Thomas, to syphilis acquired at 29 years old from her husband toward the end of their first year of marriage in 1915. However, later in life, her medical records do not support that diagnosis. She had been locally prescribed mercury and arsenic, a treatment for the disease in her time. It is now believed that some of her later symptoms were the result of heavy metal poisoning.\nAt her farm, she also used to take care of local sick persons, including those suffering from fever, variola, meningitis and typhus.\nShe returned to Denmark in June 1915 for treatment which proved successful. Although Blixen's illness was eventually cured (some uncertainty exists), it created medical anguish for years to come.\nOn 5 April 1918, Bror and Karen were introduced at the Muthaiga Club to\nthe English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (1887\u20131931). Soon afterwards he was assigned to military service in Egypt.\nBy 1919, the marriage had run into difficulties, causing her husband to request a divorce in 1920. Bror was dismissed as the farm manager by their uncle, Aage Westenholz, chair of the Karen Coffee Company, and Karen took over its management in 1921.\nOn his return to Kenya after the Armistice, Finch Hatton developed a close friendship with Karen and Bror. He left Africa again in 1920.\nAgainst her wishes, Bror and Karen separated in 1921.\nFinch Hatton often travelled back and forth between Africa and England, and visited Karen occasionally. He returned in 1922, investing in a land development company. After her separation from her husband she and Finch Hatton had developed a close friendship, which eventually became a long-term love affair. In a letter to her brother Thomas in 1924, she wrote: \"I believe that for all time and eternity I am bound to Denys, to love the ground he walks upon, to be happy beyond words when he is here, and to suffer worse than death many times when he leaves...\" But other letters in her collections show that the relationship was unstable, and that Karen's increasing dependence upon Finch Hatton, who was intensely independent, was an issue.\nKaren and Bror were officially divorced in 1925. Karen would go to Government House where she had befriended Joan Grigg, a nurse and the wife of Baron Edward Grigg, the installed Governor. Grigg would in time create a charity to create hospitals in Kenya.\nFinch Hatton moved into her house, made Blixen's farmhouse his home base between 1926 and 1931 and began leading safaris for wealthy sportsmen. Among his clients was Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII). On safari with his clients, he died in the crash of his de Havilland Gipsy Moth biplane in March 1931. \nShe wrote about their last meeting and subsequent parting.\n\"When he had started in his car for the aerodrome in Nairobi, and had turned down the drive, he came back to look for a volume of poems, that he had given to me and now wanted on his journey. He stood with one foot on the running-board of the car, and a finger in the book, reading out to me a poem we had been discussing.\n'Here are your grey geese,' he said.\n&lt;poem&gt;\"I saw grey geese flying over the flatlands\"\n\"Wild geese vibrant in the high air \u2013\"\n\"Unswerving from horizon to horizon\"\n\"With their soul stiffened out in their throats \u2013\"\n\"And the grey whiteness of them ribboning the enormous skies\"\n\"And the spokes of the sun over the crumpled hills.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThen he drove away for good, waving his arm to me.\"\nAt the same time, the failure of the coffee plantation, as a result of mismanagement, the high elevation of the farm, drought and the falling price of coffee caused by the worldwide economic depression, forced Blixen to abandon her estate. The family corporation sold the land to a residential developer, and Blixen returned to Denmark in August 1931 to live with her mother. In the Second World War, she helped Jews escape out of German-occupied Denmark. She remained in Rungstedlund for the rest of her life.\nLife as a writer.\nWhile still in Kenya, Blixen had written to her brother Thomas, \"I have begun to do what we brothers and sisters do when we don't know what else to resort to, I have started to write a book. ... I have been writing in English because I thought it would be more profitable.\" \nUpon returning to Denmark, aged 46, she continued writing in earnest. Though her first book, \"Seven Gothic Tales\", was completed in 1933, she had difficulty finding a publisher and used her brother's contacts with Dorothy Canfield to help. The book was published in the United States in 1934 under the pseudonym Isak Dinesen, though the publisher refused to give Blixen an advance and discouraged the use of a pseudonym. When it was chosen as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, sales skyrocketed. This first book, highly enigmatic and more metaphoric than Gothic, won wide recognition in the United States, and publication of the book in the United Kingdom and Denmark followed, though with difficulty. Unable to find a translator she was satisfied with, Blixen prepared the Danish versions herself, though they are not translations, but rather versions of the stories with differing details. Blixen's explanation for the difference was that she \"very much wanted it to be published in Danish as an original Danish book, and not in any \u2014 no matter how good \u2014 translation\". The Danish critics were not enthusiastic about the book and were annoyed, according to Blixen, that it had first been published abroad. Blixen never again published a book in English first. All her later books were either published first in Danish, or published simultaneously in Danish and English.\nHer second book, now the best known of her works, \"Out of Africa\", was published in 1937. Its success firmly established her reputation. Having learned from her previous experience, Blixen published the book first in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and then in the United States. Garnering another Book-of-the-Month Club choice, Blixen was assured of not only sales for this new work, but also renewed interest in \"Seven Gothic Tales\". She was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (a Danish prize for women in the arts or academic life) in 1939. The work brought attention from critics who were concerned not only with literary appraisal of the book, but also with defining Blixen's intentions and morality. Post-colonial criticism has linked her with contemporary British writers and in some cases branded her as just another morally bankrupt white European aristocrat. Danish scholars have not typically made judgments about her morality, perhaps understanding that while colonial prejudices and elements of racism are inherent in the work, given the context and era, nevertheless her position as an outsider, a Dane and a woman makes evaluating her more complex. Some critics, including Carolyn Martin Shaw and Raoul Granqvist, have judged her to be a racist and a white supremacist, while other critics, such as Abdul R. JanMohamed, have recognized both her romanticized colonial attitudes and her understanding of colonial problems, as well as her concern and respect for African nationalists.\nFive years after the publication of \"Out of Africa\", Blixen published a collection of short stories called \"Winter's Tales\" (1942; ). A departure from her previous Gothic works, the stories reflect the starkness of the times, occupation tinged with courage and pride, and hope for the future. The stories do not reflect resistance, but resilience, and explore the interdependence of opposites. She examines shame versus pride in \"The Heroine\", cowardice and courage in \"The Pearls\", master and servant in \"The Invincible Slave-Owners\", and life versus death as well as freedom versus imprisonment in \"Peter and Rosa\". In \"Sorrow-acre\", the best-known story of the collection, Blixen explores victimization and oppression. Because of the war, she had to be creative about getting the manuscript published, travelling to Stockholm and meeting with employees at both the American and British embassies. The Americans were unable to ship personal items, but the British embassy agreed, shipping the document to her publisher in the United States. Blixen did not receive further communication about \"Winter's Tales\" until after the war ended, when she received correspondence praising the stories from American troops who had read them in the \"Armed Services Editions\" during the conflict.\nBlixen worked on a novel she called \"Albondocani\" for many years, hoping to produce a volume in the style of \"Les Hommes de bonne volont\u00e9\" by Jules Romains, with interwoven stories across several volumes. The main character, Harun al-Rashid, was taken from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". She worked on several collections at once, categorizing them according to their themes and whether she thought they were mostly to make money or literary. She jumped between writing the collections of stories for \"Albondocani\" to \"Anecdotes of Destiny\" to \"New Gothic Tales\" and \"New Winter's Tales\". Almost all of Blixen's tales from the 1940s and 1950s follow a traditional style of storytelling, weaving Gothic themes such as incest and murder with myth and bewitchment as a means of exploring identity, morality and philosophy. Most also take place against the background of the 19th century or earlier periods. Concerning her deliberately old-fashioned style, Blixen mentioned in several interviews that she wanted to express a spirit that no longer existed in modern times, one of being rather than doing. Her narratives hover between skillfully crafted illusion and romanticism, with a keen knowledge of the preferred tastes of her audience. Blixen crafted her English tales in a more direct manner and her Danish tales in a 19th-century writing style which she felt would appeal more to them. Because she simultaneously worked on different collections, works written in this period were not published until almost a decade after they were originally written.\nDuring World War II, when Denmark was occupied by the Germans, Blixen started her only full-length novel, the introspective tale \"The Angelic Avengers\", under a French pseudonym, Pierre Andrezel, for the first and last time. Though it was written in Danish, she claimed that it was a translation of a French work written between the wars and denied being its author. The book was published in 1944 and nominated for a third Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Blixen initially did not want the book to be nominated, but eventually accepted the distinction. The horrors experienced by the young heroines have been interpreted as an allegory of Nazism, though Blixen also denied that interpretation, claiming instead that the novel was a distraction that had helped her to escape the feeling of being imprisoned by the war. In 1956, in an interview for \"The Paris Review\", she finally acknowledged that she was the author of the novel, saying that it was her \"illegitimate child\". Dorothy Canfield described \"The Angelic Avengers\" in her \"Book-of-the-Month Club News\" review as \"of superlatively fine literary quality, written with distinction in an exquisite style\".\nA collection of stories, \"Last Tales\" () was published in 1957, followed in 1958 by the collection \"Anecdotes of Destiny\" (). \"Last Tales\" included seven stories that Blixen had intended to be parts of \"Albondocani\". It also included sections called \"New Gothic Tales\" and \"New Winter's Tales\". Blixen's concept of the art of the story is perhaps most directly expressed in the stories \"The Blank Page\" and \"The Cardinal's First Tale\" in \"Last Tales\". These tales feature many innuendos, which Blixen employed to force her reader into participating in the creation of the story. She mixed obscure references with explicit observation. Her writing was not just a retelling of tales, however; it was a complex layering of clues and \"double entendres\" which force the reader to deduce Blixen's intent and draw conclusions. The story, for Blixen, was vital to expression: it gives a recitation of experience, and simultaneously a potential vision of the possible.\nBlixen planned for \"Anecdotes of Destiny\" to be a final part of the \"Last Tales\" in 1953, but as she prepared all the stories, she decided to publish \"Anecdotes\" as a separate volume. She wanted both books to appear simultaneously, but because of publication issues \"Anecdotes\" was delayed for another year. The most famous tale from \"Anecdotes\" is \"Babette's Feast\", about a chef who spends her entire 10,000-franc lottery prize to prepare a final spectacular gourmet meal. The story evaluates relationships and examines whether the austere but charitable life led by two sisters, in adherence to an ideal, is less true to faith than the passionate gift from the heart of their housekeeper. The story was reproduced in a film directed and written by Gabriel Axel, which was released in 1987, and won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1988.\nIn 1959, Blixen made her only trip to the United States. It was an extended trip spanning from January to April, and while the purpose was to complete a series of educational films and discussions for the Ford Foundation and Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Blixen intended to enjoy herself. She was the feature of a \"Life Magazine\" article in the edition of 19 January 1959 and attended two Broadway openings. Feted by the well-to-do of New York society, Blixen was invited to dine with socialites Babe Paley and Gloria Vanderbilt. She was photographed by Richard Avedon and Cecil Beaton, hosted by John Steinbeck at a cocktail party in her honor, and serenaded by Maria Callas. Nobel laureate Pearl Buck and poets E. E. Cummings and Marianne Moore came to see her, as well. When Blixen expressed a desire to meet Marilyn Monroe, the author Carson McCullers arranged a meeting with Monroe and her husband, the playwright Arthur Miller. Throughout the trip, Blixen played upon her crafted persona as a reclusive aristocrat and an outsider, but also that of an eccentric, who would eat only oysters and grapes, and drink only champagne. It was clear that she was ill, as it was reported that she was \"frail\" and \"weighed 63 pounds [28 kg]\" and she spent part of her time receiving \"intravenous infusions\".\nAfter returning to Denmark, Blixen resumed working, despite severe illness, finishing the African sketches \"Shadows on the Grass\" in 1960. The last of her works published during her lifetime, it was awarded her fifth selection as a Book-of-the-Month. A return-to-Africa memoir, \"Shadows\" explores the stereotypes and labels of Europeans and Africans, concluding that \"prejudices reveal more about the perceiver than the perceived\". The book consists of four tales: \"Shadows on the Grass\", which focuses on her Somali servant Farah; \"Faith is Revealed\", which relays the importance of symbolism; \"The Great Gesture\", which depicts medical issues in her community; and \"Echoes from the Hills\", which evaluates her loneliness after leaving Africa and the tireless vigil her staff from Africa kept on her former home for many years.\nIllness and death.\nWhen Blixen was diagnosed with syphilis in 1915, she was treated with mercury tablets. She took approximately 1 gram of mercury per day for almost a year according to some reports, while others show she did so for only a few months. She then spent time in Denmark for treatment and was given arsenic, which she continued to take in drop form as a treatment for the syphilis that she thought was the cause of her continued pain. Blixen had reported severe bouts of abdominal pain as early as 1921, while she was still in Kenya. Several well-known physicians and specialists of both internal medicine and neurology diagnosed her with third-stage chronic syphilis. Mogens Fog, who was Blixen's neurologist, thought that her gastric problems were attributable to syphilis, in spite of the fact that blood and spinal fluid tests were negative. By the time she left Africa, Blixen was suffering from anemia, had jaundice and had overused arsenic. As clumps of her hair had begun to fall out, she took to wearing hats and turbans.\nAlthough it was widely believed that syphilis continued to plague Blixen throughout her lifetime, extensive tests were unable to reveal evidence of syphilis in her system after 1925. Her writing prowess suggests that she did not suffer from the mental degeneration of late stages of syphilis. She did suffer a mild permanent loss of sensation in her legs that could be attributed to use of the arsenic-based anti-syphilis drug salvarsan. Her gastric pain was often called \"tropic dysentery\", though no stool analyses were reported in her medical records. Concerned about gaining weight, Blixen took strong laxatives \"during her whole adult life\", which after years of misuse affected her digestive system. She also was a heavy smoker, which when combined with her minimal food intake led to her developing a peptic ulcer.\nIn 1946 and 1955 the neurosurgeon Eduard Busch performed a lumbar sympathectomy on Blixen's spinal cord, but her pain returned. In 1956 when she was diagnosed with the stomach ulcer, Professor Torben Knudtzon performed surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital, but by that time, she was in her seventies, and already in poor health. Over the next several years, she continued to suffer from dehydration and a lack of nutrition, which rendered her weak and led to four additional hospitalizations at the Central Hospital in Hiller\u00f8d. Late in her treatment, she finally confessed her use of laxatives to her doctors. The source of her abdominal problems remains unknown. A 1995 report published by the Danish physician, Kaare Weismann, concluded that the cause of her chronic pain and ailment was likely heavy metal poisoning. A 2002 report by S\u00f8gaard in the \"Danish Medical History Journal\" (\"\") attributed her misdiagnosis to a failure to communicate on both the part of Blixen and her doctors. As she didn't tell them about her laxative misuse, and the physicians believed they were fighting syphilis, each missed the opportunity for effective treatment. Both Erik M\u00fcnster and Weismann also recognized the lapse in communication, as had Blixen been treated with penicillin, which was available by the 1950s, syphilis would have been able to be ruled out.\nIt is also known that Blixen suffered from panic attacks, because she described them in her book \"Out of Africa\". In her analysis of Blixen's medical history, Donelson points out that Blixen wondered if her pain was psychosomatic and states that during Blixen's lifetime her illnesses were rumored to be fabricated. Her publisher indicated that Blixen's syphilis was a myth in private, but publicly, Blixen blamed syphilis for her chronic health issues. Donelson concluded: \"Whatever her belief about her illness, the disease suited the artist's design for creating her own personal legend.\"\nUnable to eat, Blixen died on 7 September 1962 at Rungstedlund, her family's estate, at the age of 77, apparently of malnutrition. Others attribute her weight loss and eventual death to anorexia nervosa.\nPosthumous works.\nAmong Blixen's posthumously published works are: \"Ehrengard\" (1962), \"Carnival: Entertainments and Posthumous Tales (1977)\", \"Daguerreotypes, and Other Essays\" (1979) and \"Letters from Africa, 1914\u201331\" (1981). In the late 1960s, Orson Welles planned an anthology of Dinesen's films, in which he intended to release \"The Heroine\", \"The Deluge at Norderney\", \"A Country Tale\", and \"Full Moon\". After a day of shooting film in Budapest on \"The Heroine\", the project was canceled because his financier went bankrupt. \"The Immortal Story\" was adapted to film in 1968 by Welles and released simultaneously on French television and in theaters. Welles later attempted to film \"The Dreamers\", but only a few scenes were ever completed. In 1982, Emidio Greco directed an Italian film, \"Ehrengard\", based upon Blixen's work of the same name, which was not released until 2002 due to financial complications. A second film adaptation, \"\", was released in 2023, with creative input by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\nLegacy.\nAwards and honors.\nFor her literary accomplishments, Blixen was awarded the Danish Holberg Medal in 1949, the Ingenio et Arti medal in 1952, granted the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Scholarship of the Danish Writers Association in 1955 and received the Henrik Pontoppidan Memorial Foundation Grant in 1959. Karen Blixen was proposed by the Swedish Academy's Nobel committee to be awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Literature, but committee member Eyvind Johnson (who himself would accept the prize fifteen years later) opposed a prize to Blixen arguing that Scandinavians were overrepresentated among Nobel prize laureates in literature, and the members of the Academy surprisingly voted for a prize to the Italian poet Salvatore Quasimodo instead. Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund, members of the Swedish Academy, have both described this decision as \"a mistake\", with Espmark arguing that Blixen is likely to have been better accepted internationally than other Scandinavian Nobel laureates and that the Academy missed an opportunity to correct the underrepresention of female laureates. When Hemingway won the prize in 1954, he stated that Bernard Berenson, Carl Sandburg and Blixen deserved the prize more than he did. Although never awarded the prize, she finished in third place behind Graham Greene in 1961, the year Ivo Andri\u0107 was awarded the prize. In 2012, the 1962 Nobel records were opened after being sealed for 50 years, as is customary, and it was revealed that Blixen was among a shortlist of authors considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (the eventual winner), Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell, and Jean Anouilh. Blixen became ineligible after dying in September of that year.\nBlixen's former secretary and house manager, Clara Svendsen wrote a book, \"Notes about Karen Blixen\" () in 1974, which told of the transformation of the young woman who moved to Africa into the sophisticated writer. Giving personal anecdotes about Blixen's life, Svendsen focused on the private woman behind her public image. Blixen's great-nephew, Anders Westenholz, an accomplished writer himself, wrote two books about her and her works: \"Kraftens horn: myte og virkelighed i Karen Blixens liv\" (1982) (translated into English as \"The Power of Aries: myth and reality in Karen Blixen's life\" and republished in 1987) and \"Den glemte abe: mand og kvinde hos Karen Blixen\" (1985) (The Forgotten Ape: man and woman in Karen Blixen).\nKaren Blixen's portrait was featured on the front of the Danish 50-krone banknote, 1997 series, from 7 May 1999 to 25 August 2005. She also featured on Danish postage stamps that were issued in 1980 and 1996. The Asteroid 3318 Blixen was named in her honor on her 100th birthday.\nOn 17 April 2010, Google celebrated her 125th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nThe Spanish movie \"Karen\", released in 2021, is a minimalist film about her days in Africa. Directed by Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Sanz, Blixen is played by Christina Rosenvinge.\nRungstedlund Museum.\nBlixen lived most of her life at the family estate Rungstedlund, which was acquired by her father in 1879. The property is located in Rungsted, north of Copenhagen, Denmark's capital. The oldest parts of the estate date to 1680, and it had been operated as both an inn and a farm. Most of Blixen's writing was done in Ewald's Room, named after author Johannes Ewald.\nIn the 1940s, Blixen contemplated selling the estate due to the costs of running it, but the house became a haven for a group of young intellectuals, including Thorkild Bj\u00f8rnvig, Frank J\u00e6ger, Erling Schroeder, among others, who found the house as intriguing as its occupant. They began using the property as a literary salon, which continued to be used by artists until 1991. Bj\u00f8rnvig, who edited the journal \"Heretica\" also developed a close friendship with Blixen. The house was repaired and restored between 1958 and 1960 with a portion of the estate set aside as a bird sanctuary. After its restoration, the property was deeded to the Danish Literary Academy and became managed by the Rungstedlund Foundation, founded by Blixen and her siblings. It was opened to the public as a museum in 1991. In 2013 The Karen Blixen Museum joined the Nordic museum portal.\nKaren Blixen Museum, Nairobi.\nWhen Blixen returned to Denmark in 1931, she sold her property to a developer, Remi Martin, who divided the land into parcels. The Nairobi suburb that emerged on the land where Blixen farmed coffee is now named Karen. Blixen herself declared in her later writings that \"the residential district of Karen\" was \"named after me\". The family corporation that owned Blixen's farm was incorporated as the \"Karen Coffee Company\" and the house she lived in was built by the chairman of the board, Aage Westenholz, her uncle. Though Westenholz named the coffee company after his own daughter Karen and not Blixen, the developer of the suburb named the district after its famous author/farmer rather than the name of her company.\nChanging hands several times, the original farmhouse occupied by Blixen was purchased by the Danish government and given to the Kenyan government in 1964 as an independence gift. The government established a college of nutrition on the site and then when the film \"Out of Africa\" was released in 1985, the college was acquired by the National Museums of Kenya. A year later, the Karen Blixen Museum was opened and features many of Blixen's furnishings, which were reacquired from Lady McMillan, who had purchased them when Blixen left Africa. The museum house has been judged a significant cultural landmark, not only for its association with Blixen, but as a cultural representative of Kenya's European settlement, as well as a significant architectural style\u2014the late 19th-century bungalow.\nWorks.\nA considerable proportion of the Karen Blixen archive at the Royal Danish Library consists of the unpublished poems, plays and short stories Karen Dinesen wrote before she married and left for Africa. In her teens and early 20s, she probably spent much of her spare time practising the art of writing. It was only when she was 22 that she decided to publish some of her short stories in literary journals, adopting the pen name Osceola.\nSome of these works were published posthumously, including tales previously removed from earlier collections and essays she wrote for various occasions.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jensen", "text": "Danish author (1873\u20131950)\nJohannes Vilhelm Jensen (; 20 January 1873 \u2013 25 November 1950) was a Danish author, known as one of the great Danish writers of the first half of 20th century. He was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style\". One of his sisters, Thit Jensen, was also a well-known writer and a very vocal, and occasionally controversial, early feminist.\nJensen began his literary career by writing pulp fiction, but he made the move into more serious literature by the late 1890s. His early novels depict his disillusionment with large, modern cities.His historical novel \"The Fall of the King\" (1933) focuses on King Christian II. It was reportedly an \"indictment of Danish indecision and lack of vitality, which Jensen saw as a national disease.\"\nEarly years.\nHe was born in Fars\u00f8, a village in North Jutland, Denmark, as the son of a veterinary surgeon and he grew up in a rural environment. While studying medicine at the University of Copenhagen he worked as a writer to fund his studies. After three years of studying he chose to change careers and devote himself fully to literature.\nLiterary works.\nJensen began his career writing pulp fiction, but made the move into more serious literature with the publication of \"Danskere\" (1896, \"Danishmen\"), soon followed by \"Einar Elkj\u00e6r\" (1898). Both early novels depict disillusionment with large, modern cities. From there, Jensen went on to write Himmerland Stories (1898\u20131910), comprising a series of tales set in the part of Denmark where he was born. His 1904 short story \"Ane og Koen\" (\"Anne and the Cow\") went on to be translated into English by incarcerated author and translator Victor Folke Nelson in 1928.\nDuring 1900 and 1901 Jensen wrote his first most significant novel, \"Kongens Fald\" (translated into English as \"The Fall of the King\" in 1933), a modern historical novel centered on King Christian II. Literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith said it is an \"indictment of Danish indecision and lack of vitality, which Jensen saw as a national disease. Apart from this aspect of it, it is a penetrating study of sixteenth-century people.\"\nIn 1906 Jensen published his first collection of poetry, \"Digte 1906\" (i.e. \"Poems 1906\"), would give rise to his reputation as an early leading Modernist in Denmark. \nIn addition to his novels, short stories, and poetry, Jensen also wrote a few plays, and many essays, notable for their grand narratives, futurism, jingoism, and interest in anthropology and the philosophy of evolution. The latter culminated in a cycle of six novels, \"Den lange rejse\" (1908\u201322), translated into English as \"The Long Journey\" (1908\u20131922), later published in a two-volume edition in 1938, sometimes called an \"evolutionary bible\" of mankind. In the short autobiographical account of his career which he wrote on receiving the Nobel Prize, Jensen said he was motivated to \"introduce the philosophy of evolution into the sphere of literature ... I was prompted to do this because of the misinterpretation and distortion of Darwinism\" by the Nazis.\nLike his compatriot Hans Christian Andersen, he travelled extensively; a trip to the United States inspired a poem of his, \"Paa Memphis Station\" [At the train station, Memphis, Tennessee], which is well known in Denmark. Walt Whitman was among the writers who influenced Jensen. Jensen later became an atheist.\nLate career.\nJensen's most popular literary works were all completed before 1920, a year which also marks his initiation of the 'Museumcentre Aars' in the town of Aars in Himmerland. After this he mostly concentrated on ambitious biological and zoological studies in an effort to create an ethical system based upon Darwinian ideas. He also hoped to renew classical poetry.\nBy his own account, Jensen often wrote for newspapers, though he never employed by one. \nNobel Prize in Literature.\nIn 1944 Johannes V. Jensen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style.\" At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1945 Anders \u00d6sterling, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This child of the dry and windy moors of Jutland has, almost out of spite, astonished his contemporaries by a remarkably prolific production. He could well be considered one of the most fertile Scandinavian writers. He has constructed a vast and imposing literary \u0153uvre, comprising the most diverse genres: epic and lyric, imaginative and realistic works, as well as historical and philosophical essays, not to mention his scientific excursions in all directions.\nJensen had been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 53 times, the first time in 1925. He was nominated every year between 1931 and 1944.\nLegacy.\nJensen was a controversial figure in Danish cultural life. He was a reckless polemicist and his dubious racial theories have damaged his reputation. However, he never showed any obvious fascist leanings.\nToday Jensen is still considered the father of Danish modernism, particularly in the area of modern poetry with his introduction of the prose poem and his use of a direct and straightforward language. His direct influence was felt as late as the 1960s. Without being a Danish answer to Kipling, Hamsun or Sandburg, he bears comparison to all three authors. He combines the outlook of the regional writer with the view of the modern academic and scientific observer.\nHe was famous for experimenting with the form of his writing, amongst other things. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy and sad face. It was in the 1900s that the design evolved from a basic eye and mouth design into a more recognizable design.\nIn 1999, \"The Fall of the King\" (1901) was acclaimed as the best Danish novel of the 20th century by the newspapers \"Politiken\" and \"Berlingske Tidende\", independently of each other.\nJohannes V. Jensen Land in Northern Greenland was named in his honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the eldest brother of naturalist and writer Gerald Durrell.\nBorn in India to British parents, he was sent to England at the age of 11 for his education. He did not like formal education, and started writing poetry at the age of 15. His first book was published in 1935, when he was 23 years old. In March 1935 he and his mother and younger siblings moved to the island of Corfu. Durrell spent many years thereafter living around the world.\nHis most famous work is \"The Alexandria Quartet\", published between 1957 and 1960. The best-known novel in the series is the first, \"Justine\". Beginning in 1974, Durrell published \"The Avignon Quintet\", using many of the same techniques. The first of these novels, \"Monsieur, or the Prince of Darkness\", won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1974. The middle novel, \"Constance, or Solitary Practices\", was nominated for the 1982 Booker Prize. In the 20th century, Durrell was a bestselling author and one of the most celebrated writers in England.\nDurrell supported his writing by working for many years in the Foreign Service of the British government. His sojourns in various places during and after World War II (such as his time in Alexandria, Egypt) inspired much of his work. He married four times, and had a daughter with each of his first two wives.\nEarly years in India and schooling in England.\nDurrell was born in Jalandhar, British India, the eldest son of Indian-born British colonials Louisa (who was Anglo-Irish) and Lawrence Samuel Durrell, an engineer of English ancestry. His first school was St. Joseph's School, North Point, Darjeeling. He had three younger siblings \u2014 two brothers and a sister \u2014 naturalist Gerald Durrell, Leslie Durrell and author Margaret Durrell.\nLike many other children of the British Raj, at the age of 11, Durrell was sent to England for schooling, where he briefly attended St Olave's Grammar School before being sent to St Edmund's School Canterbury. His formal education was unsuccessful, and he failed his university entrance examinations. He began to write poetry seriously at the age of 15. His first collection, \"Quaint Fragments\", was published in 1931, when he was 19 years old.\nDurrell's father died of a brain haemorrhage in 1928, at the age of 43. His mother brought the family to England, and in 1932, she, Durrell, and his younger siblings settled in Bournemouth. There, he and his younger brother Gerald became friends with Alan G. Thomas, who had a bookstore and would become an antiquarian. Durrell had a short spell working for an estate agent in Leytonstone (East London).\nAdult life and prose writings.\nFirst marriage and Durrell's move to Corfu.\nOn 22 January 1935, Durrell married art student Nancy Isobel Myers (1912\u20131983), with whom he briefly ran a photographic studio in London. It was the first of his four marriages. Durrell was always unhappy in England, and in March of that year he persuaded his new wife, and his mother and younger siblings, to move to the Greek island of Corfu. There they could live more economically and escape both the English weather, and what Durrell considered the stultifying English culture, which he described as \"the English death\".\nThat same year Durrell's first novel, \"Pied Piper of Lovers\", was published by Cassell. Around this time he chanced upon a copy of Henry Miller's 1934 novel \"Tropic of Cancer\". After reading it, he wrote to Miller, expressing intense admiration for his novel. Durrell's letter sparked an enduring friendship and mutually critical relationship that spanned 45 years. Durrell's next novel, \"Panic Spring\", was strongly influenced by Miller's work, while his 1938 novel \"The Black Book\" abounded with \"four-letter words... grotesques... [and] its mood equally as apocalyptic\" as \"Tropic\".\nIn Corfu, Lawrence and Nancy lived together in bohemian style. For the first few months, the couple lived with the rest of the Durrell family in the Villa Anemoyanni at Kontokali. In early 1936, Durrell and Nancy moved to the White House, a fisherman's cottage on the shore of Corfu's northeastern coast at Kalami, then a tiny fishing village. The Durrell family's friend Theodore Stephanides, a Greek doctor, scientist and poet, was a frequent guest, and Miller stayed at the White House in 1939.\nDurrell fictionalised this period of his sojourn on Corfu in the lyrical novel \"Prospero's Cell\". His younger brother Gerald Durrell, who became a naturalist, published his own version in his memoir \"My Family and Other Animals\" (1954) and in the following two books of Gerald's so-called \"Corfu Trilogy\", published in 1969 and 1978. Gerald describes Lawrence as living permanently with his mother and siblings \u2014 his wife Nancy is not mentioned at all. Lawrence, in his turn, refers only briefly to his brother Leslie, and he does not mention that his mother and two other siblings were also living on Corfu in those years. The accounts cover a few of the same topics; for example, both Gerald and Lawrence describe the roles played in their lives by the Corfiot taxi driver Spyros Halikiopoulos and Theodore Stephanides. In Corfu, Lawrence became friends with Marie Aspioti, with whom he cooperated in the publication of \"Lear's Corfu\".\nPre WW2: In Paris with Miller and Nin.\nIn August 1937, Lawrence and Nancy travelled to the Villa Seurat in Paris, France, to meet Henry Miller and Ana\u00efs Nin. Together with Alfred Perles, Nin, Miller, and Durrell \"began a collaboration aimed at founding their own literary movement. Their projects included \"The Shame of the Morning\" and the \"Booster\", a country club house organ that the Villa Seurat group appropriated \"for their own artistic ... ends.\" They also started the Villa Seurat Series in order to publish Durrell's \"Black Book\", Miller's \"Max and the White Phagocytes\", and Nin's \"Winter of Artifice\". Jack Kahane of the Obelisk Press served as publisher.\nDurrell said that he had three literary uncles: T. S. Eliot, the Greek poet George Seferis, and Miller. He first read Miller after finding a copy of \"Tropic of Cancer\" that had been left behind in a public lavatory. He said the book shook him \"from stem to stern\".\nDurrell's first novel of note, \"The Black Book: An Agon\", was strongly influenced by Miller; it was published in Paris in 1938. The mildly pornographic work was not published in Great Britain until 1973. In the story, the main character Lawrence Lucifer struggles to escape the spiritual sterility of dying England and finds Greece to be a warm and fertile environment.\nWorld War Two.\nBreakdown of marriage.\nAt the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, Durrell's mother and siblings returned to England, while Nancy and he remained on Corfu. In 1940, they had a daughter, Penelope Berengaria. After the fall of Greece, Lawrence and Nancy escaped from Kalamata, where they had been teaching, via Crete to Alexandria, Egypt. The marriage was already under strain and they separated in 1942. Nancy took the baby Penelope with her to Jerusalem.\nDuring his years on Corfu, Durrell had made notes for a book about the island. He did not write it fully until he was in Egypt towards the end of the war. In the book \"Prospero's Cell\", Durrell described Corfu as \"this brilliant little speck of an island in the Ionian\" with waters \"like the heartbeat of the world itself\".\nPress attach\u00e9 in Egypt and Rhodes; second marriage.\nDuring World War Two, Durrell served as a press attach\u00e9 to the British embassies, first in Cairo and then Alexandria. While in Alexandria he met Eve (Yvette) Cohen (1918\u20132004), a Jewish Alexandrian. She inspired his character Justine in \"The Alexandria Quartet\". In 1947, after his divorce from Nancy was completed, Durrell married Eve Cohen, with whom he had been living since 1942. The couple's daughter, Sappho Jane, was born in Oxfordshire in 1951, and named after the ancient Greek poet Sappho.\nIn May 1945, Durrell obtained a posting to Rhodes, the largest of the Dodecanese islands that Italy had taken over from the disintegrating Ottoman Empire in 1912 during the Balkan Wars. With the Italian surrender to the Allies in 1943, German forces took over most of the islands and held onto them as besieged fortresses until the war's end. Mainland Greece was at that time locked in civil war. A temporary British military government was established in the Dodecanese at war's end, pending sovereignty being transferred to Greece in 1947, as part of war reparations from Italy. Durrell set up house with Eve in the little gatekeeper's lodge of an old Turkish cemetery, just across the road from the building used by the British Administration. (Today this is the Casino in Rhodes' new town.) His co-habitation with Eve Cohen could be discreetly ignored by his employer, while the couple gained from staying within the perimeter security zone of the main building. His book \"Reflections on a Marine Venus\" was inspired by this period and was a lyrical celebration of the island. It avoids more than a passing mention of the troubled war times.\nBritish Council work in C\u00f3rdoba and Belgrade; teaching in Cyprus.\nIn 1947, Durrell was appointed director of the British Council Institute in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. He served there for eighteen months, giving lectures on cultural topics. He returned to London with Eve in the summer of 1948, around the time that Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia broke ties with Stalin's Cominform. Durrell was posted by the British Council to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and served there until 1952. This sojourn gave him material for his novel \"White Eagles over Serbia\" (1957).\nIn 1952, Eve had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised in England. Durrell moved to Cyprus with their daughter Sappho Jane, buying a house and taking a position teaching English literature at the Pancyprian Gymnasium to support his writing. He next worked in public relations for the British government during the local agitation for union with Greece. He wrote about his time in Cyprus in \"Bitter Lemons\", which won the Duff Cooper Prize in 1957. In 1954, he was selected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Durrell left Cyprus in August 1956. Political agitation on the island and his British government position resulted in his becoming a target for assassination attempts.\n\"Justine\" and \"The Alexandria Quartet\".\nIn 1957, Durrell published \"Justine\", the first novel of what was to become his most famous work, \"The Alexandria Quartet\". \"Justine\", \"Balthazar\" (1958), \"Mountolive\" (1958), and \"Clea\" (1960), deal with events before and during the Second World War in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The first three books tell essentially the same story and series of events, but from the varying perspectives of different characters. Durrell described this technique in his introductory note in \"Balthazar\" as \"relativistic\". Only in the final novel, \"Clea\", does the story advance in time and reach a conclusion. Critics praised the \"Quartet\" for its richness of style, the variety and vividness of its characters, its movement between the personal and the political, and its locations in and around the ancient Egyptian city which Durrell portrays as the chief protagonist: \"The city which used us as its flora\u2014precipitated in us conflicts which were hers and which we mistook for our own: beloved Alexandria!\" \"The Times Literary Supplement\" review of the \"Quartet\" stated: \"If ever a work bore an instantly recognizable signature on every sentence, this is it.\"\nIn 2012, when the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been nominated for the 1961 Nobel Prize in Literature, but did not make the final list. In 1962, however, he did receive serious consideration, along with Robert Graves, Jean Anouilh, and Karen Blixen, but ultimately lost to John Steinbeck. The academy decided that \"Durrell was not to be given preference this year\"\u2014probably because \"they did not think that \"The Alexandria Quartet\" was enough, so they decided to keep him under observation for the future.\" However, he was never nominated again. They also noted that he \"gives a dubious aftertaste \u2026 because of [his] monomaniacal preoccupation with erotic complications.\"\nTwo further marriages and settling in Languedoc.\nIn 1955 Durrell separated from Eve Cohen. He married again in 1961, to Claude-Marie Vincendon, whom he met on Cyprus. She was a Jewish woman born in Alexandria. Durrell was devastated when Claude-Marie died of cancer in 1967. He married for the fourth and last time in 1973, to Ghislaine de Boysson, a French woman. They divorced in 1979.\nIn the spring of 1960, Durrell was hired to rewrite the script for the 1963 film \"Cleopatra\". The production company had also proposed a film of \"Justine\" which would eventually appear in 1969.\nDurrell settled in Sommi\u00e8res, a small village in Languedoc, France, where he purchased a large house on the edge of the village. The house was situated in extensive grounds surrounded by a wall. Here he wrote \"The Revolt of Aphrodite\", comprising \"Tunc\" (1968) and \"Nunquam\" (1970). He also completed \"The Avignon Quintet\", published from 1974 to 1985, which used many of the same motifs and styles found in his metafictional \"Alexandria Quartet\". Although the related works are frequently described as a quintet, Durrell referred to it as a \"quincunx\".\nThe opening novel, \"Monsieur, or the Prince of Darkness\", received the 1974 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. That year, Durrell was living in the United States and serving as the Andrew Mellon Visiting professor of humanities at the California Institute of Technology.\nThe middle novel of the quincunx, \"Constance, or Solitary Practices\" (1981), which portrays France in the 1940s under the German occupation, was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1982. \nOther works from this period are \"Sicilian Carousel\", a non-fiction celebration of that island, \"The Greek Islands\", and \"Caesar's Vast Ghost\", which is set in and chiefly about the region of Provence, France.\nLater years, literary influences, attitudes and reputation.\nA longtime smoker, Durrell suffered from emphysema for many years. He died of a stroke at his house in Sommi\u00e8res in November 1990, and was buried in the churchyard of the Chapelle St-Julien de Montredon in Sommi\u00e8res.\nHe was predeceased by his younger daughter, Sappho Jane, who took her own life in 1985 at the age of 33. After Durrell's death, it emerged that Sappho's diaries included allusions to alleged sexual abuse by her father.\nDurrell's government service and his attitudes.\nDurrell worked for several years in the service of the Foreign Office. He was senior press officer to the British embassies in Athens and Cairo, press attach\u00e9 in Alexandria and Belgrade, and director of the British Institutes in Kalamata, Greece, and C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. He was also director of Public Relations in the Dodecanese Islands and on Cyprus. He later refused an honour as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, because he felt his \"conservative, reactionary and right-wing\" political views might be a cause for embarrassment. Durrell's works of humour, \"Esprit de Corps\" and \"Stiff Upper Lip\", are about life in the diplomatic corps, particularly in Serbia. He claimed to have disliked both Egypt and Argentina, although not nearly so much as he disliked Yugoslavia.\nDurrell's poetry.\nDurrell's poetry has been overshadowed by his novels, but Peter Porter, in his introduction to a \"Selected Poems\", calls Durrell \"One of the best [poets] of the past hundred years. And one of the most enjoyable.\" Porter describes Durrell's poetry: \"Always beautiful as sound and syntax. Its innovation lies in its refusal to be more high-minded than the things it records, together with its handling of the whole lexicon of language.\"\nBritish citizenship.\nFor much of his life, Durrell resisted being identified solely as British, or as only affiliated with Britain. He preferred to be considered cosmopolitan. Since his death, there have been claims that Durrell never had British citizenship, but he was originally classified as a British citizen as he was born to British colonial parents living in India under the British Raj.\nIn 1966 Durrell and many other former and present British residents became classified as non-patrial, as a result of an amendment to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act. The law was covertly intended to reduce migration from India, Pakistan, and the West Indies, but Durrell was also penalized by it and refused citizenship. He had not been told that he needed to \"register as a British citizen in 1962 under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962\".\nAs \"The Guardian\" reported in 2002, Durrell in 1966 was \"one of the best selling, most celebrated English novelists of the late 20th century\" and \"at the height of his fame\". Denied the normal citizenship right to enter or settle in Britain, Durrell had to apply for a visa for each entry. Diplomats were outraged and embarrassed at these events. \"Sir Patrick Reilly, the ambassador in Paris, was so incensed that he wrote to his Foreign Office superiors: 'I venture to suggest it might be wise to ensure that ministers, both in the Foreign Office and the Home Office, are aware that one of our greatest living writers in the English language is being debarred from the citizenship of the United Kingdom to which he is entitled.'\"\nLegacy.\nAfter Durrell's death, his lifelong friend Alan G. Thomas donated a collection of books and periodicals associated with Durrell to the British Library. This is maintained as the distinct Lawrence Durrell Collection. Thomas had earlier edited an anthology of writings, letters and poetry by Durrell, published as \"Spirit of Place\" (1969). It contained material related to Durrell's own published works. An important documentary resource is kept by the Biblioth\u00e8que Lawrence Durrell at Paris Nanterre University.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBiography and interviews\nCritical Studies\nCritical articles\nExternal links.\nArticles"}

Rider Haggard", "text": "English adventure novelist (1856\u20131925)\nSir Henry Rider Haggard (; 22 June 1856 \u2013 14 May 1925) was an English writer of adventure fiction romances set in exotic locations, predominantly Africa, and a pioneer of the lost world literary genre. He was also involved in land reform throughout the British Empire. His stories, situated at the lighter end of Victorian literature and including the eighteen Allan Quatermain stories beginning with \"King Solomon's Mines\", continue to be popular and influential.\nLife and career.\nFamily.\nHenry Rider Haggard, generally known as H. Rider Haggard or Rider Haggard, was born at Bradenham, Norfolk, the eighth of ten children, to William Meybohm Rider Haggard, a barrister, and Ella Doveton, an author and poet. His father was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1817 to British parents.\nA member of the Haggard family, he was the great-nephew of the ecclesiastical lawyer John Haggard and an uncle of the naval officer Admiral Sir Vernon Haggard and the diplomat Sir Godfrey Haggard.\nEducation.\nHaggard was initially sent to Garsington Rectory in Oxfordshire to study under Reverend H. J. Graham, but, unlike his elder brothers, who graduated from various private schools, he attended Ipswich Grammar School. This was because his father, who perhaps regarded him as somebody who was not going to amount to much, could no longer afford to maintain his expensive private education. After failing his army entrance exam, he was sent to a private crammer in London to prepare for the entrance exam for the British Foreign Office, which he never sat. During his two years in London he came into contact with people interested in the study of psychic phenomena.\nSouth Africa, 1875\u20131882.\nIn 1875, Haggard's father sent him to what is now South Africa to take up an unpaid position as assistant to the secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Natal. In 1876, he was transferred to the staff of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Special Commissioner for the Transvaal. It was in this role that Haggard was present in Pretoria in April 1877 for the official announcement of the British annexation of the Boer Republic of the Transvaal. Indeed, Haggard raised the Union flag and read out much of the proclamation following the loss of voice of the official originally entrusted with the duty.\nAt about that time, Haggard fell in love with Mary Elizabeth \"Lilly\" Jackson, whom he intended to marry once he obtained paid employment in Africa. In 1878, he became Registrar of the High Court in the Transvaal, and wrote to his father informing him that he intended to return to England and marry her. His father forbade it until Haggard had made a career for himself, and by 1879 Jackson had married Frank Archer, a well-to-do banker. When Haggard eventually returned to England, he married a friend of his sister, Marianna Louisa Margitson (1859\u20131943) in 1880, and the couple travelled to Africa together. They had a son named Jack (born 1881, died of measles at age 10) and three daughters, Angela (1883-1973), Dorothy (1884-1946) and Lilias (1892-1968). Lilias Rider Haggard became an author, edited \"The Rabbit Skin Cap\" and \"I Walked By Night\", and wrote a biography of her father entitled \"The Cloak That I Left\" (published in 1951).\nIn England, 1882\u20131925.\nMoving back to England in 1882, the couple settled in Ditchingham, Norfolk, Louisa Margitson's ancestral home. Later they lived in Kessingland and had connections with the church in Bungay, Suffolk. Haggard turned to the study of law and was called to the bar in 1884. His practice of law was desultory and much of his time was taken up by the writing of novels, which he saw as being more profitable. Haggard lived at 69 Gunterstone Road in Hammersmith, London, from mid-1885 to circa April 1888. It was at this Hammersmith address that he completed \"King Solomon's Mines\" (published September 1885).\nHaggard was heavily influenced by the larger-than-life adventurers whom he met in colonial Africa, most notably Frederick Selous and Frederick Russell Burnham. He created his Allan Quatermain adventures under their influence, during a time when great mineral wealth was being discovered in Africa, as well as the ruins of ancient lost civilisations of the continent such as Great Zimbabwe.\nThree of his books, \"The Wizard\" (1896), \"Black Heart and White Heart; a Zulu Idyll\" (1896), and \"Elissa; the Doom of Zimbabwe\" (1898), are dedicated to Burnham's daughter Nada, the first white child born in Bulawayo; she had been named after Haggard's 1892 book \"Nada the Lily\". Haggard belonged to the Athenaeum, Savile, and Authors' clubs.\nAid for Lilly Archer.\nYears later, when Haggard was a successful novelist, he was contacted by his former love, Lilly Archer, n\u00e9e Jackson. She had been deserted by her husband, who had embezzled funds entrusted to him and had fled bankrupt to Africa. Haggard installed her and her sons in a house and saw to the children's education. Lilly eventually followed her husband to Africa, where he infected her with syphilis before dying of it himself. Lilly returned to England in late 1907, where Haggard again supported her until her death on 22 April 1909. These details were not generally known until the publication of Haggard's 1981 biography by Sydney Higgins.\nWriting career.\nAfter returning to England in 1882, Haggard published a book on the political situation in South Africa, as well as a handful of unsuccessful novels, before writing \"King Solomon's Mines\". He accepted a 10 percent royalty rather than \u00a3100 for the copyright.\nA sequel soon followed entitled \"Allan Quatermain\", followed by \"She\" and its sequel \"Ayesha\", swashbuckling adventure novels set in the context of the Scramble for Africa (although the action of \"Ayesha\" happens in Tibet). The hugely popular \"King Solomon's Mines\" is sometimes considered the first of the Lost World genre. \"She\" is generally considered to be one of the classics of imaginative literature, and with 83 million copies sold by 1965, it is one of the best-selling books in history. He also wrote \"Nada the Lily\" (a tale of adventure among the Zulus) and the epic Viking romance \"Eric Brighteyes\".\nHis novels portray many of the stereotypes associated with colonialism, yet they are unusual for the degree of sympathy with which the native populations are portrayed. Africans often play heroic roles in the novels, although the protagonists are typically European. Notable examples are the heroic Zulu warrior Umslopogaas, and Ignosi, the rightful king of Kukuanaland, in \"King Solomon's Mines\". Having developed an intense mutual friendship with the three Englishmen who help him regain his throne, he accepts their advice and abolishes witch-hunts and arbitrary capital punishment.\nThree of Haggard's novels were written in collaboration with his friend Andrew Lang, who shared his interest in the spiritual realm and paranormal phenomena.\nHaggard also wrote about agricultural and social reform, in part inspired by his experiences in Africa, but also based on what he saw in Europe. At the end of his life, he was a staunch opponent of Bolshevism, a position that he shared with his friend Rudyard Kipling. The two had bonded upon Kipling's arrival at London in 1889, largely on the strength of their shared opinions, and remained lifelong friends.\nPublic affairs.\nHaggard was involved in reforming agriculture and was a member of many commissions on land use and related affairs, work that involved several trips to the Colonies and Dominions. It eventually led to the passage of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909.\nHe stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Conservative candidate for the Eastern division of Norfolk in the 1895 summer election, losing by 197 votes.\nHe was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1912 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1919 New Year Honours.\nDeath.\nSir Rider Haggard died on 14 May 1925 in Marylebone, London, aged 68. His ashes were buried at St Mary's Church, Ditchingham. His papers are held at the Norfolk Record Office. His relatives include the writer Stephen Haggard (great-nephew), the director Piers Haggard (great-great-nephew), and the actress Daisy Haggard (great-great-great-niece).\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\nPsychoanalyst Carl Jung considered Ayesha, the female protagonist of \"She\", to be a manifestation of the anima. Her epithet \"She Who Must Be Obeyed\" is used by British author John Mortimer in his \"Rumpole of the Bailey\" series as the lead character's private name for his wife, Hilda, before whom he trembles at home (despite the fact that he is a barrister with some skill in court). Haggard's Lost World genre influenced popular American and English pulp writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy, Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, and Abraham Merritt. Allan Quatermain, the adventure hero of eighteen novels and short stories beginning with \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1885), was a template for the American character Indiana Jones. Quatermain has gained recent popularity thanks to being a main character in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" comic book series and movie.\nGraham Greene, in an essay about Haggard, stated, \"Enchantment is just what this writer exercised; he fixed pictures in our minds that thirty years have been unable to wear away.\" Haggard was praised in 1965 by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of \"literary skill and sheer imaginative power\" and a co-originator with Robert Louis Stevenson of the \"Age of the Story Tellers\".\nOn race.\nRider Haggard's works have been criticised for their depictions of non-Europeans. In his non-fiction book \"Decolonising the Mind\", Kenyan author Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o refers to Haggard, who he says was one of the canonical authors in primary and secondary school, as one of the \"geniuses of racism.\" Author and academic Micere Mugo wrote in 1973 that reading the description of \"an old African woman in Rider Haggard's \"King Solomon's Mines\" had for a long time made her feel mortal terror whenever she encountered old African women.\"\nInfluence on children's literature in the 19th century.\nDuring the 19th century, Haggard was one of many individuals who contributed to children's literature. Morton N. Cohen described \"King Solomon's Mines\" as a story that has \"universal interest, for grown-ups as well as youngsters\". Haggard himself wanted to write the book for boys, but it ultimately had an influence on children and adults around the world. Cohen explained, \"\"King Solomon\u2019s Mines\" was being read in the public schools [and] aloud in class-rooms\".\nGeneral influence and legacy.\nThe first chapter of Haggard's book \"People of the Mist\" is credited with inspiring the motto of the Royal Air Force (formerly the Royal Flying Corps), \"Per ardua ad astra\".\nIn 1925, his daughter Lilias commissioned a memorial window for Ditchingham Church, in his honour, from James Powell and Sons. The design features the Pyramids, his farm in Africa, and Bungay as seen from the Vineyard Hills near his home.\nThe Rider Haggard Society was founded in 1985. It publishes the \"Haggard Journal\" three times a year.\nFilms based on Haggard's works.\nHaggard's writings have been turned into films many times including:\nHonours.\nThe locality of Rider, British Columbia, was named after him.\nRider Haggard Lane in Kessingland, Suffolk, is the location of his former home.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65140", "revid": "48527484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65140", "title": "Samuel Richardson", "text": "English writer and printer (1689\u20131761)\nSamuel Richardson (baptised 19 August 1689 \u2013 4 July 1761) was an English writer and printer known for three epistolary novels: \"Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded\" (1740), \"\" (1748) and \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753). He printed almost 500 works, including journals and magazines, working periodically with the London bookseller Andrew Millar. Richardson had been apprenticed to the printer John Wilde, whose daughter Martha he eventually married. All six of their children died in infancy or childbirth, with Martha herself dying in childbirth in 1731. In 1733, he married Elizabeth Leake, daughter of printer John Leake. Together they had six more children, of whom four daughters reached adulthood. Richardson's first novel, \"Pamela,\" was penned at the age of 51 and was an instant success. Leading acquaintances included Samuel Johnson and Sarah Fielding, the physician and Behmenist George Cheyne, and the theologian and writer William Law, whose books he printed. At Law's request, Richardson printed some poems by John Byrom. In literature, he rivalled Henry Fielding; the two responded to each other's literary styles.\nBiography.\nRichardson, one of nine children, was probably born in 1689 in Mackworth, Derbyshire, to Samuel and Elizabeth Richardson. It is unsure where in Derbyshire he was born because Richardson always concealed the location, but it has recently been discovered that Richardson probably lived in poverty as a child. The older Richardson was, according to the younger:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHis mother, according to Richardson, \"was also a good woman, of a family not ungenteel; but whose father and mother died in her infancy, within half-an-hour of each other, in the London pestilence of 1665\".\nThe trade his father pursued was that of a joiner (a type of carpenter, but Richardson explains that it was \"then more distinct from that of a carpenter than now it is with us\"). In describing his father's occupation, Richardson stated that \"he was a good draughtsman and understood architecture\", and it was suggested by Samuel Richardson's son-in-law that the senior Richardson was a cabinetmaker and an exporter of mahogany while working at Aldersgate-street. The abilities and position of his father brought him to the attention of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. However, as Richardson claims, this was to Richardson senior's \"great detriment\" because of the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion, which ended in the death of Scott in 1685. After Scott's death, the elder Richardson was forced to abandon his business in London and live a modest life in Derbyshire.\nEarly life.\nThe Richardsons were not exiled forever from London; they eventually returned, and young Richardson was educated at Christ's Hospital grammar school. The extent that he was educated at the school is uncertain, and Leigh Hunt wrote years later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a fact not generally known that Richardson... received what education he had (which was very little, and did not go beyond English) at Christ's Hospital. It may be wondered how he could come no better taught from a school which had sent forth so many good scholars; but in his time, and indeed till very lately, that foundation was divided into several schools, none of which partook of the lessons of the others; and Richardson, agreeably to his father's intention of bringing him up to trade, was most probably confined to the writing school, where all that was taught was writing and arithmetic.\nHowever, this conflicts with Richardson's nephew's account that \"'it is certain that [Richardson] was never sent to a more respectable seminary' than 'a private grammar school' located in Derbyshire\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI recollect that I was early noted for having invention. I was not fond of play, as other boys; my school-fellows used to call me \"Serious\" and \"Gravity\"; and five of them particularly delighted to single me out, either for a walk, or at their father's houses, or at mine, to tell them stories, as they phrased it. Some I told them, from my reading, as true; others from my head, as mere invention; of which they would be most fond, and often were affected by them. One of them particularly, I remember, was for putting me to write a history, as he called it, on the model of Tommy Pots; I now forget what it was, only that it was of a servant-man preferred by a fine young lady (for his goodness) to a lord, who was a libertine. All of my stories carried with them, I am bold to say, a useful moral.\n\u2014 Samuel Richardson on his storytelling.\nLittle is known of Richardson's early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not forthcoming with specific events and incidents, he did talk about the origins of his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. \"Assuming the style and address of a person in years\", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that \"my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years\" but also \"commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken\".\nAfter his writing ability was known, he began to help others in the community write letters. In particular, Richardson, at the age of 13, helped many of the young women with whom he associated to write responses to various love letters they received. As Richardson claims, \"I have been directed to chide, and even repulse, when an offence was either taken or given, at the very time that the heart of the chider or repulser was open before me, overflowing with esteem and affect\". Although this helped his writing ability, he in 1753 advised the Dutch minister Stinstra not to draw large conclusions from these early actions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You think, Sir, you can account from my early secretaryship to young women in my father's neighbourhood, for the characters I have drawn of the heroines of my three works. But this opportunity did little more for me, at so tender an age, than point, as I may say, or lead my enquiries, as I grew up, into the knowledge of female heart.\nHe continued to explain that he did not fully understand females until writing \"Clarissa\", and these letters were only a beginning.\nEarly career.\nThe elder Richardson originally wanted his son to become a clergyman, but he was not able to afford the education that the younger Richardson would require, so he let his son pick his own profession. He selected the profession of printing because he hoped to \"gratify a thirst for reading, which, in after years, he disclaimed\". At the age of 17, in 1706, Richardson was bound in seven-year apprenticeship under John Wilde as a printer. Wilde's printing shop was in Golden Lion Court on Aldersgate Street, and Wilde had a reputation as \"a master who grudged every hour... that tended not to his profit\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI served a diligent seven years to it; to a master who grudged every hour to me that tended not to his profit, even of those times of leisure and diversion, which the refractoriness of my fellow-servants \"obliged\" him to allow them, and were usually allowed by other masters to their apprentices. I stole from the hours of rest and relaxation, my reading times for improvement of my mind; and, being engaged in correspondence with a gentleman, greatly my superior in degree, and of ample fortune, who, had he lived, intended high things for me; these were all the opportunities I had in my apprenticeship to carry it on. But this little incident I may mention; I took care that even my candle was of my own purchasing, that I might not, in the most trifling instance, make my master a sufferer (and who used to call me the pillar of his house) and not to disable myself by watching or sitting-up, to perform my duty to him in the day time.\n\u2013 Samuel Richardson on his time with John Wilde.\nWhile working for Wilde, he met a rich gentleman who took an interest in Richardson's writing abilities and the two began to correspond with each other. When the gentleman died a few years later, Richardson lost a potential patron, which delayed his ability to pursue his own writing career. He decided to devote himself completely to his apprenticeship, and he worked his way up to a position as a compositor and a corrector of the shop's printing press. In 1713, Richardson left Wilde to become \"Overseer and Corrector of a Printing-Office\". This meant that Richardson ran his own shop, but the location of that shop is unknown. It is possible that the shop was located in Staining Lane or may have been jointly run with John Leake in Jewin Street.\nIn 1719, Richardson took the freedom of the City of London, and set up his own printing shop near the Salisbury Court district close to Fleet Street. Although he claimed to business associates that he was working out of the well-known Salisbury Court, his printing shop was more accurately located on the corner of Blue Ball Court and Dorset Street in a house that later became Bell's Building. On 23 November 1721, Richardson married Martha Wilde, the daughter of his former employer and master John Wilde. The match was \"prompted mainly by prudential considerations\", although Richardson would claim later that there was a strong love-affair between them. He soon brought her to live with him in the printing shop that served also as his home.\nA key moment in Richardson's career came on 6 August 1722 when he took on his first apprentices: Thomas Gover, George Mitchell, and Joseph Chrichley. He would later take on William Price (2 May 1727), Samuel Jolley (5 September 1727), Bethell Wellington (2 September 1729), and Halhed Garland (5 May 1730).\nOne of Richardson's first major printing contracts came in June 1723, when he began to print the bi-weekly \"The True Briton\" for Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton. This was a Jacobite political paper which attacked the government and was soon censored for printing \"common libels\". However, Richardson's name was not on the publication, and he was able to escape any of the negative fallout, although it is possible that Richardson participated in the papers as far as actually writing one himself. The only lasting effect from the paper would be the incorporation of Wharton's libertine characteristics in the character of Lovelace in Richardson's \"Clarissa\", although Wharton would be only one of many models of libertine behaviour that Richardson would find in his life. In 1724, Richardson befriended Thomas Gent, Henry Woodfall, and Arthur Onslow, the latter of those would become the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nRichardson anonymously published pamphlets as described in \"Samuel Richardson as Anonymous Editor and Printer : Recycling Texts for the Book Market\" \nOver their ten years of marriage, Martha and Samuel Richardson had five sons and one daughter \u2013 three of the boys were successively named Samuel after their father, but all three died as infants. Martha died in childbirth on 23 January 1731, and their youngest son, Samuel, succumbed to illness in 1732. In 1733, Richardson married Elizabeth Leake, the daughter of printer John Leake. Samuel and Elizabeth had six children (five daughters and one son). Four of their daughters, Mary, Martha, Anne, and Sarah, reached adulthood. Their son, another Samuel, was born in 1739 but died in 1740.\nIn 1733, Richardson was granted a contract with the House of Commons, with help from Onslow, to print the \"Journals of the House\". The 26 volumes of the work soon improved his business. Later in 1733, he wrote \"The Apprentice's Vade Mecum\", urging young men like himself to be diligent and self-denying. The work was intended to \"create the perfect apprentice\". Written in response to the \"epidemick Evils of the present Age\", the text is best known for its condemnation of popular forms of entertainment including theatres, taverns and gambling. The manual targets the apprentice as the focal point for the moral improvement of society, not because he is most susceptible to vice, but because, Richardson suggests, he is more responsive to moral improvement than his social betters. During this time, Richardson took on five more apprentices: Thomas Verren (1 August 1732), Richard Smith (6 February 1733), Matthew Stimson (7 August 1733), Bethell Wellington (7 May 1734), and Daniel Green (1 October 1734). His total staff during the 1730s numbered seven, as his first three apprentices were free by 1728, and two of his apprentices, Verren and Smith, died soon into their apprenticeship. The loss of Verren was particularly devastating to Richardson because Verren was his nephew and his hope for a male heir that would take over the press.\nFirst novel.\nWork continued to improve, and Richardson printed the \"Daily Journal\" between 1736 and 1737, and the \"Daily Gazetteer\" in 1738. During his time printing the \"Daily Journal\", he was also printer to the \"Society for the Encouragement of Learning\", a group that tried to help authors become independent from publishers, but collapsed soon after. In December 1738, Richardson's printing business was successful enough to allow him to lease a house in Fulham in London. This house, which would be Richardson's residence from 1739 to 1754, was later named \"The Grange\" in 1836. In 1739, Richardson was asked by his friends Charles Rivington and John Osborn to write \"a little volume of Letters, in a common style, on such subjects as might be of use to those country readers, who were unable to indite for themselves\". While writing this volume, Richardson was inspired to write his first novel.\nRichardson made the transition from master printer to novelist on 6 November 1740 with the publication of \"\". \"Pamela\" was sometimes regarded as \"the first novel in English\" or the first modern novel. Richardson explained the origins of the work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the progress of [Rivington's and Osborn's collection], writing two or three letters to instruct handsome girls, who were obliged to go out to service, as we phrase it, how to avoid the snares that might be laid against their virtue, and hence sprung \"Pamela\"... Little did I think, at first, of making one, much less two volumes of it... I thought the story, if written in an easy and natural manner, suitably to the simplicity of it, might possibly introduce a new species of writing, that might possibly turn young people into a course of reading different from the pomp and parade of romance-writing, and dismissing the improbable and marvellous, with which novels generally abound, might tend to promote the cause of religion and virtue.\nAfter Richardson started the work on 10 November 1739, his wife and her friends became so interested in the story that he finished it on 10 January 1740. Pamela Andrews, the heroine of \"Pamela\", represented \"Richardson's insistence upon well-defined feminine roles\" and was part of a common fear held during the 18th century that women were \"too bold\". In particular, her \"zeal for housewifery\" was included as a proper role of women in society. Although \"Pamela\" and the title heroine were popular and gave a proper model for how women should act, they inspired \"a storm of anti-Pamelas\" (like Henry Fielding's \"Shamela\" and \"Joseph Andrews\" and Eliza Haywood's \"The Anti-Pamela\") because the character \"perfectly played her part\".\nLater that year, Richardson printed Rivington and Osborn's book which inspired \"Pamela\" under the title of \"Letters written to and for particular Friends, on the most important Occasions. Directing not only the requisite Style and Forms to be observed in writing\" Familiar Letters; \"but how to think and act justly and prudently, in the common Concerns of Human Life\". The book contained many anecdotes and lessons on how to live, but Richardson did not care for the work and it was never expanded even though it went into six editions during his life. He went so far as to tell a friend, \"This volume of letters is not worthy of your perusal\" because they were \"intended for the lower classes of people\".\nMultiple sequels to Pamela were written by other writers, such as \"Pamela's Conduct in High Life\", which was written by John Kelly and published by Ward and Chandler in September 1741. Published that same year were two anonymous sequels: \"Pamela in High Life\" and \"The Life of Pamela\", the latter being a third-person retelling of both Richardson's original novel and Kelly's continuation. These unofficial sequels capitalized off the character's popularity and readers desire to learn what happened to Pamela and Mr. B after the conclusion of Richardson's novel. This compelled Richardson to write a sequel to the novel, \"Pamela in her Exalted Condition\", in December 1741. The novel had a poorer reception than the first, as Peter Sabor writes, \"the continuation is a far blander affair than the original work,\" focusing on Pamela's gentility and married life. The public's interest in the characters was waning, and this was only furthered by Richardson's focusing on Pamela discussing morality, literature, and philosophy.\nLater career.\nAfter the failures of the \"Pamela\" sequels, Richardson began to compose a new novel. It was not until early 1744 that the content of the plot was known, and this happened when he sent Aaron Hill two chapters to read. In particular, Richardson asked Hill if he could help shorten the chapters because Richardson was worried about the length of the novel. Hill refused, saying,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn July, Richardson sent Hill a complete \"design\" of the story, and asked Hill to try again, but Hill responded, \"It is impossible, after the wonders you have shown in \"Pamela\", to question your infallible success in this new, natural, attempt\" and that \"you must give me leave to be astonished, when you tell me that you have finished it already\". However, the novel was not complete to Richardson's satisfaction until October 1746. Between 1744 and 1746, Richardson tried to find readers who could help him shorten the work, but his readers wanted to keep the work in its entirety. A frustrated Richardson wrote to Edward Young in November 1747:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRichardson did not devote all of his time just to working on his new novel, but was busy printing various works for other authors that he knew. In 1742, he printed the third edition of Daniel Defoe's \"Tour through Great Britain\". He filled his few further years with smaller works for his friends until 1748, when Richardson started helping Sarah Fielding and her friend Jane Collier to write novels. By 1748, Richardson was so impressed with Collier that he accepted her as the governess to his daughters. In 1753, she wrote \"An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting\" with the help of Sarah Fielding and possibly James Harris or Richardson, and it was Richardson who printed the work. But Collier was not the only author to be helped by Richardson, as he printed an edition of Young's \"Night Thoughts\" in 1749.\nBy 1748 his novel \"Clarissa\" was published in full: two volumes appeared in November 1747, two in April 1748, and three in December 1748. Unlike the novel, the author was not faring well at this time. By August 1748, Richardson was in poor health. He had a sparse diet that consisted mostly of vegetables and drinking vast amounts of water, and was not robust enough to prevent the effects of being bled upon the advice of various doctors throughout his life. He was known for \"vague 'startings' and 'paroxysms'\", along with experiencing tremors. Richardson once wrote to a friend that \"my nervous disorders will permit me to write with more impunity than to read\" and that writing allowed him a \"freedom he could find nowhere else\".\nHowever, his condition did not stop him from continuing to release the final volumes \"Clarissa\" after November 1748. To Hill he wrote: \"The Whole will make Seven; that is, one more to attend these two. Eight crouded into Seven, by a smaller Type. Ashamed as I am of the Prolixity, I thought I owed the Public Eight Vols. in Quantity for the Price of Seven\". Richardson later made it up to the public with \"deferred Restorations\" of the fourth edition of the novel being printed in larger print with eight volumes and a preface that reads: \"It is proper to observe with regard to the \"present Edition\" that it has been thought fit to restore many Passages, and several Letters which were omitted in the former merely for shortening-sake.\"\nThe response to the novel was positive, and the public began to describe the title heroine as \"divine Clarissa\". It was soon considered Richardson's \"masterpiece\", his greatest work, and was rapidly translated into French in part or in full, for instance by the abb\u00e9 Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, as well as into German. The Dutch translator of \"Clarissa\" was the distinguished Mennonite preacher, Johannes Stinstra (1708\u20131790), who as a champion of Socinianism had been suspended from the ministry in 1742. This gave him sufficient leisure to translate \"Clarissa\", which was published in eight volumes between 1752\u20131755. However, Stinstra later wrote in a letter to Richardson of 24 December 1753 that the translation had been \"a burden too heavy for [his] shoulders\". In England there was particular emphasis on Richardson's \"natural creativity\" and his ability to incorporate daily life experience into the novel. However, the final three volumes were delayed, and many of the readers began to \"anticipate\" the concluding story and some demanded that Richardson write a happy ending. One such advocate of the happy ending was Henry Fielding, who had previously written \"Joseph Andrews\" to mock Richardson's \"Pamela\". Although Fielding was originally opposed to Richardson, Fielding supported the original volumes of \"Clarissa\" and thought a happy ending would be \"poetical justice\". Those who disagreed included the Sussex diarist Thomas Turner, writing in about July 1754: \"\"Clarissa Harlow\" [sic], I look upon as a very well-wrote thing, tho' it must be allowed it is too prolix. The author keeps up the character of every person in all places; and as to the maner [sic] of its ending, I like it better than if it had terminated in more happy consequences.\"\nOthers wanted Lovelace to be reformed and for him and Clarissa to marry, but Richardson would not allow a \"reformed rake\" to be her husband, and was unwilling to change the ending. In a postscript to \"Clarissa\", Richardson wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;if the temporary sufferings of the Virtuous and the Good can be accounted for and justified on Pagan principles, many more and infinitely stronger reasons will occur to a Christian Reader in behalf of what are called unhappy Catastrophes, from a consideration of the doctrine of \"future rewards\"; which is every where strongly enforced in the History of Clarissa.\nAlthough few were bothered by the epistolary style, Richardson feels obliged to continue his postscript with a defence of the form based on the success of it in \"Pamela\".\nHowever, some did question the propriety of having Lovelace, the villain of the novel, act in such an immoral fashion. The novel avoids glorifying Lovelace, as Carol Flynn puts it,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;by damning his character with monitory footnotes and authorial intrusions, Richardson was free to develop in his fiction his villain's fantasy world. Schemes of mass rape would be legitimate as long as Richardson emphasized the negative aspects of his character at the same time.\nBut Richardson still felt the need to respond by writing a pamphlet called \"Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend and Worthy Gentleman\". In the pamphlet, he defends his characterizations and explains that he took great pains to avoid any glorification of scandalous behaviour, unlike the authors of many other novels that rely on characters of such low quality.\nIn 1749, Richardson's female friends started asking him to create a male figure as virtuous as his heroines \"Pamela\" and \"Clarissa\" in order to \"give the world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined\". Although he did not at first agree, he eventually complied, starting work on a book in this vein in June 1750. Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalized in the middle of 1752. When the novel was being printed in 1753, Richardson discovered that Irish printers were trying to pirate the work. He immediately fired those he suspected of giving the printers advanced copies of \"Grandison\" and relied on multiple London printing firms to help him produce an authentic edition before the pirated version was sold. The first four volumes were published on 13 November 1753, and in December the next two would follow. The remaining volume was published in March to complete a seven-volume series while a six-volume set was simultaneously published, and these met with success. In \"Grandison\", Richardson was unwilling to risk having a negative response to any \"rakish\" characteristics that Lovelace embodied, and denigrated the immoral characters \"to show those mischievous young admirers of Lovelace once and for all that the rake should be avoided\".\nDeath.\nIn his final years, Richardson received visits from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker, other important political figures, and many London writers. By that time, he enjoyed a high social position and was Master of the Stationers' Company. In early November 1754, Richardson and his family moved from the Grange to a home at Parsons Green, now in west London. During this time Richardson received a letter from Samuel Johnson asking for money to pay a debt that Johnson was unable to afford. On 16 March 1756, Richardson responded with more than enough money and their friendship was certain by this time.\nAt the same time as he was associating with important figures of the day, Richardson's career as a novelist drew to a close. \"Grandison\" was his final novel, and he stopped writing fiction afterwards. It was \"Grandison\" that set the tone for Richardson's followers after his death. However, he was continually prompted by various friends and admirers to continue to write along with suggested topics. Richardson did not like any of the topics, and chose to spend all of his time composing letters to his friends and associates. The only major work that Richardson would write would be \"A Collection of the Moral and Instruction Sentiments, Maxims, Cautions, and Reflexions, contained in the Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison\". Although it is possible that this work was inspired by Johnson asking for an \"index rerum\" for Richardson's novels, the \"Collection\" contains more of a focus on \"moral and instructive\" lessons than the index that Johnson sought.\nAfter June 1758, Richardson began to suffer from insomnia, and in June 1761, he was afflicted with apoplexy. This moment was described by his friend, Miss Talbot, on 2 July 1761:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTwo days later, aged 71, on 4 July 1761, Richardson died at Parsons Green and was buried at St. Bride's Church in Fleet Street near his first wife Martha.\nDuring Richardson's life, his printing press produced about 10,000 pieces, including novels, historical texts, Acts of Parliament, and newspapers, making his print house one of the most productive and diverse in the 18th century. He wanted to keep the press in his family, but after the death of his four sons and a nephew, his printing press would be left in his will to his only surviving male heir, a second nephew. This happened to be a nephew whom Richardson did not trust, doubting his abilities as a printer. Richardson's fears proved well-founded, for after his death the press stopped producing quality works and eventually stopped printing altogether. Richardson owned copyrights to most of his works, and these were sold after his death, in twenty-fourth share issues, with shares in \"Clarissa\" bringing in 25 pounds each and those for \"Grandison\" bringing in 20 pounds each. Shares in \"Pamela\", sold in sixteenths, went for 18 pounds each.\nThe first full biography of Richardson was written by Clara Linklater Thomson and published in 1900, and is credited with bringing \"Richardson back into view as a major novelist at a time when he was no longer being read\". \nEpistolary novels.\nRichardson was a skilled letter writer and his talent traces back to his childhood. Throughout his whole life, he would constantly write to his various associates. Richardson had a \"faith\" in the act of letter writing, and believed that letters could be used to accurately portray character traits. He quickly adopted the epistolary novel form, which granted him \"the tools, the space, and the freedom to develop distinctly different characters speaking directly to the reader\". The epistolary form gave Richardson, as well as others, the means to impact his audience more effectively as readers were able to get a more intimate insight into a novel's characters. This allowed a stronger sense of engagement with the text to develop. Richardson structured his epistolary work to offer multiple perspectives so readers could interpret the text in varied ways. However, Richardson \"hoped he would eventually convince his audience to read in the ways that he chose\u2014ways that he hoped would lead to moral regeneration.\" These epistolary novels were a \"moral project\" as well as a literary one; Susan Whyman writes that Richardson's \"goal was not only to reform reading practices but to reform lives as well.\"\nIn his first novel, \"Pamela\", he explored the various complexities of the title character's life, and the letters allow the reader to witness her develop and progress over time. The novel was an experiment, but it allowed Richardson to create a complex heroine through a series of her letters. When Richardson wrote \"Clarissa\", he had more experience in the form and expanded the letter writing to four different correspondents, which created a complex system of characters encouraging each other to grow and develop over time. However, the villain of the story, Lovelace, is also involved in the letter writing, and this leads to tragedy. Leo Braudy described the benefits of the epistolary form of \"Clarissa\" as, \"Language can work: letters can be ways to communicate and justify\". By the time Richardson writes \"Grandison\", he transforms the letter writing from telling of personal insights and explaining feelings into a means for people to communicate their thoughts on the actions of others and for the public to celebrate virtue. The letters are no longer written for a few people, but are passed along in order for all to see. The characters of \"Pamela\", \"Clarissa\", and \"Grandison\" are revealed in a personal way, with the first two using the epistolary form for \"dramatic\" purposes, and the last for \"celebratory\" purposes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the province of Monza and Brianza. Monza is best known for its Grand Prix motor racing circuit, the , which hosts the Formula One Italian Grand Prix.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;On 11 June 2004, Monza was designated the capital of the new province of Monza and Brianza. The new administrative arrangement came fully into effect in summer 2009; previously, Monza was a \"comune\" within the province of Milan. Monza is the third-largest city of Lombardy and is the most important economic, industrial and administrative centre of the Brianza area, supporting a textile industry and a publishing trade. Monza also hosts a department of the University of Milano-Bicocca, a Court of Justice and several offices of regional administration. Monza Park is one of the largest urban parks in Europe.\nGeography and topography.\nMonza is located in the high plains of Lombardy, between Brianza and Milan, at an altitude of above sea level. It is from the centre of the region's capital, although when considering the cities borders, they are separated by less than . Monza is about from Lecco and Como. Monza shares its position with Milan in the same metro area, and is a big part of its new province.\nMonza is crossed from north to south by the Lambro. The river enters Monza from the north, between Via Aliprandi and Via Zanzi streets. This is an artificial fork of the river created for defensive purposes in the early decades of the 14th century. The fork is known as Lambretto and it rejoins the main course of the Lambro as it exits to the south, leaving Monza through the now-demolished ancient circle of medieval walls. Another artificial stream is the Canale Villoresi, which was constructed in the late 19th century.\nMonza has a typical sub mediterranean climate of the Po valley, with cool, short winters and warm summers; temperatures are very similar to nearby Milan, averaging in January, the coldest month, to about in July, the warmest. Precipitation is abundant, with most occurring in the autumn and the least in winter and summer; despite this, the city and surrounding area usually does not suffer drought in any season.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and ancient era.\nFunerary urns found in the late 19th century show that humans were in the area dating at the least to the Bronze Age, when people would have lived in pile dwelling settlements raised above the rivers and marshes.\nDuring the Roman Empire, Monza was known as Modicia. During the 3rd century BCE, the Romans subdued the Insubres, a Gaul tribe that had crossed the Alps and settled around Mediolanum (now Milan). A Gallo-Celtic tribe, perhaps the Insubres themselves, founded a village on the Lambro. The ruins of a Roman bridge named \"Ponte d'Arena\" can be seen near today's \"Ponte dei Leoni\" (Lions Bridge).\nMiddle Ages.\nTheodelinda, daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria and wife of the Lombard king Authari (and later of king Agilulf), chose Monza as her summer residence. Here in 595 she founded an \"oraculum\" dedicated to St. John the Baptist. According to the legend, Theodelinda, asleep while her husband was hunting, saw a dove in a dream that told her: \"modo\" (Latin for \"here\") indicating that she should build the oraculum in that place, and the queen answered \"etiam\", meaning \"yes\". According to this legend, the medieval name of Monza, \"Modoetia\", is derived from these two words. She also had a palace (the future Royal palace) built here.\nBerengar I of Italy (850\u2013924) located his headquarters in Monza. A fortified castrum was constructed to resist the incursions of the Hungarians. Under Berengar's reign, Monza enjoyed a certain degree of independence: it had its own system of weights and measures, and could also seize property and mark the deeds with their signatures. Berengar was very generous evident by the donation of numerous works to the Monza Cathedral, including the famous cross, and by giving large benefits to its 32 canons and other churches.\nIn 980 Monza hosted Emperor Otto II inside the walled city. The Glossary of Monza, one of the earliest examples of the evolution of the Lombard language, probably dates to the early 10th century. In 1000 Emperor Otto III became the protector of Monza and its possessions: Bulciago, Cremella, Lurago, Locate and Garlate.\nIn 1018, Aribert (970\u20131045), Lord of Monza, was consecrated bishop of Milan, resulting in the city losing its independence from its rival. These years saw a power struggle between the emperor Conrad II, and Aribert. When the emperor died, he left important donations to the church of Monza.\nIn the 12th century, it is estimated that the city of Monza had about 7,000 inhabitants. Agriculture was the main occupation, although crafts had begun to grow in importance. In 1128 Conrad III of Hohenstaufen was crowned King of Italy in the Church of San Michele at Monza.\nIn 1136 emperor Lothair III guaranteed the independence of the clergy of Monza from Milan. Monza subsequently regained its autonomy, which was not limited to the feudal government of lands and goods; the archpriest of Monza was confirmed the authority of the clergy of his church (year 1150). This autonomy was never absolute, as the church of Monza was not able to completely cut its ties with the bishop of Milan.\nFrederick I Barbarossa visited Monza twice (1158 and 1163). During this period the city again regained its independence from Milan, a city hostile to the emperor. Frederick declared that Monza was his property and also gave the \"Curraria\" (the right to levy customs on the streets), a right usually granted only to royal seats.\nDuring the period of the struggle against Milan and other cities of the Lombard League, Monza was primarily an administrative centre for Barbarossa. Monzan independence lasted until 1185 when Barbarossa ended the conflict with the Lombard League with the peace of Constance. He allowed the city of Milan to self-rule its subjects again while taking possession of the treasury of the cathedral.\nIn 1185 Henry VI, son of Barbarossa, was crowned king at Monza, on the occasion of his marriage to Queen Constanza of Sicily, heir to the Norman kingdom.\nAs early as the 12th century, Monza was a fortified place, although the status of free city had changed its economical role. Agricultural activities were now paired by the production of clothes, while wool processing developed on large farms outside the walls.\nMonza was increasingly linked to events of Milan and shared its history and enemies: in 1255 the city was sacked by the Ghibellines, and in 1259 and Ezzelino III da Romano tried to seize the castle of Monza but was repelled; the village was set on fire.\nAfter the decisive 1277 victory of the Visconti at the Battle of Desio, Monza was occupied by Archbishop Ottone Visconti and the Marquis of Montferrat, William VII (1278). The following year, the town was declared a possession of the people of Milan.\n14th\u201317th centuries.\nIn 1312, Monza adhered to the Ghibelline faction.\nEnrico Aliprandi, a member of a family of Monza, joined the Torriani faction, with many enlisted soldiers under his command. He was acclaimed Lord of Monza by the people in 1322. The same year, Luchino Visconti and Francesco Garbagnate demolished the walls of Monza to prevent it from defending itself against attacks from the Milanese.\nIn 1325 Galeazzo I Visconti, who conquered the city after a long siege, began the construction of new defences. Among the projects was the bifurcation of the River Lambro (the \"Lambretto\" branch) and the construction of a castle, the third in Monza. It included a tall-tower, later used as a jail (\"Forni\"). The Castle of Monza was later expanded to such a degree that it was necessary to demolish the St. Mary of Ingino church as space was needed for new buildings. Two other towers were also built along the River Lambro. In 1327 Galeazzo himself was imprisoned in the \"Forni\", by order of emperor Louis IV. He was released the next year.\nIn April 1329, the condottiero Pinalla Aliprandi regained Monza from the imperial troops. Azzone Visconti allowed the reconstruction of the walls, beginning in 1333 and lasting until 1381. Martino Aliprandi was \"podest\u00e0\" of Monza from 1334 to 1336, overseeing the construction of the walls and the fortification of the fortress.\nIn 1354 Pope Innocent VI proclaimed the undisputed right to impose, in the Cathedral of Monza, the Crown of Italy, the Iron Crown. In 1380 Gian Galeazzo Visconti donated the castle to his wife Catherine, who died there after having been jailed by her son Giovanni Maria (1404). In 1407 Estorre Visconti was proclaimed Lord of Monza and began minting Monza's own coinage.\nAntonio de Leyva, the Spanish governor of Milan and commander of the imperial troops, sacked the city in 1527. In the same year, a mine exploded causing the partial destruction of the Castle of Monza. De Leyva became Lord of Monza in 1529, devoting himself to the government regulation of ecclesiastical affairs, controlling their taxes and duties and shutting the doors of those who did not pay. His relative Marianna de Leyva was the inspiration to Alessandro Manzoni for his Nun of Monza.\nThe plague, which struck Monza in 1576 and 1630, caused a profound demographic and economic crisis. In 1648, Monza and its territory became the property of the Milanese Durini family.\nThe Duchy of Milan and Monza remained subject to the Spanish crown until the early 18th century.\n18th century.\nAt the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (1713), the Duchy of Milan was assigned to the House of Habsburg of Austria. This historical period is a season of rebirth of the city, with a considerable development of agriculture and crafts.\nEmpress Maria Theresa built the Royal Villa of Monza for her son Ferdinand, Governor of Milan (1777\u20131780). The choice of Monza was due not only to the beauty of the landscape, but also its strategic position and the fact that it was connected to Vienna as well as its proximity to Milan. The construction was completed in three years with design by architect Giuseppe Piermarini from Foligno.\nAt the conclusion of the Italian campaign of Napoleon Bonaparte (1796), the Duchy of Milan was acquired first by the French Republic and then entered the Cisalpine Republic (which, in 1802, became the Italian Republic).\n19th century.\nConsidered by the French as a symbol of aristocratic power, the Royal Villa was destined for demolition. However, the protests of citizens stopped the process, although the abandonment caused the complex to decay.\nTwo-thirds of the gold and silver treasures of the Monza Cathedral were delivered to the mint of Milan, which turned them into coins used for military expenses. Bonaparte also took possession of the treasures of the Basilica and the Chapter Library books, and transferred them to the National Library in Paris. The Iron Crown was left provisionally in Monza.\nIn 1805, the Italian Republic became the Kingdom of Italy with its capital in Milan. On 26 May 1805, the Iron Crown was in Milan for the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte, who put it on his head, uttering the famous phrase \"God gave it to me, woe to anyone who touches it.\" Napoleon also established the Order of the Iron Crown. Monza received the title of Imperial City. The Viceroy of Italy, Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, was appointed in August 1805 and he settled in the Villa of Monza. In 1807 the castle was demolished.\nIn the fall of the First Empire (1815), Austria annexed the Italian territories to the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Monza being included in the province of Milan. The Monzesi asked for the restoration of all the treasures taken by the French. In 1816 the city returned the possession of the books of the Treasury and Chapter Library. The Crown of Agilulf, however, had been melted in Paris.\nThe next emperor Ferdinand I of Austria had himself crowned King of Lombardy and Venetia in Milan with the Iron Crown (6 September 1838), with the opportunity to extend various benefits to the city. New roads are opened, including the King Ferdinand road (now Via Vittorio Emanuele), while in 1842 the Bridge of Lions was erected near the old Roman bridge. In 1841 the first railway connecting Milan and Monza was inaugurated.\nMonza took part in the Five Days of Milan (22\u201323 March 1848) Monza, expelling the Austrian garrison. The Austrians returned in 1849.\nIn 1859, at the end of the Second Italian War of Independence, Lombardy became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. But the treasure and the Iron Crown had been transferred to Vienna by the Austrians and was returned to Monza only after the conclusion of the Third War of Italian Independence (December 1866).\nOn 31 December 1895 Monza had about 37,500 permanent inhabitants. The economy was based on the production of wheat, corn, fodder, potatoes, oats, rye and vegetables in general. Another source of wealth was the breeding of silkworms.\nIn 1900 Monza was the scene of the assassination of King Umberto I by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. To commemorate the spot of the crime, his successor Victor Emmanuel III ordered the construction of an Expiatory Chapel on Via Matteo da Campione.\n20th century.\nAt the beginning of the century, Monza counted 41,200 inhabitants; in 1911 it was among the eight most industrialised centres of Italy. The main activities were related to the processing of cotton, mechanics, hat factories and industries.\nBetween the two world wars, the city's industrial structure did not undergo substantial change while recording significant increases in production volumes. The Autodromo (1922) and a golf course (1925) were built in the park.\nThe Second World War, between 1940 and 1945, caused several bombings of Monza, with civilian casualties; after the September 1943 Italian Armistice, the area was occupied by the Germans.\nIn the second half of the century, the city experienced a significant increase in population and subsequent building development. With the development of various activities occurring problems related to traffic and links to nearby towns, especially with Milan.\n21st century.\nAt the beginning of the century, Monza had about 120,000 inhabitants. The city became the capital of the Province of Monza and Brianza on 11 June 2004. In 2009\u20132013 a tunnel was built to supplement the Viale Lombardia (SS36 national road), one of the busiest streets in Europe.\nMain sights.\nIn the course of its history, Monza withstood thirty-two sieges, but the Porta d'Agrate is all that remains of its original walls and fortifications. Nearby is the nunnery in which the Nun of Monza was enclosed in Manzoni's \"The Betrothed\".\nMonza is known for its Romanesque-Gothic style Cathedral of Saint John (\"Duomo\"). The black-and-white marble arcaded fa\u00e7ade was erected in the mid-14th century by Matteo da Campione. The campanile was erected in 1606 to designs by Pellegrino Tibaldi.\nThe cathedral encloses the \"Chapel of Theodelinda\", a centrally-planned Greek-cross \"oraculum\" (\"chapel of prayer\") dated to c.\u2009595. The foundations remain under the crossing of nave and transept, but at the close of the 13th century, the chapel was enlarged by enclosing the former atrium within the building. The frescoed chapel houses the Iron Crown of Lombardy, said to include one of the nails used at the Crucifixion of Jesus. The treasury also contains the crown, fan and gold comb of Theodelinda, and, as well as Gothic crosses and reliquaries, a golden hen and seven chickens, representing Lombardy and her seven provinces. Though the interior has suffered changes, there is a fine relief by Matteo da Campione representing a royal Lombard coronation, and some 15th-century frescoes with scenes from the life of Theodelinda.\nThe historical centre of Monza also includes the following landmarks:\nOther villas includes the Mirabello, Mirabellino, Durini, Crivelli Mesmer, Prata, Villa Archinto Pennati, Calloni and Villa Carminati-Ferrario.\nCulture and education.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Monza is typical of Insubria and Brianza. It is linked to culinary traditions and the bond with the nearby areas, especially with the Milanese cuisine. Typical dishes are cassoeula, the buseca, risotto with luganega.\nUniversity.\nThere are two departments of the University of Milan Bicocca located in Monza: the faculty of Medicine and Surgery and the Faculty of Sociology.\nMuseums.\nThe Duomo's (Cathedral) Museum collection is home to early medieval treasures from the time of Queen Theodelinda, including the gilt silver \"Hen with Chicks\", the Cross of Agilulf, and the Iron Crown; there are also pieces from the late medieval, modern and contemporary ages.\nTheatres and cinemas.\nTheatre in the city include the Teatro Manzoni, the Teatro Villoresi, the Teatro Binario 7. Cinemas include the Sala San Carlo, the AreaOdeon, the Cinema Capitol, the Cinema Metropol and the Cinema Teodolinda.\nSport.\nMonza Circuit.\nMonza is internationally known for the motor racing circuit, home to the Italian Grand Prix usually held in September, and previously to the Alfa Romeo team. Meanwhile, the Golf Club Milano is a golf course that has hosted nine editions of the Italian Open. Both are located inside the Monza Park, which comprises 688 ha.\nThe Italian Grand Prix has been hosted at the Monza circuit in every single year of Formula One history bar one (1980), and although no Italian has won the race since Ludovico Scarfiotti in 1966, the local support is for the Ferrari team, which has taken many historical wins on the circuit, especially with Michael Schumacher winning five times between 1996 and 2006. The event also saw Jody Scheckter secure the 1979 title in that event among other historical wins such as the Ferrari 1-2 finish against the odds in 1988. The Ferrari fans at Monza are known both in Italian and internationally as \"tifosi\". Aside from Ferrari, another Italian milestone at the venue was German 21-year old Sebastian Vettel taking his and Italian team Scuderia Toro Rosso's first win in torrential rain in 2008.\nThe event has been marred by tragedy several times, involving driver fatalities such as Wolfgang von Trips, Jochen Rindt and Ronnie Peterson, but also a fatal accident involving a trackside marshal in 2000, and multiple spectators being killed in von Trips' fatal accident in 1961. Monza is an extremely fast circuit that has been modified with three chicanes to curb speeds, but is still the fastest circuit on the Formula One calendar and is considered too fast to be considered to host MotoGP and no longer holds Superbike World Championship events either. When it hosted the Italian motorcycle Grand Prix it saw a double fatal accident for Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini in 1973 after a pile-up through the dauntingly fast \"Curva Grande\", that has since had significant runoff added to it. Italy's last Formula One champion Alberto Ascari also died at the Monza circuit in 1955, but it was during a test of a road car rather than during a race.\nOther.\nMonza's professional football club, AC Monza, play at the Stadio Brianteo. They were promoted to the Serie A, the top flight of Italian football, in 2022. AC Monza's under-19 team also plays in the top youth division (Primavera 1).\nMonza-based Vero Volley plays in the Serie A1, the top division for men's volleyball in Italy, since 2014. They play at the Monza Arena. Their women's team also plays at the Monza Arena in the women's Serie A1.\nIn 2006 Monza hosted the World Cyber Games tournament. In 2005 and 2008, Monza hosted the \"International Gran Gal\u00e0 Marching Show Bands\" at Stadio Brianteo (with the USA band Blue Devils, 11 times WMSB Champion of the World).\nTransport.\nRail.\nMonza railway station is the most important railway junction in the Brianza area. Travel between Monza and Milan via the Milan - Monza railway can be made both with suburban (lines S7, S8, S9 and S11) and regional trains, that furthermore connect Monza to Lecco/Sondrio, Como, Chiasso/Lugano (CH), Bergamo and Saronno (via the Saronno - Seregno railway). Also, some EuroCity trains stop in Monza. In early 2008, work began on the expansion of Milan subway Line M1 from Sesto San Giovanni to Monza Bettola, while works for the Line M5 extension from Milan to Monza railway station and the rest of the city, with 8 new stops through the city of Monza, started in 2024.\nMonza railway station is located on Enrico Arosio Road, on the southern edge of the historic city centre.\nRoads.\nMonza can be reached through the following motorways: A4-E64 (Turin-Milan-Venice), A52 (North Ring of Milan), A51 (East Ring of Milan). State road (SS36 \u2013 Nuova Valassina) connects the city to Lecco and Sondrio. A long tunnel has been added to try and alleviate traffic problems that are happening in the city.\nThe centre is off-limits to cars and other motorised vehicles.\nInternational relations.\nMonza is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65145", "revid": "1778754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65145", "title": "Paulo Coelho", "text": "Brazilian lyricist and novelist (born 1947)\nPaulo Coelho de Souza ( , ; born 24 August 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002. His 1988 novel \"The Alchemist\" became an international best-seller.\nEarly life.\nPaulo Coelho was born on 24 August 1947 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and attended a Jesuit school. At age 17, Coelho's parents committed him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Coelho later remarked that \"It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me.\"\nOn his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, travelling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s.\nCareer.\nSongwriting.\nUpon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. He is often accused of these songs being rip-offs of foreign songs not well known in Brazil at the time. In 1974, by his account, he was arrested for \"subversive\" activities and tortured by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.\nIn 1986, Coelho walked the 500-plus-mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. On the path, he had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in \"The Pilgrimage\". In an interview, Coelho stated \"[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water \u2013 to use the metaphor in \"The Alchemist\", I was working, I had a person whom I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer.\" Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.\nWriting.\nIn 1982, Coelho published his first book, \"Hell Archives\", which failed to make a substantial impact. In 1986, he contributed to the \"Practical Manual of Vampirism\", although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it \"of bad quality.\" After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986, Coelho wrote \"The Pilgrimage\", published in 1987.\nWhile trying to overcome his procrastination about launching his writing career, Coelho decided, \"If I see a white feather today, that is a sign that God is giving me that I have to write a new book.\" Seeing one in the window of a shop, he began writing that day. The following year, Coelho wrote \"The Alchemist\" and published it through a small Brazilian publishing house that made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint it. He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book \"Brida\", \"The Alchemist\" took off. HarperCollins decided to publish the book in 1994. Later, it became an international bestseller. In a 2009 interview with the Syrian \"Forward Magazine\", Coelho stated that the Sufi tradition had been an influence on him, particularly when writing \"The Alchemist\" and later \"The Zahir\".\nSince the publication of \"The Alchemist\", Coelho has generally written at least one novel every two years. Four of them \u2013 \"The Pilgrimage\", \"Hippie\", \"The Valkyries\" and\" Aleph\" \u2013 are autobiographical, while the majority of the rest are broadly fictional. Other books, like \"Maktub\", \"The Manual of the Warrior of Light\" and \"Like the Flowing River\", are collections of essays, newspaper columns, or selected teachings. His work has been published in more than 170 countries and translated into eighty-three languages. Together, his books have sold 320 million copies. On 22 December 2016, Coelho was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 2 in the list of 200 most influential contemporary authors.\nReception.\nReactions to his writing have not been without dissension. Though he was raised in a Catholic family and describes himself as of that faith even now, his stance has been described as incompatible with the Catholic faith, because of its New Age, pantheist and relativist contents. And whatever his sales, reviews of Coelho's later work consistently note its superficiality.\nIn 2016, he was contacted by basketball player Kobe Bryant, who wanted to discuss a children's book project with him. Some months before Bryant's death in a helicopter crash in January 2020, they started to write the book together, but upon hearing about his death, Coelho deleted the draft, saying in an interview that \"it didn't make any sense to publish without him.\" He did not say how many pages had been written or whether the book had a title.\nFilm.\n\"The Pilgrim \u2013 Story of Paulo Coelho\" is the international title for the biographical film \"N\u00e3o Pare na Pista\", a co-production between Brazil\u2019s Drama Films and the Spanish Babel Films, in which the younger and older Coelho are played by two different actors. One of the producers, I\u00f4na de Mac\u00eado, told \"Screen International\": \"The film tells the story of a man who has a dream. It's a little like \"Alice in Wonderland\" \u2013 he's someone who is too big for his house.\" The film, shot in Portuguese, had its premiere in Brazilian theatres in 2014 and was internationally distributed in 2015.\nPersonal life.\nCoelho married the artist Christina Oiticica in 1980. Together they had previously spent half the year in Rio de Janeiro and the other half in a French country house in the Pyrenees, but now the couple reside permanently in Geneva, Switzerland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65153", "revid": "29350589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65153", "title": "Tahiti", "text": "Island in French Polynesia\nTahiti (; , ; ) is the largest island of the Windward group of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France. It is located in the central part of the Pacific Ocean and the nearest major landmass is the North Island of New Zealand. The island was formed from volcanic activity in two overlapping parts, \"Tahiti Nui\" (bigger, northwestern part) and \"Tahiti Iti\" (smaller, southeastern part); it is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs. Its population was 189,517 in 2017, making it by far the most populous island in French Polynesia and accounting for 68.7% of its total population; the 2022 Census recorded a population of 191,779.\nTahiti is the economic, cultural, and political centre of French Polynesia. The capital of French Polynesia, Pape\u02bbete, is located on the northwest coast of Tahiti. The only international airport in the region, Fa\u02bba\u02bb\u0101 International Airport, is on Tahiti near Pape\u02bbete. Tahiti was originally settled by Polynesians between \u00a0CE. They represent about 70% of the island's population, with the rest made up of Europeans, Chinese and those of mixed heritage. The island was part of the Kingdom of Tahiti until its annexation by France in 1880, when it was proclaimed a colony of France, and the inhabitants became French citizens. French is the sole official language, although the Tahitian language (\"Reo Tahiti\") is also widely spoken.\nTahiti was called \"Otaheite\" in earlier European documents: this is a rendering of the Tahitian phrase , which is typically pronounced . When early Europeans asked the name of the island, the reply was \"'o Tahiti\", meaning \"it is Tahiti\".\nGeography.\nTahiti is the highest and largest island in French Polynesia lying close to Mo\u02bborea island. It is located south of Hawai\u02bbi, from Chile, from Australia.\nThe island is across at its widest point and covers an area of . The highest peak is Mont Orohena (Mou\u02bba \u02bbOrohena) (). Mount Roonui, or Mount Ronui (Mou\u02bba R\u014dnui), in the southeast rises to . The island consists of two roughly round portions centered on volcanic mountains and connected by a short isthmus of Taravao.\nThe northwestern portion is known as \"Tahiti Nui\" (\"big Tahiti\"), while the much smaller southeastern portion is known as \"Tahiti Iti\" (\"small Tahiti\") or \"Tai\u02bbarap\u016b\". \"Tahiti Nui\" is heavily populated along the coast, especially around the capital, Pape\u02bbete.\nThe interior of \"Tahiti Nui\" is almost entirely uninhabited. \"Tahiti Iti\" has remained isolated, as its southeastern half (\"Te Pari\") is accessible only to those travelling by boat or on foot. The rest of the island is encircled by a main road which cuts between the mountains and the sea. Tahiti's landscape features lush rainforests and many rivers and waterfalls, including the Papeno\u02bbo on the north side and the Fautaua Falls near Pape\u02bbete.\nGeology.\nBoth \"Tahiti Nui\" and \"Tahiti Iti\" are extinct and heavily eroded shield volcanoes which formed from volcanic activity associated with the Society hotspot.\nClimate.\nNovember to April is the wet season, the wettest month of which is January with of rain in Pape\u02bbete. August is the driest with .\nThe average temperature ranges between , with little seasonal variation. The lowest and highest temperatures recorded in Pape\u02bbete are , respectively.\nHistory.\nEarly settling of Tahiti.\nThe first Tahitians arrived from Western Polynesia into the Society Islands sometime after \u00a0CE; some studies have proposed slightly later dates, \u00a0CE. Linguistic, biological and archaeological evidence supports a long migration from Southeast Asia via the Fijian, Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos using outrigger canoes that were up to twenty or thirty metres long and could transport families as well as domestic animals.\nCivilization before the arrival of the Europeans.\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the island was divided into territories, each dominated by a single clan. The most important clans were the closely related Teva i Uta (Teva of the Interior) and the Teva i Tai (Teva of the Sea) whose combined territory extended from the peninsula in the south of Tahiti Nui.\nClan leadership consisted of a chief (\"ari\u02bbi rahi\"), nobles (\"ari\u02bbi\"), and under-chiefs (\"\u02bb\u012aato\u02bbai\"). The ari\u02bbi were also the religious leaders, revered for the mana (spiritual power) they inherited as descendants of the gods. As symbols of their power, they wore belts of red feathers. Nonetheless, to exercise their political power, councils or general assemblies composed of the ari\u02bbi and the \u02bb\u012aato\u02bbai had to be called, especially in case of war.\nThe chief's spiritual power was also limited; each clan's practice was organized around their \"marae\" (stone temple) and its priests.\nFirst European visits.\nThe first European to arrive at Tahiti may have been Spanish explorer Juan Fern\u00e1ndez in his expedition of 1576\u20131577. Alternatively, Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s, serving the Spanish Crown in an expedition to \"Terra Australis\", was perhaps the first European to see Tahiti. He sighted an inhabited island on 10 February 1606. However, it has been suggested that he actually saw the island of Rekareka to the southeast of Tahiti. Hence, although the Spanish and Portuguese made contact with nearby islands, they may not have arrived at Tahiti.\nThe next stage of European visits to the region came during the period of intense Anglo-French rivalry that filled the twelve years between the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. The first of these visits, and perhaps the first European visit to Tahiti, was under the command of Captain Samuel Wallis. While circumnavigating the globe in , they sighted the island on 18 June 1767 and then harbored in Matavai Bay between the chiefdom Pare-Arue (governed by Tu (Tu-nui-e-a\u02bba-i-te-Atua) and his regent Tutaha) and the chiefdom Ha\u02bbapape, governed by Amo and his wife \"Oberea\" (Purea). The initially friendly encounter turned tense as islanders grew suspicious and sought control of the Dolphin, leading to a week of skirmishes that culminated in violence, but to avert all-out war after a British show of force, Oberea laid down peace offerings leading to cordial relations.\nOn 2 April 1768, the expedition of Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, aboard and on the first French circumnavigation, sighted Tahiti. On 5 April, they anchored off Hitia\u02bba O Te Ra and were welcomed by its chief Reti. Bougainville was also visited by Tutaha. Bougainville stayed about ten days.\nBy 12 April 1769 Captain James Cook had arrived in Tahiti's Matavai Bay on a scientific mission with astronomy, botany, and artistic details. On 14 April Cook met Tutaha and Tepau and the next day he picked the site for a fortified camp at Point Venus for Charles Green's observatory. Botanist Joseph Banks and artist Sydney Parkinson, along with Cook, gathered valuable information on fauna and flora as well as on native society, language and customs, including the proper name of the island. Cook also met many island chiefs. Cook and \"Endeavour\" left Tahiti on 13 July 1769. Cook estimated the population to be 200,000 including all the nearby islands in the chain. This estimate was reduced to 35,000 by Cook's contemporary, anthropologist and Tahiti expert Douglas L. Oliver.\nThe Viceroy of Peru, Manuel de Amat y Juniet, under order of the Spanish Crown, organized an expedition to colonize the island in 1772. He would ultimately send three expeditions aboard the ship \"Aguila\", the first two under the command of navigator Domingo de Bonechea. Four Tahitians, Pautu, Tipitipia, Heiao, and Tetuanui, accompanied Bonechea back to Peru in early 1773 after the first \"Aguila\" expedition.\nCook returned to Tahiti between 15 August and 1 September 1773. Greeted by the chiefs, Cook anchored in Vaitepiha Bay before returning to Point Venus. Cook left Tahiti on 14 May 1774.\nPautu and Tetuanui returned to Tahiti with Bonechea aboard \"Aguila\" on 14 November 1774; Tipitipia and Heiao had died. Bonechea died on 26 January 1775 in Tahiti and was buried near the mission he had established at Tautira Bay. Lt Tomas Gayangos took over command and set sail for Peru on 27 January, leaving the Fathers Geronimo Clota and Narciso Gonzalez and the sailors Maximo Rodriguez and Francisco Perez in charge of the mission. On the third \"Aguila\" expedition, under Don Cayetano de Langara, the mission on Tahiti was abandoned on 12 November 1775, when the Fathers successfully begged to be taken back to Lima.\nDuring his final visit in 1777 Cook first moored in Vaitepiha Bay. From there he reunited with many Tahitian clans and established British presence on the remains of the Spanish mission. On 29 September 1777 Cook sailed for Papeto\u02bbai Bay on Mo\u02bborea.\nBritish influence and the rise of the P\u014dmare.\nMutineers of the \"Bounty\".\nOn 26 October 1788, , under the command of Captain William Bligh, landed in Tahiti with the mission of carrying Tahitian breadfruit trees (Tahitian: \"\u02bburu\") to the Caribbean. Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist from James Cook's first expedition, had concluded that this plant would be ideal to feed the African slaves working in the Caribbean plantations at very little cost. The crew remained in Tahiti for about five months, the time needed to transplant the seedlings of the trees. Three weeks after leaving Tahiti, on 28 April 1789, the crew mutinied on the initiative of Fletcher Christian. The mutineers seized the ship and set the captain and most of those members of the crew who remained loyal to him adrift in a ship's boat. A group of mutineers then went back to settle in Tahiti, after which the Bounty, under Christian, sailed to Pitcairn Island.\nAlthough various explorers had refused to get involved in tribal conflicts, the mutineers from the \"Bounty\" offered their services as mercenaries and furnished arms to the family which became the P\u014dmare Dynasty. The chief T\u016b knew how to use their presence in the harbours favoured by sailors to his advantage. As a result of his alliance with the mutineers, he succeeded in considerably increasing his supremacy over the island of Tahiti.\nIn about 1790, the ambitious chief T\u016b took the title of king and gave himself the name \"P\u014dmare\". Captain Bligh explains that this name was a homage to his eldest daughter Teri\u02bbinavahoroa, who had died of tuberculosis, \"an illness that made her cough (\"mare\") a lot, especially at night (\"p\u014d\")\". Thus he became P\u014dmare I, founding the P\u014dmare Dynasty and his lineage would be the first to unify Tahiti from 1788 to 1791. He and his descendants founded and expanded Tahitian influence to all of the lands that now constitute modern French Polynesia.\nIn 1791, under Captain Edward Edwards called at Tahiti and took custody of fourteen of the mutineers. Four were drowned in the sinking of \"Pandora\" on her homeward voyage, three were hanged, four were acquitted, and three were pardoned.\nLandings of the whalers.\nIn the 1790s, whalers began landing at Tahiti during their hunting expeditions in the southern hemisphere. The arrival of these whalers, who were subsequently joined by merchants coming from the penal colonies in Australia, marked the first major overturning of traditional Tahitian society. The crews introduced alcohol, arms and infectious diseases to the island. These commercial interactions with westerners had catastrophic consequences for the Tahitian population, which shrank rapidly, ravaged by diseases and other cultural factors. During the first decade of the 19th century, the Tahitian population dropped from 16,000 to 8,000\u20139,000; the French census in 1854 counted a population just under 6,000.\nArrival of the missionaries.\nOn 5 March 1797, representatives of the London Missionary Society landed at Matavai Bay (Mahina) on board \"Duff\", with the intention of converting the pagan native populations to Christianity. The arrival of these missionaries marked a new turning point for the island of Tahiti, having a lasting impact on the local culture.\nThe first years proved hard work for the missionaries, despite their association with P\u014dmare, the importance of whom they were aware of thanks to the reports of earlier sailors. In 1803, upon the death of P\u014dmare I, his son Vaira\u02bbatoa succeeded him and took the title of P\u014dmare II. He allied himself more and more with the missionaries, and from 1803 they taught him reading and the Gospels. Furthermore, the missionaries encouraged his wish to conquer his opponents, so that they would only have to deal with a single political contact, enabling them to develop Christianity in a unified country. The conversion of P\u014dmare II to Protestantism in 1812 marks moreover the point when Protestantism truly took off on the island.\nIn about 1810, P\u014dmare II married Teremo\u02bbemo\u02bbe daughter of the chief of Raiatea, to ally himself with the chiefdoms of the Leeward Islands. On 12 November 1815, thanks to these alliances, P\u014dmare II won a decisive battle at Fe\u02bbi P\u012b (Puna\u02bbauia), notably against Opuhara, the chief of the powerful clan of Teva. This victory allowed P\u014dmare II to be styled \"Ari\u02bbi Rahi\", or the king of Tahiti. It was the first time that Tahiti had been united under the control of a single family. This marked the end of Tahitian feudalism and the military aristocracy, which were replaced by an absolute monarchy. At the same time, Protestantism quickly spread, thanks to the support of P\u014dmare II, and replaced the traditional beliefs. In 1816 the London Missionary Society sent John Williams as a missionary and teacher, and starting in 1817, the Gospels were translated into Tahitian (\"Reo Maohi\") and taught in the religious schools. In 1818, the minister William Pascoe Crook founded the city of Pape\u02bbete, which became the capital of the island.\nIn 1819, P\u014dmare II, encouraged by the missionaries, introduced the first Tahitian legal code, known under the name of the P\u014dmare Legal Code, which consists of nineteen laws. The missionaries and P\u014dmare II thus imposed a ban on nudity (obliging them to wear clothes covering their whole body), banned dances and chants (described as immodest), tattoos, and costumes made of flowers.\nIn the 1820s, the entire population of Tahiti converted to Protestantism. Duperrey, who berthed in Tahiti in May 1823, attests to the change in Tahitian society in a letter dated 15 May 1823: \"The missionaries of the Royal Society of London have totally changed the morals and customs of the inhabitants. Idolatry no longer exists among them, and they generally profess the Christian religion. The women no longer come aboard the vessel, and even when we meet them on land they are extremely reserved. (...) The bloody wars that these people used to carry out and human sacrifices have no longer taken place since 1816.\"\nWhen, on 7 December 1821, P\u014dmare II died, his son P\u014dmare III was only eighteen months old. His uncle and the religious people therefore supported the regency, until 2 May 1824, the date on which the missionaries conducted his coronation, a ceremony unprecedented in Tahiti. Taking advantage of the weakness of the P\u014dmare, local chiefs won back some of their power and took the hereditary title of \"Tavana\" (from the English word \"governor\"). The missionaries also took advantage of the situation to change the way in which powers were arranged, and to make the Tahitian monarchy closer to the English model of a constitutional monarchy. They therefore created the Tahitian Legislative Assembly, which first sat on 23 February 1824.\nIn 1827, the young P\u014dmare III suddenly died, and it was his half-sister, \u02bbAimata, aged thirteen, who took the title of P\u014dmare IV. The Birmingham-born missionary George Pritchard, who was the acting British consul, became her main adviser and tried to interest her in the affairs of the kingdom but the authority of the Queen, who was certainly less charismatic than her father, was challenged by the chiefs, who had won back an important part of their prerogatives since the death of P\u014dmare II. The power of the P\u014dmare had become more symbolic than real; time and time again Queen P\u014dmare, Protestant and anglophile, sought in vain the protection of England.\nIn November 1835 Charles Darwin visited Tahiti aboard HMS \"Beagle\" on its circumnavigation, captained by Robert FitzRoy. He was impressed by what he perceived to be the positive influence the missionaries had had on the sobriety and moral character of the population. Darwin praised the scenery, but was not flattering towards Tahiti's Queen P\u014dmare IV. Captain Fitzroy negotiated payment of compensation for an attack on an English ship by Tahitians, which had taken place in 1833.\nIn Sept. 1839, the island was visited by the United States Exploring Expedition. One of its members, Alfred Thomas Agate, produced a number of sketches of Tahitian life, some of which were later published in the United States.\nFrench protectorate and the end of the P\u014dmare kingdom.\nIn 1836, the Queen's advisor Pritchard had two French Catholic priests expelled, Fran\u00e7ois Caret and Honor\u00e9 Laval. As a result, in 1838 France sent Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars to obtain reparations. Once his mission had been completed, Admiral Du Petit-Thouars sailed towards the Marquesas Islands, which he annexed in 1842. Also in 1842, a European crisis involving Morocco escalated between France and Great Britain, souring their relations. In August 1842, Admiral Du Petit-Thouars returned and landed in Tahiti. He then made friends with Tahitian chiefs who were hostile to the P\u014dmare family and favourable to a French protectorate. He had them sign a request for protection in the absence of their Queen, before then approaching her and obliging her to ratify the terms of the treaty of protectorate. The treaty had not even been ratified by France itself when Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout was named royal commissaire alongside Queen P\u014dmare.\nWithin the framework of this treaty, France recognised the sovereignty of the Tahitian state. The Queen was responsible for internal affairs, while France would deal with foreign relations and assure the defence of Tahiti, as well as maintain order on the island. Once the treaty had been signed there began a struggle for influence between the English Protestants and the Catholic representatives of France. During the first years of the Protectorate, the Protestants managed to retain a considerable hold over Tahitian society, thanks to their knowledge of the country and its language. George Pritchard had been away at the time. He returned however to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the Roman Catholic French.\nTahitian War of independence (1844\u201347).\nIn 1843, the Queen's Protestant advisor, Pritchard, persuaded her to display the Tahitian flag in place of the flag of the Protectorate. By way of reprisal, Admiral Dupetit-Thouars announced the annexation of the Kingdom of P\u014dmare on 6 November 1843 and set up the governor Armand Joseph Bruat there as the chief of the new colony. He threw Pritchard into prison, and later sent him back to Britain. The annexation caused the Queen to be exiled to the Leeward Islands, and after a period of troubles, a real Franco-Tahitian war began in March 1844. News of Tahiti reached Europe in early 1844. The French statesman Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, supported by King Louis-Philippe of France, had denounced annexation of the island.\nThe war ended in December 1846 in favour of the French. The Queen returned from exile in 1847 and agreed to sign a new covenant, considerably reducing her powers, while increasing those of the commissaire. Thus, the French reigned over the Kingdom of Tahiti. In 1863, they put an end to the British influence and replaced the British Protestant Missions with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des missions \u00e9vang\u00e9liques de Paris (Society of Evangelical Missions of Paris).\nLater 19th century.\nDuring the same period about a thousand Chinese, mainly Cantonese, were recruited at the request of a plantation owner in Tahiti, William Stewart, to work on the great cotton plantation at Atimaono. When the enterprise resulted in bankruptcy in 1873, some Chinese workers returned to their country, but a large number stayed in Tahiti and mixed with the population.\nIn 1866 the district councils were formed, elected, which were given the powers of the traditional hereditary chiefs. In the context of the republican assimilation, these councils tried their best to protect the traditional way of life of the local people, which was threatened by European influence.\nIn 1877, Queen P\u014dmare died after ruling for fifty years. Her son, P\u014dmare V, then succeeded her on the throne. The new king seemed little concerned with the affairs of the kingdom, and when in 1880 the governor Henri Isidore Chess\u00e9, supported by the Tahitian chiefs, pushed him to abdicate in favour of France, he accepted. On 29 June 1880, he ceded Tahiti to France along with the islands that were its dependencies. He was given the titular position of Officer of the Orders of the Legion of Honour and Agricultural Merit of France. Having become a colony, Tahiti thus lost all sovereignty. Tahiti was nevertheless a special colony, since all the subjects of the Kingdom of P\u014dmare would be given French citizenship. On 14 July 1881, among cries of \"Vive la R\u00e9publique!\" the crowds celebrated the fact that Polynesia now belonged to France; this was the first celebration of the Tiurai (national and popular festival). In 1890, Pape\u02bbete became a commune of the Republic of France.\nThe French painter Paul Gauguin lived on Tahiti in the 1890s and painted many Tahitian subjects. Papeari has a small Gauguin museum.\nIn 1891 Matthew Turner, an American shipbuilder from San Francisco who had been seeking a fast passage between the city and Tahiti, built , a two-masted schooner that made the trip in seventeen days.\nTwentieth century to present.\nIn 1903, the \u00c9tablissements Fran\u00e7ais d'Oc\u00e9anie (French Establishments in Oceania) were created, which collected together Tahiti, the other Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Marquesas Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago.\nDuring the First World War, the Pape\u02bbete region of the island was attacked by two German warships. A French gunboat as well as a captured German freighter were sunk in the harbour and the two German armoured cruisers bombarded the colony.\nAfter the capitulation of France and establishment of the Vichy government, French citizens in Tahiti overwhelmingly voted for allegiance to the Free France of general de Gaulle in a unofficial referendum of 24 August 1940, thus choosing the Allies side in World War II.\nIn 1946, Tahiti and the whole of French Polynesia became an overseas territory (\"Territoire d'outre-mer\"). Tahitians were granted French citizenship, a right that had been campaigned for by nationalist leader Pouvana\u02bba a Oopa for many years.\nFaa\u02bba International Airport was opened on Tahiti in 1960.\nBetween 1966 and 1996 the French Government conducted 193 surface and underwater nuclear bomb tests at the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa. The last test was conducted on 27 January 1996.\nOn 17 July 1974, the French did a nuclear test over Mururoa Atoll, codenamed Centaure, but the atomic cloud and fallout did not take the direction planned. 42 hours later, the cloud reached Tahiti and the surrounding islands. As many as 111,000 people were affected. Reports showed that some people on Tahiti were exposed to 500 times the maximum allowed level for plutonium.\nIn 2003, French Polynesia's status was changed to that of an overseas collectivity (\"collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer\"), and in 2004 it was declared an overseas country (\"pays d'outre-mer\" or \"POM\").\nIn 2009, Tauatomo Mairau claimed the Tahitian throne and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court.\nPolitics.\nTahiti is part of French Polynesia. French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous territory of France with its own assembly, president, budget and laws. France's influence is limited to subsidies, education, and security.\nTahitians are French citizens with complete civil and political rights. French is the official language, but Tahitian and French are both in use. However there was a time during the 1960s and 1970s when children were forbidden to speak Tahitian in schools. Tahitian is now taught in schools; it is sometimes even a requirement for employment.\nDuring a press conference on 26 June 2006 during the second France-Oceania Summit, French President Jacques Chirac said he did not think the majority of Tahitians wanted independence. He would keep an open door to a possible referendum in the future.\nElections for the Assembly of French Polynesia, the Territorial Assembly of French Polynesia, were held on 23 May 2004.\nIn a surprise result, Oscar Temaru's pro-independence progressive coalition, Union for Democracy, formed a government with a one-seat majority in the 57-seat parliament, defeating the conservative party, T\u0101h\u014d\u02bbera\u02bba Huira\u02bbatira, led by Gaston Flosse. On 8 October 2004, Flosse succeeded in passing a censure motion against the government, provoking a crisis. Flosse was removed from office in 2004 but was subsequently re-elected in 2008 after a period of political instability. His main rival Oscar Temaru served as the President of French Polynesia during multiple terms: 2004-2005, 2006-2008, and 2009-2013. He led the left-wing pro-independence party, Union for Democracy (UPLD). Temaru focused on greater autonomy for French Polynesia and calls for independence.\nDemographics.\nThe indigenous Tahitians are of Polynesian ancestry and make up 70% of the population alongside Europeans, East Asians (mostly Chinese), and people of mixed heritage, sometimes referred to as \"Demis\".\nThe places of birth of the 189,517 residents of the island of Tahiti at the 2017 census were the following:\nMost people from metropolitan France live in Pape\u02bbete and its suburbs, notably Puna\u02bbauia, where they made up 16.8% of the population at the 2017 census, and Arue, where they made up 15.9%; these percentages do not include their children born in French Polynesia.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe island consists of 12 communes, which, along with Mo\u02bborea-Mai\u02bbao, make up the Windward Islands administrative subdivision.\nThe capital is Pape\u02bbet\u0113 and the largest commune by population is Fa\u02bba\u02bb\u0101 while Tai\u02bbarapu-Est has the largest area.\nCommunes of Tahiti.\nThe following is a list of communes and their subdivisions sorted alphabetically:\nEconomy.\nTourism is a significant industry, generating 17% of GDP before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe main trading partners are Metropolitan France for about 40% of imports and about 25% of exports. The other main trading partners are China, the US, South Korea, and New Zealand.\nTahitian pearl (Black pearl) farming is also a substantial source of revenues, most of the pearls being exported to Japan, Europe and the United States. Tahiti also exports vanilla, fruits, flowers, monoi, fish, copra oil, and noni. Tahiti is also home to a single winery, whose vineyards are located on the Rangiroa atoll.\nUnemployment affects about 15% of the active population, especially women and unqualified young people.\nTahiti's currency, the French Pacific Franc (CFP, also known as XPF), is pegged to the euro at 1 CFP=EUR .0084 (1 EUR=119.48 CFP, approx. 113 CFP to the United States dollar in November 2024). Hotels and financial institutions offer exchange services.\nSales tax in Tahiti is called \"Taxe sur la valeur ajout\u00e9e\" (TVA or value added tax (VAT) in English). VAT in 2009 was 10% on tourist services, and 6% on hotels, small boarding houses, food and beverages. VAT on the purchase of goods and products is 16%.\nEnergy and electricity.\nFrench Polynesia imports its petroleum and has no local refinery or production capabilities. Daily consumption of imported oil products was 7,430 barrels in 2012 and 6,100 barrels per day in 2022, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The utility EDT operates hydroelectric plants, solar plants, and a 10 MWh battery to reduce oil demand.\nCulture.\nAs is mentioned in records of Captain Cook's visits, breadfruit is a staple crop. One main way of preparing it is documented in Joseph Banks' diaries: after it is very ripe, breadfruit can be buried in leaf-lined pits with weights placed on top of it, to allow it to ferment into a sour paste known as \"mahie\".\nArt.\nTahitian cultures included an oral tradition that involved the mythology of gods, such as \u02bbOro and beliefs, as well as ancient traditions such as tattooing and navigation. The annual Heiv\u0101 I Tahiti Festival in July is a celebration of traditional culture, dance, music and sports including a long-distance race between the islands of French Polynesia, in modern outrigger canoes (va\u02bba).\nThe Paul Gauguin Museum is dedicated to the life and works of French artist Paul Gauguin (1848\u20131903) who resided in Tahiti for years and painted such works as \"Two Tahitian Women\", \"Tahitian Women on the Beach\", and \"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\"\nThe Mus\u00e9e de Tahiti et des \u00celes (Museum of Tahiti and the Islands) is in Puna\u02bbauia. It is an ethnographic museum that was founded in 1974 to conserve and restore Polynesian artefacts and cultural practices.\nThe Robert Wan Pearl Museum is the world's only museum dedicated to pearls. The Pape\u02bbete Market sells local arts and crafts.\nDance.\nOne of the most widely recognised images of the islands is the world-famous Tahitian dance. The \"\u02bb\u014dte\u02bba\" (sometimes written as \"otea\") is a traditional dance from Tahiti, where the dancers, standing in several rows, execute figures. This dance, easily recognised by its fast hip-shaking and grass skirts, is often confused with the Hawai\u02bbian hula, a generally slower, more graceful dance which focuses more on the hands and storytelling than the hips.\nThe \u02bb\u014dte\u02bba is one of the few Tahitian men's dances that existed in pre-European times. On the other hand, the \"hura\" (Tahitian vernacular for \"hula\"), a dance for women, has disappeared, and the couples' dance \"\u02bbupa\u02bbupa\" is likewise gone but may have re-emerged as the tamure. Nowadays, the \u02bb\u014dte\u02bba can be danced by men (\"\u02bb\u014dte\u02bba t\u0101ne\"), by women (\"\u02bb\u014dte\u02bba vahine\"), or by both genders (\"\u02bb\u014dte\u02bba \u02bb\u0101mui\", \"united \u02bb\u014d\"). This dance is accompanied by instruments only, particularly drums; no singing is involved. The drum can be one of the types of the t\u014d\u02bbere, a laying log of wood with a longitudinal slit, which is struck by one or two sticks. Or it can be the \"pahu\", the ancient Tahitian standing drum covered with a shark skin and struck by the hands or with sticks. The rhythm from the t\u014d\u02bbere is fast; from the pahu it is slower. A smaller drum, the \"fa\u02bbatete\", can also be used.\nThe dancers make gestures that re-enact daily occupations of life. For the men the themes can include warfare or sailing, and they may use spears or paddles during such dances.\nFor women the themes are closer to home or from nature: combing their hair or the flight of a butterfly, for example. More elaborate themes can be chosen, for example, one where the dancers end up portraying a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper \u02bb\u014dte\u02bba the whole dance should be one story on a single theme.\nThe group dance called \u02bbaparima is often performed with the dancers dressed in pareo and maro. There are two types of \u02bbaparima: the \"\u02bbaparima h\u012bmene\" (sung handdance) and the \"\u02bbaparima v\u0101v\u0101\" (silent handdance), the latter of which is accompanied by instruments without any singing.\nNewer dances include the hivinau and the p\u0101\u02bb\u014d\u02bb\u0101.\nDeath.\nThe Tahitians believed in the afterlife, a paradise called Rohutu-no\u02bbano\u02bba. When a Tahitian died, the corpse was wrapped in barkcloth and placed on a funeral bier, \"fare tupapa \u02bbu\", which was a raised canoe awning on posts surrounded by bamboo. Food for the gods was placed nearby to prevent them from eating the body, which would condemn the spirit to the underworld. Mourners would slash themselves with shark's teeth and smear the blood on barkcloth placed nearby. Most importantly, the Chief Mourner donned the \"parae\", an elaborate costume that included an iridescent mask made of four polished pearl shell discs. One disk was black, signifying Po, the spirit world, while one was white, signifying Ao, the world of people. A crown of red feathers signified \u02bbOro. A curved wooden board, \"pautu\", below the mask contained five polished pearl shells, which signified Hina, the moon goddess. Hanging below were more shells in rows, \"ahu-parau\", representing the Pleiades, believed to be the eyes of former chiefs. Finally, a ceremonial garment, \"tiputa\", covered the body and was decorated with an apron of polished coconut shells, \"ahu-\u02bbaipu\".\nSport.\nThe Tahitian national sport is Va\u02bba. In English, this paddle sport is also known as outrigger canoe. The Tahitians consistently achieve record-breaking and top times as world champions in this sport.\nMajor sports in Tahiti include rugby union and association football and the island has fielded a national basketball team, which is a member of FIBA Oceania.\nAnother sport is surfing, with famous surfers such as Malik Joyeux and Michel Bourez. Teahupo\u02bbo is one of the deadliest surf breaks in the world.\nRugby union in Tahiti is governed by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Tahitienne de Rugby de Polyn\u00e9sie Fran\u00e7aise which was formed in 1989. The Tahiti national rugby union team has been active since 1971 but have only played 12 games since then.\nFootball in Tahiti is administered by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Tahitienne de Football and was founded in 1938. The Tahiti Division F\u00e9d\u00e9rale is the top division on the island and the Tahiti Championnat Enterprise is the second tier. Some of the major clubs are AS Manu-Ura, who play in Stade Hamuta, AS Pirae, who play in the Stade Pater Te Hono Nui and AS Tefana, who play in the Stade Louis Ganivet. Lesser clubs include Matavai. In 2012, the national team won the OFC Nations Cup qualifying for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil and becoming the first team other than Australia or New Zealand to win it.\nThe Tahiti Cup is the islands' premier football knockout tournament and has been played for since 1938. The winner of the Tahiti Cup goes on to play the winner of the Tahiti Division F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in the Tahiti Coupe des Champions.\nIn 2010, Tahiti was chosen as the host of the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, which was held in September 2013. The national team reached the semifinals. They achieved even more success in subsequent editions, the 2015 and 2017, where they reached the final on both occasions.\nTahiti has also been represented at the World Championship of P\u00e9tanque. They are the pre-eminent country in the Oceania region for P\u00e9tanque, undoubtedly due to their strong connections to France.\nAs part of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tahiti hosted the surfing competition. It was the only sport to be held outside of metropolitan France, as Paris, located away, hosts the international competition. \nThe Men's Shortboard gold medal was won by Tahitian Kauli Vaast.\nFilm.\nTahiti is depicted in the biography of Paul Gauguin in the 2017 French film \"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti\" portraying his life during his years on Tahiti.\nAlso linked to Tahiti are of the 1789 mutiny on HMS \"Bounty\" \u2013 e.g. \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962) with actor Marlon Brando, \"The Bounty\" (1984) with Mel Gibson.\nA more recent movie is the 2022 thriller film, \"Pacifiction\", related to French nuclear testing in the area.\nEducation.\nTahiti is home to the University of French Polynesia (Universit\u00e9 de la Polyn\u00e9sie Fran\u00e7aise). It is a growing university, with 3,200 students and 62 researchers. Courses are available in topics such as law, commerce, science, and literature. There are also high schools, including the Catholic Coll\u00e8ge La Mennais located in Pape\u02bbete.\nTransport.\nAir.\nFa\u02bba\u02bb\u0101 International Airport is located from Pape\u02bbete in the commune of Fa\u02bba\u02bb\u0101 and is the only international airport in French Polynesia. Because of limited level terrain, rather than levelling large stretches of sloping agricultural land, the airport is built primarily on reclaimed land on the coral reef just off-shore.\nInternational destinations such as Auckland, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney and Tokyo are served by Air France, Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui French Polynesia's flag carrier, Hawai\u02bbian Airlines, United Airlines, and French Bee.\nFlights within French Polynesia and to New Caledonia are available from Aircalin and Air Tahiti; Air Tahiti has their headquarters at the airport.\nFerry.\nThe Mo\u02bborea Ferry operates from Pape\u02bbete and takes about 45 minutes to travel to Mo\u02bborea. Other ferries are the Aremiti 5 and the Aremiti 7 and these two ferries sail to Mo\u02bborea in about half an hour. There are also several ferries that transport people and goods throughout the islands. The Bora Bora cruiseline sails to Bora Bora about once a week. The main hub for these ferries is the Pape\u02bbete Wharf.\nRoads.\nTahiti has a freeway that runs across its west coast, starting in Arue and continuing across the Pape\u02bbete urban area. From there, it continues along the west coast of Tahiti Nui through smaller villages and turns east toward Taravao where Tahiti Nui meets Tahiti Iti. The freeway transitions into a thin paved road at Teahupo\u02bbo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The play was first performed around 1607, by the King's Men at either the Blackfriars Theatre or the Globe Theatre. Its first appearance in print was in the First Folio published in 1623, under the title The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra.\nThe plot is based on Thomas North's 1579 English translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\" (in Ancient Greek) and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra's suicide during the War of Actium. The main antagonist is Octavius Caesar, one of Antony's fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first emperor of the Roman Empire. The tragedy is mainly set in the Roman Republic and Ptolemaic Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative Alexandria and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.\nMany consider Shakespeare's Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus describes as having \"infinite variety\", as one of the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright's body of work. She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses. It is difficult to classify \"Antony and Cleopatra\" as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a history play (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a tragedy, as a comedy, as a romance, and according to some critics, such as McCarter, a problem play. All that can be said with certainty is that it is a Roman play. It is perhaps a sequel to another of Shakespeare's tragedies, \"Julius Caesar\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSynopsis.\nMark Antony\u2014one of the triumvirs of the Roman Republic, along with Octavius and Lepidus\u2014has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt's Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome's domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife Fulvia rebelled against Octavius and then died.\nOctavius calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the Mediterranean. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves.\nThe triumvirs meet in Rome, where Antony and Octavius put to rest, for now, their disagreements. Octavius' general, Agrippa, suggests that Antony should marry Octavius's sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony accepts. Antony's lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he describes Cleopatra's charms: \"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies.\"\nA soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavius.\nIn Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger who brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair.\nBefore battle, the triumvirs parley with Sextus Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain Sicily and Sardinia, but he must help them \"rid the sea of pirates\" and send them tributes. After some hesitation, Sextus agrees. They engage in a drunken celebration on Sextus' galley, though the austere Octavius leaves early and sober from the party. Menas suggests to Sextus that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of the Roman Republic, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. After Antony departs Rome for Athens, Octavius and Lepidus break their truce with Sextus and war against him. This infuriates Antony.\nAntony returns to Hellenistic Alexandria and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Republic (which was Antony's share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavius of not giving him his fair share of Sextus' lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavius has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavius agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done.\nAntony prepares to battle Octavius. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavius has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, during the Battle of Actium off the western coast of Greece, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his forces to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying \"Give me a kiss; even this repays me.\"\nOctavius sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behavior. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land.\nOn the eve of the battle, Antony's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavius' side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus' goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.\nAntony loses the battle as his troops desert en masse and he denounces Cleopatra: \"This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.\" He resolves to kill her for the imagined treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony's love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony's return.\nHer plan backfires: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the \"dead\" Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument and dies in her arms.\nSince Egypt has been defeated, the captive Cleopatra is placed under a guard of Roman soldiers. She tries to take her own life with a dagger, but Proculeius disarms her. Octavius arrives, assuring her she will be treated with honour and dignity. But Dolabella secretly warns her that Octavius intends to parade her at his Roman triumph. Cleopatra bitterly envisions the endless humiliations awaiting her for the rest of her life as a Roman conquest.\nCleopatra kills herself using the venomous bite of an asp, imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids Iras and Charmian also die, Iras from heartbreak and Charmian from one of the two asps in Cleopatra's basket. Octavius discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free to become the first Roman Emperor, but he also feels some sympathy for them. He orders a public military funeral.\nSources.\nThe principal source for the story is an English translation of a French translation of Plutarch's \"Life of Mark Antony\", from the \"Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together\". This translation, by Sir Thomas North, was first published in 1579. Many phrases in Shakespeare's play are taken directly from North, including Enobarbus' famous description of Cleopatra and her barge:&lt;poem&gt;\nI will tell you.\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\nBurn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\nThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\nIt beggar'd all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion\u2014cloth-of-gold of tissue\u2014\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature: on each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n&lt;/poem&gt;This may be compared with North's text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Therefore when she was sent unto by diverse letters, both from Antonius himselfe, and also from his friends, she made so light of it and mocked Antonius so much, that she disdained so set forward otherwise, but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poope whereof was of gold, the sailes of purple, and the oares of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of musicke of flutes, howboyes cithernes, vials and such other instruments as they played upon the barge. And now for the person of her selfe: she was layed under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddesse Venus, commonly drawn in picture: and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretie fair boys apparelled as painters do set foorth god Cupid, with little fans in their hands, with which they fanned wind upon her.\u2014\u200a\nHowever, Shakespeare also adds scenes, including many portraying Cleopatra's domestic life, and the role of Enobarbus is greatly developed. Historical facts are also changed: in Plutarch, Antony's final defeat was many weeks after the Battle of Actium, and Octavia lived with Antony for several years and bore him two children: Antonia Major, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Nero and maternal grandmother of the Empress Valeria Messalina, and Antonia Minor, the sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger.\nDate and text.\nMany scholars believe Shakespeare's play was written in 1606\u201307, although some researchers have argued for an earlier dating, around 1603\u201304. \"Antony and Cleopatra\" was entered in the Stationers' Register (an early form of copyright for printed works) in May 1608, but it does not seem to have been actually printed until the publication of the First Folio in 1623. The Folio is therefore the only authoritative text today. Some scholars speculate that it derives from Shakespeare's own draft, or \"foul papers\", since it contains minor errors in speech labels and stage directions that are thought to be characteristic of the author in the process of composition.\nModern editions divide the play into a conventional five-act structure but, as in most of his earlier plays, Shakespeare did not create these act divisions. His play is articulated in forty separate \"scenes\", more than he used for any other play. Even the word \"scenes\" may be inappropriate as a description, as the scene changes are often very fluid, almost montage-like. The large number of scenes is necessary because the action frequently switches between Alexandria, Italy, Messina in Sicily, Syria, Athens, and other parts of Egypt and the Roman Republic. The play contains thirty-four speaking characters, fairly typical for a Shakespeare play on such an epic scale.\nAnalysis and criticism.\nClassical allusions and analogues: Dido and Aeneas from Virgil's \"Aeneid\".\nMany critics have noted the strong influence of Virgil's first-century Roman epic poem, the \"Aeneid\", on Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\". Such influence should be expected, given the prevalence of allusions to Virgil in the Renaissance culture in which Shakespeare was educated. The historical Antony and Cleopatra were the prototypes and antitypes for Virgil's Dido and Aeneas: Dido, ruler of the north African city of Carthage, tempts Aeneas, the legendary exemplar of Roman \"pietas\", to forego his task of founding Rome after the fall of Troy. The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido's temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome. Given the well-established traditional connections between the fictional Dido and Aeneas and the historical Antony and Cleopatra, it is no surprise that Shakespeare includes numerous allusions to Virgil's epic in his historical tragedy. As Janet Adelman observes, \"almost all the central elements in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" are to be found in the \"Aeneid\": the opposing values of Rome and a foreign passion; the political necessity of a passionless Roman marriage; the concept of an afterlife in which the passionate lovers meet.\" However, as Heather James argues, Shakespeare's allusions to Virgil's Dido and Aeneas are far from slavish imitations. James emphasizes the various ways in which Shakespeare's play subverts the ideology of the Virgilian tradition; one such instance of this subversion is Cleopatra's dream of Antony in Act 5 (\"I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony\" [5.2.75]). James argues that in her extended description of this dream, Cleopatra \"reconstructs the heroic masculinity of an Antony whose identity has been fragmented and scattered by Roman opinion.\" This politically charged dream vision is just one example of the way that Shakespeare's story destabilises and potentially critiques the Roman ideology inherited from Virgil's epic and embodied in the mythic Roman ancestor Aeneas.\nCritical history: changing views of Cleopatra.\nCleopatra, being the complex figure that she is, has faced a variety of interpretations of character throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy is that of the manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history of the character of Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great poise and capacity for leadership.\nThis phenomenon is illustrated by the famous poet T. S. Eliot's take on Cleopatra. He saw her as \"no wielder of power\", but rather that her \"devouring sexuality...diminishes her power\". His language and writings use images of darkness, desire, beauty, sensuality, and carnality to portray not a strong, powerful woman, but a temptress. Throughout his writing on Antony and Cleopatra, Eliot refers to Cleopatra as material rather than person. He frequently calls her \"thing\". Eliot conveys the view of early critical history on the character of Cleopatra.\nOther scholars also discuss early critics' views of Cleopatra in relation to a serpent signifying \"original sin\". The symbol of the serpent \"functions, at the symbolic level, as a means of her submission, the phallic appropriation of the queen's body (and the land it embodies) by Octavius and the empire\". The serpent, because it represents temptation, sin, and feminine weakness, is used by 19th and early 20th century critics to undermine Cleopatra's political authority and to emphasise the image of Cleopatra as manipulative seductress.\nThe postmodern view of Cleopatra is complex. Doris Adler suggests that, in a postmodern philosophical sense, we cannot begin to grasp the character of Cleopatra because, \"In a sense it is a distortion to consider Cleopatra at any moment apart from the entire cultural milieu that creates and consumes Antony and Cleopatra on stage. However the isolation and microscopic examination of a single aspect apart from its host environment is an effort to improve the understanding of the broader context. In similar fashion, the isolation and examination of the stage image of Cleopatra becomes an attempt to improve the understanding of the theatrical power of her infinite variety and the cultural treatment of that power.\" So, as a microcosm, Cleopatra can be understood within a postmodern context, as long as one understands that the purpose for the examination of this microcosm is to further one's own interpretation of the work as a whole. Author L.T. Fitz believes that it is not possible to derive a clear, postmodern view of Cleopatra due to the sexism that all critics bring with them when they review her intricate character. She states specifically, \"Almost all critical approaches to this play have been coloured by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.\" One seemingly anti-sexist viewpoint comes from Donald C. Freeman's articulations of the meaning and significance of the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra at the end of the play. Freeman states, \"We understand Antony as a grand failure because the container of his Romanness \"dislimns\": it can no longer outline and define him even to himself. Conversely, we understand Cleopatra at her death as the transcendent queen of \"immortal longings\" because the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her: unlike Antony, she never melts, but sublimates from her very earthly flesh to ethereal fire and air.\"\nThese constant shifts in the perception of Cleopatra are well-represented in a review of Estelle Parsons' adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" at the Interart Theatre in New York City. Arthur Holmberg surmises, \"What had at first seemed like a desperate attempt to be chic in a trendy New York manner was, in fact, an ingenious way to characterise the differences between Antony's Rome and Cleopatra's Egypt. Most productions rely on rather predictable contrasts in costuming to imply the rigid discipline of the former and the languid self-indulgence of the latter. By exploiting ethnic differences in speech, gesture, and movement, Parsons rendered the clash between two opposing cultures not only contemporary but also poignant. In this setting, the white Egyptians represented a graceful and ancient aristocracy\u2014well groomed, elegantly poised, and doomed. The Romans, upstarts from the West, lacked finesse and polish. But by sheer brute strength they would hold dominion over principalities and kingdoms.\" This assessment of the changing way in which Cleopatra is represented in modern adaptations of Shakespeare's play is yet another example of how the modern and postmodern view of Cleopatra is constantly evolving.\nCleopatra is a difficult character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality of which we occasionally get a glimpse. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it as a means of control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a \"grasping, licentious harlot\". However, despite her \"insatiable sexual passion\" she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is something in her passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.\nCleopatra's race.\nTheatrical portrayals of Cleopatra in Shakespeare and beyond have a complicated history. In the Pelican edition of \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Professor Albert R. Braunmuller discusses how, in the play she is insulted by Philo by being called a \"gypsy\" which is a derivative of the word \"Egyptian\" but also evokes imagery of \"Romany people, dark-haired, dark-skinned\" which would be in line with a much more racialized version of Cleopatra. The other notable insult used towards Cleopatra in the play is when Philo calls her \"tawny\". Braunmuller notes that \"tawny\" is \"hard to define historically\" but that it \"seems to have meant some brownish color, and Shakespeare elsewhere uses it to describe suntanned or sunburnt skin, which Elizabethan Canons of beauty regarded as undesirable.\"\nBraunmuller contextualizes all of this by reminding modern audiences that viewers and writers during Shakespeare's time would have had more complicated perspectives on race, ethnicity and related subjects and that their viewpoints were \"extremely hard to define\". There were also precursors to Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" that portrayed Cleopatra as having \"Macedonian-Greek descent.\nPascale Aebischer's analysis of race in Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" further discusses the historically and culturally ambiguous nature of Cleopatra's race. The paper enters into and gives context to the existing academic conversation surrounding the racial identity of Shakespeare's Cleopatra. Aebischer reviews the historical portrayals leading up to and including Shakespeare's portrayal of Cleopatra and uses them to analyze the opposing analyses of Cleopatra as either black or white and also to look at how race even functioned during the time period that plays like this were written. She concludes that portrayals of Cleopatra have been historically complicated and varied widely. Although, factually, she was of European ethnic origin, her racial identity on stage becomes intertwined with the cultural and social identity she is portraying in a way that makes determining her precise racial identity difficult. Aebischer points to scholars like 'Linda Charnes [who] cannily observe, \"descriptions of Cleopatra in [Shakespeare's] play are never more than descriptions of the effect she has on the onlooker\"'. Aebischer eventually concludes that \"we must accept that Shakespeare's Cleopatra is neither black nor white, but that should not stop us from appreciating the political significance of casting choices, nor should it fool us into thinking that, for a character like Cleopatra, any casting choice will ever be 'colourblind.'\" Within the context of theatrical portrayals of Cleopatra, Aebischer asserts that \"racial attributes are not properties that are embodied, but theatrical properties to be deployed and discarded at will.\"\nStructure: Egypt and Rome.\nThe relationship between Egypt and Rome in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is central to understanding the plot, as the dichotomy allows the reader to gain more insight into the characters, their relationships, and the ongoing events that occur throughout the play. Shakespeare emphasises the differences between the two nations with his use of language and literary devices, which also highlight the different characterisations of the two countries by their own inhabitants and visitors. Literary critics have also spent many years developing arguments concerning the \"masculinity\" of Rome and the Romans and the \"femininity\" of Egypt and the Egyptians. In traditional criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\", \"Rome has been characterised as a male world, presided over by the austere Caesar, and Egypt as a female domain, embodied by a Cleopatra who is seen to be as abundant, leaky, and changeable as the Nile\". In such a reading, male and female, Rome and Egypt, reason and emotion, and austerity and leisure are treated as mutually exclusive binaries that all interrelate with one another. The straightforwardness of the binary between male Rome and female Egypt has been challenged in later 20th-century criticism of the play: \"In the wake of feminist, poststructuralist, and cultural-materialist critiques of gender essentialism, most modern Shakespeare scholars are inclined to be far more skeptical about claims that Shakespeare possessed a unique insight into a timeless 'femininity'.\" As a result, critics have been much more likely in recent years to describe Cleopatra as a character that confuses or deconstructs gender than as a character that embodies the feminine.\nLiterary devices used to convey the differences between Rome and Egypt.\nIn \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Shakespeare uses several literary techniques to convey a deeper meaning about the differences between Rome and Egypt. One example of this is his schema of the container as suggested by critic Donald Freeman in his article, \"The rack dislimns.\" In his article, Freeman suggests that the container is representative of the body and the overall theme of the play that \"knowing is seeing.\" In literary terms a schema refers to a plan throughout the work, which means that Shakespeare had a set path for unveiling the meaning of the \"container\" to the audience within the play. An example of the body in reference to the container can be seen in the following passage:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nNay, but this dotage of our general's\nO'erflows the measure ...\nHis captain's heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of great fights hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper\nAnd is become the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gypsy's lust. (1.1.1\u20132, 6\u201310)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe lack of tolerance exerted by the hard-edged Roman military code allots to a general's dalliance is metaphorised as a container, a measuring cup that cannot hold the liquid of Antony's grand passion. Later we also see Antony's heart-container swells again because it \"o'erflows the measure.\" For Antony, the container of the Rome-world is confining and a \"measure\", while the container of the Egypt-world is liberating, an ample domain where he can explore. The contrast between the two is expressed in two of the play's famous speeches:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nLet Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\nOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!\nKingdoms are clay!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nFor Rome to \"melt is for it to lose its defining shape, the boundary that contains its civic and military codes.\" This schema is important in understanding Antony's grand failure because the Roman container can no longer outline or define him\u2014even to himself. Conversely we come to understand Cleopatra in that the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her. Unlike Antony whose container melts, she gains a sublimity being released into the air.\nIn her article \"Roman World, Egyptian Earth\", critic Mary Thomas Crane introduces another symbol throughout the play: The four elements. In general, characters associated with Egypt perceive their world composed of the Aristotelian elements, which are earth, wind, fire and water. For Aristotle these physical elements were the centre of the universe and appropriately Cleopatra heralds her coming death when she proclaims, \"I am fire and air; my other elements/I give to baser life\", (5.2.289\u2013290). Romans, on the other hand, seem to have left behind that system, replacing it with a subjectivity separated from and overlooking the natural world and imagining itself as able to control it. These differing systems of thought and perception result in very different versions of nation and empire. Shakespeare's relatively positive representation of Egypt has sometimes been read as nostalgia for an heroic past. Because the Aristotelian elements were a declining theory in Shakespeare's time, it can also be read as nostalgia for a waning theory of the material world, the pre-seventeenth-century cosmos of elements and humours that rendered subject and world deeply interconnected and saturated with meaning. Thus this reflects the difference between the Egyptians who are interconnected with the elemental earth and the Romans in their dominating the hard-surfaced, impervious world.\nCritics also suggest that the political attitudes of the main characters are an allegory for the political atmosphere of Shakespeare's time. According to Paul Lawrence Rose in his article \"The Politics of \"Antony and Cleopatra\"\", the views expressed in the play of \"national solidarity, social order and strong rule\" were familiar after the absolute monarchies of Henry VII and Henry VIII and the political disaster involving Mary Queen of Scots. Essentially the political themes throughout the play are reflective of the different models of rule during Shakespeare's time. The political attitudes of Antony, Caesar, and Cleopatra are all basic archetypes for the conflicting sixteenth-century views of kingship. Caesar is representative of the ideal king, who brings about the Pax Romana similar to the political peace established under the Tudors. His cold demeanour is representative of what the sixteenth century thought to be a side-effect of political genius. Conversely, Antony's focus is on valour and chivalry, and Antony views the political power of victory as a by-product of both. Cleopatra's power has been described as \"naked, hereditary, and despotic\", and it is argued that she is reminiscent of Mary Tudor's reign\u2014implying it is not coincidence that she brings about the \"doom of Egypt.\" This is in part due to an emotional comparison in their rule. Cleopatra, who was emotionally invested in Antony, brought about the downfall of Egypt in her commitment to love, whereas Mary Tudor's emotional attachment to Catholicism fates her rule. The political implications within the play reflect on Shakespeare's England in its message that Impact is not a match for Reason.\nThe characterization of Rome and Egypt.\nCritics have often used the opposition between Rome and Egypt in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" to set forth defining characteristics of the various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral. Critic James Hirsh has stated that, \"as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; Rome as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view.\"\nRome from the Roman perspective.\nAccording to Hirsh, Rome largely defines itself by its opposition to Egypt. Where Rome is viewed as structured, moral, mature, and essentially masculine, Egypt is the polar opposite; chaotic, immoral, immature, and feminine. In fact, even the distinction between masculine and feminine is a purely Roman idea which the Egyptians largely ignore. The Romans view the \"world\" as nothing more than something for them to conquer and control. They believe they are \"impervious to environmental influence\" and that they are not to be influenced and controlled by the world but vice versa.\nRome from the Egyptian perspective.\nThe Egyptians view the Romans as boring, oppressive, strict and lacking in passion and creativity, preferring strict rules and regulations.\nEgypt from the Egyptian perspective.\nThe Egyptian worldview reflects what Mary Floyd-Wilson has called geo-humoralism, or the belief that climate and other environmental factors shapes racial character. The Egyptians view themselves as deeply entwined with the natural \"earth\". Egypt is not a location for them to rule over, but an inextricable part of them. Cleopatra envisions herself as the embodiment of Egypt because she has been nurtured and moulded by the environment fed by \"the dung, / The beggar's nurse and Caesar's\" (5.2.7\u20138). They view life as more fluid and less structured allowing for creativity and passionate pursuits.\nEgypt from the Roman perspective.\nThe Romans view the Egyptians essentially as improper. Their passion for life is continuously viewed as irresponsible, indulgent, over-sexualised and disorderly. The Romans view Egypt as a distraction that can send even the best men off course. This is demonstrated in the following passage describing Antony.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nBoys who, being mature in knowledge,\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure,\nAnd so rebel judgment.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nUltimately the dichotomy between Rome and Egypt is used to distinguish two sets of conflicting values between two different locales. Yet, it goes beyond this division to show the conflicting sets of values not only between two cultures but within cultures, even within individuals. As John Gillies has argued \"the 'orientalism' of Cleopatra's court\u2014with its luxury, decadence, splendour, sensuality, appetite, effeminacy and eunuchs\u2014seems a systematic inversion of the legendary Roman values of temperance, manliness, courage\". While some characters fall completely into the category of Roman or Egyptian (Octavius as Roman, Cleopatra Egyptian) others, such as Antony, cannot choose between the two conflicting locales and cultures. Instead he oscillates between the two. In the beginning of the play Cleopatra calls attention to this saying\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHe was dispos'd to mirth, but on the sudden\nA Roman thought hath strook him.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis shows Antony's willingness to embrace the pleasures of Egyptian life, yet his tendency to still be drawn back into Roman thoughts and ideas.\nOrientalism plays a very specific, and yet, nuanced role in the story of Antony and Cleopatra. A more specific term comes to mind, from Richmond Barbour, that of proto-orientalism, that is orientalism before the age of imperialism. This puts Antony and Cleopatra in an interesting period of time, one that existed before the West knew much about what would eventually be called the Orient, but still a time where it was known that there were lands beyond Europe. This allowed Shakespeare to use widespread assumptions about the \"exotic\" east with little academic recourse. It could be said that Antony and Cleopatra and their relationship represent the first meeting of the two cultures in a literary sense, and that this relationship would lay the foundation for the idea of Western superiority vs. Eastern inferiority. The case could also be made that at least in a literary sense, the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra was some people's first exposure to an inter-racial relationship, and in a major way. This plays into the idea that Cleopatra has been made out to be an \"other\", with terms used to describe her like \"gypsy\". And it is this otherization that is at the heart of the piece itself, the idea that Antony, a man of Western origin and upbringing has coupled himself with the Eastern women, the stereotypical \"other\".\nEvolving views of critics regarding gender characterizations.\nFeminist criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" has provided a more in-depth reading of the play, has challenged previous norms for criticism, and has opened a larger discussion of the characterization of Egypt and Rome. However, as Gayle Greene so aptly recognises, it must be addressed that \"feminist criticism [of Shakespeare] is nearly as concerned with the biases of Shakespeare's interpretors [\"sic\"]\u2014critics, directors, editors\u2014as with Shakespeare himself.\"\nFeminist scholars, in respect to \"Antony and Cleopatra\", often examine Shakespeare's use of language when describing Rome and Egypt. Through his language, such scholars argue, he tends to characterise Rome as \"masculine\" and Egypt as \"feminine.\" According to Gayle Greene, \"the 'feminine' world of love and personal relationships is secondary to the 'masculine' world of war and politics, [and] has kept us from realizing that Cleopatra is the play's protagonist, and so skewed our perceptions of character, theme, and structure.\" The highlighting of these starkly contrasting qualities of the two backdrops of \"Antony and Cleopatra\", in both Shakespeare's language and the words of critics, brings attention to the characterization of the title characters, since their respective countries are meant to represent and emphasise their attributes.\nThe feminine categorization of Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" was often summarised as either \"the fall of a great general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it can be viewed as a celebration of transcendental love.\" In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to take a closer look at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.\nJonathan Gil Harris claims that the Egypt vs. Rome dichotomy many critics often adopt does not only represent a \"gender polarity\" but also a \"gender hierarchy\". Critical approaches to \"Antony and Cleopatra\" from the beginning of the 20th century mostly adopt a reading that places Rome as higher in the hierarchy than Egypt. Early critics like Georg Brandes presented Egypt as a lesser nation because of its lack of rigidity and structure and presented Cleopatra, negatively, as \"the woman of women, quintessentiated Eve.\" Egypt and Cleopatra are both represented by Brandes as uncontrollable because of their connection with the Nile River and Cleopatra's \"infinite variety\" (2.2.236).\nIn more recent years, critics have taken a closer look at previous readings of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and have found several aspects overlooked. Egypt was previously characterised as the nation of the feminine attributes of lust and desire while Rome was more controlled. However, Harris points out that Caesar and Antony both possess an uncontrollable desire for Egypt and Cleopatra: Caesar's is political while Antony's is personal. Harris further implies that Romans have an uncontrollable lust and desire for \"what they do not or cannot have.\" For example, Antony only desires his wife Fulvia after she is dead:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThere's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:\nWhat our contempt doth often hurl from us,\nWe wish it ours again; the present pleasure,\nBy revolution lowering, does become\nThe opposite of itself: she's good, being gone:\nThe hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn this way, Harris is suggesting that Rome is no higher on any \"gender hierarchy\" than Egypt.\nL. T. Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is \"colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.\" Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's \"wicked and manipulative\" ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the \"chaste and submissive\" Roman Octavia. Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes\u2018 argument: \"when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him.\" Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and \"would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero.\"\nThese criticisms are only a few examples of how the critical views of Egypt's \"femininity\" and Rome's \"masculinity\" have changed over time and how the development of feminist theory has helped in widening the discussion.\nThemes and motifs.\nAmbiguity and opposition.\nRelativity and ambiguity are prominent ideas in the play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature of many of the characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.\nA major theme running through the play is opposition. Throughout the play, oppositions between Rome and Egypt, love and lust, and masculinity and femininity are emphasised, subverted, and commented on. One of Shakespeare's most famous speeches, drawn almost verbatim from North's translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\", Enobarbus' description of Cleopatra on her barge, is full of opposites resolved into a single meaning, corresponding with these wider oppositions that characterise the rest of the play:\n&lt;poem&gt;The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\nBurn'd on the water...\n...she did lie\nIn her pavilion\u2014cloth-of-gold of tissue\u2014\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature: on each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did. (Act 2, Scene 2)&lt;/poem&gt;\nCleopatra herself sees Antony as both the Gorgon and Mars (Act 2 Scene 5, lines 118\u2013119).\nTheme of ambivalence.\nThe play is accurately structured with paradox and ambivalence in order to convey the antitheses that make Shakespeare's work remarkable.\nAmbivalence in this play is the contrasting response of one's own character. It may be perceived as opposition between word and deed but not to be confused with \"duality.\" For example, after Antony abandons his army during the sea battle to follow Cleopatra, he expresses his remorse and pain in his famous speech:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAll is lost; \nThis foul Egyptian hath betrayed me: \nMy fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder\nThey cast their caps up and carouse together \nLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou \nHast sold me to this novice; and my heart \nMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;\nFor when I am revenged upon my charm,\nI have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. [Exit SCARUS] \nO sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: \nFortune and Antony part here; even here\nDo we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts \nThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave \nTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets \nOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,\nThat overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:\nO this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,\u2014 \nWhose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home; \nWhose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,\u2014 \nLike a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,\nBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.\nWhat, Eros, Eros! [Enter CLEOPATRA] Ah, thou spell! Avaunt! (IV.12.2913\u20132938)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nHowever, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: \"All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me\"(3.12.69\u201370). Antony's speech conveys pain and anger, but he acts in opposition to his emotions and words, all for the love of Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: \"Antony's agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much.\" This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: \"the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves\". However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: \"Tell me how much you love.\" Tzachi Zamir points out: \"The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty\" and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.\nBetrayal.\nBetrayal is a recurring theme throughout the play. At one time or another, almost every character betrays their country, ethics, or a companion. However, certain characters waver between betrayal and loyalty. This struggle is most apparent in the actions of Cleopatra, Enobarbus, and most importantly Antony. Antony mends ties with his Roman roots and alliance with Caesar by entering into a marriage with Octavia, but he returns to Cleopatra. Diana Kleiner points out, \"Anthony's perceived betrayal of Rome was greeted with public calls for war with Egypt\". Although he vows to remain loyal in his marriage, his impulses and unfaithfulness to his Roman roots are what ultimately lead to war. Cleopatra twice abandons Antony during battle and whether out of fear or political motives, she deceived Antony. When Thidias, Caesar's messenger, tells Cleopatra Caesar will show her mercy if she will relinquish Antony, she is quick to respond:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Most kind messenger,\nSay to great Caesar this in deputation:\nI kiss his conqu'ring hand. Tell him I am prompt\nTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.\" (III.13.75\u201379)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nShakespeare critic Sara Deats says Cleopatra's betrayal fell \"on the successful fencing with Octavius that leaves her to be \"noble to [herself]\". However, she quickly reconciles with Antony, reaffirming her loyalty towards him and never truly submitting to Caesar.\nEnobarbus, Antony's most devoted friend, betrays Antony when he deserts him in favour of Caesar. But he exclaims, \"I fight against thee! / No: I will go seek some ditch wherein to die\" (IV. 6. 38\u201339). Although he abandoned Antony, critic Kent Cartwright claims Enobarbus' death \"uncovers his greater love\" for him considering it was caused by the guilt for what he had done to his friend, thus adding to the confusion of the characters' loyalty and betrayal that previous critics have also discovered. Even though loyalty is central to secure alliances, Shakespeare is making a point with the theme of betrayal by exposing how people in power cannot be trusted, no matter how honest their word may seem. The characters' loyalty and validity of promises are constantly called into question. The perpetual swaying between alliances strengthens the ambiguity and uncertainty amid the characters' loyalty and disloyalty.\nPower dynamics.\nAs a play concerning the relationship between two empires, the dynamics of power becomes a recurring theme. Antony and Cleopatra battle over this dynamic as heads of state, yet the theme of power also resonates in their romantic relationship. The Roman ideal of power lies in a political nature taking a base in economical control. As an imperialist power, Rome takes its power in the ability to change the world. As a Roman man, Antony is expected to fulfill certain qualities pertaining to his Roman masculine power, especially in the war arena and in his duty as a soldier:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThose his goodly eyes,\nThat o'er the files and musters of the war\nHave glowed like plated mars, now bend, now turn\nThe office and devotion of their view\nUpon a tawny front. His captain's heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of greatness hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all tempers,\nAnd is becomes the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gipsy's lust.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nCleopatra's character is slightly unpindown-able, as her character identity retains a certain aspect of mystery. She embodies the mystical, exotic, and dangerous nature of Egypt as the \"serpent of old Nile\". Critic Lisa Starks says that \"Cleopatra [comes] to signify the double-image of the \"temptress/goddess\". She is continually described in unearthly terms, extending to her description as the goddess Venus.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n...For her own person,\nIt beggared all description. She did lie\nIn her pavilion\u2014cloth of gold, of tissue\u2014\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis mysteriousness connected with the supernatural not only captures the audience and Antony, but also draws all other characters' focus. As a subject of conversation even when not present in the scene, Cleopatra is continually a central point, therefore demanding control of the stage. As an object of sexual desire, she is connected to the Roman need to conquer. Her mixture of sexual prowess with political power is a threat to Roman politics. She retains her deep involvement in the military aspect of her rule, especially when she asserts herself as \"the president of [her] kingdom will/ Appear there for a man.\" Where the dominating power lies is up for interpretation, yet there are several mentions of the power exchange in their relationship in the text. Antony remarks on Cleopatra's power over him multiple times throughout the play, the most obvious being sexual innuendo: \"You did know / How much you were my conqueror, and that / My sword, made weak by my affection, would / Obey it on all cause.\"\nUse of language in power dynamics.\nManipulation and the quest for power are very prominent themes not only in the play but specifically in the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra. Both utilise language to undermine the power of the other and to heighten their own sense of power.\nCleopatra uses language to undermine Antony's assumed authority over her. Cleopatra's \"'Roman' language of command works to undermine Antony's authority.\" By using a Romanesque rhetoric, Cleopatra commands Antony and others in Antony's own style. In their first exchange in Act I, scene 1, Cleopatra says to Antony, \"I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.\" In this case Cleopatra speaks in an authoritative and affirming sense to her lover, which to Shakespeare's audience would be uncharacteristic for a female lover.\nAntony's language suggests his struggle for power against Cleopatra's dominion. Antony's \"obsessive language concerned with structure, organization, and maintenance for the self and empire in repeated references to 'measure,' 'property,' and 'rule' express unconscious anxieties about boundary integrity and violation.\" (Hooks 38) Furthermore, Antony struggles with his infatuation with Cleopatra and this paired with Cleopatra's desire for power over him causes his eventual downfall. He states in Act I, scene 2, \"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,/Or lose myself in dotage.\" Antony feels restrained by \"Egyptian fetters\" indicating that he recognises Cleopatra's control over him. He also mentions losing himself in dotage\u2014\"himself\" referring to Antony as Roman ruler and authority over people including Cleopatra.\nCleopatra also succeeds in causing Antony to speak in a more theatrical sense and therefore undermine his own true authority. In Act I, scene 1, Antony not only speaks again of his empire but constructs a theatrical image: \"Let Rome and Tiber melt, and the wide arch/Of the ranged empire fall... The nobleness of life/Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair/And such a twain can do't\u2014in which I bind/On pain of punishment the world to weet/We stand up peerless.\" Cleopatra immediately says, \"Excellent falsehood!\" in an aside, indicating to the audience that she intends for Antony to adopt this rhetoric.\nYachnin's article focuses on Cleopatra's usurping of Antony's authority through her own and his language, while Hooks' article gives weight to Antony's attempts to assert his authority through rhetoric. Both articles indicate the lovers' awareness of each other's quests for power. Despite awareness and the political power struggle existent in the play, Antony and Cleopatra both fail to achieve their goals by the play's conclusion.\nPerforming gender and crossdressing.\nThe performance of gender.\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" is essentially a male-dominated play in which the character of Cleopatra takes significance as one of few female figures and definitely the only strong female character. As Oriana Palusci says in her article \"When Boys or Women Tell Their Dreams: Cleopatra and the Boy Actor\", \"Cleopatra constantly occupies the centre, if not of the stage, certainly of the discourse, often charged with sexual innuendos and disparaging tirades, of the male Roman world\". We see the significance of this figure by the constant mention of her, even when she is not on stage.\nWhat is said about Cleopatra is not always what one would normally say about a ruler; the image that is created makes the audience expect \"to see on stage not a noble Sovereign, but a dark, dangerous, evil, sensual and lewd creature who has harnessed the 'captain's heart\". This dangerously beautiful woman is difficult for Shakespeare to create because all characters, male or female, were played by men. Phyllis Rackin points out that one of the most descriptive scenes of Cleopatra is spoken by Enobarbus: \"in his famous set speech, Enobarbus evokes Cleopatra's arrival on the Cynus\". It is an elaborate description that could never possibly be portrayed by a young boy actor. It is in this way that \"before the boy [playing Cleopatra] can evoke Cleopatra's greatness, he must remind us that he cannot truly represent it\". The images of Cleopatra must be described rather than seen on stage. Rackin points out that \"it is a commonplace of the older criticism that Shakespeare had to rely upon his poetry and his audience's imagination to evoke Cleopatra's greatness because he knew the boy actor could not depict it convincingly\".\nThe constant comments of the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought on the foreign and particularly of Egyptians. From the perspective of the reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare's \"Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum\". It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra \"embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart\". To many of Antony's crew, his actions appear extravagant and over the top: \"Antony's devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational\". It is no wonder, then, that she is such a subordinated queen.\nAnd yet she is also shown as having real power in the play. When threatened to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: \"She is not to be silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: 'My resolution and my hands I'll trust/ None about Caesar' (IV. 15.51\u201352)\". From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.\nInterpretations of crossdressing within the play.\nScholars have speculated that Shakespeare's original intention was to have Antony appear in Cleopatra's clothes and vice versa in the beginning of the play. This possible interpretation seems to perpetuate the connections being made between gender and power. Gordon P. Jones elaborates on the importance of this detail:\nSuch a saturnalian exchange of costumes in the opening scene would have opened up a number of important perspectives for the play's original audience. It would immediately have established the sportiveness of the lovers. It would have provided a specific theatrical context for Cleopatra's later reminiscence about another occasion on which she \"put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan\" (II.v.22\u201323). It would have prepared the ground for Cleopatra's subsequent insistence on appearing \"for a man\" (III.vii.18) to bear a charge in the war; in doing so, it would also have prepared the audience for Antony's demeaning acquiescence in her usurpation of the male role.\nThe evidence that such a costume change was intended includes Enobarbus' false identification of Cleopatra as Antony:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nDomitius Enobarbus: Hush! here comes Antony.\nCharmian: Not he; the queen.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nEnobarbus could have made this error because he was used to seeing Antony in the queen's garments. It can also be speculated that Philo was referring to Antony cross-dressing in Act 1, scene 1:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nPhilo: Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,\nHe comes too short of that great property\nWhich still should go with Antony.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn the context of cross-dressing, \"not Antony\" could mean \"when Antony is dressed as Cleopatra.\"\nIf Shakespeare had indeed intended for Antony to crossdress, it would have drawn even more similarities between Antony and Hercules, a comparison that many scholars have noted many times before. Hercules (who is said to be an ancestor of Antony) was forced to wear Queen Omphale's clothing while he was her indentured servant. The Omphale myth is an exploration of gender roles in Greek society. Shakespeare might have paid homage to this myth as a way of exploring gender roles in his own.\nHowever, it has been noted that, while women dressing as men (i.e., a boy actor acting a female character who dresses as a man) are common in Shakespeare, the reverse (i.e., a male adult actor dressing as a woman) is all but non-existent, leaving aside Antony's debated case.\nCritics' interpretations of boys portraying female characters.\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" also contains self-references to the crossdressing as it would have been performed historically on the London stage. For instance, in Act Five, Scene Two, Cleopatra exclaims, \"Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore\" (ll. 214\u2013217). Many scholars interpret these lines as a metatheatrical reference to Shakespeare's own production, and by doing so comments on his own stage. Shakespeare critics such as Tracey Sedinger interpret this as Shakespeare's critique of the London stage, which, by the perpetuation of boy actors playing the part of the woman, serves to establish the superiority of the male spectator's sexuality. The male-male relationship, some critics have offered, between the male audience and the boy actor performing the female sexuality of the play would have been less threatening than had the part been played by a woman. It is in this manner that the London stage cultivated in its audience a chaste and obedient female subject, while positioning male sexuality as dominant. Shakespeare critics argue that the metatheatrical references in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" seem to critique this trend and the presentation of Cleopatra as a sexually empowered individual supports their argument that Shakespeare seems to be questioning the oppression of female sexuality in London society. The crossdresser, then, is not a visible object but rather a structure \"enacting the failure of a dominant epistemology in which knowledge is equated with visibility\". What is being argued here is that the cross-dressing on the London stage challenges the dominant epistemology of Elizabethan society that associated sight with knowledge. The boy actors portraying female sexuality on the London stage contradicted such a simple ontology.\nCritics such as Rackin interpret Shakespeare's metatheatrical references to the crossdressing on stage with less concern for societal elements and more of a focus on the dramatic ramifications. Rackin argues in her article on \"Shakespeare's Boy Cleopatra\" that Shakespeare manipulates the crossdressing to highlight a motif of the play\u2014recklessness\u2014which is discussed in the article as the recurring elements of acting without properly considering the consequences. Rackin cites the same quote, \"Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore\" to make the argument that here the audience is reminded of the very same treatment Cleopatra is receiving on Shakespeare's stage (since she is being portrayed by a boy actor) (V.ii.214\u2013217). Shakespeare, utilizing the metatheatrical reference to his own stage, perpetuates his motif of recklessness by purposefully shattering \"the audience's acceptance of the dramatic illusion\".\nOther critics argue that the crossdressing as it occurs in the play is less of a mere convention, and more of an embodiment of dominant power structures. Critics such as Charles Forker argue that the boy actors were a result of what \"we may call androgyny\". His article argues that \"women were barred from the stage for their own sexual protection\" and because \"patriarchally acculturated audiences presumably found it intolerable to see English women\u2014those who would represent mothers, wives, and daughters\u2014in sexually compromising situations\". Essentially, the crossdressing occurs as a result of the patriarchally structured society.\nEmpire.\nSexuality and empire.\nThe textual motif of empire within \"Antony and Cleopatra\" has strong gendered and erotic undercurrents. Antony, the Roman soldier characterised by a certain effeminacy, is the main article of conquest, falling first to Cleopatra and then to Caesar (Octavius). Cleopatra's triumph over her lover is attested to by Caesar himself, who gibes that Antony \"is not more manlike/ Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy/ More womanly than he\" (1.4.5\u20137). That Cleopatra takes on the role of male aggressor in her relationship with Antony should not be surprising; after all, \"a culture attempting to dominate another culture will [often] endow itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones\"\u2014appropriately, the queen's romantic assault is frequently imparted in a political, even militaristic fashion. Antony's subsequent loss of manhood seemingly \"signifies his lost Romanness, and Act 3, Scene 10, is a virtual litany of his lost and feminised self, his \"wounder chance\". Throughout the play, Antony is gradually bereaved of that Roman quality so coveted in his nostalgic interludes\u2014by the centremost scenes, his sword (a plainly phallic image), he tells Cleopatra, has been \"made weak by his affection\" (3.11.67). In Act 4, Scene 14, \"an un-Romaned Antony\" laments, \"O, thy vile lady!/ She has robb'd me of my sword\", (22\u201323)\u2014critic Arthur L. Little Jr. writes that here \"he seems to echo closely the victim of raptus, of bride theft, who has lost the sword she wishes to turn against herself. By the time Antony tries to use his sword to kill himself, it amounts to little more than a stage prop\". Antony is reduced to a political object, \"the pawn in a power game between Caesar and Cleopatra\".\nHaving failed to perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means with which he might \"write himself into Rome's imperial narrative and position himself at the birth of empire\" is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; \"once [he] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido\". \"Antony and Cleopatra\" can be read as a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: \"If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than it is surely significant that Shakespeare's [\"sic\"]... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back for the sake of his African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas\". Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of \"occupying the... politically empowering place\" of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person\u2014\"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame\"\u2014informs the view of some critics that the Roman \"figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... [he] not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over\". In reciprocal contrast, \"in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals\". While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally\u2014indeed, \"she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd\" (2.2.232\u2013233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that \"as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility\". Caesar says of her final deed, \"Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way\" (5.2.325\u2013327).\nArthur L. Little, in agitative fashion, suggests that the desire to overcome the queen has a corporeal connotation: \"If a black\u2014read foreign\u2014man raping a white woman encapsulates an iconographic truth... of the dominant society's sexual, racial, national, and imperial fears, a white man raping a black woman becomes the evidentiary playing out of its self-assured and cool stranglehold over these representative foreign bodies\". Furthermore, he writes, \"Rome shapes its Egyptian imperial struggle most visually around the contours of Cleopatra's sexualised and racialised black body\u2014most explicitly her \"tawny front\", her \"gipsy's lust\", and her licentious climactic genealogy, \"with Phoebus' amorous pinches black\". In a similar vein, essayist David Quint contends that \"with Cleopatra the opposition between East and West is characterised in terms of gender: the otherness of the Easterner becomes the otherness of the opposite sex\". Quint argues that Cleopatra (not Antony) fulfils Virgil's Dido archetype; \"woman is subordinated as is generally the case in \"The Aeneid\", excluded from power and the process of Empire-building: this exclusion is evident in the poem's fiction where Creusa disappears and Dido is abandoned... woman's place or displacement is therefore in the East, and epic features a series of oriental heroines whose seductions are potentially more perilous than Eastern arms\", i.e., Cleopatra.\nPolitics of empire.\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" deals ambiguously with the politics of imperialism and colonization. Critics have long been invested in untangling the web of political implications that characterise the play. Interpretations of the work often rely on an understanding of Egypt and Rome as they respectively signify Elizabethan ideals of East and West, contributing to a long-standing conversation about the play's representation of the relationship between imperializing western countries and colonised eastern cultures. Despite Octavius Caesar's concluding victory and the absorption of Egypt into Rome, \"Antony and Cleopatra\" resists clear-cut alignment with Western values. Indeed, Cleopatra's suicide has been interpreted as suggesting an indomitable quality in Egypt, and reaffirming Eastern culture as a timeless contender to the West. However, particularly in earlier criticism, the narrative trajectory of Rome's triumph and Cleopatra's perceived weakness as a ruler have allowed readings that privilege Shakespeare's representation of a Roman worldview. Octavius Caesar is seen as Shakespeare's portrayal of an ideal governor, though perhaps an unfavourable friend or lover, and Rome is emblematic of reason and political excellence. According to this reading, Egypt is viewed as destructive and vulgar; the critic Paul Lawrence Rose writes: \"Shakespeare clearly envisages Egypt as a political hell for the subject, where natural rights count for nothing.\" Through the lens of such a reading, the ascendancy of Rome over Egypt does not speak to the practice of empire-building as much as it suggests the inevitable advantage of reason over sensuality.\nMore contemporary scholarship on the play, however, has typically recognised the allure of Egypt for \"Antony and Cleopatra\"'s audiences. Egypt's magnetism and seeming cultural primacy over Rome have been explained by efforts to contextualise the political implications of the play within its period of production. The various protagonists' ruling styles have been identified with rulers contemporary to Shakespeare. For example, there appears to be continuity between the character of Cleopatra and the historical figure of Queen Elizabeth I, and the unfavourable light cast on Caesar has been explained as deriving from the claims of various 16th-century historians.\nThe more recent influence of New Historicism and post-colonial studies have yielded readings of Shakespeare that typify the play as subversive, or challenging the status quo of Western imperialism. The critic Abigail Scherer's claim that \"Shakespeare's Egypt is a holiday world\" recalls the criticisms of Egypt put forth by earlier scholarship and disputes them. Scherer and critics who recognise the wide appeal of Egypt have connected the spectacle and glory of Cleopatra's greatness with the spectacle and glory of the theatre itself. Plays, as breeding grounds of idleness, were subject to attack by all levels of authority in the 1600s; the play's celebration of pleasure and idleness in a subjugated Egypt makes it plausible to draw parallels between Egypt and the heavily censored theatre culture in England. In the context of England's political atmosphere, Shakespeare's representation of Egypt, as the greater source of poetry and imagination, resists support for 16th century colonial practices. Importantly, King James' sanction of the founding of Jamestown occurred within months of \"Antony and Cleopatra\"'s debut on stage. England during the Renaissance found itself in an analogous position to the early Roman Republic. Shakespeare's audience may have made the connection between England's westward expansion and \"Antony and Cleopatra\"'s convoluted picture of Roman imperialism. In support of the reading of Shakespeare's play as subversive, it has also been argued that 16th century audiences would have interpreted \"Antony and Cleopatra\"'s depiction of different models of government as exposing inherent weaknesses in an absolutist, imperial, and by extension monarchical, political state.\nEmpire and intertextuality.\nOne of the ways to read the imperialist themes of the play is through a historical, political context with an eye for intertextuality. Many scholars suggest that Shakespeare possessed an extensive knowledge of the story of Antony and Cleopatra through the historian Plutarch, and used Plutarch's account as a blueprint for his own play. A closer look at this intertextual link reveals that Shakespeare used, for instance, Plutarch's assertion that Antony claimed a genealogy that led back to Hercules, and constructed a parallel to Cleopatra by often associating her with Dionysus in his play. The implication of this historical mutability is that Shakespeare is transposing non-Romans upon his Roman characters, and thus his play assumes a political agenda rather than merely committing itself to a historical recreation. Shakespeare deviates from a strictly obedient observation of Plutarch, though, by complicating a simple dominant/dominated dichotomy with formal choices. For instance, the quick exchange of dialogue might suggest a more dynamic political conflict. Furthermore, certain characteristics of the characters, like Antony whose \"legs bestrid the ocean\" (5.2.82) point to constant change and mutability. Plutarch, on the other hand, was given to \"tendencies to stereotype, to polarise, and to exaggerate that are inherent in the propaganda surrounding his subjects.\"\nFurthermore, because of the unlikelihood that Shakespeare would have had direct access to the Greek text of Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" and probably read it through a French translation from a Latin translation, his play constructs Romans with an anachronistic Christian sensibility that might have been influenced by St. Augustine's \"Confessions\" among others. As Miles writes, the ancient world would not have been aware of interiority and the contingence of salvation upon conscience until Augustine. For the Christian world, salvation relied on and belonged to the individual, while the Roman world viewed salvation as political. So, Shakespeare's characters in \"Antony and Cleopatra\", particularly Cleopatra in her belief that her own suicide is an exercise of agency, exhibit a Christian understanding of salvation.\nAnother example of deviance from the source material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the \"order of exclusive society\" that the lovers surrounded themselves with\u2014a society with a specifically defined and clear understanding of the hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status\u2014Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is a tragedy. For Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\", the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in \"Othello\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Coriolanus\".\nFortune and chance: politics and nature.\nThe concept of luck, or Fortune, is frequently referenced throughout \"Antony and Cleopatra\", portrayed as an elaborate \"game\" that the characters participate in. An element of Fate lies within the play's concept of Chance, as the subject of Fortune/Chance's favour at any particular moment becomes the most successful character. Shakespeare represents Fortune through elemental and astronomical imagery that recalls the characters' awareness of the \"unreliability of the natural world\". This calls into question the extent to which the characters' actions influence the resulting consequences, and whether the characters are subject to the preferences of Fortune or Chance. Antony eventually realises that he, like other characters, is merely \"Fortune's knave\", a mere card in the game of Chance rather than a player. This realization suggests that Antony realises that he is powerless in relation to the forces of Chance, or Fortune. The manner in which the characters deal with their luck is of great importance, therefore, as they may destroy their chances of luck by taking advantage of their fortune to excessive lengths without censoring their actions, as Antony did. Scholar Marilyn Williamson notes that the characters may spoil their Fortune by, \"riding too high\" on it, as Antony did by ignoring his duties in Rome and spending time in Egypt with Cleopatra. While Fortune does play a large role in the characters' lives, they do have ability to exercise free will, however; as Fortune is not as restrictive as Fate. Antony's actions suggest this, as he is able to use his free will to take advantage of his luck by choosing his own actions. Like the natural imagery used to describe Fortune, scholar Michael Lloyd characterises it as an element itself, which causes natural occasional upheaval. This implies that fortune is a force of nature that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play can be related to that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor. The play culminates, however, in Antony's realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.\nThe motif of \"card playing\" has a political undertone, as it relates to the nature of political dealings. Caesar and Antony take action against each other as if playing a card game; playing by the rules of Chance, which sways in its preference from time to time. Although Caesar and Antony may play political cards with each other, their successes rely somewhat on Chance, which hints at a certain limit to the control they have over political affairs. Furthermore, the constant references to astronomical bodies and \"sublunar\" imagery connote a Fate-like quality to the character of Fortune, implying a lack of control on behalf of the characters. Although the characters do exercise free will to a certain extent, their success in regard to their actions ultimately depends on the luck that Fortune bestows upon them. The movement of the \"moon\" and the \"tides\" is frequently mentioned throughout the play, such as when Cleopatra states that, upon Antony's death, there is nothing of importance left \"beneath the moon.\" The elemental and astronomical \"sublunar\" imagery frequently referred to throughout the play is thus intertwined with the political manipulation that each character incites, yet the resulting winner of the political \"game\" relies in part on Chance, which has a supreme quality that the characters cannot maintain control over, and therefore must submit to.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65171", "revid": "49337131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65171", "title": "Deobandi movement", "text": "Sunni revivalist movement in South Asia\nThe Deobandi movement or Deobandism is a revivalist movement within Sunni Islam that adheres to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. It was formed in the late 19th century around the Darul Uloom Madrassa in Deoband, India, from which the name derives, by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Ashraf Ali Thanwi and Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri after the Indian Rebellion of 1857\u201358. They opposed the influence of non-Muslim cultures on the Muslims living in South Asia. The movement pioneered education in religious sciences through the \"Dars-i-Nizami\" associated with the Lucknow-based of Firangi Mahal with the goal of preserving traditional Islamic teachings from the influx of modernist and secular ideas during British colonial rule. The Deobandi movement's Indian clerical wing, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, was founded in 1919 and played a major role in the Indian independence movement through its participation in the pan-Islamist \"Khilafat\" movement and propagation of the doctrine of composite nationalism.\nIn terms of jurisprudence, the Deobandis uphold the doctrine of \"\" (conformity to a school of thought) and adhere to the Hanafi school. Founders of the Deobandi school Nanautavi and Gangohi drew inspiration from the religious and political doctrines of the South Asian Islamic scholar, Salafi-oriented Sufi and theologian Ismail Dehlawi (26 April 1779 \u2013 6 May 1831). In its early years, Deobandi scholars engaged in theological debates with Christian and Hindu scholars; with the objective of defending Islamic faith, and to form a popular struggle to overthrow British colonialism. Deobandi theologians of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, in particular, discussed multiculturalism and opposition to the partition of India, with a strategic vision to safeguard the religious freedom of Muslims in India.\nThe movement has spread from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to the United Kingdom, and has a presence in South Africa. The Pakistani branch and the original Indian seminaries have far less contact since the Partition of India, for political reasons related to the India\u2013Pakistan border. Followers of the Deobandi movement are extremely diverse; some advocate for non-violence and others are militant.\nFoundation and expansion.\nBritish colonialism in India was seen by a group of Indian scholars\u2014consisting of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Muhammad Yaqub Nanautawi, Shah Rafi al-Din, Sayyid Muhammad Abid, Zulfiqar Ali, Fazlur Rahman Usmani and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi\u2014to be corrupting Islam. The group founded an Islamic seminary (\"madrassa\") known as Darul Uloom Deoband, where the Islamic revivalist and anti-imperialist ideology of the Deobandis began to develop. In time, the Darul Uloom Deoband became the second largest focal point of Islamic teaching and research after the Al-Azhar University, Cairo. Towards the time of the Indian independence movement and afterward in post-colonial India, the Deobandis advocated a notion of composite nationalism by which Muslims and Hindus were seen as one nation who were asked to be united in the struggle against the British rule.\nIn 1919, a large group of Deobandi scholars formed the political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and opposed the partition of India. Deobandi scholar Hussain Ahmad Madani helped to spread these ideas through his text \"Muttahida Qaumiyat Aur Islam\". A group later dissented from this position and joined Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League, including Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Zafar Ahmad Usmani and Muhammad Shafi, who formed the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam in 1945.\nThrough the organisations such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Tablighi Jamaat, the Deobandi movement began to spread. Graduates of Darul Uloom Deoband in India from countries such as South Africa, China, and Malaysia opened thousands of \"madaaris\" throughout the world.\nIndia.\nThe Deobandi movement in India is managed and spread by Darul Uloom Deoband and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.\nPakistan.\nOf Pakistan's estimated 230 million Muslims, some 15-30% consider themselves Deobandi. According to Heritage Online, nearly 65% of the total seminaries (Madrasah) in Pakistan are run by Deobandis, whereas 25% are run by Barelvis, 6% by Ahl-i Hadith and 3% by various Shia organisations. The Deobandi movement in Pakistan was a major recipient of funding from Saudi Arabia from the early 1980s up until the early 2000s, where after this funding was diverted to the rival Ahl-i Hadith movement. Having seen Deoband as a counterbalance to Iranian influence in the region, Saudi funding is now strictly reserved for the Ahl-i Hadith.\nDeobandi-affiliated groups such as the TTP, SSP, Let, etc. have a militant character and have attacked and destroyed Sufi sites holy to Sunni Muslims of the Barelvi movement, such as Data Darbar in Lahore, Abdullah Shah Ghazi's tomb in Karachi, Khal Magasi in Balochistan, and Rahman Baba's tomb in Peshawar.\nAfghanistan.\nDeobandi is the most popular Islamic movement in the Pashtun belt on both sides of the Durand Line that separates Afghanistan and Pakistan. Moreover, prominent Afghan and Pakistani Taliban leaders have studied in Deobandi seminaries.\nSouth Africa.\nThe Deobandi Movement has an international presence today, with its full-fledged manifestation in South Africa, a country where the movement was initiated through the Indian Gujarati merchant class. The Islamic education system of the Deobandi movement, as well as the necessary components of social and political organisations such as the Tablighi Jamat and Jamiatul Ulama South Africa are fully functioning effectively in South Africa, as they do in India. Madrasas in South Africa provide Islamic higher education and are now centers for Islamic education for foreigners who are interested in receiving a Deobandi-style education. Many of their graduates, especially from Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, are Western students. Some of South African madrasas are recognised globally, providing fatwa services. South Africa is now known for producing exceptional Islamic literature through translation and compilation. Similarly, the Tabligh Jamaat is a hub in South Africa that spreads throughout South and East Africa. Graduates of South African madrassas spend their time in service of the Tablighi Jamaat, among them are Zakariyya Kandhlawi, Masihullah Khan, Mahmood Hasan Gangohi and Asad Madni. South African Deobandi Muslims have many important and influential educational and socio-political organisations that educate the people and play an important role in religious and social activities. Among them are Jamiatul Ulama South Africa and the Muslim Judicial Council.\nIran.\nStudents from various regions, including Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran, attended Deoband, which led to the spread of its founders ideas. This movement had a significant impact on some of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After entering Iran, the students of this school continued to expand this thinking and with the formation of missionary groups. These thoughts have been strengthened on one hand due to the cultural relationships between the Baloch tribes and on the other hand due to the connection of Sistan and Baluchestan's Iran and India's Hanafi religious leaders in Iran. Today, Deobandi thinking is one of the intellectual currents in Sistan and Baluchestan and preaching groups are active in different cities and villages. Its playing a crucial role in Iran's political landscape. The Deobandis aimed to homogenise religious schools and were opposed to certain popular practices. The Naqshbandi order played an important role for the Deobandi movement in the Persian-speaking world.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the 1970s, Deobandis opened the first British-based Muslim religious seminaries (Darul-Ulooms), educating imams and religious scholars. Deobandis \"have been quietly meeting the religious and spiritual needs of a significant proportion of British Muslims, and are perhaps the most influential British Muslim group.\" In 2007, the Deobandis ran 17 seminaries (out of a total of 26 in the UK) and were producing 80 percent of home-trained Muslim clerics. They also ran 600 of Britain's nearly 1,500 mosques. In 2014 it was reported that 45 per cent of Britain's mosques and nearly all the UK-based training of Islamic scholars were controlled by the Deobandis.\nJournalist Andrew Norfolk found that the leading Deobandi preacher loathed western values, called on Muslims to \"shed blood\" for Allah and preached contempt for Jews, Christians and Hindus. In 2015 Ofsted highlighted the Deobandi seminary in Holcombe as a good example of a school \"promoting British values, preventing radicalisation and protecting children\". Norfolk disagreed with the assessment.\nBeliefs.\nThe Deobandi movement sees itself as a scholastic tradition that grew out of the Islamic scholastic traditions of the pre-colonial Indian subcontinent and Afghanistan, and it considers its visionary forefather to be Ismail Dehlawi (26 April, 1779 \u2013 6 May, 1831). Dehlawi was a contemporary of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and they studied in Medina under some of the same teachers. Muhammad Iqbal said: \"The Deobandi movement is neither a creed (Aqidah) nor a denomination (Tayifa) \u2013 terms by which its antagonists try to incite the masses against it \u2013 but it is a comprehensive picture and a complete edition of the tack of the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama\u2019ah in which all the offshoots of the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama\u2019ah are seen joined with their root.\"\nTheology.\nDeobandis follow the Maturidi school of Sunni Islamic theology. Their schools teach a short text on beliefs known as \"al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyya\" by the Hanafi-Maturidi scholar Najm al-Din 'Umar al-Nasafi.\nThe official Deobandi book, \"al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad\" (The Sword on the Disproved), also known as: \"al-Tasdiqat li-Daf' al-Talbisat\" (Endorsements Repelling Deceits), is a work that summarises the beliefs generally held by the Deobandis. It was authored by Khalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri (d. 1346/1927) in order to defend and remit the Deobandis from the charge of kufr (unbelief or blasphemy) levied against them by their opponents.\nAccording to Brannon D. Ingram, Deobandis differ from Barelvis on three theological positions. Gangohi stated that God has the ability to lie. This doctrine is called \"Imkan-i Kizb\". According to this doctrine, because God is omnipotent, God is capable of lying. Gangohi also supported the doctrine that God has the ability to make additional prophets after Muhammad (\"Imkan-i Nazir\") and other prophets equal to Muhammad. Gangohi clarifies that although God has the ability to make prophets on \"par\" with Muhammad, he \"would never do so\".\nSome Deobandis, known as \"Mamati\" Deobandis, believe that the Prophet is not alive in his grave. This contrasts with the \"Hayati\" Deobandis and Barelvis who believe that he is alive in his grave.\nFiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).\nDeobandis are strong proponents of the doctrine of \"Taqlid\". In other words, they believe that a Deobandi must adhere to one of the four schools (madhhabs) of Sunni Islamic Law and discourage inter-school eclecticism. They themselves claim to be the followers of the Hanafi school. Students at madrasas affiliated with the Deobandi movement study the classic books of Hanafi Law such as \"Nur al-Idah\", \"Mukhtasar al-Quduri\", \"Sharh al-Wiqayah\", and \"Kanz al-Daqa\u2019iq\", culminating their study of the madhhab with the \"Hidayah\" of \"al-Marghinani\".\nWith regard to views on \"Taqlid\", one of their main opposing reformist groups are the Ahl-i-Hadith, also known as the \"Ghair Muqallid\", the nonconformists, because they eschewed \"taqlid\" in favor of the direct use of Quran and Hadith. They often accuse those who adhere to the rulings of one scholar or legal school of blind imitation\",\" and frequently demand scriptural evidence for every argument and legal ruling. Almost since the very beginnings of the movement, Deobandi scholars have generated a copious amount of scholarly output in an attempt to defend their adherence to a \"madhhab\" in general. In particular, Deobandis have penned much literature in defense of their argument that the Hanafi madhhab is in complete accordance with the \"Quran\" and \"Hadith\".\nHadith.\nIn response to this need to defend their \"madhhab\" in the light of scripture, Deobandis became particularly distinguished for their unprecedented salience to the study of \"Hadith\" in their madrasas. Their \"madrasa\" curriculum incorporates a feature unique among the global arena of Islamic scholarship, the \"Daura-e Hadis\", the capstone year of a student's advanced madrasa training, in which all six canonical collections of the Sunni Hadith (the \"Sihah Sittah\") are reviewed.\nIn a Deobandi madrasa, the position of \"Shaykh al-Hadith\", or the resident professor of Sahih Bukhari, is held in much reverence. Their views were widely shared by a broad range of Islamic reform movements of the colonial period.\nSufism.\nKhalil Ahmad Saharanpuri outlined the creedal beliefs of Deobandis in his \"Al-Muhannad ala al-Mufannad\":\nOur way is following the greatest Imam, Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man \u2013 Allah Exalted is He be pleased with him \u2013 in the peripherals; and followers of the noble Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari and the noble Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (Allah be pleased with them) in creed and the fundamentals; and that we are adherents to the following Sufi ways: the most distinguished way of the Naqshbandi masters, the most pure way of the Chishti masters, the most glorious way of the Qadiri masters, and the most radiant way of the Suhrawardi masters (Allah be pleased with them all).\n\u2014\u200aAl-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad (Questions One and Two)\nHowever, Deobandis are strictly opposed to Mawlid (celebrations the birthday of Muhammad), urs (remembrances of the death date of notable religious figures), and mourning of Muharram.\nDeobandis also reject reverence for walis (Sufi saints), including the construction of maqams (structures over graves) and ziyarat (pilgrimage) to them, as well as \"urs\". They also reject religious practices associated with dervishes and Sufis such as dhikr (recitation of prayers), singing qawwalis, and performing sama, which are used to achieve wajd (religious ecstacy), as they believe these are bid'ah (\"forbidden religious innovations\"). Deobandis oppose various forms of intercession such as tawassul and istighatha, which they label as apostasy and shirk (denial of Islam).\nDeoband's curriculum combined the study of Islamic holy books (the Quran, hadith and religious law) with rational subjects (logic, philosophy and science). At the same time, it was strongly Sufi in orientation and affiliated with the Chishti Order. Taqi Usmani, the most famous Deobandi scholar, was trained as a Chishti, as were the four founders of the Deoband madrasa. Mahmood Ashraf Usmani, the former head of Darul Ulum Karachi, defended the concept of tariqa and bay'ah based on the incident of the Pledge of the Tree. Ashraf Ali Thanwi graduated from Darul Uloom Deoband and was widely considered a preeminent Sufi of modern India. \nThe founders of the Deobandi school, Qasim Nanawtawi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, were inspired by the doctrine of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and other sources. Gangohi studied under the Sufi shaykh Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, although he differed with him on many points. However Gangohi's \"Fatawa-yi Rashidiyya\" rejected Sufi practices.\nGangohi opposed the Sufi doctrine that Muhammad has knowledge of the unseen (\"ilm-e Ghayb\"). This belief of the Deobandis conflicts with traditional Sufi views of Muhammad having unparalleled and unequal knowledge that encompasses the unseen realm. Gangohi also issued multiple fatwas against Mawlid and stated it is bid\u02bfah, and opposed the practice of standing up in honour of Muhammad during the day of Mawlid.\nZakariyya Kandhlawi, noted hadith scholar and Deobandi shaykh, stated, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScholarship.\nDeobandi fiqh.\nDeobandi fiqh, originating from the Hanafi school of Islamic law, is a distinctive school of Islamic jurisprudence that highly values the strict adherence to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, also known as Taqlid. Deobandi scholars view Taqlid as a crucial means of ensuring the proper interpretation and application of Islamic law, especially for individuals without the necessary knowledge and expertise to engage in Ijtihad. However, Ijtihad is also recognised as necessary for the evolution of Islamic law, but it should be approached with caution and respect for Islamic scholarship traditions. Darul Uloom Deoband established the first Department of Fatwa, or Darul Ifta, in 1892, followed by other Deobandi madrasas and organisations such as the Islamic Fiqh Academy (India), which constitute the bedrock for the development of the Deobandi fiqh. Rashid Ahmad Gangohi is considered the founder of Deobandi fiqh, with Ashraf Ali Thanwi and Aziz-ul-Rahman Usmani regarded as key figures. The earliest text of Deobandi fiqh is \"Fatawa-e-Rashidiya\", with other important texts including \"Imdad-ul-Fatawa\" and \"Fatawa Darul Uloom Deoband\". Deobandi fiqh plays a vital role in Afghanistan's judiciary system, with Taqi Usmani and Khalid Saifullah Rahmani recognised as prominent contemporary faqihs of the Deobandi school. Digital initiatives such as Darulifta-Deoband.com and Askimam demonstrate the digitisation of Deobandi fiqh. A significant fatwa in Deobandi fiqh is the \"Fatwa of Peace for Humanity\", issued by Farid Uddin Masood in 2016, endorsed by over 100,000 Islamic scholars from Bangladesh, declaring terrorism as haram or forbidden, based on Islamic scripture and tradition.\nPolitics.\nDeobandi jihadism.\nDeobandi jihadism pertains to a militant interpretation of Islam that draws upon the teachings of the Deobandi movement. The Deobandi movement underwent three waves of armed conflict. The first wave resulted in the establishment of an Islamic territory centered on Thana Bhawan by the movement's elders during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, prior to the founding of Darul Uloom Deoband. Imdadullah Muhajir Makki served as the Amir al-Mu'minin of this Islamic territory, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi as the Chief justice, and Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi as the Commander-in-chief. However, following the British victory over the Deobandi forces in the Battle of Shamli, the territory fell. After the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband, Mahmud Hasan Deobandi initiated the second wave. He attempted to mobilise an armed resistance against the British through various initiatives, including the formation of the Samratut Tarbiat. When the British uncovered his Silk Letter Movement, they arrested him and held him captive in Malta. Following his release, he and his followers entered mainstream politics and actively participated in the democratic process. In the late 1970s, the Pakistan\u2013Afghan border became the epicenter of the Deobandi jihadist movement's third wave, which was fueled by the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Under the auspices of President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, its expansion occurred through various madrasas, such as Darul Uloom Haqqania and Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia, with political support provided by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S). Trained militants from the Pakistan\u2013Afghan border participated in the Afghan jihad and later formed various organisations, including the Taliban. The most prominent example of Deobandi jihadism is the Taliban, who established Islamic rule in Afghanistan. Sami-ul-Haq, the head of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S), is regarded as the \"father of the Taliban.\"\nOrganisations.\nJamiat Ulema-I-Hind.\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind is one of the leading Deobandi organisations in India. It was founded in British India in 1919 by Ahmad Saeed Dehlavi, Sanaullah Amritsari and several other scholars including Kifayatullah Dehlawi who was elected its first interim president. The Jamiat has propounded a theological basis for its nationalistic philosophy. Their thesis is that Muslims and non-Muslims have entered upon a mutual contract in India since independence, to establish a secular state. The Constitution of India represents this contract.\nJamiat Ulema-e-Islam.\nJamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) is a Deobandi organisation, part of the Deobandi movement. The JUI formed when members broke from the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in 1945 after that organisation backed the Indian National Congress against the Muslim League's lobby for a separate Pakistan. The first president of the JUI was Shabbir Ahmad Usmani.\nMajlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam.\nMajlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam (), also known in short as Ahrar, was a conservative Deobandi political party in the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj (prior to the independence of Pakistan) founded 29 December 1929 at Lahore. Chaudhry Afzal Haq, Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi, Mazhar Ali Azhar, Zafar Ali Khan and Dawood Ghaznavi were the founders of the party. The Ahrar was composed of Indian Muslims disillusioned by the Khilafat Movement, which cleaved closer to the Congress Party. The party was associated with opposition to Muhammad Ali Jinnah and against establishment of an independent Pakistan as well as criticism of the Ahmadiyya movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Majlis-e-Ahrar divided in two parts. Now, Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam is working for the sake of Muhammad, nifaaz Hakomat-e-illahiyya and Khidmat-e-Khalq. In Pakistan, Ahrar secretariat is in Lahore and in India it is based in Ludhiana.\nTablighi Jamaat.\nTablighi Jamaat, a non-political Deobandi missionary organisation, began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement. Its inception is believed to be a response to Hindu reform movements, which were considered a threat to vulnerable and non-practising Deobandi Muslims. It gradually expanded from a local to a national organisation, and finally to a transnational movement with followers in over 200 countries. Although its beginnings were from the Deobandi movement, it has now established an independent identity though it still maintains close ties with Deobandi ulema in many countries with large South Asian Muslim populations such as the UK.\nAssociated militant organisations.\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi.\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ) (Army of Jhangvi) was a Deobandi militant organisation. Formed in 1996, it operated in Pakistan as an offshoot of Sipah-e-Sahaba (SSP). Riaz Basra broke away from the SSP over differences with his seniors. The group, now practically defunct since the unsuccessful Operation Zarb-e-Azab, is considered a terrorist group by Pakistan and the United States, It was involved in attacks on civilians and protectors of them. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is predominantly Punjabi. The group has been labelled by intelligence officials in Pakistan as a major security threat.\nTaliban.\nThe Taliban (\"students\"), alternative spelling Taleban, is an Islamic fundamentalist political and militant movement in Afghanistan. It spread into Afghanistan and formed a government, ruling as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from September 1996 until December 2001, with Kandahar as the capital.\nWhile in power, it enforced its strict interpretation of Sharia law. While many leading Muslims and Islamic scholars have been highly critical of the Taliban's interpretations of Islamic law, the Darul Uloom Deoband has consistently supported the Taliban in Afghanistan, including their 2001 destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, and the majority of the Taliban's leaders were influenced by Deobandi fundamentalism. Pashtunwali, the Pashtun tribal code, also played a significant role in the Taliban's legislation. The Taliban were condemned internationally for their brutal treatment of women.\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan.\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (the TTP), alternatively referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, is an umbrella organisation of various Islamist militant groups based in the northwestern Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Pakistan. In December 2007 about 13 groups united under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud to form the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. Among the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan's stated objectives are resistance against the Pakistani state, enforcement of their interpretation of sharia and a plan to unite against NATO-led forces in Afghanistan.\nThe TTP is not directly affiliated with the Afghan Taliban movement led by Mullah Omar, with both groups differing greatly in their histories, strategic goals and interests although they both share a primarily Deobandi interpretation of Islam and are predominantly Pashtun.\nSipah-e-Sahaba.\nSipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) is a banned Pakistani militant organisation, and a formerly registered Pakistani political party. Established in the early 1980s in Jhang by the militant leader Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, its stated goal is primarily to deter major Shiite influence in Pakistan in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. The organisation was banned by President Pervez Musharraf in 2002 as being a terrorist group under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.\nIn October 2000 Masood Azhar, another militant leader, and founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), was quoted as saying that \"Sipah-e-Sahaba stands shoulder to shoulder with Jaish-e-Muhammad in Jehad.\" A leaked U.S. diplomatic cable described JeM as \"another SSP breakaway Deobandi organisation.\"\nInstitutions.\nRight after Darul Uloom Deoband, the main center of Deobandism throughout the world, Mazahir Uloom, Saharanpur is the second known Deobandi madrassa in India, which produced the scholars like Zakariyya Kandhlawi. Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi's established Madrasa Shahi, Moradabad, the alma of scholars like Mufti Mahmud and Saeed Ahmad Akbarabadi has its position. Darul Uloom Karachi, founded by Muhammad Shafi, Jamia Binoria and Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Pakistani are top Deobandi institutions there. Darul Uloom Bury, Holcombe, established by Yusuf Motala during 1970s is the first Deobandi madrassa of the West In South Africa, Darul Ulum Newcastle, was founded in 1971 by Cassim Mohammed Sema and Dar al-Ulum Zakariyya in Lenasia, Madrasah In'aamiyyah, Camperdown is known for its Dar al-Iftaa (Department of Fatwa Research and Training) which runs the popular online fatwa service, Askimam.org. Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam is the first established Deobandi madrassa in Bangladesh, which produced the scholars like Shah Ahmad Shafi, Junaid Babunagari. Al-Rashid Islamic Institute, Ontario, Canada, Darul Uloom Al-Madania in Buffalo, New York, Jamiah Darul Uloom Zahedan in Iran and Darul Uloom Raheemiyyah are some top Deobandi institutions.\nReferences.\nGeneral citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the granddaughter of American publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst.\nShe first became known for the events following her 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army. She was found and arrested 19 months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes committed with members of the group. She was held in custody, and there was speculation before trial that her family's resources would enable her to avoid time in prison.\nAt her trial, the prosecution suggested that Hearst had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition. However, she testified that she had been raped and threatened with death while held captive. In 1976, she was convicted for the crime of bank robbery and sentenced to 35 years in prison, later reduced to seven years. Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter, and she was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton.\nIn the 1990s, she began acting in films and television after being approached by film director John Waters.\nEarly life.\nHearst, who prefers to be called Patricia rather than Patty, was born on February 20, 1954, in San Francisco, California, the third of five daughters of Randolph Apperson Hearst and Catherine Wood Campbell. She was raised primarily in Hillsborough and attended the private Crystal Springs School for Girls there, Sacred Heart in Atherton, and the Santa Catalina School in Monterey. She attended Menlo College in Atherton, California before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley.\nHearst's grandfather William Randolph Hearst created the largest newspaper, magazine, newsreel and film business in the world. Her great-grandmother was philanthropist Phoebe Hearst. The family wielded immense political influence and had opposed organized labor, gold mine workers' interests, and communism since before World War II. Hearst's father was among a number of heirs to the family fortune and did not control the Hearst interests. Her parents had not considered it necessary to take preventive measures to ensure their children's personal security. At the time of her abduction, Hearst was a sophomore at Berkeley studying art history. She lived with her fianc\u00e9 Steven Weed in an apartment in Berkeley.\nSymbionese Liberation Army.\nKidnapping.\nOn February 4, 1974, 19-year-old Hearst was kidnapped from her Berkeley apartment. A small urban guerrilla left-wing group called the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) claimed responsibility for the abduction and demanded the release of recently arrested SLA members Joe Remiro and Russ Little.\nAfter the state refused to free the men, the SLA demanded that Hearst's family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian, an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst's father obtained a loan and arranged the immediate donation of $2 million worth of food to the poor of the Bay Area for one year in a project called People in Need. After the distribution descended into chaos, the SLA refused to release Hearst.\nAccording to Hearst's testimony at her 1976 trial, she was held for a week in a closet, blindfolded and with her hands tied. During this time, SLA founder Cinque (Donald DeFreeze) repeatedly threatened her with death. She was allowed to leave the closet for meals, still blindfolded, and began to participate in the group's political discussions. She was given a flashlight for reading and SLA political tracts to memorize. Hearst was confined in the closet for weeks. She said, \"DeFreeze told me that the war council had decided or was thinking about killing me or me staying with them, and that I better start thinking about that as a possibility. ... I accommodated my thoughts to coincide with theirs.\" In an April 1974 account, Hearst claimed that she had been offered the choice of being released or joining the SLA.\nWhen asked for her decision, Hearst elected to remain and fight with the SLA. The blindfold was removed, allowing her to see her captors for the first time. After this, she was given daily lessons on her duties, especially weapon drills. Angela Atwood told Hearst that the others wanted Hearst to share in the sexual freedom within the unit. Hearst later claimed to have been raped by William \"Willie\" Wolfe and DeFreeze.\nBank robbery.\nOn April 3, 1974, two months after she had been abducted, Hearst announced on an audiotape released to the media that she had joined the SLA and adopted the name Tania, a tribute to Che Guevara's comrade Tamara Bunke.\nOn April 15, 1974, Hearst was recorded on surveillance video wielding an M1 carbine while robbing the Sunset District branch of the Hibernia Bank at 1450 Noriega Street in San Francisco. Hearst, identified under her pseudonym of \"Tania\", yelled, \"I'm Tania. Up, up, up against the wall, motherfuckers!\" Two men entered the bank while the robbery was occurring and were shot and wounded by the SLA. According to testimony at her trial, a witness thought that Hearst had been several paces behind the others when running to the getaway car.\nAttorney General William B. Saxbe said that Hearst was a \"common criminal\" and \"not a reluctant participant\" in the bank robbery. James L. Browning Jr. said that her participation in the robbery may have been voluntary, contrasting with an earlier comment in which he said that she might have been coerced into taking part. The FBI agent heading the investigation said that SLA members were photographed pointing guns at Hearst during the robbery. A grand jury indicted her in June 1974 for the robbery.\nRescue of Hearst.\nOn May 16, 1974, the manager at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood, California, observed a minor theft by William Harris, who had been shopping with his wife Emily while Hearst waited across the road in a van. The manager and an employee followed Harris out and confronted him. There was a scuffle and the manager restrained Harris, when a pistol fell out of Harris's waistband. Hearst discharged the entire magazine of an automatic carbine into the overhead storefront, causing the manager to dive behind a lightpost. He tried to shoot back, but Hearst began aiming closer.\nFugitive.\nHearst and the Harris couple hijacked two cars and abducted the owners. One was a young man who found Hearst so personable that he was reluctant to report the incident. He testified at the trial to her discussing the effectiveness of cyanide-tipped bullets and repeatedly asking if he was okay.\nThe six SLA members inside the hideout died. There was an hourslong gunfight with police, and two members were fatally shot; a fire broke out in the house, in which the remainder died, but DeFreeze first killed himself by gunshot. It was initially thought that Hearst had also died during this confrontation. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Hearst and the Harrises for several , including two counts of kidnapping.\nEmily Harris went to a Berkeley rally to commemorate the deaths of Angela Atwood, Soltysik, DeFreeze, and other founding members of the SLA who had died in Los Angeles during the police siege. Harris recognized Atwood's acquaintance Kathy Soliah among the radicals whom she had known from civil rights groups. Soliah introduced the three fugitives to Jack Scott, an athletics reformer and radical, and he agreed to provide them help and money.\nInvolvement in later SLA crimes.\nHearst helped make improvised explosive devices. These were used in two unsuccessful attempts to kill police officers during August 1975; one of the devices failed to detonate.\nMarked money found in the apartment when she was arrested linked Hearst to the SLA armed robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California; she was the getaway car driver for the robbery. Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four who was at the bank making a deposit, was shot dead by a masked Emily Harris. Hearst was potentially at risk for felony murder charges and could testify as a witness against Harris for a capital offense.\nLegal consequences.\nOn September 18, 1975, Hearst was arrested in a San Francisco apartment with Wendy Yoshimura, another SLA member, by San Francisco Police Inspector Timothy F. Casey and his partner, Police Officer Laurence R. Pasero, and FBI Special Agent Thomas J. Padden and his partners, FBI agents Jason Moulton, Frank Doyle, Jr., Larry Lawler, Monte Hall, Dick Vitamonte, Leo Brenneissen, and Ray Campos. While being booked into jail, Hearst listed her occupation as \"Urban Guerilla\". She asked her attorney to relay the following message: \"Tell everybody that I'm smiling, that I feel free and strong and I send my greetings and love to all the sisters and brothers out there.\"\nBrainwashing claims.\nAt the time of her arrest, Hearst's weight had dropped to 87 pounds (40\u00a0kg), and she was described by psychologist Margaret Singer in October 1975 as \"a low-IQ, low-affect zombie\". Shortly after her arrest, doctors recorded signs of trauma: her IQ was measured as 112, whereas it had previously been 130; there were huge gaps in her memory regarding her pre-Tania life; she was smoking heavily and had nightmares. Without a mental illness or defect, a person is considered to be fully responsible for any criminal action not done under duress, which is defined as a clear and present threat of death or serious injury. For Hearst to secure an acquittal on the grounds of having been brainwashed would have been completely unprecedented.\nPsychiatrist Louis Jolyon West, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was appointed by the court in his capacity as a brainwashing expert and worked without a fee. After the trial, he wrote a newspaper article asking President Carter to release Hearst from prison.\nHearst wrote in her memoir, \"Every Secret Thing\" (1982), \"I spent fifteen hours going over my SLA experiences with Robert Jay Lifton of Yale University. Lifton, author of several books on coercive persuasion and thought reform, [...] pronounced me a 'classic case' which met all the psychological criteria of a coerced prisoner of war. [...] If I had reacted differently, that would have been suspect, he said.\"\nAfter some weeks in custody, Hearst repudiated her SLA allegiance. Her first lawyer, Terence Hallinan, had advised Hearst not to talk to anyone, including psychiatrists. He advocated a defense of involuntary intoxication: that the SLA had given her drugs that affected her judgment and recollection.\nHe was replaced by attorney F. Lee Bailey, who asserted a defense of coercion or duress affecting intent at the time of the offense. This was similar to the brainwashing defense which Hallinan had warned was not a defense in law. Hearst gave long interviews to various psychiatrists.\nTrial.\nHearst alone was arraigned for the Hibernia Bank robbery; the trial commenced on January 15, 1976. Judge Oliver Jesse Carter ruled that Hearst's taped and written statements after the bank robbery, while she was a fugitive with the SLA members, were voluntary. He did not allow expert testimony that stylistic analysis indicated the \"Tania\" statements and writing were not wholly composed by Hearst. He permitted the prosecution to introduce statements and actions Hearst made long after the Hibernia robbery, as evidence of her state of mind at the time of the robbery. Judge Carter also allowed into evidence a recording made by jail authorities of a friend's jail visit with Hearst, in which Hearst used profanities and spoke of her radical and feminist beliefs, but he did not allow tapes of psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West's interviews of Hearst to be heard by the jury. Judge Carter was described as \"resting his eyes\" during testimony favorable to the defense by West and others.\nAccording to Hearst's testimony, her captors had demanded she appear enthusiastic during the robbery and warned she would pay with her life for any mistake. Her defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey provided photographs showing that SLA members, including Camilla Hall, had pointed guns at Hearst during the robbery. In reference to the shooting at Mel's Sporting Goods Store and her decision to not escape, Hearst testified that she was instructed throughout her captivity on what to do in an emergency. She said one class in particular had a situation similar to the store manager's detention of the Harrises. Hearst testified that \"when it happened I didn't even think. I just did it, and if I had not done it and if they had been able to get away they would have killed me.\"\nTestifying for the prosecution, Dr. Harry Kozol said Hearst had been \"a rebel in search of a cause\", and her participation in the Hibernia robbery had been \"an act of free will.\" Prosecutor James L. Browning Jr. asked the other psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution, Dr. Joel Fort, if Hearst was in fear of death or great bodily injury during the robbery, to which he answered, \"No\". Bailey angrily objected. Fort assessed Hearst as amoral, and said she had voluntarily had sex with Wolfe and DeFreeze, which Hearst denied both in court and outside. Prosecutor Browning tried to show that writings by Hearst indicated her testimony had misrepresented her interactions with Wolfe. She said she had been writing the SLA version of events, and had been punched in the face by William Harris when she refused to be more effusive about what she regarded as sexual abuse by Wolfe. Judge Carter allowed testimony from the prosecution psychiatrists about Hearst's early sexual experiences, although these had occurred years before her kidnapping and the bank robbery.\nIn court, Hearst made a poor impression and appeared lethargic. An Associated Press report attributed this state to drugs she was given by jail doctors. Bailey was strongly criticized for his decision to put Hearst on the stand, then having her repeatedly decline to answer questions. According to Alan Dershowitz, Bailey was wrong-footed by the judge, who had appeared to indicate she would have Fifth Amendment privilege: the jury would not be present for some of her testimony, or would be instructed not to draw inferences, on matters subsequent to the Hibernian Bank charges for which she was being tried, but he changed his mind.\nAfter a few months, Hearst provided information to the authorities, not under oath (sworn testimony could have been used to convict her) of SLA activities. A bomb exploded at Hearst Castle in February 1976. After Hearst testified that Wolfe had raped her, Emily Harris gave a magazine interview from jail alleging that Hearst's keeping a trinket given to her by Wolfe was an indication that she had been in a romantic relationship with him. Hearst said she had kept the stone carving because she thought it was a Pre-Columbian artifact of archeological significance. The prosecutor James L. Browning Jr. used Harris's interpretation of the item. Some jurors later said they regarded the carving, which Browning waved in front of them, as powerful evidence that Hearst was lying.\nClosing arguments.\nIn his closing argument, prosecutor Browning suggested that Hearst had taken part in the bank robbery without coercion. Browning, who later became a judge, also suggested to the jury that as the female SLA members were feminists, they would not have allowed Hearst to be raped.\nIn her autobiography, Hearst expressed disappointment with what she saw as Bailey's lack of focus in the crucial end stage of her trial. She described him as having the appearance of someone with a hangover, and spilling water down the front of his pants while making a \"disjointed\" closing argument. Bailey's final statement to the court was, \"But simple application of the rules, I think, will yield one decent result, and, that is, there is not anything close to proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Patty Hearst wanted to be a bank robber. What you know, and you know in your hearts to be true is beyond dispute. There was talk about her dying, and she wanted to survive.\"\nConviction and sentencing.\nOn March 20, 1976, Hearst was convicted of bank robbery and using a firearm during the commission of a felony. She was given the maximum sentence possible of 35 years' imprisonment, pending a reduction at final sentence hearing, which Carter declined to specify.\nBecause Judge Carter had died, Judge William H. Orrick Jr. determined Hearst's sentence. He gave her seven years' imprisonment, commenting that \"rebellious young people who, for whatever reason become revolutionaries, and voluntarily commit criminal acts will be punished\".\nPrison life.\nHearst was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin (California). She suffered a collapsed lung in prison, the beginning of a series of medical problems, and she underwent emergency surgery. This prevented her from appearing to testify against the Harrises on 11 charges, including robbery, kidnapping, and assault; she was also arraigned for those charges. She was held in solitary confinement for security reasons; she was granted bail for an appeal hearing in November 1976 on the condition that she was protected on bond. Her father hired dozens of bodyguards.\nSuperior Court judge Talbot Callister gave her probation on the sporting goods store charge when she pleaded no contest, saying that he believed that she had been subject to coercion amounting to torture. California Attorney General Evelle J. Younger said that, if there was a double standard for the wealthy, it was the opposite of what was generally believed and that Hearst had received a stiffer sentence than a person of lesser means might have. He said that she had no legal brainwashing defense, but pointed out that the events had started with her being kidnapped.\nHearst's bail was revoked in May 1978 when appeals failed, and the Supreme Court declined to hear her case. The prison took no special security measures for her safety until she found a dead rat on her bunk on the day when William and Emily Harris were arraigned for her abduction. The Harrises were convicted on a simple kidnapping charge, as opposed to the more serious kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping with bodily injury, and they were released after serving a total of eight years each.\nRepresentative Leo Ryan was collecting signatures on a petition for Hearst's release several weeks before he was murdered while visiting the Jonestown settlement in Guyana. Actor John Wayne spoke after the Jonestown cult deaths, stating that people had accepted that Jim Jones had brainwashed 900 individuals into mass suicide but would not accept that the Symbionese Liberation Army could have brainwashed a kidnapped teenage girl.\nCommutation, release, and pardon.\nPresident Jimmy Carter commuted Hearst's federal sentence to the 22 months served, freeing her eight months before she was eligible for her first parole hearing. Her release (on February 1, 1979) was under stringent conditions, and she remained on probation for the state sentence on the sporting goods store plea. She recovered full civil rights when President Bill Clinton granted her a pardon on January 20, 2001, his last day in office.\nLife after release.\nTwo months after her release from prison, Hearst married Bernard Lee Shaw (1945\u20132013), a policeman who was part of her security detail during her time on bail. They had two children, Gillian and Lydia Hearst-Shaw. Hearst became involved in a foundation helping children with AIDS, and was active in other charities and fund-raising activities.\nMedia and other activities.\nHearst published the memoir \"Every Secret Thing\", co-written with Alvin Moscow, in 1981. Her accounts resulted in authorities considering bringing new charges against her. She was interviewed in 2009 on NBC and said that the prosecutor had suggested that she had been in a consensual relationship with Wolfe. She described that as \"outrageous\" and an insult to rape victims.\nHearst produced a special for the Travel Channel titled \"Secrets of San Simeon with Patricia Hearst\", in which she took viewers inside her grandfather's mansion Hearst Castle, providing unprecedented access to the property. She collaborated with Cordelia Frances Biddle on writing the novel \"Murder at San Simeon\" (Scribner, 1996), based upon the death of Thomas H. Ince on her grandfather's yacht.\nShe has appeared in feature films for director John Waters, who cast her in \"Cry-Baby\" (1990), \"Serial Mom\" (1994), \"Pecker\" (1998), \"Cecil B. DeMented\" (2000) and \"A Dirty Shame\" (2004). Hearst also made a cameo in Pauly Shore's film \"Bio-Dome\" (1996) and had a small role in the 2004 film \"Second Best\". She was also a producer on the film \"Pottersville\" and made an appearance in the 2000 documentary, \"Pie in the Sky: The Brigid Berlin Story\".\nHer television acting roles include episodes of \"The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete\", \"Boston Common\", \"Son of the Beach\" and \"Tripping the Rift\". She was also a guest caller on the TV series \"Frasier\" on season 1 episode 23 \"Frasier Crane's Day Off\" (1994), as Janice. She also appeared in the episode \"Lord of the Pi's\" in season 3 of \"Veronica Mars\". The character was the heiress of a fictionalized Hearst family, loosely based on aspects of her life.\nHearst has participated with her dogs in dog shows, and her Shih Tzu Rocket won the \"Toy\" group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden on February 16, 2015. At the 2017 show, Hearst's French bulldog Tuggy won Best of Breed, and Rubi won Best of Opposite Sex.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th-century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect, which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.\nBorn in Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire) to Jewish parents of humble origins, the German-speaking Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler\u2014who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post\u2014experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.\nMahler's \"\u0153uvre\" is relatively limited; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part-time activity while he earned his living as a conductor. Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna, Mahler's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces, symphonic choruses and operatic soloists. These works were frequently controversial when first performed, and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval; exceptions included his Second Symphony, and the triumphant premiere of his Eighth Symphony in 1910. Some of Mahler's immediate musical successors included the composers of the Second Viennese School, notably Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten are among later 20th-century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler. The International Gustav Mahler Society was established in 1955 to honour the composer's life and achievements.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nFamily background.\nThe Mahler family came from eastern Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, and were of humble circumstances\u2014the composer's grandmother had been a street pedlar. Bohemia was then part of the Austrian Empire; the Mahler family belonged to a German-speaking minority among Bohemians, and was also Jewish. From this background the future composer developed early on a permanent sense of exile, \"always an intruder, never welcomed\". The pedlar's son Bernhard Mahler, the composer's father, elevated himself to the ranks of the petite bourgeoisie by becoming a coachman and later an innkeeper. He bought a modest house in the village of Kali\u0161t\u011b (), and in 1857 married Marie Herrmann, the 19-year-old daughter of a local soap manufacturer. In the following year Marie gave birth to the first of the couple's 14\u00a0children, a son named Isidor, who died in infancy. Two years later, on 7 July 1860, their second son, Gustav, was born.\nChildhood.\nIn December 1860, Bernhard Mahler moved with his wife and infant son to the city of Jihlava (), where Bernhard built up a successful distillery and tavern business. The family grew rapidly, but of the 12\u00a0children born to the family in the city, only six survived infancy. Jihlava was then a thriving commercial city of 20,000 people, in which Gustav was introduced to music through the street songs of the day, through dance tunes, folk melodies and the trumpet calls and marches of the local military band. All of these elements would later contribute to his mature musical vocabulary.\nWhen he was four years old, Gustav discovered his grandparents' piano and took to it immediately. He developed his performing skills sufficiently to be considered a local and gave his first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old. Although Gustav loved making music, his school reports from the Jihlava portrayed him as absent-minded and unreliable in academic work. In 1871, in the hope of improving the boy's results, his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague, but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Jihlava. On 13 April 1875 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst (b. 18 March 1862) died after a long illness. Mahler sought to express his feelings in music: with the help of a friend, Josef Steiner, he began work on an opera, (\"Duke Ernest of Swabia\"), as a memorial to his lost brother. Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived.\nStudent days.\nBernhard Mahler supported his son's ambitions for a music career, and agreed that the boy should try for a place at the Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875\u201376. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes at the end of each of his first two years. For his final year, 1877\u201378, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.\nAmong Mahler's fellow students at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable to submit to the strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.\nMahler left the conservatory in 1878 with a diploma but without the silver medal given for outstanding achievement. He then enrolled in the University of Vienna (he had, at his father's insistence, sat and with difficulty passed the , a highly demanding final exam at a , which was a precondition for university studies) and followed courses which reflected his developing interests in literature and philosophy. After leaving the university in 1879, Mahler made some money as a piano teacher, continued to compose, and in 1880 finished a dramatic cantata, (\"The Song of Lamentation\"). This, his first substantial composition, shows traces of Wagnerian and Brucknerian influences, yet includes many musical elements which musicologist Deryck Cooke describes as \"pure Mahler\". Its first performance was delayed until 1901, when it was presented in a revised, shortened form.\nMahler developed interests in German philosophy, and was introduced by his friend Siegfried Lipiner to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustav Fechner and Hermann Lotze. These thinkers continued to influence Mahler and his music long after his student days were over. Mahler's biographer Jonathan Carr says that the composer's head was \"not only full of the sound of Bohemian bands, trumpet calls and marches, Bruckner chorales and Schubert sonatas. It was also throbbing with the problems of philosophy and metaphysics he had thrashed out, above all, with Lipiner\".\nEarly conducting career 1880\u20131888.\nFirst appointments.\nFrom June to August 1880, Mahler took his first professional conducting job, in a small wooden theatre in the spa town of Bad Hall, south of Linz. The repertory was exclusively operetta; it was, in Carr's words \"a dismal little job\", which Mahler accepted only after Julius Epstein told him he would soon work his way up. In 1881, he was engaged for six months (September to April) at the Landestheater in Laibach (now Ljubljana, in Slovenia), where the small but resourceful company was prepared to attempt more ambitious works. Here, Mahler conducted his first full-scale opera, Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", one of 10 operas and a number of operettas that he presented during his time in Laibach. After completing this engagement, Mahler returned to Vienna and worked part-time as chorus-master at the Vienna Carltheater.\nFrom the beginning of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in Olm\u00fctz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: \"From the moment I crossed the threshold of the Olm\u00fctz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God.\" Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine operas to the theatre, including Bizet's \"Carmen\", and won over the press that had initially been sceptical of him. After a week's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre's \"Musical and Choral Director\" from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre's Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and vice versa) and set out to make his life miserable. Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber's , and 25 other operas. On 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel's play (\"The Trumpeter of S\u00e4ckingen\"), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle (\"Songs of a Wayfarer\").\nIn January 1884, the distinguished conductor Hans von B\u00fclow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts. Hoping to escape from his job in the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as B\u00fclow's permanent assistant. However, in the following year his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered, a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal in Prague by the theatre's newly appointed director, the famous Angelo Neumann.\nPrague and Leipzig.\nIn Prague, the emergence of the Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the 's fortunes. Mahler's task was to help arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated for the rest of his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for the first time in his life. By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch began almost at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre's new production of Wagner's \"Ring\" cycle. Nikisch's illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except ), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, win him popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.\nIn Leipzig, Mahler befriended Captain Carl von Weber (1849\u20131897), grandson of the composer, and agreed to prepare a performing version of Carl Maria von Weber's unfinished opera (\"The Three Pintos\"). Mahler transcribed and orchestrated the existing musical sketches, used parts of other Weber works, and added some composition of his own. The premiere at the Stadttheater, on 20 January 1888, was an important occasion at which several heads of various German opera houses were present. (The Russian composer Tchaikovsky attended the third performance on 29 January.) The work was well-received; its success did much to raise Mahler's public profile, and brought him financial rewards. Mahler's involvement with the Weber family was complicated by Mahler's alleged romantic attachment to Carl von Weber's wife Marion Mathilde (1857\u20131931) which, though intense on both sides \u2013 so it was rumoured by for example English composer Ethel Smyth \u2013 ultimately came to nothing. In February and March 1888 Mahler sketched and completed his First Symphony, then in five movements. At around the same time Mahler discovered the German folk-poem collection (\"The Youth's Magic Horn\"), which would dominate much of his compositional output for the following 12\u00a0years.\nOn 17 May 1888, Mahler suddenly resigned his Leipzig position after a dispute with the 's chief stage manager, Albert Goldberg. However, Mahler had secretly been invited by Angelo Neumann in Prague (and accepted the offer) to conduct the premiere there of \"his\" , and later also a production of by Peter Cornelius. This short stay (July to September) ended unhappily, with Mahler's dismissal following his outburst during a rehearsal. However, through the efforts of an old Viennese friend, Guido Adler, and cellist David Popper, Mahler's name went forward as a potential director of the Royal Hungarian Opera in Budapest. He was interviewed, made a good impression, and was offered and accepted (with some reluctance) the post from 1 October 1888.\nApprentice composer.\nIn the early years of Mahler's conducting career, composing was a spare time activity. Between his Laibach and Olm\u00fctz appointments he worked on settings of verses by Richard Leander and Tirso de Molina, later collected as Volume\u00a0I of (\"Songs and Airs\"). Mahler's first orchestral song cycle, , composed at Kassel, was based on his own verses, although the first poem, \"\" (\"When my love becomes a bride\") closely follows the text of a poem. The melodies for the second and fourth songs of the cycle were incorporated into the First Symphony, which Mahler finished in 1888, at the height of his relationship with Marion von Weber. The intensity of Mahler's feelings is reflected in the music, which originally was written as a five-movement symphonic poem with a descriptive programme. One of these movements, the \"Blumine\", later discarded, was based on a passage from his earlier work . After completing the symphony, Mahler composed a 20-minute symphonic poem, \"Funeral Rites\", which later became the first movement of his Second Symphony.\nThere has been frequent speculation about lost or destroyed works from Mahler's early years. The Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg believed that the First Symphony was too mature to be a first symphonic work, and must have had predecessors. In 1938, Mengelberg revealed the existence of the so-called \"Dresden archive\", a series of manuscripts in the possession of the widowed Marion von Weber. According to the Mahler historian Donald Mitchell, it was highly likely that important Mahler manuscripts of early symphonic works had been held in Dresden; this archive, if it existed, was almost certainly destroyed in the bombing of Dresden in 1945.\nBudapest and Hamburg, 1888\u20131897.\nRoyal Opera, Budapest.\nOn arriving in Budapest in October 1888, Mahler encountered a cultural conflict between conservative Hungarian nationalists who favoured a policy of Magyarisation, and progressives who wanted to maintain and develop the country's Austro-German cultural traditions. In the opera house a dominant conservative caucus, led by the music director S\u00e1ndor Erkel, had maintained a limited repertory of historical and folklore opera. By the time that Mahler began his duties, the progressive camp had gained ascendancy following the appointment of the liberal-minded Ferenc von Beniczky as intendant. Aware of the delicate situation, Mahler moved cautiously; he delayed his first appearance on the conductor's stand until January 1889, when he conducted Hungarian-language performances of Wagner's and to initial public acclaim. However, his early successes faded when plans to stage the remainder of the \"Ring\" cycle and other German operas were frustrated by a renascent conservative faction which favoured a more traditional \"Hungarian\" programme. In search of non-German operas to extend the repertory, Mahler visited in spring 1890 Italy where among the works he discovered was Mascagni's recent sensation (Budapest premiere on 26 December 1890).\nOn 18 February 1889, Bernhard Mahler died; this was followed later in the year by the deaths both of Mahler's sister Leopoldine (27 September) and his mother (11 October). From October 1889 Mahler took charge of his four younger brothers and sisters (Alois, Otto, Justine, and Emma). They were installed in a rented flat in Vienna. Mahler himself suffered poor health, with attacks of haemorrhoids and migraine and a recurrent septic throat. Shortly after these family and health setbacks the premiere of the First Symphony, in Budapest on 20 November 1889, was a disappointment. The critic August Beer's lengthy newspaper review indicates that enthusiasm after the early movements degenerated into \"audible opposition\" after the Finale. Mahler was particularly distressed by the negative comments from his Vienna Conservatory contemporary, Viktor von Herzfeld, who had remarked that Mahler, like many conductors before him, had proved not to be a composer.\nIn 1891, Hungary's move to the political right was reflected in the opera house when Beniczky on 1 February was replaced as intendant by Count G\u00e9za Zichy, a conservative aristocrat determined to assume artistic control over Mahler's head. However, Mahler had foreseen that and had secretly been negotiating with Bernhard Pollini, the director of the Stadttheater Hamburg since summer and autumn of 1890, and a contract was finally signed in secrecy on 15 January 1891. Mahler more or less \"forced\" himself to be sacked from his Budapest post, and he succeeded on 14 March 1891. By his departure he received a large sum of indemnity. One of his final Budapest triumphs was a performance of Mozart's (16 September 1890) which won him praise from Brahms, who was present at the performances on 16 December 1890. During his Budapest years Mahler's compositional output had been limited to a few songs from the song settings that became Volumes\u00a0II and III of , and amendments to the First Symphony.\nStadttheater Hamburg.\nMahler's Hamburg post was as chief conductor, subordinate to the director, Bernhard Pohl (known as Pollini) who retained overall artistic control. Pollini was prepared to give Mahler considerable leeway if the conductor could provide commercial as well as artistic success. This Mahler did in his first season, when he conducted Wagner's for the first time and gave acclaimed performances of the same composer's and . Another triumph was the German premiere of Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\", in the presence of the composer, who called Mahler's conducting \"astounding\", and later asserted in a letter that he believed Mahler was \"positively a genius\". Mahler's demanding rehearsal schedules led to predictable resentment from the singers and orchestra in whom, according to music writer Peter Franklin, the conductor \"inspired hatred and respect in almost equal measure\". He found support, however, from Hans von B\u00fclow, who was in Hamburg as director of the city's subscription concerts. B\u00fclow, who had spurned Mahler's approaches in Kassel, had come to admire the younger man's conducting style, and on B\u00fclow's death in 1894 Mahler took over the direction of the concerts.\nIn the summer of 1892 Mahler took the Hamburg singers to London to participate in an eight-week season of German opera\u2014his only visit to Britain. His conducting of \"Tristan\" enthralled the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who \"staggered home in a daze and could not sleep for two nights.\" However, Mahler refused further such invitations as he was anxious to reserve his summers for composing. In 1893 he acquired a retreat at Steinbach, on the banks of Lake Attersee in Upper Austria, and established a pattern that persisted for the rest of his life; summers would henceforth be dedicated to composition, at Steinbach or its successor retreats. Now firmly under the influence of the folk-poem collection, Mahler produced a stream of song settings at Steinbach, and composed his Second and Third Symphonies there.\nPerformances of Mahler works were still comparatively rare (he had not composed very much). On 27 October 1893, at Hamburg's Konzerthaus Ludwig, Mahler conducted a revised version of his First Symphony; still in its original five-movement form, it was presented as a (tone poem) under the descriptive name \"Titan\". This concert also introduced six recent settings. Mahler achieved his first relative success as a composer when the Second Symphony was well-received on its premiere in Berlin, under his own baton, on 13 December 1895. Mahler's conducting assistant Bruno Walter, who was present, said that \"one may date [Mahler's] rise to fame as a composer from that day.\" That same year Mahler's private life had been disrupted by the suicide of his younger brother Otto on 6 February.\nAt the Stadttheater Mahler's repertory consisted of 66 operas of which 36 titles were new to him. During his six years in Hamburg, he conducted 744 performances, including the debuts of Verdi's \"Falstaff\", Humperdinck's \"H\u00e4nsel und Gretel\", and works by Smetana. However, he was forced to resign his post with the subscription concerts after poor financial returns and an ill-received interpretation of his re-scored Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Already at an early age Mahler had made it clear that his ultimate goal was an appointment in Vienna, and from 1895 onward was manoeuvring, with the help of influential friends, to secure the directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. He overcame the bar that existed against the appointment of a Jew to this post by what may have been a pragmatic conversion to Catholicism in February 1897. Despite this event, Mahler has been described as a lifelong agnostic.\nVienna, 1897\u20131907.\nHofoper director.\nAs he waited for the Emperor's confirmation of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original \"Ring\" cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.\nVienna, the imperial Habsburg capital, had recently elected an anti-Semitic conservative mayor, Karl Lueger, who had once proclaimed: \"I myself decide who is a Jew and who isn't.\" In such a volatile political atmosphere Mahler needed an early demonstration of his German cultural credentials. He made his initial mark in May 1897 with much-praised performances of Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" and Mozart's . Shortly after the triumph, Mahler was forced to take sick leave for several weeks, during which he was nursed by his sister Justine and his long-time companion, the viola player Natalie Bauer-Lechner. Mahler returned to Vienna in late July to prepare for Vienna's first uncut version of the \"Ring\" cycle. This performance took place on 24\u201327 August, attracting critical praise and public enthusiasm. Mahler's friend Hugo Wolf told Bauer-Lechner that \"for the first time I have heard the \"Ring\" as I have always dreamed of hearing it while reading the score\".\nOn 8 October Mahler was formally appointed to succeed Jahn as the Hofoper's director. His first production in his new office was Smetana's Czech nationalist opera \"Dalibor\", with a reconstituted finale that left the hero Dalibor alive. This production caused anger among the more extreme Viennese German nationalists, who accused Mahler of \"fraternising with the anti-dynastic, inferior Czech nation.\" The Austrian author Stefan Zweig, in his memoirs \"The World of Yesterday\" (1942), described Mahler's appointment as an example of the Viennese public's general distrust of young artists: \"Once, when an amazing exception occurred and Gustav Mahler was named director of the Court Opera at thirty-eight years old, a frightened murmur and astonishment ran through Vienna, because someone had entrusted the highest institute of art to 'such a young person' ... This suspicion\u2014that all young people were 'not very reliable'\u2014ran through all circles at that time.\" Zweig also wrote that \"to have seen Gustav Mahler on the street [in Vienna] was an event that one would proudly report to his comrades the next morning as if it were a personal triumph.\" During Mahler's tenure a total of 33\u00a0new operas were introduced to the Hofoper; a further 55 were new or totally revamped productions. However, a proposal to stage Richard Strauss's controversial opera \"Salome\" in 1905 was rejected by the Viennese censors.\nEarly in 1902 Mahler met Alfred Roller, an artist and designer associated with the Vienna Secession movement. A year later, Mahler appointed him chief stage designer to the Hofoper, where Roller's debut was a new production of . The collaboration between Mahler and Roller created more than 20\u00a0celebrated productions of, among other operas, Beethoven's \"Fidelio\", Gluck's \"Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide\" and Mozart's . In the \"Figaro\" production, Mahler offended some purists by adding and composing a short recitative scene to Act\u00a0III.\nIn spite of numerous theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers and the house administration continued on and off for the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At the end of the summer he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted \"Fidelio\", his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends\u2014it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.\nPhilharmonic concerts.\nWhen Richter resigned as head of the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898, the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor. The appointment was not universally welcomed; the anti-Semitic press wondered if, as a non-German, Mahler would be capable of defending German music. Attendances rose sharply in Mahler's first season, but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re-scoring acknowledged masterpieces, and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar. An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed, because Richter was not interested. Mahler's position was weakened when, in 1900, he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle. The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money\u2014Mahler had to borrow the orchestra's fare home from the Rothschilds. In April 1901, dogged by a recurrence of ill-health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra, Mahler relinquished the Philharmonic concerts conductorship. In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works, which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz, Wilhelm Kienzl and the Italian Lorenzo Perosi.\nMature composer.\nThe demands of his twin appointments in Vienna initially absorbed all Mahler's time and energy, but by 1899 he had resumed composing. The remaining Vienna years were to prove particularly fruitful. While working on some of the last of his settings he started his Fourth Symphony, which he completed in 1900. By this time he had abandoned the composing hut at Steinbach and had acquired another, at Maiernigg on the shores of the W\u00f6rthersee in Carinthia, where he later built a villa. In this new venue Mahler embarked upon what is generally considered as his \"middle\" or post- compositional period. Between 1901 and 1904 he wrote ten settings of poems by Friedrich R\u00fcckert, five of which were collected as . The other five formed the song cycle (\"Songs on the Death of Children\"). The trilogy of orchestral symphonies, the Fifth, the Sixth and the Seventh were composed at Maiernigg between 1901 and 1905, and the Eighth Symphony written there in 1906, in eight weeks of furious activity.\nWithin this same period Mahler's works began to be performed with increasing frequency. In April 1899 he conducted the Viennese premiere of his Second Symphony; 17 February 1901 saw the first public performance of his early work , in a revised two-part form. Later that year, in November, Mahler conducted the premiere of his Fourth Symphony, in Munich, and was on the rostrum for the first complete performance of the Third Symphony, at the festival at Krefeld on 9 June 1902. Mahler \"first nights\" now became increasingly frequent musical events; he conducted the first performances of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies at Cologne and Essen respectively, in 1904 and 1906. Four of the , and , were introduced in Vienna on 29 January 1905.\nMarriage, family, tragedy.\nDuring his second season in Vienna, Mahler acquired a spacious modern apartment on the Auenbruggergasse and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg. In November 1901, he met Alma Schindler, the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll, at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard. Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler, on account of \"the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera.\" The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky (Alma was one of Zemlinsky's pupils), but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day. This meeting led to a rapid courtship; Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902. Alma was by then pregnant with her first child, a daughter Maria Anna, who was born on 3 November 1902. A second daughter, Anna, was born in 1904.\nFriends of the couple were surprised by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom. Burckhard called Mahler \"that rachitic degenerate Jew\", unworthy for such a good-looking girl of good family. On the other hand, Mahler's family considered Alma to be flirtatious, unreliable, and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms. Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian\u2014Natalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was \"like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves.\" Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler's insistence that there could only be one composer in the family and that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him. \"The role of composer, the worker's role, falls to me, yours is that of a loving companion and understanding partner ... I'm asking a very great deal \u2013 and I can and may do so because I know what I have to give and will give in exchange.\" She wrote in her diary: \"How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of\u00a0... things closest to one's heart.\" Mahler's requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma's part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.\nIn the summer of 1907 Mahler, exhausted from the effects of the campaign against him in Vienna, took his family to Maiernigg. Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria. Anna recovered, but after a fortnight's struggle Maria died on 12 July. Immediately following this devastating loss, Mahler learned that his heart was defective, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist, who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise. The extent to which Mahler's condition disabled him is unclear; Alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence, though Mahler himself, in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907, said that he would be able to live a normal life, apart from avoiding over-fatigue. The illness was, however, a further depressing factor. Mahler and his family left Maiernigg and spent the rest of the summer at Schluderbach. At the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed and never revisited.\nLast years, 1908\u20131911.\nNew York.\nMahler made his New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 1 January 1908, when he conducted Wagner's . In a busy first season Mahler's performances were widely praised, especially his \"Fidelio\" on 20 March 1908, in which he insisted on using replicas that were at the time being made of Alfred Roller's Vienna sets. On his return to Austria for the summer of 1908, Mahler established himself in the third and last of his composing studios, in the pine forests close to Toblach in Tyrol. Here, using a text by Hans Bethge based on ancient Chinese poems, he composed (\"The Song of the Earth\"). Despite the symphonic nature of the work, Mahler refused to number it, hoping thereby to escape the \"curse of the Ninth Symphony\" that he believed had affected fellow-composers Beethoven, Schubert and Bruckner. On 19 September 1908 the premiere of the Seventh Symphony, in Prague, was deemed by Alma Mahler a critical rather than a popular success.\nFor its 1908\u201309 season the Metropolitan management brought in the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19\u00a0appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's \"The Bartered Bride\" on 19 February 1909. In the early part of the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky's \"The Queen of Spades\" on 5 March 1910.\nBack in Europe for the summer of 1909, Mahler worked on his Ninth Symphony and made a conducting tour of the Netherlands. The 1909\u201310 New York Philharmonic season was long and taxing; Mahler rehearsed and conducted 46 concerts, but his programmes were often too demanding for popular tastes. His own First Symphony, given its American debut on 16 December 1909, was one of the pieces that failed with critics and public, and the season ended with heavy financial losses. The highlight of Mahler's 1910 summer was the first performance of the Eighth Symphony at Munich on 12 September, the last of his works to be premiered in his lifetime. The occasion was a triumph\u2014\"easily Mahler's biggest lifetime success\", according to Carr\u2014but it was overshadowed by the composer's discovery, before the event, that Alma had begun an affair with the young architect Walter Gropius. Greatly distressed, Mahler sought advice from Sigmund Freud, and appeared to gain some comfort from his meeting with the psychoanalyst. One of Freud's observations was that much damage had been done by Mahler's insisting that Alma give up her composing. Mahler accepted this, and started to positively encourage her to write music, even editing, orchestrating and promoting some of her works. Alma agreed to remain with Mahler, although the relationship with Gropius continued surreptitiously. In a gesture of love, Mahler dedicated his Eighth Symphony to her.\nIllness and death.\nIn spite of the emotional distractions, during the summer of 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's . This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which people with defective heart valves were particularly prone and which could be fatal. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS \"Amerika\" bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the L\u00f6w sanatorium in Vienna, where he developed pneumonia and slipped into a coma. Hundreds had come to the sanatorium during this brief period to show their admiration for the great composer. After receiving treatments of radium to reduce swelling on his legs and morphine for his general ailments, he died on 18 May, aged 50.\nOn 22 May 1911 Mahler was buried in the Grinzing cemetery, as he had requested, next to his daughter Maria. His tombstone was inscribed only with his name because \"any who come to look for me will know who I was and the rest don't need to know.\" Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as \"the holy Gustav Mahler\"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. \"The New York Times\", reporting Mahler's death, called him \"one of the towering musical figures of his day\", but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to \"two hours and forty minutes\". In London, \"The Times\" obituary said his conducting was \"more accomplished than that of any man save Richter\", and that his symphonies were \"undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality\", though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.\nAlma Mahler survived her husband by more than 50\u00a0years, dying in 1964. She married Walter Gropius in 1915, divorced him five years later, and married the writer Franz Werfel in 1929. In 1940 she published a memoir of her years with Mahler, entitled \"Gustav Mahler: Memories and Letters\". This account was criticised by later biographers as incomplete, selective and self-serving, and for providing a distorted picture of Mahler's life. The composer's daughter Anna Mahler became a well-known sculptor; she died in 1988. The International Gustav Mahler Society was founded in 1955 in Vienna, with Bruno Walter as its first president and Alma Mahler as an honorary member. The Society aims to create a complete critical edition of Mahler's works, and to commemorate all aspects of the composer's life.\nMusic.\nThree creative periods.\nDeryck Cooke and other analysts have divided Mahler's composing life into three distinct phases: a long \"first period\", extending from in 1880 to the end of the phase in 1901; a \"middle period\" of more concentrated composition ending with Mahler's departure for New York in 1907; and a brief \"late period\" of elegiac works before his death in 1911.\nThe main works of the first period are the first four symphonies, the song cycle and various song collections in which the songs predominate. In this period songs and symphonies are closely related and the symphonic works are programmatic. Mahler initially gave the first three symphonies full descriptive programmes, all of which he later repudiated. He devised, but did not publish, titles for each of the movements for the Fourth Symphony; from these titles the German music critic Paul Bekker conjectured a programme in which Death appears in the Scherzo \"in the friendly, legendary guise of the fiddler tempting his flock to follow him out of this world.\"\nThe middle period comprises a triptych of purely instrumental symphonies (the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh), the \"R\u00fcckert\" songs and the , two final settings and, in some reckonings, Mahler's last great affirmative statement, the choral Eighth Symphony. Cooke believes that the Eighth stands on its own, between the middle and final periods. Mahler had by now abandoned all explicit programmes and descriptive titles; he wanted to write \"absolute\" music that spoke for itself. Cooke refers to \"a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\" in the middle-period symphonies, while the songs have lost most of their folk character, and cease to fertilise the symphonies as explicitly as before.\nThe three works of the brief final period\u2014, the Ninth and (incomplete) Tenth Symphonies\u2014are expressions of personal experience, as Mahler faced death. Each of the pieces ends quietly, signifying that aspiration has now given way to resignation. Cooke considers these works to be a loving (rather than a bitter) farewell to life; the composer Alban Berg called the Ninth \"the most marvellous thing that Mahler ever wrote\". None of these final works were performed in Mahler's lifetime.\nAntecedents and influences.\nMahler was a \"late Romantic\", part of an ideal that placed Austro-German classical music on a higher plane than other types, through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance. He was one of the last major composers of a line which includes, among others, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Wagner, Bruckner and Brahms. From these antecedents Mahler drew many of the features that were to characterise his music. Thus, from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony came the idea of using soloists and a choir within the symphonic genre. From Beethoven, Liszt and (from a different musical tradition) Berlioz came the concept of writing music with an inherent narrative or \"programme\", and of breaking away from the traditional four-movement symphony format. The examples of Wagner and Bruckner encouraged Mahler to extend the scale of his symphonic works well beyond the previously accepted standards, to embrace an entire world of feeling.\nEarly critics maintained that Mahler's adoption of many different styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own; Cooke on the other hand asserts that Mahler \"redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his [own] personality on practically every note\" to produce music of \"outstanding originality.\" The music critic Harold Schonberg sees the essence of Mahler's music in the theme of struggle, in the tradition of Beethoven. However, according to Schonberg, Beethoven's struggles were those of \"an indomitable and triumphant hero\", whereas Mahler's are those of \"a psychic weakling, a complaining adolescent who\u00a0... enjoyed his misery, wanting the whole world to see how he was suffering.\" Yet, Schonberg concedes, most of the symphonies contain sections in which Mahler the \"deep thinker\" is transcended by the splendour of Mahler the musician.\nGenre.\nExcept for his juvenilia, little of which has survived, Mahler composed only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song cycle and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler's extended phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the song (\"The Heavenly Life\"), composed in 1892, became a key element in the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the song, (\"The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes\"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another setting from 1892, (\"Primal Light\"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.\nIn Mahler's middle and late periods, the song\u2013symphony relationship is less direct. However, musicologist Donald Mitchell notes specific relationships between the middle period songs and their contemporaneous symphonies\u2014the second song and the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony, the last song and the Sixth Symphony finale. Mahler's last work employing vocal and orchestral forces, , is subtitled \"A Symphony\u00a0...\"\u2014Mitchell categorises it as a \"song \"and\" symphony.\"\nStyle.\nThe union of song and symphonic form in Mahler's music is, in Cooke's view, organic; \"his songs flower naturally into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast.\" To Sibelius, Mahler expressed the belief that \"The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.\" True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life's struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. Amid all this is Mahler's particular hallmark\u2014the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges as one of the majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony \"the most farcical and at the same time the most tragic piece that ever existed\u00a0... It is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue.\"\nThe range of musical moods, Cooke maintains, comes from Mahler's \"amazing orchestration\" which, in the writer's view, defies analysis\u2014\"it speaks for itself.\" Franklin lists specific features which are basic to Mahler's style: extremes of volume, the use of off-stage ensembles, unconventional arrangement of orchestral forces, and frequent recourse to popular music and dance forms such as the l\u00e4ndler and the waltz. Musicologist Vladim\u00edr Karbusick\u00fd maintains that the composer's Jewish roots had lasting effects on his creative output; he pinpoints the central part of the third movement of the First Symphony as the most characteristically \"Yiddish\" music in Mahler's work. The Czech composer-journalist Max Brod has also identified Jewish tunes and rhythms in Mahler's music.\nA technical device much used by Mahler is that of \"progressive tonality\", which Deryck Cooke describes as \"the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated\", and which is often used \"to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony\". This technique was also used by Mahler's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen. Mahler first employed the device in an early song, (\"Memory\"), and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies. For example, the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major; at the beginning of the Finale, the \"conflict\" movement, the key switches to F minor, and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D, near the end. The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E-flat. The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major. The Sixth Symphony, unusually for Mahler, begins and ends in the same key, A minor, signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved.\nReception.\nEarly responses, 1889\u20131911.\nMahler's friend Guido Adler calculated that at the time of the composer's death in 1911 there had been more than 260\u00a0performances of the symphonies in Europe, Russia and America, the Fourth Symphony with 61\u00a0performances given most frequently (Adler did not enumerate performances of the songs). In his lifetime, Mahler's works and their performances attracted wide interest, but rarely unqualified approval; for years after its 1889 premiere critics and public struggled to understand the First Symphony, described by one critic after an 1898 Dresden performance as \"the dullest [symphonic] work the new epoch has produced\". The Second Symphony was received more positively, one critic calling it \"the most masterly work of its kind since Mendelssohn\". Such generous praise was rare, particularly after Mahler's accession to the Vienna Hofoper directorship. His many enemies in the city used the anti-Semitic and conservative press to denigrate almost every performance of a Mahler work; thus the Third Symphony, a success in Krefeld in 1902, was treated in Vienna with critical scorn: \"Anyone who has committed such a deed deserves a couple of years in prison.\"\nA mix of enthusiasm, consternation and critical contempt became the normal response to new Mahler symphonies, although the songs were better received. After his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies failed to gain general public approval, Mahler was convinced that his Sixth would finally succeed. However, its reception was dominated by satirical comments on Mahler's unconventional percussion effects\u2014the use of a wooden mallet, birch rods and a huge square bass drum. Viennese critic Heinrich Reinhardt dismissed the symphony as \"Brass, lots of brass, incredibly much brass! Even more brass, nothing but brass!\" The one unalloyed performance triumph within Mahler's lifetime was the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in Munich, on 12 September 1910, advertised by its promoters as the \"Symphony of a Thousand\". At its conclusion, applause and celebrations reportedly lasted for half an hour.\nRelative neglect, 1911\u20131950.\nPerformances of Mahler's works became less frequent after his death. In the Netherlands the advocacy of Willem Mengelberg ensured that Mahler remained popular there, and Mengelberg's engagement with the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought Mahler regularly to American audiences. However, much American critical reaction in the 1920s was negative, despite a spirited effort by the young composer Aaron Copland to present Mahler as a progressive, 30\u00a0years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than Richard Strauss. Earlier, in 1916, Leopold Stokowski had given the American premieres of the Eighth Symphony and in Philadelphia. The Eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to New York where it scored a further triumph.\nAn early proponent of Mahler's work in Britain was Adrian Boult, who as conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra performed the Fourth Symphony in 1926 and in 1930. The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra brought and the Ninth Symphony to Manchester in 1931; Sir Henry Wood staged the Eighth in London in 1930, and again in 1938 when the young Benjamin Britten found the performance \"execrable\" but was nevertheless impressed by the music. British critics during this period largely treated Mahler with condescension and faint praise. Thus Dyneley Hussey, writing in 1934, thought the \"children's songs\" were delightful, but that the symphonies should be let go. Composer-conductor Julius Harrison described Mahler's symphonies as \"interesting at times, but laboriously put together\" and as lacking creative spark. Bernard Shaw reported that the younger generation of the 1930s found Mahler (and Bruckner) \"expensively second-class\".\nBefore Mahler's music was banned as \"degenerate\" during the Nazi era, the symphonies and songs were played in the concert halls of Germany and Austria, often conducted by Bruno Walter or Mahler's younger assistant Otto Klemperer, and also by Willem Mengelberg. In Austria, Mahler's work experienced a brief renaissance between 1934 and 1938, a period known today as 'Austrofascism', when the authoritarian regime with the help of Alma Mahler and Bruno Walter, who were both on friendly terms with the new chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, sought to make Mahler into a national icon (with a status comparable to that of Wagner in Germany). Mahler's music was performed during the Nazi era in Berlin in early 1941 and in Amsterdam during the German occupation of the Netherlands by Jewish orchestras and for Jewish audiences alone; works performed included the Second Symphony (Berlin), the First and Fourth Symphonies, and the \"Songs of a Wayfarer\" (Amsterdam).\nModern revival.\nAccording to American composer David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used to imply that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50\u00a0years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative\u2014far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach in the years after his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland. Mahler himself predicted his place in history, once commenting: \"Would that I could perform my symphonies for the first time 50 years after my death!\"\nDeryck Cooke argues that Mahler's popularity escalated when a new, postwar generation of music lovers arose, untainted by \"the dated polemics of anti-romanticism\" which had affected Mahler's reputation in the inter-war years. In this more-liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places\u2014Spain, France, Italy\u2014which had long been resistant to him. Jonathan Carr's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that \"it was the long-playing record [in the early 1950s] rather than the which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler's work became accessible and repeatable in the home.\" In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly became one of the most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that \"it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty\", adding that \"a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [to the critic] long letters of furious denunciation.\"\nIn a letter to Alma dated 16 February 1902, Mahler wrote, with reference to Richard Strauss: \"My day will come when his is ended. If only I might live to see it, with you at my side!\" Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see \"his day\"; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.\nLater influence.\n Donald Mitchell writes that Mahler's influence on succeeding generations of composers is \"a complete subject in itself\". Mahler's first disciples included Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who together founded the Second Viennese School. Mahler's music influenced the trio's move from progressive tonalism to atonality (music without a key); although Mahler rejected atonality, he became a fierce defender of the bold originality of Schoenberg's work. At the premiere of the latter's First String Quartet in February 1907, Mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking the hecklers. Schoenberg's Serenade, Op. 24 (1923), Berg's Three Pieces for Orchestra (1915) and Webern's Six Pieces (1928) all carry echoes of Mahler's Seventh Symphony. Mahler has also influenced the film scores of John Williams and other Hollywood composers.\nAmong other composers whose work carries the influence of Mahler, Mitchell lists America's Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy's Luciano Berio, Russia's Dmitri Shostakovich and England's Benjamin Britten. The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler's work. In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was \"very strong and obvious\"; their music represented \"the individual versus the vices of the world.\" Mitchell highlights Britten's \"marvellously keen, spare and independent writing for the wind in\u00a0... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [which] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish.\" Mitchell concludes with the statement: \"Even were his own music not to survive, Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques.\" A 2016 \"BBC Music Magazine\" survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in the top ten symphonies of all time.\nMemorials and museums.\nIn Hamburg, the Gustav Mahler Museum is dedicated to Gustav Mahler's life and work. It is situated in the Composers Quarter. In Altschluderbach, near Toblach in South Tyrol, Italy, there remains a little museum and memorial in the former composer's hut of Mahler. It is situated in the animal park next to the Gustav Mahler Stube. The \"Stube\" formerly had a museum on the first floor. There, Mahler and his wife Alma resided from 1907 to 1910. \nTwo of the other composer's huts used by Mahler still exist; both are equipped as little museums. There is one composing hut at the Attersee, Upper Austria, and one at the W\u00f6rthersee in Carinthia. Mount Mahler in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado is named in honour of the composer.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "65178", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65178", "title": "Hobo", "text": "Migratory worker or homeless vagabond\nA hobo is a migrant worker in the United States. Hoboes, tramps, and bums are generally regarded as related, but distinct: a hobo travels and is willing to work; a tramp travels, but avoids work if possible; a bum neither travels nor works.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the term is unknown. According to etymologist Anatoly Liberman, the only certain detail about its origin is the word was first noticed in American English circa 1890. The term has also been dated to 1889 in the Western\u2014probably Northwestern\u2014United States, and to 1888. Liberman points out that many folk etymologies fail to answer the question: \"Why did the word become widely known in California (just there) by the early Nineties (just then)?\" Author Todd DePastino mentions possible derivations from \"hoe-boy\", meaning \"farmhand\", or a greeting \"Ho, boy\", but that he does not find these convincing. Bill Bryson suggests in \"Made in America\" (1998) that it might come from the railroad greeting, \"Ho, beau!\" or a syllabic abbreviation of \"homeward bound\". It could also come from the words \"homeless boy\" or \"homeless Bohemian\". H. L. Mencken, in his \"The American Language\" (4th ed., 1937), wrote:\nTramps and hobos are commonly lumped together, but in their own sight they are sharply differentiated. A \"hobo\" or \"bo\" is simply a migratory laborer; he may take some longish holidays, but soon or late he returns to work. A \"tramp\" never works if it can be avoided; he simply travels. Lower than either is the \"bum\", who neither works nor travels, save when impelled to motion by the police.\nHistory.\nWhile there have been drifters in every society, the term became common only after the broad adoption of railroads provided free, though illegal, travel by hopping aboard train cars (so-called \"freighthopping\"). With the end of the American Civil War in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began to hop freight trains. Others looking for work on the American frontier followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by \"The New York Telegraph\" in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.\nThe number of hoboes increased greatly during the Great Depression era of the 1930s. With no work and no prospects at home, many decided to try their luck elsewhere by freight train.\nHobo life was dangerous. Itinerant, poor, far from home and support, hoboes also faced the hostility of many train crews and the railroad police, nicknamed \"bulls\", who often dealt violently with trespassers. British poet W. H. Davies, author of \"The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp\", lost a foot when he fell under the wheels trying to jump aboard a train. It was easy to get trapped between cars, and one could freeze to death in cold weather. When freezer cars were loaded at an ice factory, any hobo inside was likely to be killed.\nAround the end of World War II, railroads began to move from steam to diesel locomotives, making jumping freight trains more difficult due to higher speeds and less frequent stops. This, along with postwar prosperity, led to a decline in the number of hoboes. In the 1970s and 1980s hobo numbers were augmented by returning Vietnam War veterans, many of whom were disillusioned with settled society. Overall, the national economic demand for a mobile surplus labor force has declined over time, leading to fewer hoboes.\nCulture.\nExpressions used through the 1940s.\nHoboes were noted for, among other things, the distinctive lingo that arose among them. Some examples follow:\nMany hobo terms have become part of common language, such as \"big house\", \"glad rags\", \"main drag\", and others.\nHobo signs and graffiti.\nAlmost from the beginning of the existence of hoboes, as early as the 1870s, it was reported that they communicated with each other by way of a system of cryptic \"hobo signs\", which would be chalked in prominent or relevant places to clandestinely alert future hoboes about important local information. Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include:\nReports of hoboes using these symbols appeared in newspapers and popular books straight through the Depression, and continue to turn up in American popular culture; for example, John Hodgman's book \"The Areas of My Expertise\" features a section on hobo signs listing signs found in newspapers of the day as well as several whimsical ones invented by Hodgman, and the Free Art and Technology Lab released a QR Hobo Code, with a QR stenciler, in July 2011. Displays on hobo signs have been exhibited in the Steamtown National Historic Site at Scranton, Pennsylvania, operated by the National Park Service, and in the National Cryptologic Museum in Annapolis Junction, Maryland, and Webster's \"Third New International Dictionary\" supplies a listing of hobo signs under the entry for \"hobo\".\nDespite an apparently strong record of authentication, however, there is doubt as to whether hobo signs were ever actually in practical use by hoboes. They may simply have been invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the folklore surrounding hoboes soon after they acquired the name, an invention perpetuated and embellished by others over the years, aided occasionally by amenable hoboes themselves. Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\". Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a University of Chicago master's thesis, wrote in 1932,Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 \"American Tramp and Underworld Slang\"] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe. Though newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the Depression) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, these may have been staged in order to add color to the story.\nNonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of 'monikers' (sometimes 'monicas'). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. Jack London, in recounting his hobo days, wrote,Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars. However, not all moniker writers (or \"boxcar artists\") are hoboes; Bozo Texino in fact worked for the railroad, though others such as \"A No. 1\" and \"Palm Tree Herby\" rode trains as tramps or hoboes.\nEthical code.\nHobo culture\u2014though it has always had many points of contact with the mainstream American culture of its day\u2014has also always been somewhat separate and distinct, with different cultural norms. Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hoboes and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hoboes themselves from attempting the exercise. An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 (a hobo union created in the mid-1800s to dodge anti-vagrancy laws, which did not apply to union members) during its 1889 National Hobo Convention:\nConventions.\nGeneral.\nThere are numerous hobo conventions throughout the United States each year. The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts. Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or \"railroad days\"; others quasi-private affairs hosted by long-time hoboes; still others surreptitious affairs on private land, as in abandoned quarries along major rivers.\nMost non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical railroad stops. The most notable is the National Hobo Convention held in Britt, Iowa. The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years. Since 1934 the convention has been held annually in Britt, on the second weekend in August.\nNotable persons.\nNotable persons who have hoboed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn mainstream culture.\nFictional characters.\nExamples of characters based on hoboes include:\nMusic.\nArtists.\nMusicians known for hobo songs include: Tim Barry, Baby Gramps, Railroad Earth, Harry McClintock, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Utah Phillips, Jimmie Rodgers, Seasick Steve, and Boxcar Willie.\nSongs.\nExamples of hobo songs include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65179", "revid": "33959159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65179", "title": "Nyarlathotep", "text": "Fictional Lovecraftian god\nNyarlathotep is a fictional character created by H. P. Lovecraft. The character is a malign deity in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe. First appearing in Lovecraft's 1920 prose poem \"Nyarlathotep\", he was later mentioned in other works by Lovecraft and by other writers, to the point of often being considered the main antagonist of the Cthulhu Mythos as a whole. He is presented as the messenger of Azathoth. He is later described by other authors as being part of the Other Gods, an alien pantheon.\nAppearances.\nIn the works of H. P. Lovecraft.\nIn his first appearance in \"Nyarlathotep\" (1920), he is described as a \"tall, swarthy man\" who resembles an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. In this story he wanders the Earth, seemingly gathering legions of followers, the narrator of the story among them, through his demonstrations of strange and seemingly magical instruments. These followers lose awareness of the world around them, and through the narrator's increasingly unreliable accounts, the reader gets an impression of the world's collapse. Fritz Leiber proposes three interpretations of the character based on this appearance: the universe's mockery of man's attempts to understand it; a negative view of the commercial world, represented by Nyarlathotep's self-promotion and contemptuous attitude; and man's self-destructive rationality.\nNyarlathotep subsequently appears as a major character in \"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\" (1926/27), in which he again manifests in the form of an Egyptian pharaoh when he confronts protagonist Randolph Carter. Leiber describes Nyarlathotep as \"evilly intelligent\" in this story, in contrast to the mindless Azathoth, his master.\nThe 21st sonnet of Lovecraft's poem-cycle \"Fungi from Yuggoth\" (1929/30) is essentially a retelling of the original prose poem.\nIn \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (1933), Nyarlathotep appears to Walter Gilman and witch Keziah Mason (who has made a pact with the entity) in the form of \"the 'Black Man' of the witch-cult\", a black-skinned avatar of the Devil described by witch hunters. Although inhuman, some characters mistake him as a human of African descent, though his facial features are described as Caucasian.\nFinally, in \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (1936), the nocturnal, tentacled, bat-winged monster dwelling in the steeple of the Starry Wisdom sect's church is identified as another manifestation of Nyarlathotep. This avatar cannot tolerate light.\nLovecraft suggests that the fake Henry Akeley that appears at the end of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1930) is also Nyarlathotep. In the story, the Mi-Go chant his name in reverential tones, stating \"To Nyarlathotep, Mighty Messenger, must all things be told. And he shall put on the semblance of man, the waxen mask and the robes that hide, and come down from the world of Seven Suns to mock.\" At the end of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\", the main character to his horror discovers a loose dressing gown and the severed head and arms of Akeley lying on the couch, presumed in the story to have been a Mi-Go in disguise. But due to the mention in the chant to Nyarlathotep wearing the \"waxen mask and the robes that hide\", S. T. Joshi writes that \"this seems a clear allusion to Nyarlathotep disguised with Akeley's face and hands; but if so, it means that at this time Nyarlathotep is, in bodily form, one of the fungi \u2014 especially if, as seems likely, Nyarlathotep is one of the two buzzing voices Albert Wilmarth overhears at the end.\" Joshi notes this is problematic, because \"if Nyarlathotep is (as critics have termed it) a 'shapeshifter', why would he have to don the face and hands of Akeley instead of merely reshaping himself as Akeley?\"\nThough Nyarlathotep appears as a character in only four stories and two sonnets, his name is mentioned frequently in other works. In \"The Rats in the Walls\" (1924), Nyarlathotep is mentioned as a faceless god in the caverns of Earth's center. In \"The Shadow Out of Time\" (1936), the \"hideous secret of Nyarlathotep\" is revealed to the protagonist by Khephnes during their imprisonment by the Great Race of Yith.\nNyarlathotep does not appear in Lovecraft's story \"The Crawling Chaos\" (1920/21), despite the similarity of the title to the character's epithet. Lovecraft wrote to a correspondent that he reused the phrase because he \"liked the sound of it\".\nOther appearances.\nNyarlathotep has also appeared outside of Lovecraft's own writings. The light novel and anime series \"Haiyore! Nyaruko-san\" (2009) is based on the Cthulhu mythos, with the main character Nyaruko directly referring to Nyarlathotep.\nMasks of Nyarlathotep is a globe-spanning adventure campaign for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, first published in 1984. \nNyarlathotep appears in the guise of the Dark Man in Larry Correia's story \"Dead Waits Dreaming\" (2013).\nThough he does not appear in Lovecraft's original short story, Nyarlathotep in his \"Black Man\" form appears in the 1993 Caliber Comics adaption of \"The Music of Erich Zann\", in flashbacks for the eponymous Erich Zann.\nAlan Moore's limited comic series \"Neonomicon\" (2010\u20132011) utilizes Nyarlathotep in the form of Johnny Carcosa, a masked drug dealer who frequents Cthulhu-themed clubs and occult shops. His manner of converting new followers is to place them in a vegetative state, susceptible to \"Aklo\"\u2014words related to Lovecraft's work, which alter the consciousness of those who listen to them. In Moore's story, he serves the allegorical role of the Archangel Gabriel at the Annunciation, informing the protagonist that she has been impregnated and will soon give birth to Cthulhu. Carcosa takes a more active role in Moore's follow-up volume \"Providence\", \"rewarding\" the protagonist, Robert Black, for his work as the \"herald\" of H. P. Lovecraft's effects on the world and later overseeing the birth of Cthulhu.\nIn the video game \"Dusk\", Nyarlathotep appears as the final enemy encounter. Instead of taking the form of a humanoid in the fight, however, he takes the form of a leviathan eldritch beast. How he has been worked into the plot is deliberately very vague, as he only appears at the very end, though it is clear that he was up to the trickery and manipulation of his past portrayals.\nIn the manga series \"Ghost Reaper Girl\" the head of the Eastern Branch is a woman called Nyarlathotep who uses the title \"The Chaos\". She is a dark skinned woman, with the lower half of the eye of Horus below her right eye.\nNyarlathotep is featured in several of the \"Shin Megami Tensei\" video games, as well as the \"Persona\" spin-offs, including \"\" and also the \"Persona 2\" duology, in which he is the main antagonist. He showcases shape shifting abilities there, by donning several characters' appearances and when fought as \"himself\", changes to a more unsettling and tentacled appearance. Although it can be noted that when defeated for the last time, he switches back to the human appearance of one of the playable characters.\nIn Charles Stross' series \"The Laundry Files\", a human avatar of Nyarlathotep under the name Fabian Everyman becomes UK's prime minister.\nIn the mobile video game \"Dragalia Lost\", there is a dragon named Nyarlathotep who appears in the Accursed Archives raid event.\nNyarlathotep appears as a playable unit in the 2016 Japanese mobile game \"Tokyo Afterschool Summoners\", where he is depicted as a popular DJ with a rep for causing chaos simply to cause chaos.\nNyarlathotep is the focus of an augmented reality game distributed by The Mysterious Package Company.\nNyarlathotep appears in the loosely-based 'Azathoth Rising' by Joseph S. Dale, as the guardian of the Necronomicon, as he tries to make wizards and other people of power use the spells in the book ostensibly to gain power.\nIn the 2007 visual novel \"\", Nyarlathotep is revealed to be the true identity of the character simply named 'the M'. The dimension of Sharnoth which is closely associated with Nyarlathotep also plays a significant part in the game's story.\nIn the 2017 game \"Sundered\", Nyarlathotep appears as the final boss, the god of a group of worshippers based on Lovecraftian mythology.\nIn the podcast \"https://\" created by Harlan Guthrie, Nyarlathotep appears as an enigmatic, manic, unpredictable and dramatic antagonist. In the podcast he uses the name Kayne, but is later revealed to be Nyarlathotep.\nNyarlathotep makes an appearance in the 2022 video game , as well as in its 2024 sequel, , as a character named Nyanlahotep, a female catgirl version of Nyarlathotep.\nInspiration.\nIn a 1921 letter to Reinhardt Kleiner, Lovecraft related the dream he had had\u2014described as \"the most realistic and horrible [nightmare] I have experienced since the age of ten\"\u2014that served as the basis for his prose poem \"Nyarlathotep\". In the dream, he received a letter from his friend Samuel Loveman that read:\nDon't fail to see Nyarlathotep if he comes to Providence. He is horrible\u2014horrible beyond anything you can imagine\u2014but wonderful. He haunts one for hours afterwards. I am still shuddering at what he showed.\nLovecraft commented:\nI had never heard the name NYARLATHOTEP before, but seemed to understand the allusion. Nyarlathotep was a kind of itinerant showman or lecturer who held forth in public halls and aroused widespread fear and discussion with his exhibitions. These exhibitions consisted of two parts\u2014first, a horrible\u2014possibly prophetic\u2014cinema reel; and later some extraordinary experiments with scientific and electrical apparatus. As I received the letter, I seemed to recall that Nyarlathotep was already in Providence... I seemed to remember that persons had whispered to me in awe of his horrors, and warned me not to go near him. But Loveman's dream letter decided me... As I left the house I saw throngs of men plodding through the night, all whispering affrightedly and bound in one direction. I fell in with them, afraid yet eager to see and hear the great, the obscure, the unutterable Nyarlathotep.\nWill Murray has speculated that this dream image of Nyarlathotep may have been inspired by the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose well-attended lectures did involve extraordinary experiments with electrical apparatus and whom some saw as a sinister figure.\nRobert M. Price proposes that the name Nyarlathotep may have been subconsciously suggested to Lovecraft by two names from Lord Dunsany, an author he much admired. Alhireth-Hotep, a false prophet, appears in Dunsany's \"The Gods of Pegana\", and Mynarthitep, a god described as \"angry\", appears in Dunsany's \"The Sorrow of Search\".\nIn the novella \"Mario and the Magician\" (German: Mario und der Zauberer) by the German writer Thomas Mann, written in 1929, only a few years later than Lovecraft had his dream about Nyarlahotep, a family on their holidays in an Italian seaside town attends a performance by a magician and hypnotist, Cavaliere Cipolla, who uses his mental powers in an abusive way to overwhelmingly control his audience. The magician, whose body is somehow disfigured but who has a strong mind, represents the mesmerizing power of authoritarian leaders in Europe at the time \u2014 he is autocratic beyond any measure, misuses power for coercing the audience to do things which they would not do, and is able to subjugate the crowd, counterbalancing his inferiority complex by artificially boosting his self-confidence. Cipolla later gets assassinated on stage by Mario, a young man from the audience, who got particularly humiliated by him. This deed is not seen as a tragedy but as liberation by the author and the audience.\nSummary.\nNyarlathotep differs from the other beings in a number of ways. Most of them are exiled to stars, like Yog-Sothoth and Hastur, or sleeping and dreaming like Cthulhu; Nyarlathotep, however, is active and frequently walks the Earth in the guise of a human being, usually a tall, slim, joyless man. He has \"a thousand\" other forms, most of these reputed to be maddeningly horrific. Most of the Outer Gods have their own cults serving them; Nyarlathotep seems to serve these cults and take care of the deities' affairs in their absence. Most of the gods use strange alien languages, but Nyarlathotep uses human languages and can be mistaken for a human being. The other Outer Gods and Great Old Ones are often described as mindless or unfathomable rather than truly malevolent, but Nyarlathotep delights in cruelty, is deceptive and manipulative, and even cultivates followers and uses propaganda to achieve his goals.\nNyarlathotep enacts the will of the Outer Gods, and is their messenger, heart and soul; he is also a servant of Azathoth, his father, whose wishes he immediately fulfills. Unlike the other Outer Gods, causing madness is more important and enjoyable than death and destruction to Nyarlathotep. It is suggested by some that he will destroy the human race and possibly the Earth as well.\nNyarlathotep is an immensely powerful being, as he is able take anything to the throne of Azathoth, which is at the center of Ultimate Chaos. He also envelops the world in darkness and causes waves of destruction to emanate from \"ultimate space\", and he also causes groups of people to go insane. Nyarlathotep also knows the truths and futures of things that are incomprehensible to the human mind.\n\"The Nyarlathotep Cycle\".\nIn 1996, Chaosium published \"The Nyarlathotep Cycle\", a Cthulhu Mythos anthology focusing on works referring to or inspired by the entity Nyarlathotep. Edited by Lovecraft scholar Robert M. Price, the book includes an introduction by Price tracing the roots and development of the God of a Thousand Forms.

{"id": "65184", "revid": "50857544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65184", "title": "QNX", "text": "Real-time operating system (RTOS) software\nQNX ( or ) is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market.\nThe product was originally developed in the early 1980s by Canadian company Quantum Software Systems, founded March 30, 1980, and later renamed QNX Software Systems.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], it is used in a variety of devices including automobiles, medical devices, program logic controllers, automated manufacturing, trains, and more.\nHistory.\nGordon Bell and Dan Dodge, both students at the University of Waterloo in 1980, took a course in real-time operating systems, in which the students constructed a basic real-time microkernel and user programs. Both were convinced there was a commercial need for such a system, and moved to the high-tech planned community Kanata, Ontario, to start Quantum Software Systems that year. In 1982, the first version of QUNIX was released for the Intel 8088 CPU. In 1984, Quantum Software Systems renamed QUNIX to QNX (Quantum's Network eXecutive) in an effort to avoid any trademark infringement challenges.\nOne of the first widespread uses of the QNX real-time OS (RTOS) was in the nonembedded world when it was selected as the operating system for the Ontario education system's own computer design, the Unisys ICON. Over the years QNX was used mostly for larger projects, as its 44k kernel was too large to fit inside the one-chip computers of the era. The system garnered a reputation for reliability and became used in running machinery in many industrial applications.\nIn the late-1980s, Quantum realized that the market was rapidly moving towards the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) model and decided to rewrite the kernel to be much more compatible at a low level. The result was QNX 4. During this time Patrick Hayden, while working as an intern, along with Robin Burgener (a full-time employee at the time), developed a new windowing system. This patented concept was developed into the embeddable graphical user interface (GUI) named the QNX Photon microGUI. QNX also provided a version of the X Window System.\nTo demonstrate the OS's capability and relatively small size, in the late 1990s QNX released a demo image that included the POSIX-compliant QNX 4 OS, a full graphical user interface, graphical text editor, TCP/IP networking, web browser and web server that all fit on a bootable 1.44\u00a0MB floppy disk for the 386 PC.\nToward the end of the 1990s, the company, then named QNX Software Systems, began work on a new version of QNX, designed from the ground up to be symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) capable, and to support all current POSIX application programming interfaces (APIs) and any new POSIX APIs that could be anticipated while still retaining the microkernel architecture. This resulted in QNX Neutrino, released in 2001.\nAlong with the Neutrino kernel, QNX Software Systems became a founding member of the Eclipse (integrated development environment) consortium. The company released a suite of Eclipse plug-ins packaged with the Eclipse workbench in 2002, and named QNX Momentics Tool Suite.\nIn 2004, the company announced it had been sold to Harman International Industries. Before this acquisition, QNX software was already widely used in the automotive industry for telematics systems. Since the purchase by Harman, QNX software has been designed into over 200 different automobile makes and models, in telematics systems, and in infotainment and navigation units. The QNX CAR Application Platform was running in over 20 million vehicles as of mid-2011. The company has since released several middleware products including the QNX Aviage Multimedia Suite, the QNX Aviage Acoustic Processing Suite and the QNX HMI Suite.\nThe microkernels of Cisco Systems' IOS-XR (ultra high availability IOS, introduced 2004) and IOS Software Modularity (introduced 2006) were based on QNX. IOS Software Modularity never gained traction and was limited only to small run for Catalyst 6500, while IOS XR moved to Linux https://.\nIn September 2007, QNX Software Systems announced the availability of some of its source code.\nOn April 9, 2010, Research In Motion (later renamed to BlackBerry Limited) announced they would acquire QNX Software Systems from Harman International Industries. On the same day, QNX source code access was restricted from the public and hobbyists.\nIn September 2010, the company announced a tablet computer, the BlackBerry PlayBook, and a new operating system BlackBerry Tablet OS based on QNX to run on the tablet.\nOn October 18, 2011, Research In Motion announced \"BBX\", which was later renamed \"BlackBerry 10\", in December 2011. Blackberry 10 devices build upon the BlackBerry PlayBook QNX based operating system for touch devices, but adapt the user interface for smartphones using the Qt based Cascades Native User-Interface framework.\nAt the Geneva Motor Show, Apple demonstrated CarPlay which provides an iOS-like user interface to head units in compatible vehicles. Once configured by the automaker, QNX can be programmed to hand off its display and some functions to an Apple CarPlay device.\nOn December 11, 2014, Ford Motor Company stated that it would replace Microsoft Auto with QNX.\nIn January 2017, QNX announced the upcoming release of its SDP 7.0, with support for Intel and ARM 32- and 64-bit platforms, and support for C++14. It was released in March 2017.\nIn December 2023, QNX released QNX SDP 8.0 which is powered by a next generation microkernel with support for the latest Intel and ARM [v8 and v9] 64 bit platforms, GCC12 based toolchain and a QNX toolkit for Visual Studio Code.\nTechnology.\nAs a microkernel-based OS, QNX is based on the idea of running most of the operating system kernel in the form of a number of small tasks, named Resource Managers. This differs from the more traditional monolithic kernel, in which the operating system kernel is one very large program composed of a huge number of parts, with special abilities. In the case of QNX, the use of a microkernel allows users (developers) to turn off any functions they do not need without having to change the OS. Instead, such services will simply not run.\nThe QNX kernel, codice_1 (also name of the binary executable program for the QNX Neutrino ('nto') process ('proc') itself), contains only CPU scheduling, interprocess communication, interrupt redirection and timers. Everything else runs as a user process, including a special process known as codice_2 which performs process creation and memory management by operating in conjunction with the microkernel. This is made possible by two key mechanisms: subroutine-call type interprocess communication, and a boot loader which can load an image containing the kernel and any desired set of user programs and shared libraries. There are no device drivers in the kernel. The network stack is based on NetBSD code. Along with its support for its own, native, device drivers, QNX supports its legacy, \"io-net manager\" server, and the network drivers ported from NetBSD.\nQNX interprocess communication consists of sending a message from one process to another and waiting for a reply. This is a single operation, called codice_3. The message is copied, by the kernel, from the address space of the sending process to that of the receiving process. If the receiving process is waiting for the message, control of the CPU is transferred at the same time, without a pass through the CPU scheduler. Thus, sending a message to another process and waiting for a reply does not result in \"losing one's turn\" for the CPU. This tight integration between message passing and CPU scheduling is one of the key mechanisms that makes QNX message passing broadly usable. Most Unix and Linux interprocess communication mechanisms lack this tight integration, although a user space implementation of QNX-type messaging for Linux does exist. Mishandling of this subtle issue is a primary reason for the disappointing performance of some other microkernel systems such as early versions of Mach. The recipient process need not be on the same physical machine.\nAll I/O operations, file system operations, and network operations were meant to work through this mechanism, and the data transferred was copied during message passing. Later versions of QNX reduce the number of separate processes and integrate the network stack and other function blocks into single applications for performance reasons.\nMessage handling is prioritized by thread priority. Since I/O requests are performed using message passing, high priority threads receive I/O service before low priority threads, an essential feature in a hard real-time system.\nThe boot loader is the other key component of the minimal microkernel system. Because user programs can be built into the boot image, the set of device drivers and support libraries needed for startup need not be, and are not, in the kernel. Even such functions as program loading are not in the kernel, but instead are in shared user-space libraries loaded as part of the boot image. It is possible to put an entire boot image into ROM, which is used for diskless embedded systems.\nNeutrino supports symmetric multiprocessing and processor affinity, called bound multiprocessing (BMP) in QNX terminology. BMP is used to improve cache hitting and to ease the migration of non-SMP safe applications to multi-processor computers.\nNeutrino supports strict priority-preemptive scheduling and adaptive partition scheduling (APS). APS guarantees minimum CPU percentages to selected groups of threads, even though others may have higher priority. The adaptive partition scheduler is still strictly priority-preemptive when the system is underloaded. It can also be configured to run a selected set of critical threads strictly real time, even when the system is overloaded.\nThe QNX operating system also contained a web browser known as 'Voyager'.\nDue to its microkernel architecture QNX is also a distributed operating system. Dan Dodge and Peter van der Veen hold http:// based on the QNX operating system's distributed processing features known commercially as Transparent Distributed Processing. This allows the QNX kernels on separate devices to access each other's system services using effectively the same communication mechanism as is used to access local services.\nUses.\nThe BlackBerry PlayBook tablet computer designed by BlackBerry uses a version of QNX as the primary operating system. The BlackBerry 10 operating system is also based on QNX.\nQNX is also used in car infotainment systems with many major car makers offering variants that include an embedded QNX architecture. It is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL.\nSince the introduction of its \"Safe Kernel 1.0\" in 2010, QNX was projected and used subsequently in automated drive or ADAS systems for automotive projects that require a functional safety certified RTOS. QNX provides this with its QNX OS for Safety products.\nQNX Neutrino (2001) has been ported to a number of platforms and now runs on practically any modern central processing unit (CPU) family that is used in the embedded market. This includes the PowerPC, x86, MIPS, SH-4, and the closely interrelated group of ARM, StrongARM, and XScale.\n QNX software is now embedded in over 255 million vehicles worldwide, including most leading OEMs and Tier 1s, such as BMW, Bosch, Continental, Dongfeng Motor, Geely, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, and more.\nLicensing.\nOn January 6, 2025, QNX made its software development platform available for non-commercial use.\nQNX offers a license for noncommercial and academic users. In January 2024, BlackBerry introduced QNX Everywhere to make QNX more accessible to Hobbyists. QNX Everywhere was made publicly accessible in early 2024.\nCommunity.\nQNX Board Support Packages.\nQNX Standard Support is available for a BSP that is listed below as available on QNX Software Center. For other BSPs, alternative forms of support (e.g., custom support plans, etc.) may be available or required from the \u201cBSP Supplier\u201d or \u201cBoard Vendor\u201d indicated below.\nBlackBerry QNX Partners.\nBlackBerry QNX has worked with a network of partner organizations to provide complementary technologies. These important relationships have ability to provide the foundational software, middleware, and services behind the world's most critical embedded systems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its capital city is Chengdu, and its population stands at 83\u00a0million. Sichuan neighbors Qinghai and Gansu to the north, Shaanxi and Chongqing to the east, Guizhou and Yunnan to the south, and Tibet to the west.\nDuring antiquity, Sichuan was home to the kingdoms of Ba and Shu until their incorporation by the Qin. During the Three Kingdoms era (220\u2013280), Liu Bei's state of Shu was based in Sichuan. The area was devastated in the 17th century by Zhang Xianzhong's rebellion and the area's subsequent Manchu conquest. However, the area recovered to become one of China's most productive by the 19th century. During World War II, Chongqing served as the temporary capital of the Republic of China, and was heavily bombed. It was one of the last mainland areas captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War, and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952, with Chongqing restored two years later. It suffered gravely during the Great Chinese Famine (1959\u20131961) but remained China's most-populous province until Chongqing was again separated from it in 1997.\nThe Sichuanese people speak distinctive dialects of Mandarin Chinese. The Sichuan pepper, with its distinctive flavor and numbing effect, is prominent in modern Sichuan cuisine, featuring dishes, including Kung Pao chicken and mapo tofu, that have become staples of Chinese cuisine around the world. \nThere are many panda stations in the province and large reserves for these creatures, such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\nSichuan is the 6th-largest provincial economy of China, the largest in Western China, and the second-largest among inland provinces after Henan. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was CN\u00a5 (US$847.68 billion), ahead of that of Turkey ($815 billion). If it were its own country, Sichuan would be the 18th-largest economy and 19th-most populous as of 2021.\nNames.\nIt is commonly assumed that the name \"Sichuan\" means 'four rivers'; in folk etymology, this is usually taken to mean any four of the province's major rivers: Jialing, Jinsha (or the Yangtze), Wu, Min, and Tuo. According to historical geographer Tan Qixiang, 'four rivers' is an erroneous interpretation of the name. The name of the province is a contraction of the phrases 'Four Plain Circuits' () and 'Four Circuits of Chuanxia' (), referring to the division of the existing imperial administrative circuit in the area into four during the Northern Song dynasty, which were Yizhou, Lizhou, Zizhou, and Kuizhou. The word \"chuan\" () here means 'plain', not its typical meaning of 'river' as popularly assumed. In addition to its postal map and Wade\u2013Giles forms, the name has also been irregularly romanized as \"Sz\u0171-chuan\" and \"Szechuen\".\nIn antiquity, the area of modern Sichuan including the now-separated Chongqing Municipality was known to the Chinese as \"Ba\u2013Shu\", in reference to the ancient state of Ba and the ancient kingdom of Shu that once occupied the Sichuan Basin. \"Shu\" continued to be used to refer to the region to the present day; several states formed in the area used the same name, for example, the Shu of the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280), and Former Shu and Later Shu of the Ten Kingdoms period (907\u2013979). Currently, both characters for \"Shu\" and \"Chuan\" are common abbreviations for Sichuan.\nThe region was formerly referred to as \"West China\" or \"Western China\" by Protestant missions.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe Sichuan Basin and adjacent areas of the Yangtze watershed were a cradle of indigenous civilizations dating back to at least the 15th century\u00a0BC, coinciding with the Shang in northern China. The region had its own distinct religious beliefs and worldview. The earliest excavated culture found therein is the Baodun culture (c.2700\u20131750 BC) excavated in the Chengdu Plain.\nBa and Shu Kingdoms.\nThe most important native states were those of Ba and Shu.\nBa stretched into Sichuan from the Han Valley in Shaanxi and Hubei down the Jialing River as far as its confluence with the Yangtze at Chongqing.\nShu occupied the valley of the Min, including Chengdu and other areas of western Sichuan. The existence of the early state of Shu was poorly recorded in the main historical records of China. It was, however, referred to in the \"Book of Documents\" as an ally of the Zhou. Accounts of Shu exist mainly as a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends recorded in local annals such as the \"Chronicles of Huayang\" compiled in the Jin dynasty (266\u2013420), and the Han-dynasty compilation \"Chronicle of the Kings of Shu\". These contained folk stories such as that of Emperor Duyu who taught the people agriculture and transformed himself into a cuckoo after his death. The existence of a highly developed civilization with an independent bronze industry in Sichuan was excavated in 1986 at a small village named Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site, believed to be an ancient city of Shu, was initially discovered by a local farmer in 1929 who found jade and stone artifacts. Excavations by archeologists yielded few significant finds until 1986 when two major sacrificial pits were found with spectacular bronze items as well as artifacts in jade, gold, earthenware, and stone. This and other discoveries in Sichuan contest the conventional historiography that the local culture and technology of Sichuan were undeveloped in comparison to the technologically and culturally \"advanced\" Yellow River valley of north-central China.\nQin dynasty.\nThe rulers of the expansionist state of Qin, based in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi, were the first strategists to realize that the area's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance. The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the Hengduan Mountains to the west, the Qin Mountains to the north, and Yungui Plateau to the south. Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Three Gorges to eastern and southern China, Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a haven for political refugees.\nQin armies finished their conquest of the kingdoms of Shu and Ba by 316 BC. Any written records and civil achievements of earlier kingdoms were destroyed. Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. Li Bing, engineered the Dujiangyan irrigation system to control the Min River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of movable weirs which could be adjusted for high or low water flow according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin's unification of China.\nHan dynasty.\nSichuan was subjected to the autonomous control of kings named by the imperial family of the Han dynasty. During the 11 years hiatus between 25 and 36 AD, Sichuan was controlled by the Chengjia Kingdom. Following the declining central government of the Han dynasty in the second century, the Sichuan basin, surrounded by mountains and easily defensible, became a popular place for upstart generals to found kingdoms that challenged the authority of Yangtze Valley emperors over China.\nThree Kingdoms.\nIn 221, during the partition following the fall of the Eastern Han \u2013 the era of the Three Kingdoms \u2013 Liu Bei founded the southwest kingdom of Shu Han (; 221\u2013263) in parts of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, with Chengdu as its capital. Shu-Han claimed to be the successor to the Han dynasty.\nIn 263, the Cao Wei of North China conquered the Kingdom of Shu-Han as a step on the path to reuniting China. Salt production becomes a major business in Ziliujing District. During the Six Dynasties period of Chinese disunity, Sichuan began to be populated by non-Han ethnic minority peoples, owing to the migration of Gelao people from the Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau to the Sichuan basin.\nTang dynasty.\nSichuan came under the firm control of a Chinese central government during the Sui dynasty, but it was during the subsequent Tang dynasty that Sichuan regained its previous political and cultural prominence for which it was known during the Han. Chengdu became nationally known as a supplier of armies and the home of Du Fu, who is sometimes called China's greatest poet. During the An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763), Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled from Chang'an to Sichuan which became his refuge. The region was torn by constant warfare and economic distress as it was besieged by the Tibetan Empire.\nFive Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms.\nIn the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Sichuan became the heart of the Shu kingdom with its capital in Chengdu. In 925, the kingdom was absorbed into Later Tang but would regain independence under Meng Zhixiang who founded Later Shu in 934. Later Shu would continue until 965 when it was absorbed by the Song.\nSong and Yuan dynasties.\nDuring the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), Sichuanese was able to protect themselves from Tibetan attacks with the help of the central government. There were rebellions against the Song by Li Shun in 994 and Wang Jun in 1000. Sichuan also saw cultural revivals like the great poets Su Xun (), Su Shi, and Su Zhe. Although paper currency was known in the Tang dynasty, in 1023 AD, the first true paper money in human history () was issued in Chengdu.\nIt was also during the Song dynasty that the bulk of the native Ba people of eastern Sichuan assimilated into the Han Chinese ethnicity.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, the Southern Song dynasty established coordinated defenses against the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, in Sichuan and Xiangyang. The Southern Song state monopolized the Sichuan tea industry to pay for warhorses, but this state intervention eventually brought devastation to the local economy. The line of defense was finally broken through after the first use of firearms in history during the six-year Battle of Xiangyang, which ended in 1273. Allegedly there were a million pieces of unspecified types of skeleton bones belonging to war animals and both Song and Yuan soldiers who perished in the fighting over the city, although the figure may have been grossly exaggerated. The recorded number of families in Sichuan dropped from 2,640,000 families, as recorded from the census taken in 1162 AD, to 120,000 families in 1282 AD. Possible causes include forced population transfer to nearby areas, evacuation to nearby provinces, census under-reporting or inaccuracy, and war-related deaths.\nOne instance of the deportation of Sichuanese civilians to Mongolia occurred in the aftermath of a battle in 1259 when more than 80,000 people were taken captive from one city in Sichuan and moved to Mongolia.\nMing dynasty.\nThe Ming dynasty defeated Ming Yuzhen's Xia polity which ruled Sichuan.\nDuring the Ming dynasty, major architectural works were created in Sichuan. Buddhism remained influential in the region. Bao'en Temple is a well-preserved 15th-century monastery complex built between 1440 and 1446 during the Zhengtong Emperor's reign (1427\u201364). Dabei Hall enshrines a thousand-armed wooden image of Guanyin and Huayan Hall is a repository with a revolving sutra cabinet. The wall paintings, sculptures, and other ornamental details are masterpieces of the Ming period.\nIn the middle of the 17th century, the peasant rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong (1606\u20131646) from Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, nicknamed \"Yellow Tiger\", led his peasant troop from north China to the south and conquered Sichuan. Upon capturing it, he declared himself emperor of the Daxi dynasty (). In response to the resistance from local elites, he massacred a large number of people in Sichuan, killing around one in three people. As a result of the massacre as well as years of turmoil during the Ming-Qing transition, the population of Sichuan fell sharply, requiring massive resettlement of people from the neighboring Huguang Province (modern Hubei and Hunan) and other provinces during the Qing dynasty.\nQing dynasty.\nSichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty but during the Qing plan to increase the population in 1671 they came to Sichuan again. In 1904 Deng Xiaoping was born in Sichuan.\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Sichuan was merged with Shaanxi and Shanxi to create \"Shenzhuan\" during 1680\u20131731 and 1735\u20131748. The current borders of Sichuan (which then included Chongqing) were established in the early 18th century. In the aftermath of the Sino-Nepalese War on China's southwestern border, the Qing gave Sichuan's provincial government direct control over the minority-inhabited areas of Sichuan west of Kangding, which had previously been handled by an amban.\nA landslide dam on the Dadu River caused by an earthquake gave way on 10 June 1786. The resulting flood killed 100,000 people.\nRepublic of China.\nIn the early 20th century, the newly founded Republic of China established the Chuanbian Special Administrative District () on the province's territories to the west of the Sichuan Basin. The Special District later became the province of Xikang, incorporating the areas inhabited by Yi, Tibetan, and Qiang ethnic minorities to its west, and eastern part of today's Tibet Autonomous Region.\nIn the 20th century, as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the capital of the Republic of China had been temporarily relocated to Chongqing, then a major city in Sichuan. An enduring legacy of this move is those nearby inland provinces, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, which previously never had modern Western-style universities, began to be developed in this regard. The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of the Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government during 1938\u201345 and led to the Bombing of Chongqing.\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War was soon followed by the resumed Chinese Civil War, and the cities of East China are obtained by the Communists one after another, the Kuomintang government again tried to make Sichuan its stronghold on the mainland, although it already saw some Communist activity since it was one area on the road of the Long March. Chiang Kai-shek himself flew to Chongqing from Taiwan in November 1949 to lead the defense. But the same month Chongqing switched to the Communists, followed by Chengdu on 10 December. The Kuomintang general Wang Sheng wanted to stay behind with his troops to continue the anticommunist guerilla war in Sichuan, but was recalled to Taiwan. Many of his soldiers made their way there as well, via Burma.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nThe People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, and it split Sichuan into four areas and separated Chongqing municipality. Sichuan was reconstituted in 1952, with Chongqing added in 1954, while the former Xikang province was split between Tibet in the west and Sichuan in the east.\nThe province was deeply affected by the Great Chinese Famine of 1959\u20131961, during which period some 9.4 million people (13.07% of the population at the time) died.\nIn 1978, when Deng Xiaoping took power, Sichuan was one of the first provinces to experiment with the market economic enterprise.\nFrom 1955 until 1997, Sichuan had been China's most populous province; the population hit the 100 million mark shortly after the 1982 census figure of 99,730,000. This changed in 1997 when the Sub-provincial city of Chongqing as well as the three surrounding prefectures of Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang were split off into the new Chongqing Municipality. The new municipality was formed to spearhead China's effort to economically develop its western provinces, as well as to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project.\nIn 1997, when Sichuan split, the sum of the two parts was recorded to be 114,720,000 people. As of 2010, Sichuan ranks as both the 3rd largest (the largest among Chinese provinces with a population greater than 50 million) and 4th most populous province in China.\nOn 12 May 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9/8.0 hit just northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu. Official figures recorded a death toll of over 87,000 people, and millions of people were left homeless.\nAdministrative divisions.\nSichuan consists of twenty-one prefecture-level divisions: eighteen prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city) and three autonomous prefectures:\nThe twenty prefectures of Sichuan are subdivided into 183 county-level divisions (53 districts, 17 county-level cities, 109 counties, and 4 autonomous counties). At the end of the year 2017, the total population is 83.02 million.\nUrban areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeography and biodiversity.\nSichuan consists of two geographically very distinct parts. The eastern part of the province is mostly within the fertile Sichuan basin (which is shared by Sichuan with Chongqing Municipality). The western Sichuan consists of numerous mountain ranges forming the easternmost part of the Tibetan Plateau, which are known generically as the Hengduan Mountains. One of these ranges, the Daxue Mountains, contains the highest point of the province Gongga Shan, at above sea level. The mountains are formed by the collision of the Tibetan Plateau with the Yangtze Plate. Faults here include the Longmenshan Fault which ruptured during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Other mountain ranges surround the Sichuan Basin from north, east, and south. Among them are the Daba Mountains, in the province's northeast.\nThe Yangtze River and its tributaries flow through the mountains of western Sichuan and the Sichuan Basin; thus, the province is upstream of the great cities that stand along the Yangtze River further to the east, such as Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. One of the major tributaries of the Yangtze within the province is the Min River of central Sichuan, which joins the Yangtze at Yibin. There are also a number of other rivers, such as the Jialing River, Tuo River, Yalong River, Wu River, and Jinsha River, and any four of the various rivers are often grouped as the \"four rivers\" that the name of Sichuan is commonly and mistakenly believed to mean.\nSichuan borders Qinghai to the northwest, Gansu to the north, Shaanxi to the northeast, Chongqing to the east, Guizhou to the southeast, Yunnan to the south, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the west.\nGiant panda.\nGiant pandas live in bamboo forests and low mountainous areas such as the Minshan Mountains in Sichuan. The majority of the panda population lives in Sichuan, with their range spreading into Shaanxi and Gansu. As it is abundant where they live, pandas' diet consists of 99% bamboo, with small other plants, or small animals consisting of the other 1%. As the panda is native to China, they have become a national symbol of China.\nClimate.\nDue to great differences in terrain, the climate of the province is highly variable. In general, it has strong monsoonal influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the Sichuan Basin (including Chengdu) in the eastern half of the province experiences a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwa\" or \"Cfa\"), with long, hot, wet summers and short, mild to cool, dry, and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals.\nThe western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate. Having cool to very cold winters and mild summers, temperatures generally decrease with greater elevation. Due to high altitude and inland location, the far northwestern areas like Garz\u00ea County and Zoig\u00ea County exhibit a subalpine climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dwc\") or even an alpine climate (\"ETH\"), featuring frigid winters down to and even cold summer nights. The region is geologically active with landslides and earthquakes. Average elevation ranges from ; average temperatures range from .\nThe southern part of the province, including Panzhihua and Xichang, has a sunny climate with short, very mild winters and very warm to hot summers.\nPolitics.\nThe politics of Sichuan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\nThe governor of Sichuan is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Sichuan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Party Secretary of Sichuan, colloquially termed the \"Sichuan CCP Party Chief\".\nGovernance.\nThe Sichuan Provincial Prison Administrative Bureau is the main corrections agency in Sichuan.\nThe Sichuan Provincial Public Security Department is the primary law enforcement agency in Sichuan. It has a SWAT unit, a forestry unit, an anti-drug unit, an economic crime unit, a food safety unit and an investigation unit. In 2021, the agency had a budget of 45.8 million Renminbi.\nOn July 10, 2017, the Sichuan Provincial Public Security Department established the Sichuan Provincial Expressways Public Security Bureau (), a provincial Highway patrol agency.\nThe People's Armed Police Sichuan Corps provides paramilitary law enforcement and disaster relief services within Sichuan province. The Yibin Detachment was deployed for disaster relief during the 2025 Junlian Landslides of February 8, 2025 in Junlian County, Yibin.\nThe Sichuan Provincial Fire and Rescue Department () is in charge of firefighting and rescue duties within the province.\nEconomy.\nSichuan is the 6th-largest provincial economy of China, the largest in Western China and the second largest among inland provinces after Henan. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was 5,385 billion yuan (US$847.68 billion), ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion. Compared to a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as well as the 19th most populous as of 2021. As of 2021, its nominal GDP per capita was 64,357 RMB (US$10,120). In 2021, the per capita net income of rural residents was 17,575 yuan (US$2760). The per capita disposable income of the urbanites averaged 41,444 yuan (US$6510).\nSichuan has been historically known as the \"Province of Abundance\". It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China. Grain, including rice and wheat, is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999. Commercial crops include citrus fruits, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, peaches, and grapes. Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999. Sichuan is rich in mineral resources. It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium, titanium, and lithium is the largest in China. The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3% of the reserves of iron, 93% of titanium, 69% of vanadium, and 83% of cobalt in the whole country. Sichuan also possesses China's largest proven natural gas reserves (such as the Dazhou and Yuanba gas fields), the majority of which are transported to more developed eastern regions.\nSichuan is one of the major industrial centers of China. It was a major recipient of China's investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.298 In addition to heavy industries such as coal, energy, iron, and steel, the province has also established a light industrial sector comprising building materials, wood processing, food, and silk processing. Chengdu and Mianyang are the production centers for textiles and electronics products. Deyang, Panzhihua, and Yibin are the production centers for machinery, metallurgical industries, and wine, respectively. Sichuan's wine production accounted for 21.9% of the country's total production in 2000.\nGreat strides have been made in developing Sichuan into a modern hi-tech industrial base, by encouraging both domestic and foreign investments in electronics and information technology (such as software), machinery and metallurgy (including automobiles), hydropower, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.\nThe auto industry is an important and key sector of the machinery industry in Sichuan. Most of the auto manufacturing companies are located in Chengdu, Mianyang, Nanchong, and Luzhou.\nOther important industries in Sichuan include aerospace and defense (military) industries. A number of China's rockets (Long March rockets) and satellites were launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in the city of Xichang.\nSichuan's landscapes and rich historical relics have also made the province a center for tourism.\nThe Three Gorges Dam, the largest dam ever constructed, was built on the Yangtze River in nearby Hubei province to control flooding in the Sichuan Basin, neighboring Yunnan province, and downstream. The plan is hailed by some as China's efforts to shift towards alternative energy sources and to further develop its industrial and commercial bases, but has been denounced for mass resettlement, loss of archeological sites, and ecological damage.\nEconomic development zones.\nChengdu Hi-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone.\nChengdu Hi-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone was established with the approval of the State Council on October 18, 2010, and passed the national acceptance on February 25, 2011. It was officially operated in May 2011. Chengdu High-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone is integrated and expanded from the former Chengdu Export Processing Zone and Chengdu Bonded Logistics Center. it is located in the Chengdu West High-tech Industrial Development Zone, with an area of 4.68 square kilometers and divided into three areas A, B, and C. The industries focus on notebook computer manufacturing, tablet computer manufacturing, wafer manufacturing, chip packaging testing, electronic components, precision machining, and the biopharmaceutical industry. Chengdu Hi-Tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone has attracted the top 500 multinational enterprises such as Intel, Foxconn, Texas Instruments, Dell, Morse, and so on.\nIn 2020, the Chengdu Hi-Tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone achieved a total import and export volume of 549.1 billion yuan (including the Shuangliu Sub-zone), accounting for 68% of the province's total foreign trade import and export volume, ranking first in the national comprehensive insurance zone import and export volume for three consecutive years.\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone.\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone () was approved as state-level development zone in February 2000. The zone now has a developed area of and a planned area of . Chengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone (CETDZ) lies east of Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province and the hub of transportation and communication in southwest China. The zone has attracted investors and developers from more than 20 countries to carry out their projects there. Industries encouraged in the zone include mechanical, electronic, new building materials, medicine, and food processing.\nChengdu Export Processing Zone.\nChengdu Export Processing Zone ()) was ratified by the State Council as one of the first 15 export processing zones in the country in April 2000. In 2002, the state ratified the establishment of the Sichuan Chengdu Export Processing West Zone with a planned area of , located inside the west region of the Chengdu Hi-tech Zone.\nChengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone.\nEstablished in 1988, Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone () was approved as one of the first national hi-tech development zones in 1991. In 2000, it was open to APEC and has been recognized as a national advanced hi-tech development zone in successive assessment activities held by China's Ministry of Science and Technology. It ranks 5th among the 53 national hi-tech development zones in China in terms of comprehensive strength.\nChengdu Hi-tech Development Zone covers an area of , consisting of South Park and West Park. By relying on the city sub-center, which is under construction, South Park is focusing on creating a modernized industrial park of science and technology with scientific and technological innovation, incubation R&amp;D, modern service industry, and Headquarters economy playing leading roles. Priority has been given to the development of the software industry. Located on both sides of the \"Chengdu-Dujiangyan-Jiuzhaigou\" golden tourism channel, the West Park aims at building a comprehensive industrial park targeting industrial clustering with complete supportive functions. West Park gives priority to three major industries i.e. electronic information, biomedicine, and precision machinery.\nMianyang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone.\nMianyang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was established in 1992, with a planned area of . The zone is situated 96 kilometers away from Chengdu and is away from Mianyang Airport. Since its establishment, the zone accumulated 177.4 billion yuan of industrial output, 46.2 billion yuan of gross domestic product, and fiscal revenue of 6.768 billion yuan. There are more than 136 high-tech enterprises in the zone and they accounted for more than 90% of the total industrial output.\nThe zone is a leader in the electronic information industry, biological medicine, new materials, and the production of motor vehicles and parts.\nTransportation.\nFor millennia, Sichuan's rugged and riverine landscape presented enormous challenges to the development of transportation infrastructure, and the lack of roads out of the Sichuan Basin contributed to the region's isolation. Since the 1950s, numerous highways and railways have been built through the Qinling in the north and the Bashan in the east. Dozens of bridges across the Yangtze and its tributaries to the south and west have brought greater connectivity with Yunnan and Tibet.\nAirports.\nChengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the 4th-busiest airport in mainland China. It was among the world's top 30 busiest airports in 2015, and the busiest in western and central China. It was also the fifth-busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic in China in 2013. Chengdu airport is the hub of Sichuan Airlines, Chengdu Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Tibet Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Lucky Air, and Air China. Alongside Shuangliu Airport, Chengdu Tianfu International Airport has opened in 2021.\nChengdu airports are also 144-hour transit visa-free airports for foreigners from 53 countries.\nExpressways.\nOn 3 November 2007, the Sichuan Transportation Bureau announced that the Suining-Chongqing Expressway was completed after three years of construction. After the completion of the Chongqing section of the road, the expressway connected Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway and formed the shortest expressway from Chengdu to Chongqing. The new expressway is shorter than the pre-existing road between Chengdu and Chongqing; thus journey time between the two cities was reduced by an hour, now taking two and a half hours. The Sui-Yu Expressway is a four-lane overpass with a speed limit of . The total investment was 1.045 billion yuan.\nRail.\nChina Railway Chengdu Group is headquartered in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, managing railway systems in Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guizhou. Sichuan's major railways in Sichuan include the Baoji\u2013Chengdu, Chengdu\u2013Chongqing, Chengdu\u2013Kunming, Neijiang\u2013Kunming, Suining\u2013Chongqing, and Chengdu\u2013Dazhou railways. High-speed railways in Sichuan include the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing high-speed railway, Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway, Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway, and Chengdu\u2013Kunming high-speed railway. A suburban railway connects Chengdu and Dujiangyan.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe majority of the province's population is Han Chinese (95% of the provincial population), who are found scattered throughout the region except for the far western areas. Thus, significant minorities of Tibetan, Yi, Qiang, and Nakhi people reside in the western portion that is impacted by inclement weather and natural disasters, environmentally fragile, and impoverished. Sichuan's capital of Chengdu is home to a large community of Tibetans, with 30,000 permanent Tibetan residents and up to 200,000 Tibetan floating population. The Eastern Lipo, included with either the Yi or the Lisu people, as well as the A-Hmao, also are among the ethnic groups of the provinces.\nSichuan was China's most populous province before Chongqing became a directly controlled municipality; it is currently the fourth most populous, after Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan. As of 1832, Sichuan was the most populous of the 18 provinces in China, with an estimated population at that time of 21 million. It was the third most populous sub-national entity in the world, after Uttar Pradesh, India, and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic until 1991, when the Soviet Union was dissolved. It is also one of the only eight subnational divisions to ever reach 100 million people (Uttar Pradesh, Russian RSFSR, Maharashtra, Sichuan, Bihar, Shandong, Guangdong, and Punjab). It is currently ranked 10th.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe predominant religions in Sichuan are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions, and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 10.6% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 0.68% of the population identifies as Christian. According to the Japanese publication \"Tokyo Sentaku\" in 1999, there were 2 million members of Yiguandao (Tiandao) in Sichuan, equal to 2.4% of the province's population.\nThe reports did not give figures for other types of religion; the vast majority may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, etc. Tibetan Buddhism is widespread, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic Tibetans. Sichuan is one of the cradles of the early Heavenly Masters' Taoist religious movements.\nAccording to \"Vestiges of Zoroastrianism in Medieval Sichuan\" by Yao Chongxin, professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Zoroastrianism flourished during the period of Tang (618\u2013907), Former Shu (907\u2013925), Later Shu (934\u2013965), and Song (960\u20131279).\nA Chabad Jewish Center was established in Chengdu in 2012, after moving five times, a permanent location was secured at Wuhou District.\nCulture.\nThe \"Sichuanese people\" (Sichuanese: Ba1su2ren2; IPA: ; alternatively , , or ) are a subgroup of Han Chinese living in mostly Sichuan province and the neighboring Chongqing municipality. Beginning from the 9th century BC, Shu (on the Chengdu Plain) and Ba (which had its first capital at Enshi City in Hubei and controlled part of the Han Valley) emerged as cultural and administrative centers where two rival kingdoms were established. Although eventually, the Qin dynasty destroyed the kingdoms of Shu and Ba, the Qin government accelerated the technological and agricultural advancements of Sichuan making it comparable to that of the Yellow River Valley. The now-extinct Ba\u2013Shu language was derived from Qin-era settlers and represents the earliest documented division from what is now called Middle Chinese.\nDuring the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the population of the area was reduced through wars and the bubonic plague, and settlers arrived from the area of modern Hubei, replacing the earlier common Chinese with a new standard.\nThe Li Bai Memorial, located in Jiangyou, is a museum in memory of Li Bai, a Chinese poet of Tang China (618\u2013907) built at the place where he grew up. The building was begun in 1962 on the occasion of the 1200th anniversary of his death, completed in 1981, and opened to the public in October 1982. The memorial is built in the style of the classic Tang garden.\nIn 2003, Sichuan had \"88 art performing troupes, 185 culture centers, 133 libraries, and 52 museums\". Companies based in Sichuan also produced 23 television series and one film.\nLanguages.\nThe Sichuanese once spoke their variety of Spoken Chinese called Ba-Shu Chinese, or Old Sichuanese before it became extinct during the Ming dynasty. Now most of them speak Sichuanese Mandarin. The Minjiang dialects are thought by some linguists to be a bona fide descendant of Old Sichuanese, but there is no conclusive evidence whether Minjiang dialects are derived from Old Sichuanese or Southwestern Mandarin.\nThe languages of Sichuan are primarily members of three subfamilies of the Sino-Tibetan languages.\nThe most widely used variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan is Sichuanese, which is the lingua franca in Sichuan, Chongqing, and parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Although Sichuanese is generally classified as a dialect of Mandarin Chinese, it is highly divergent in phonology, vocabulary, and even grammar from Standard Chinese. The Minjiang dialect is especially difficult for speakers of other Mandarin dialects to understand.\nGarz\u00ea Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in western Sichuan are populated by Tibetans and Qiang people. Tibetans speak the Khams and Amdo Tibetan, which are Tibetic languages, as well as various Qiangic languages. The Qiang speak Qiangic languages and often Tibetic languages as well. The Yi people of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southern Sichuan speak the Nuosu language, which is one of the Lolo-Burmese languages; Yi is written using the Yi script, a syllabary standardized in 1974. The Southwest University for Nationalities has one of China's most prominent Tibetology departments and the Southwest Minorities Publishing House prints literature in minority languages. In the minority-inhabited regions of Sichuan, there is bilingual signage and public school instruction in non-Mandarin minority languages.\nSichuan brocade.\nCommonly known as \"Shu brocade\" () in Chinese, Sichuan brocade is referred to as the \"mother of brocade in China\" given its age. This technique of embroidery originates in the capital city of Chengdu during the time of the Ancient Kingdom of Shu. It enjoyed high popularity throughout the regions along the Silk Road, which stimulated an \"exoticization\" of the embroidery designs during the 1st millennium, with most of the patterns imported from Sogdia and other parts of Central Asia. According to the \"Book of Sui\", in the year 605 AD, the head of the Sichuan ateliers producing silks in the \"western style\" was a certain He Chou, a name which betrays his Sogdian origins. Most of the silk products unearthed in Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan) and Qinghai (Tuyuhun Kingdom) confirmed to be manufactured in Sichuan.\nCuisine.\nSichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of Sichuan peppers due to its humid climate.\nThe Sichuanese are proud of their cuisine, known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine. The cuisine here is of \"one dish, one shape, hundreds of dishes, hundreds of tastes\", as the saying goes, to describe its acclaimed diversity. The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh, and fragrant. Sichuan cuisine is popular in the whole nation of China, and so are Sichuan chefs.\nAnother famous Sichuan delicacy is hot pot. Hot pot is a Chinese soup containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nAs of 2022, Sichuan hosts 134 institutions of higher education, ranking first in the Western China region and fifth among all Chinese provinces after Jiangsu, Guangdong, Henan and Shandong.\nTourism.\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in Sichuan province and Chongqing municipality include:\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building, the New Century Global Center is located in Chengdu. At high, long, and wide, the Center houses retail outlets, movie theaters, offices, hotels, the Paradise Island waterpark, an artificial beach, a -long LED screen, skating rink, pirate ship, fake Mediterranean village, 24-hour artificial sun, and 15,000-spot parking area.\nSports.\nProfessional sports teams in Sichuan include:\nSister states and regions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is believed to have been built during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25\u2013220) for a Chinese officer attached to the local garrison. The museum is located at 41 Tonkin Street, in Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po District, in the northwestern part of the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nAccording to its structure, inscriptions on the tomb bricks and tomb finds, it is believed that the tomb was built in the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220 AD). Here is the explanation by Museum of History:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cross-shaped tomb with domed roof was a popular tomb design in Guangdong at the time. The pottery ding tripod, zun wine warmer, kui food container and zhi wine container were common daily utensils and often appeared on pictorial bricks in Han tombs. The set of four pottery models \u2013 a house, granary, well and stove \u2013 were customary burial objects in the period. The characters Panyu (Chinese: \u756a\u79ba; Jyutping: pun1 jyu4) in the brick inscription refer to the county in which the Hong Kong region was located in the Han dynasty, and the calligraphic style of the characters Xue Shi was widely used for Eastern Han bronze and stone inscriptions.\nAlthough a number of Han tombs have been discovered in Guangdong province, south of China; the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb is the only Han brick tomb unearthed in Hong Kong to date. The tomb is an important site to understand the ancient history of Hong Kong and the early activities of Han people.\nDiscovery and preservation.\nThe tomb was accidentally discovered in August 1955, when the Hong Kong Government was levelling a hill slope for the construction of resettlement buildings at Lei Cheng Uk Village (present-day Lei Cheng Uk Estate). The tomb was then excavated by members of University of Hong Kong (HKU) and workers of the Public Works Department, under the supervision of Professor Frederick S. Drake, former head of the Chinese Department at HKU. After excavation, the government intended to demolish the tomb, but the tomb was eventually preserved due to high public interest. The tomb and its exhibition hall were formally opened to the public in 1957. In November 1988, the Han Tomb was declared as a gazetted monument by the Hong Kong Government, and is now protected and preserved permanently under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance.\nSince the mid-1980s, visitors have no longer been allowed inside the tomb due to conservation concerns. It can instead only be viewed through glass panel at the entrance passage. The tomb is sealed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment, and is protected by concrete, waterproofing layers, topsoil, and turf. Following rainwater leakage problems, the tomb was renovated in 2005, with the addition of a canopy to cover the tomb.\n3D laser scanning technology in the digital recording of the structures was applied to capture 3D images of the structure. An exhibition hall opened in 1988, when the tomb was declared a gazetted monument. The hall was refurbished in 2005. Details on the discovery and characteristics of the tomb, as well as bronze and pottery artefacts found in the tomb are on permanent display in the exhibition hall.\nThe museum.\nThe tomb and gallery came under the management of the former Urban Council in 1969. The museum later became a branch of the Hong Kong Museum of History in 1975. As such, it is presently managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong government.\nA 3D digital animation in the exhibition hall provides a detailed view of the interior of the tomb. Moreover, a 1:1 replica of the inside of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb is displayed at the Hong Kong Museum of History.\nExhibition Hall.\nThe Exhibition Hall is located next to the tomb. The first section is about food and drink in Han as it seems because most of what was found in the Han tomb is related to food. The display of this section begins with the old Chinese adage, 'food is the first necessity of the people'. There is a map depicting food distribution, a pictogram of rice distribution and a table of the major food groups. There are also three replicas of figurines. Two of the figurines are cooks, and another one is a farmer.\nThe second section is about the excavation of the Han tomb. The excavation process, the inside of the tomb and the archaeologists at work are shown with several photographs. The tomb's structure and layout are shown with the models and plans. This displays also how the professionals dated the tomb by using the inscriptions on the bricks.\nThe third part of the gallery shows the artefacts found in the tomb. As the only Eastern Han dynasty brick tomb ever found in Hong Kong, the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb has invaluable historic value containing 58 items found on site. Objects include cooking utensils, food containers, storage jars and models (a house, a granary, a well and a stove) made of pottery (50), as well as bowls, basins, mirrors, and bells made of bronze (8). No human skeletal remains were found.\nTransportation.\nThe Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum is served by the Cheung Sha Wan station of the MTR (exit A3).\nSurrounding.\nThe Han Garden, located next to the museum, was completed in December 1993. The features in this Chinese garden were built following the style of the Han dynasty and include pavilions, terraces, towers, fishponds and rock sculptures.\nOnce overlooking the seashore, the site of the tomb is now almost 2,000 m from the sea, following a series of land reclamations."}

The world's largest power station by installed capacity (22,500\u00a0MW), the Three Gorges Dam generates 95\u00b120\u00a0TWh of electricity per year on average, depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin. After the monsoons of 2020, the dam produced nearly 112\u00a0TWh in a year, breaking the record of 103\u00a0TWh set by the Itaipu Dam in 2016.\nThe dam's body, 185 meters high and 2,309 meters wide, was completed in 2006. The power plant became fully operational in 2012, when the last of the 32 main water turbines in the underground plant began production. The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015. \nEach of the 32 turbines, considered state-of-the-art at the time of their installation, can generate 700\u00a0MW. Combined with two 50 MW generators that power the plant itself, the Three Gorges Dam can generate some 22,500\u00a0MW\u2014far more than the next-biggest hydroelectric plant, Brazil\u2019s 12,600-MW Itaipu facility. \nThe dam improves the Yangtze River's shipping capacity and provides flood control, helping to protect millions of people from severe flooding on the Yangtze Plain. Additionally, its hydroelectric power generation has helped fuel China's economic growth. As a result, the Chinese government considers the project a source of national pride and a major social and economic success. However, it is controversial domestically and abroad. Estimates of the number of people displaced by the dam's construction range from 1.13 million to around 1.4 million. Its construction has also inundated ancient and culturally significant sites. In operation, the dam has caused some ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides.\nHistory.\nSun Yat-sen envisioned a large dam across the Yangtze River in \"The International Development of China\" (1919). He wrote that a dam capable of generating 30\u00a0million horsepower (22\u00a0GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges. In 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.\nIn 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation's head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for a \"Yangtze River Project\". Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the US for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships: the ships would enter locks at the dam's lower and upper ends and then cranes would move them from each lock to the next. Groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods. No construction work was performed because of the Nationalists' worsening situation in the Chinese Civil War.204\nAfter the 1949 Communist Revolution, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress. After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao wrote \"Swimming\", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.\nDuring China's emphasis on the Four Modernizations during its early period of Reform and Opening Up, The Communist Party revived plans for the dam and proposed to start construction in 1986.204 It emphasized the need to develop hydroelectric power.204\nThe Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference became a center of opposition to the proposed dam.204 It convened panels of experts who recommended delaying the project.204\nThe National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote, giving the legislation an unusually low 67.75% approval rate. Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until 2012. The ship lift was completed in 2015. The dam raised the water level in the reservoir to above sea level by 2008 and to the designed maximum level of by 2010.\nComposition and dimensions.\nMade of concrete and steel, the dam is long and above sea level at its top. The project used of concrete (mainly for the dam wall), used 463,000 tonnes of steel (enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers), and moved about of earth. The concrete dam wall is high above the rock basis.\nWhen the water level is at its maximum of above sea level, higher than the river level downstream, the dam reservoir is on average about in length and in width. It contains of water and has a total surface area of . On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of of land, compared to the of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.\nEconomics.\nThe Chinese government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180\u00a0billion yuan (US$22.5\u00a0billion). By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365\u00a0billion yuan, of which 64.613\u00a0billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557\u00a0billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195\u00a0billion yuan on financing. It was estimated in 2009 that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated of electricity, yielding 250\u00a0billion yuan; total cost recovery was thus expected to be completed ten years after the dam became fully operational. In fact, the entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.\nFunding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam had become fully operational. Additional charges were assessed as follows: every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay an extra \u00a57.00 per MWh, and the other provinces had to pay an additional charge of \u00a54.00 per MWh. No surcharge was imposed on the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nPower generation and distribution.\nGenerating capacity.\nPower generation is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), a Central Enterprise administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station, with 34\u00a0generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700\u00a0MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50\u00a0MW, for a total of 22,500\u00a0MW. Among the 32 main generators, 14 are installed on the dam's north side, 12 on the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. Annual electricity generation in 2018 was 101.6\u00a0TWh, which is 20 times more than the Hoover Dam.\nGenerators.\nThe main generators each weigh about 6,000\u00a0tonnes and are designed to produce more than 700\u00a0MW of power each. The designed hydraulic head of the generators is . The flow rate varies between depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4\u00a0m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75\u00a0revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840\u00a0MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20\u00a0kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500\u00a0kV for transmission at 50\u00a0Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3\u00a0m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9\u00a0m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8\u00a0m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, with a maximum efficiency of 96.5% reached.\nThe generators were manufactured by two joint ventures: Alstom, ABB, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Harbin Motor; and Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some of the newer ones are air-cooled, making them simpler in design and easier to manufacture and maintain.\nGenerator installation progress.\nThe first north-side main generator (No.\u00a02) started up on July 10, 2003. The north side became completely operational on September 7, 2005, with the implementation of generator No.\u00a09. Full power (9,800\u00a0MW) was eventually achieved on October 18, 2006, after the water level reached 156\u00a0meters.\nOn the south side, main generator No.\u00a022 started up on June 11, 2007, and No.\u00a015 became operational on October 30, 2008. The sixth (No.\u00a017) began operation on December 18, 2007, raising capacity to 14.1\u00a0GW, exceeding that of Itaipu dam (14.0\u00a0GW) to become the world's largest hydro power plant by capacity.\nWhen the last main generator (No. 27) finished its final test on May 23, 2012, the six underground main generators were all operational, raising the capacity to 22.5 GW. After nine years of construction, installation and testing, the power plant was fully operational by July 2012.\nOutput milestones.\nBy August 16, 2011, the plant had generated 500\u00a0TWh of electricity. In July 2008 it generated 10.3\u00a0TWh of electricity, its first month over 10\u00a0TWh. On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000\u00a0m3/s, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100\u00a0MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient. During an August 2009 flood, the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period.\nDuring the November to May dry season, power output is limited by the river's flow rate, as seen in the diagrams on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175\u00a0m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.\nThe Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of for the first time on October 26, 2010, in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 TWh was realized. It has a combined generating capacity of 22.5 gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of 88.2 TWh. In 2012, the dam's 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 TWh of electricity, which accounts for 14% of China's total hydro generation. Between 2012 (first year with all 32 generating units operating) and 2021, the dam generated an average of 97.22 TWh of electricity per year, higher than Itaipu dam's average of 89.22 TWh of electricity per year during the same period. Due to the extensive 2020 monsoon season rainfall, the annual production reached ~112 TWh that year, which broke the previous world record of annual production by Itaipu Dam equal to ~103 TWh.\nDistribution.\nThe State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid paid a flat rate of \u00a5250\u00a0per MWh (US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from \u00a5228.7 to \u00a5401.8\u00a0per MWh. Higher-paying customers, such as Shanghai, receive priority. Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.\nPower distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387\u00a0billion yuan. Construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.\nPower is distributed over multiple 500 kV transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges \u2013 Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges \u2013 Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba \u2013 Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges \u2013 Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.\nThe dam was expected to provide 10% of China's power. However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected. Even fully operational and despite its size, on average, it supplies less than 1.0% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2024 when the Chinese electricity demand reached 9,852.1 TWh.\nEnvironmental impact.\nEmissions.\nAccording to the National Development and Reform Commission, 366\u00a0grams of coal would produce 1\u00a0kWh of electricity during 2006. From 2003 to 2007, power production equaled that of 84\u00a0million tonnes of standard coal.\nErosion and sedimentation.\nTwo hazards are uniquely identified with the dam: that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is eroding, depositing about 40\u00a0million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment settles there instead of flowing downstream, and there is less sediment downstream.\nThe absence of silt downstream has three effects:\nLandslides.\nErosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River. In the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.\nWaste management.\nThe dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007, more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84\u00a0million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5\u00a0tonnes of solid waste every day. Over one\u00a0billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water stagnant, polluted and murky.\nForest cover.\nIn 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.\nResearch by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would gain about of forest by 2008. That is a significant change from the net loss of forest each year in the 1990s. This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort. This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it should restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.\nWildlife.\nConcerns about the dam's impact on wildlife predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992. This region has long been known for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 plant species, which belong to 238 families and 1,508 genera. Of these species, 57 are endangered. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. The proportion of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam dropped from 20% in 1950 to less than 10% as of 2002, adversely affecting all plant species there. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species. Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are injured in the hydroelectric plants' turbine blades. This is particularly detrimental to the region's ecosystem because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for 27% of China's endangered freshwater fish species. Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin, now extinct. In fact, Chinese Government scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.\nOf the 3,000 to 4,000 remaining critically endangered Siberian crane, many spend the winter in wetlands that the Three Gorges Dam will destroy. Populations of the Yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be \"negatively affected\" by the dam. In 2022 the Chinese paddlefish was declared extinct, with the last confirmed sighting in 2003.\nTerrestrial impact.\nIn 2005, NASA scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the total length of the Earth's day by 0.06\u00a0microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles. A study published in 2022 in the journal Open Geosciences suggests that the change of reservoir water level affects the gravity field in western Sichuan, which in turn affects the seismicity in that area.\nFloods, agriculture, industry.\nAn important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai located adjacent to the river. Large areas of farmland and China's most important industrial area are situated beside the river.\nThe reservoir's flood storage capacity is . This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100\u00a0years. The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a \"super\" flood. The river flooded in 1954 over an area of , killing 33,169 people and forcing almost 18.9\u00a0million people to move. The flood waters covered Wuhan, a city of eight million people, for over three months, and the Jingguang Railway was out of service for more than 100\u00a0days. The 1954 flood carried of water. The dam could only divert the water above Chenglingji, leaving to be diverted. The dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream, including the Xiang, Zishui, Yuanshui, Lishui, Hanshui, and Gan.\nIn 1998, a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars' worth of damage, when of farmland were flooded. The flood affected more than 2.3\u00a0million people, killing 1,526. In early August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. During this flood, the dam limited the water flow to less than per second, raising the upstream water level from on August 1, to on August 8. A full of flood water was captured and the river flow was cut by as much as per second.\nThe dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season every year, between December and March. This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, providing fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage, and improving shipping conditions. The water level upstream drops from , in preparation for the rainy season. The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.\nSince the filling of the reservoir in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra of fresh water to downstream cities and farms over the course of the dry season.\nDuring the South China floods in July 2010, inflows at the Three Gorges Dam reached a peak of , exceeding the peak inflow during the 1998 Yangtze River floods. The dam's reservoir rose nearly in 24 hours and reduced the outflow to in discharges downstream, preventing any significant impact on the middle and lower river.\nNavigating the dam.\nLocks.\nThe installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten\u00a0million to 100\u00a0million tonnes annually; as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate.\nThere are two series of ship locks installed near the dam (). Each of them is made up of five stages, with transit time at around four hours. Maximum vessel size is 10,000\u00a0tons. The locks are 280\u00a0m long, 35\u00a0m wide, and 5\u00a0m deep (918 \u00d7 114 \u00d7 16.4\u00a0ft). That is longer than those on the St Lawrence Seaway, but half as deep. Before the dam was constructed, the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was 18.0\u00a0million tonnes per year. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198\u00a0million tonnes of freight passed through the locks. The freight capacity of the river increased six\u00a0times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25%. Originally, the total capacity of the ship locks was expected to reach 100\u00a0million tonnes per year. In 2022, their cargo turnover reached 159.65 million tons, with an annual increase of 6% over the previous few years.\nThese locks are staircase locks, whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate of the chamber below and the lower gate of the chamber above. The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.\nShip lift.\nIn addition to the canal locks, there is a ship lift, a kind of elevator for vessels. The ship lift can lift ships of up to 3,000\u00a0tons. The vertical distance traveled is , and the size of the ship lift's basin is . The ship lift takes 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks. One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically. The ship lift must work even if water levels vary by on the lower side, and on the upper side.\nThe ship lift's design uses a helical gear system, to climb or descend a toothed rack.\nThe ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on May 20, 2006.\nIn November 2007, it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in October 2007.\nIn February 2012, \"Xinhua\" reported that the four towers intended to support the ship lift were nearly complete. The report said that by that time, the towers had reached of the anticipated .\nAs of May 2014, the ship lift was expected to be completed by July 2015. It was tested in December 2015 and announced complete in January 2016. Lahmeyer, the German firm that designed the ship lift, said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift. An article in Steel Construction says the actual time of the lift will be 21 minutes. It says that the expected dimensions of the passenger vessels the ship lift's basin was designed to carry will be . The moving mass (including counterweights) is 34,000 tonnes.\nThe trials of elevator finished in July 2016, the first cargo ship was lifted on July 15; the lift time comprised 8 minutes. \"Shanghai Daily\" reported that the first operational use of the lift was on September 18, 2016, when limited \"operational testing\" of the lift began.\nPortage railways.\nPlans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether. Two short rail lines, one on each side of the river, are to be constructed. The northern portage railway () will run from the Taipingxi port facility () on the northern side of the Yangtze, just upstream from the dam, via Yichang East Railway Station to the Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town (), below Yichang. The southern portage railway () will run from Maoping (upstream of the dam) via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng (on the Jiaozuo\u2013Liuzhou Railway).\nIn late 2012, preliminary work started along both future railway routes.\nDisplacement of residents.\nDuring planning, it was estimated that 13 cities, 140 towns and 1,350 villages would be partially or completely flooded by the reservoir, amounting to roughly 1.5% of Hubei's 60.3\u00a0million people and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44\u00a0million people. These people were moved to new homes by the Chinese government, which considered the displacement justified by the flood protection provided for the communities downstream of the dam.\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky documented the impact of the project on the surrounding areas, including the town of Wanzhou. Other photographers who recorded the change include Chengdu-based Muge, Paris-based Zeng Nian (originally from Jiangsu), and Israeli Nadav Kander. Living conditions deteriorated for many, and hundreds of thousands of people could not find work. The older generation was particularly affected, but younger generations benefited from the educational and career opportunities afforded by moving to large cities with new, modern companies and schools.\nSome 2007 reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality would encourage four million more people to move away from the dam to Chongqing's main urban area by 2020. The municipal government asserted that the relocation was driven by urbanization, rather than a direct result of the dam project, and that the people involved included other areas of the municipality.\nBy June 2008, China had moved 1.24\u00a0million residents as far as Gaoyang in Hebei Province, and the moves concluded the following month.\nOther effects.\nCultural and history.\nThe area which would fill with water behind the dam included locations with significant cultural history.206 The State Council authorized a \u00a5505 million archaeology salvage effort.206 Over the course of several years, archaeologists excavated 723 sites and conducted surface archaeology recovery missions at an additional 346 sites.206 Archaeologists recovered 200,000 artifacts of which 13,000 were considered as particularly historically or culturally notable.206 As part of this effort, the old Chongqing City Museum was replaced by the Chongqing China Sanxia Museum to house many of the recovered artifacts.206\nRecovered structures that were too large for museums were moved upland to reconstruction districts (\"fu jian qu\"), which are outdoor museum parks. Recovered structures placed in such parks include temples, pavilions, houses, and bridges, among others.206\nSome sites could not be moved because of their location, size, or design, such as the hanging coffins site high in the Shen Nong Gorge, part of the cliffs.\nNational security.\nA 2004 United States Department of Defense report stated that \"Since Taipei cannot match Beijing\u2019s ability to field offensive systems, proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China's urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion.\" In response, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the U.S. report as exhibiting a \"Cold War mentality harbouring evil intentions.\" The People's Liberation Army Lieutenant General Liu Yuan cautioned that \"[It] will not be able to stop war. It will have the exact opposite of the desired effect.\" He also remarked that China would be \"seriously on guard against threats from Taiwan independence terrorists.\"\nSung Chao-wen, a senior advisory committee member of the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense, dismissed online comments about targeting the Three Gorges Dam with missiles as \"ridiculous\", saying that the dam's high-strength reinforced concrete could withstand a small nuclear weapon, any missile attack would have to penetrate multiple layers of ground and air defenses, and missiles would cause only minimal damage if they reached the dam at all. Zhang Boting, deputy secretary-general of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering, said that the Three Gorges Dam was designed as a concrete gravity dam and would therefore be resistant to nuclear attacks.\nDebate among Chinese scholars and analysts about the basic principles of China's no first use (NFU) of nuclear weapons policy includes questions about whether to add narrow exceptions, such as acts that produce catastrophic consequences equivalent to that of a nuclear attack, including attacks intended to destroy the Three Gorges Dam. Nonetheless, supporters of the NFU policy maintain that foreign conventional attacks of such targets including the dam\u2014with the intent to cause mass civilian casualties and economic losses\u2014are highly improbable.\nStructural integrity.\nImmediately after the reservoir was first filled, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure. Still, an experts group gave the project overall a good-quality rating. The 163,000 concrete units all passed quality testing, with normal deformation within design limits.\nUpstream dams.\nIn order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the Jinsha River, the upper course of the Yangtze River, authorities are building a series of dams on the Jinsha, including the now completed Wudongde, Baihetan, Xiluodu, and Xiangjiaba dams. The total capacity of those four dams is 38,500\u00a0MW, almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges.\nBaihetan became fully operational in 2022. Wudongde was opened in June 2021. Another eight dams are in the midstream of the Jinsha and eight more upstream of it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies to the south-east of Lincoln, east of Nottingham and north-east of Peterborough. The town had a population of 45,339 at the 2021 census, while the borough had an estimated population of 66,900 at the ONS mid-2015 estimates. The Haven in Boston flows about 5 miles away to the Lincolnshire coast at The Wash, a bay between Lincolnshire and Norfolk.\nBoston's most notable landmark is St Botolph's Church, colloquially referred to as 'The Stump', the largest parish church in England, which is visible from miles away across the flat lands of Lincolnshire. Residents of Boston are known as Bostonians. Emigrants from Boston named several other settlements around the world after the town\u2014most notably Boston, Massachusetts, then an English colony and now part of the United States.\nToponymy.\nThe name \"Boston\" is said to be a contraction of \"Saint Botolph's town\", \"stone\" or \"\" (Old English, Old Norse and modern Norwegian for a hamlet or farm; hence the Latin \"villa Sancti Botulfi\" \"St. Botulf's village\").\nThe name \"Botulfeston\" appears in 1460, with an alias \"Boston\".\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe town was once said to have been a Roman settlement, but no evidence shows this to be the case. Similarly, it is often linked to the monastery established by the Saxon monk Botolph at \"Icanhoe\" on the Witham in AD\u00a0654 and destroyed by the Vikings in 870, but this is doubted by modern historians. The early medieval geography of The Fens was much more fluid than it is today, and at that time, the Witham did not flow near the site of Boston. Botolph's establishment is most likely to have been in Suffolk. However, he was a popular missionary and saint to whom many churches between Yorkshire and Sussex are dedicated.\nThe 1086 Domesday Book does not mention Boston by name, but nearby settlements of the tenant-in-chief Count Alan Rufus of Brittany are covered. Its present territory was probably then part of the grant of Skirbeck, part of the very wealthy manor of Drayton, which before 1066 had been owned by Ralph the Staller, Edward the Confessor's Earl of East Anglia. Skirbeck had two churches and one is likely to have been that dedicated to St Botolph, in what was consequently Botolph's town. Skirbeck &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt; is now considered part of Boston, but the name remains, as a church parish and an electoral ward.\nThe order of importance was the other way round, when the Boston quarter of Skirbeck developed at the head of the Haven, which lies under the present Market Place. At that stage, The Haven was the tidal part of the stream, now represented by the Stone Bridge Drain&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, which carried the water from the East and West Fens. The line of the road through Wide Bargate, to A52 and A16, is likely to have developed on its marine silt levees. It led, as it does now, to the relatively high ground at Sibsey&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, and thence to Lindsey.\nThe reason for the original development of the town, away from the centre of Skirbeck, was that Boston lay on the point where navigable tidal water was alongside the land route, which used the Devensian terminal moraine ridge at Sibsey, between the upland of East Lindsey and the three routes to the south of Boston:\nThe River Witham seems to have joined The Haven after the flood of September 1014, having abandoned the port of Drayton, on what subsequently became known as Bicker Haven. The predecessor of Ralph the Staller owned most of both Skirbeck and Drayton, so it was a relatively simple task to transfer his business from Drayton, but Domesday Book in 1086 still records his source of income in Boston under the heading of Drayton, so Boston's name is not mentioned. The Town Bridge still maintains the preflood route, along the old Haven bank.\nGrowth.\nAfter the Norman conquest, Ralph the Staller's property was taken over by Count Alan. It subsequently came to be attached to the Earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire, and known as the Richmond Fee. It lay on the left bank of The Haven.\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, Boston grew into a notable town and port. In 1204, King John vested sole control over the town in his bailiff. That year or the next, he levied a \"fifteenth\" tax (\"\") of 6.67% on the moveable goods of merchants in the ports of England: the merchants of Boston paid \u00a3780, the highest in the kingdom after London's \u00a3836. Thus, by the opening of the 13th century, Boston was already significant in trade with the continent of Europe and ranked as a port of the Hanseatic League. In the thirteenth century it was said to be the second port in the country. Edward III named it a staple port for the wool trade in 1369. Apart from wool, Boston also exported salt, produced locally on the Holland coast, grain, produced up-river, and lead, produced in Derbyshire and brought via Lincoln, up-river.\nA quarrel between the local and foreign merchants led to the withdrawal of the Hansards around 1470. Around the same time, the decline of the local guilds and shift towards domestic weaving of English wool (conducted in other areas of the country) led to a near-complete collapse of the town's foreign trade. The silting of the Haven only furthered the town's decline.\nAt the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII during the English Reformation, Boston's Dominican, Franciscan, Carmelite, and Augustinian friaries\u2014erected during the boom years of the 13th and 14th centuries\u2014were all expropriated. The refectory of the Dominican friary was eventually converted into a theatre in 1965 and now houses the Blackfriars Arts Centre.\nHenry VIII granted the town its charter in 1545 and Boston had two Members of Parliament from 1552.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nThe staple trade made Boston a centre of intellectual influence from the Continent, including the teachings of John Calvin that became known as Calvinism. This, in turn, revolutionised the Christian beliefs and practices of many Bostonians and residents of the neighbouring shires of England. In 1607, a group of pilgrims from Nottinghamshire led by William Brewster and William Bradford attempted to escape pressure to conform with the teaching of the English church by going to the Netherlands from Boston. At that time, unsanctioned emigration was illegal, and they were brought before the court in the Guildhall. Most of the pilgrims were released fairly soon, and the following year, set sail for the Netherlands, settling in Leiden. In 1620, several of these were among the group who moved to New England in the \"Mayflower\".\nBoston remained a hotbed of religious dissent. In 1612, John Cotton became the Vicar of St Botolph's and, although viewed askance by the Church of England for his nonconformist preaching, became responsible for a large increase in Church attendance. He encouraged those who disliked the lack of religious freedom in England to join the Massachusetts Bay Company, and later helped to found the city of Boston, Massachusetts, which he was instrumental in naming. Unable to tolerate the religious situation any longer, he eventually emigrated himself in 1633.\nAt the same time, work on draining the fens to the west of Boston was begun, a scheme which displeased many whose livelihoods were at risk. (One of the sources of livelihood obtained from the fen was fowling, supplying ducks and geese for meat and in addition the processing of their feathers and down for use in mattresses and pillows. Until 2018, the feathery aspect of this was still reflected in the presence of the local bedding company named Fogarty.) This and the religious friction put Boston into the parliamentarian camp in the Civil War, which in England began in 1642. The chief backer of the drainage locally, Lord Lindsey, was shot in the first battle and the fens returned to their accustomed dampness until after 1750.\nThe later 18th century saw a revival when the Fens began to be effectively drained. The Act of Parliament permitting the embanking and straightening of the fenland Witham was dated 1762. A sluice, called for in the act, was designed to help scour out The Haven. The land proved to be fertile, and Boston began exporting cereals to London. In 1754, the first financial bank was opened, and in 1776, an act of Parliament allowed watchmen to begin patrolling the streets at night.\nModern history.\nIn the 19th century, the names of Howden, a firm located near the Grand Sluice, and Tuxford, near the Maud Foster Sluice, were respected among engineers for their steam road locomotives, threshing engines, and the like. Howden developed his business from making steam engines for river boats, while Tuxford began as a miller and millwright. His mill was once prominent near Skirbeck Church, just to the east of the Maud Foster Drain.\nThe railway reached the town in 1848, and it was briefly on the main line from London to the north. The area between the Black Sluice and the railway station was mainly railway yard and the railway company's main depot. The latter facility moved to Doncaster when the modern main line was opened. Boston remained something of a local railway hub well into the 20th century, moving the produce of the district and the trade of the dock, plus the excursion trade to Skegness.\nBoston once again became a significant port in trade and fishing in 1884, when the new dock with its associated wharves on The Haven were constructed. It continued as a working port, exporting grain, fertiliser, and importing timber, although much of the fishing trade was moved out in the interwar period.\nAt the beginning of the First World War, a number of the town's trawlermen, together with some from Grimsby, were taken prisoner after their ships were sunk by German raiders in the North Sea. Their families did not know what had happened to them until late September 1914. The men were taken to Sennelager camp, then on to Ruhleben POW camp, where most remained until repatriated in 1918. A full report of their homecoming is in the \"Lincolnshire Standard\" newspaper, January 1918. During the war the port was used by hospital ships and some 4,000 sick or wounded troops passed through Boston. The town was bombed by a Zeppelin on 2 September 1916, injuring three adults and killing a child.\nThe first cinema opened in 1910, and in 1913, a new town bridge was constructed. Central Park was purchased in 1919, and is now one of the focal points of the town. Electricity came to Boston during the early part of the century, and electrical street lighting was provided from 1924.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Second World War, 17 residents of the borough were killed by enemy air raids. A memorial in Boston Cemetery commemorates them.\nThere were 16 air raids, with 14 people killed in the town, and 18 in the whole county of Holland. There were 40 high explosive bombs over the town, but the county of Holland had 695 high explosive bombs, 30 oil bombs, and 8 parachute mines.\nRecent development.\nThe Haven Bridge, which now carries the two trunk roads over the river, was opened in 1966, and a new dual carriageway, John Adams Way, was built in 1976\u20131978 to take traffic away from the town centre. A shopping centre, named the Pescod Centre, opened in 2004, bringing many new shops into the town.\nHealthcare.\nBoston Cottage Hospital opened in 1871, was rebuilt in the 1960s, and is now called the Pilgrim Hospital, having been officially opened by Princess Anne on 23 June 1977. The hospital is currently building a new Emergency Department extension next to the current one, costing \u00a335\u00a0million and doubling the current department in size.\nTransport.\nRailway.\nBoston railway station is a stop on the Poacher Line; East Midlands Railway operates a generally hourly service between Nottingham, Grantham and Skegness. These services are run by the Class 170, 158 or the older Class 156 trains.\nThe railways came to Boston in 1848, following the building of the East Lincolnshire Railway from Grimsby to Boston and the simultaneous building of the Lincolnshire Loop Line by the Great Northern Railway, which ran between Peterborough and York, via Boston, Lincoln and Doncaster. This line was built before the East Coast Main Line and, for a short while, put Boston on the map as the GNR's main locomotive works before it was relocated to Doncaster in 1852.\nBoston was the southern terminus of the East Lincolnshire Line to Louth and Grimsby, until its closure in 1970.\nBuses.\nBus services in the area are operated predominantly by Stagecoach East, Stagecoach East Midlands and Brylaine Travel. Key routes link the town with Lincoln, Skegness and Spalding.\nPolitics.\nBoston residents voted strongly (75.6%) in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, the highest such vote in the country.\nBoston Borough Council.\nIn the 2019 Borough elections, the Conservatives were confirmed as the majority party on Boston Borough Council with 16 of the 30 seats, followed by independents with 11.\nIn May 2007, a single-issue political party, the Boston Bypass Independents campaigning for a bypass to be built around the town, took control of the council when they won 25 of the 32 council seats, losing all but four of them in the subsequent election in 2011.\nGovernance.\nBoston received its charter in 1546. It is the main settlement in the Boston local government district of Lincolnshire, which includes the unparished town of Boston and 18 other civil parishes. The borough council is based in the Municipal Buildings in West Street.\nBorough Council wards.\nAs of 2015, Boston Borough council consisted of 30 members:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLincolnshire County Council divisions.\nIn 2017, six county council divisions existed for the Borough of Boston, each of which returned one member to Lincolnshire County Council:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUK Parliament.\nThe town is part of the Boston and Skegness parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Reform UK chairman, Richard Tice.\nDemography.\nAccording to the 2021 Census, the population of Boston is around 70,500. This is 9.1% higher than the 64,600 reported in the 2011 Census. This was a higher percentage of growth than the 6.6% national average for England during the same period. Much of this population growth is due to high levels of immigration to the town, especially from eastern Europe. The 2021 Census states that 23.6% of Boston's population was born outside of the UK. 5.6% of the population of Boston was born in Lithuania and 5.4% was born in Poland. This is the highest proportion of Lithuanians anywhere in the UK and the second highest number of Poles, behind Slough, Berkshire. Polish is the main language of 5.68% of the inhabitants.\nArts and culture.\nBoston has historically had strong cultural connections to the Netherlands, and Dutch influence can be found in its architecture.\nLandmarks.\nThe parish church of Saint Botolph is known locally as Boston Stump and is renowned for its size and its dominant appearance in the surrounding countryside.\nThe Great Sluice is disguised by railway and road bridges, but it is there, keeping the tide out of the Fens and twice a day, allowing the water from the upland to scour the Haven. Not far away, in the opposite direction, was the boyhood home of John Foxe, the author of \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\".\nThe Town Bridge maintains the line of the road to Lindsey and from its western end, looking at the river side of the Exchange Building to the right, it is possible to see how the two ends of the building, founded on the natural levees of The Haven, have stood firm while the middle has sunk into the infill of the former river.\nFrom 1552, Bostonians used to have their jail near the Stump (about where the red car in the photograph is located). This is likely to be where the Scrooby Pilgrims were imprisoned in 1607.\nThere is a statue of Herbert Ingram, founder of \"The Illustrated London News\", in front of the Stump. The statue was designed by Alexander Munro and was unveiled in October 1862. The allegorical figure at the base of the monument is a reference to Ingram's efforts to bring the first piped water to the town. He was also instrumental in bringing the railways to Boston. Born in nearby Paddock Grove, son of a butcher, he was also MP for Boston, from 1856 until his death in 1860, in a shipping accident on Lake Michigan.\nThe seven-storeyed Maud Foster Tower Windmill, completed in 1819 by millwrights Norman and Smithson of Kingston upon Hull for Issac and Thomas Reckitt, was extensively restored in the late 1980s and became a working mill again. It stands next to the drain after which it is named, and is unusual in having an odd number (five) of sails.\nThe Guildhall in which the Pilgrim Fathers were tried was converted into a museum in 1929. The cells in which the pilgrims are said to have been held at the time of their trial are on the ground floor. After a major refurbishment during which the museum was closed for several years, it reopened in 2008.\nThe Pilgrim Fathers Memorial is located on the north bank of The Haven a few miles outside the town. Here at Scotia Creek, the pilgrims made their first attempt to leave for the Dutch Republic in 1607.\nThe ruined Hussey Tower is all that remains of a medieval brick-fortified house, built in 1450, and occupied by John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford until he was executed in the wake of the Lincolnshire Rising. east, Rochford Tower is another medieval tower house.\nIn Skirbeck Quarter, on the right bank of The Haven, is the Black Sluice, the outfall of the South Forty-Foot Drain.\nThe Prime Meridian passes through the eastern side of Boston, marked by the fairly modern, suburban Meridian Road (https://), which straddles the line after which the road was named.\nThe annual Boston May Fair has been held in the town since at least 1125. This fair is held during the first week of May, and is one of the few remaining fairs in the country still held in the town centre. By tradition, the fair was officially opened by the mayor at midday on 3 May, although this date has varied in recent years.\nThe Haven Gallery, opened in 2005, was closed to the public in 2010 in a cost-cutting measure by Boston Borough Council.\nBlackfriars is a theatre and arts centre that was formerly the refectory of the Benedictine friary, built in the 13th century and once visited by King Edward I.\nFrampton Marsh and Freiston Shore are two nature reserves, managed by the RSPB, which lie on the Wash coast on either side of the mouth of The Haven.\nThe Boston Preservation Trust has recently extended its Blue Plaque Trail to include a total of 27 examples (as of 2024) of significant heritage to the town and its place in the world. The 2024 additions include:\nLocal economy.\nBoston's most important industries are food production, including vegetables and potatoes; road haulage and logistics companies that carry the food; the Port of Boston, which handles more than one million tons of cargo per year including the import of steel and timber and the export of grain and recyclable materials; shellfishing; other light industry; and tourism. The port is connected by rail, with steel imports going by rail each day to Washwood Heath in Birmingham, and the port and town are also connected by trunk roads including the A16 and the A52.\nBoston's market is held every Wednesday and Saturday is in one of England's largest marketplaces, with an additional market and outside auction held on Wednesdays on Bargate Green.\nThe town has many local and national stores. Pescod Square shopping centre, located in the centre of town, houses several branded stores including Next, HMV, Waterstones and Wilko. Other big name stores in Boston include New Look, Sports Direct, Dunelm, TK Maxx and Boots. There are several supermarkets, including Tesco, Asda, Aldi and two Lidls. Several Lincolnshire Co-op stores are located around the town and both Sainsbury's (inside Dobbies Garden Center) and Morrisons (in Wide Bargate) have a small presence. \nHowever, recently the town centre has been hit by the loss of many retailers. Marks &amp; Spencer closed in 2019 after over 100 years in the marketplace, while the town\u2019s flagship department store, Oldrids, closed in 2020 after 216 years on the same site in Strait Bargate. It was replaced by a new department store, Rebos, but this in turn closed in 2023. In 2024 WH Smith closed, amid reports that a quarter of shops in the town were now empty.\nIn late 2013, a \u00a3100 million development was announced for the outskirts of town on the A16 towards Kirton. This development, named the Quadrant, is split in two phases. Phase one consists of a new football ground for Boston United F.C., 500 new homes, retail and business outlets, and a possible supermarket. This development also includes the beginning of a distributor road that will eventually link the A52 Grantham Road and the A16 together. Phase two, still in the development stage, consists of a possible second new marina, more new homes, and retail units.\nCrime.\nIn 2016, Boston was named as the most murderous place in England and Wales.\nHealth.\nIn the mid-2000s Boston was shown to have the highest obesity rate of any town in the United Kingdom, with one-third of its adults (31%) considered clinically obese. Obesity has been linked to social deprivation.\nSport.\nRugby.\nThe Princess Royal Arena is located on the Boardsides, just outside Boston, and is the home of Boston Rugby Football Club. The club was established in 1927 by Ernst Clark, who had an interest in providing activity for boys.\nFootball.\nThe town has two nonleague football clubs. The more senior Boston United, nicknamed the Pilgrims, plays in the National League following promotion in 2024. The stadium is currently located on York Street in the centre of the town and has an approximate capacity of 6,200. Boston United moved out of their former ground, York Street, for the 2020\u201321 season, to the Boston Community Stadium on the outskirts of town. The town's second club, Boston Town, nicknamed the Poachers, plays in the United Counties Football League. Its home games are played at their stadium on Tattershall Road, on the outskirts of Boston.\nRowing.\nBoston Rowing Club, near Carlton Road, hosts the annual Boston Rowing Marathon each year in mid-September. Crews from throughout the world compete, starting at Brayford Pool in Lincoln, and finishing in times from three to six hours.\nSpeedway.\nAn advert for a speedway meeting on Thursday 16 July at the greyhound track in Shodfriers Lane in 1936 appeared in The Guardian on 10 July 1936. Other sources now confirm this was a grass track venue.\nSpeedway racing was staged at a stadium in New Hammond Beck Road in the 1970s and 1980s. The Boston Barracudas raced in the British League Division Two, (now the Premier League) and in 1973 won the League and the Knock-out Cup, with one member winning the League Individual Championship. After the New Hammond Beck Road Stadium was sold for redevelopment in 1988, attempts to secure a new venue in the 1990s failed. A team, known as Boston, raced in the Conference League at King's Lynn.\nSwimming.\nBoston Amateur Swimming Club holds galas and open meets, including the Boston Open, and two yearly club championship events. It trains at the Geoff Moulder Swimming Pool.\nSailing.\nWitham Sailing Club is based on the banks of the Witham, with its own clubhouse.\nMedia.\nBoston has two weekly newspapers, the \"Boston Standard\" and the \"Boston Target\". The \"Boston Standard\" (previously \"Lincolnshire Standard\") was founded in the 19th century and has been the main newspaper. The \"Boston Target\" is owned by Local World, and is \"Boston Standard\"'s main rival.\nThe town is served by a community radio station, Endeavour FM. It had previously been called Endeavour Online and Stump Radio, set up as a collaboration between Blackfriars Arts Centre and Tulip Radio, which first started broadcasting in 2006 on 107 FM.\nEducation.\nSecondary schools.\nBoston Grammar School an all-male selective school, is on Rowley Road. Its female counterpart, Boston High School is on Spilsby Road. Both schools have sixth forms open to both boys and girls. Haven High Academy is on Marian Road, and another campus on Tollfield Road \u2013 it was created in 1992 on the site of Kitwood Girls' School following its merger with another secondary modern school, Kitwood Boys' School. The town previously also had a Roman Catholic secondary school, St Bede's in Tollfield Road (now the Tollfield Campus operated by Haven High Academy), but this was closed in 2011 following poor exam results.\nColleges.\nBoston College is a predominantly further education college that opened in 1964 to provide A-level courses for those not attending the town's two grammar schools. It currently has three sites in the town. It also took over the site of Kitwood Boys' school in Mill Road following the school's merger with Kitwood Girls' School in 1992, but this was closed in 2012, with the buildings subsequently demolished and housing built on the site.\nIndependent schools.\nSt George's Preparatory School is the only independent school in the town. Established in 2011, it is housed in a Grade II listed building, the former home of the town architect William Wheeler, and caters for the 3\u201311 year age group.\nInternational relations.\nBoston joined the new Hanseatic League, in July 2015, a project for trade, cultural and educational integration. Boston's twin towns include:\nClimate.\nSince 1991, the highest recorded temperature was on 19 July 2022 and the lowest was on 11 February 2012.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nWikisource"}

When the rider is regular footed the board spins clockwise if viewed from the front.\nIt was the first of many modern tricks to be invented by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s, and it opened the door to contemporary concepts of board sports wherein the board and rider separate then re-join. In March 2011, Zoltan \"The Magician\" Torkos was credited to land the first kickflip on a surfboard.\nOrigin.\nIn the 1970s freestyle skateboarders learned to flip the board over beneath them by lifting a rail edge of the board\u2013and flipping it without any leverage of the tail. While the board flipped completely over, the technique employed no upward force, and the setup required the rider to stand with both feet facing the nose. Any connection to the contemporary kickflip is conceptual, since the two tricks employ radically different riding styles on boards that do not have comparable functional features.\nIn 1982 Rodney Mullen invented the modern form of the trick in Massachusetts, initially naming it the \"Ollie Flip\"; the term \"Magic Flip\" was popularized by other skaters who could not figure out how Mullen was flipping his board. The kickflip employs many of the same techniques that Alan Gelfand discovered when he created the technique for the ollie, but Gelfand's ollie unifies the board and rider using both feet in a single reaction of force and counterforce wherein board and rider bounce into the air and come back down in unison. Mullen's kickflip separates the board and rider using both feet in opposing reactions of force and counterforce wherein the rider flicks, the board flips, and the rider catches it only returning to unison in the downward arc of the trick.\nThis technique of separating the board and rider became a tremendous amount of the vernacular of street skaters\u2013and later vert skaters\u2013introducing skateboarding to the era of flip tricks, many of which Rodney Mullen also created. Many of the skaters credited with defining skate culture, and discovering how to use flip tricks in a contemporary manner\u2013Daewon Song, Ronnie Creager, Kareem Campbell, Enrique Lorenzo, JB Gillet\u2013were sponsored by Mullen's company World Industries.\nExecution.\nTo perform a kickflip, the rider ollies into the air and lifts the back foot from the board while simultaneously sliding the front foot across the skateboard diagonally forward and towards the heel side. This front foot motion, sometimes called \"the flick\", spins the board, flipping it completely over. Before landing, the rider stops the spin by returning the feet to the board as it nears its original position.\nThe board revolves around its longitudinal axis, like an aileron roll. To understand this motion and the direction of rotation, imagine stepping backwards off a skateboard, leaving it in front of you, then rolling it over on the ground toward you; during the kickflip, the board spins similarly, but in mid-air beneath the rider. During a heelflip, a similar trick, the rider slides their front heel toward the opposite side that they would with a kick flip, resulting in a rotation of the board opposite to the kick flip. \nVariations.\nOnce a skateboarder masters the kickflip, many variations are possible:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cura\u00e7ao includes the main island of Cura\u00e7ao, and the much smaller, uninhabited island of Klein Cura\u00e7ao (\"Little Cura\u00e7ao\").\nCura\u00e7ao has a population of 158,665 (January 2019 estimate), with an area of ; its capital is Willemstad. Together with Aruba and Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao forms part of the ABC islands. Collectively, Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. It is the largest of the ABC islands in terms of both area and population.\nThe island's name \"Cura\u00e7ao\" may originate from the indigenous autonym of its people; this idea is supported by early Spanish accounts referring to the inhabitants as \"Indios Cura\u00e7aos\". Cura\u00e7ao's history begins with the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians; the island becoming a Spanish colony after Alonso de Ojeda's 1499 expedition. Though labelled \"the useless island\" due to its poor agricultural yield and lack of precious metals, it later became a strategic cattle ranching area. When the Dutch colonized the island in 1634, they shifted the island's focus to trade and shipping, and later made it a hub of the Atlantic slave trade. Members of the Jewish community, fleeing persecution in Europe, settled here and significantly influenced the economy and culture.\nBritish forces occupied Cura\u00e7ao twice during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but it was returned to Dutch rule. The abolition of slavery in 1863 led to economic shifts and migrations. Dutch remains the official language, though Papiamentu, English, and Spanish are widely spoken, reflecting the island's diverse cultural influences. Cura\u00e7ao was formerly part of the Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies colony from 1815 to 1954, and later the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 2010, as Island Territory of Cura\u00e7ao.\nThe discovery of oil in the Maracaibo Basin in 1914 transformed Cura\u00e7ao into a major refinery location, altering its economic landscape. There were efforts towards becoming a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the island achieved autonomy in 2010.\nEtymology.\nOne explanation for the island's name is that \"Cura\u00e7ao\" was the autonym by which its indigenous peoples identified themselves. Early Spanish accounts support this theory, referring to the indigenous peoples as \"Indios Cura\u00e7aos\".\nFrom 1525, the island was featured on Spanish maps as \"Cura\u00e7ote, Curasaote, Curasaore\", and even \"Curacaute\". By the 17th century, it appeared on most maps as \"Cura\u00e7ao\" or \"Curazao.\" On a map created by Hieronymus Cock in 1562 in Antwerp, the island was called \"Q\u00faracao\".\nA persistent but undocumented story claims the following: in the 16th and 17th centuries\u2014the early years of European exploration\u2014when sailors on long voyages got scurvy from lack of vitamin C, sick Portuguese or Spanish sailors were left on the island now known as Cura\u00e7ao. When their ship returned, some had recovered, probably after eating vitamin C-rich fruit there. From then on, the Portuguese allegedly referred to the island as \"Ilha da Cura\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Island of Healing) or the Spanish as \"Isla de la Curaci\u00f3n.\"\nHistory.\nPre-colonial.\nThe original inhabitants of Cura\u00e7ao were the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians. Their ancestors had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, probably hundreds of years before Europeans' first arrival.\nSpanish colonization.\nThe first Europeans recorded as seeing the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Caquetios (Arawak) for forced labour in their Hispaniola colony, but paid little attention to the island itself. In 1515, almost all of the 2,000 Caquetios living there were also transported to Hispaniola as slaves.\nEstablished in 1499 as a Spanish launchpad for exploring northern South America, Cura\u00e7ao was officially settled by Spain in 1527. It functioned as an island extension of Venezuela throughout the 1500s. As mainland colonization advanced, Spain slowly withdrew from the island. The city registry of Caracas, Venezuela, holds one of the earliest written mentions of Cura\u00e7ao. A document dated 9 December 1595, states that Francisco Montesinos, priest and vicar of \"the Yslas de Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire\" conferred his power of attorney to Pedro Guti\u00e9rrez de Lugo, a Caracas resident, to collect his ecclesiastic salary from the Royal Treasury of King Philip II of Spain.\nThe Spanish introduced numerous tree, plant and animal species to Cura\u00e7ao, including horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle from Europe and other Spanish colonies. In general, imported sheep, goats and cattle did relatively well. Cattle were herded by Caquetios and Spaniards and roamed freely in the kunuku plantations and savannas.\nNot all imported species fared equally well, and the Spanish also learned to use Caquetio crops and agricultural methods, as well as those from other Caribbean islands. Though historical sources point to thousands of people living on the island, agricultural yields were disappointing; this and the lack of precious metals in the salt mines led the Spanish to call Cura\u00e7ao \"the useless island\".\nOver time, the number of Spaniards living on Cura\u00e7ao decreased while the number of aboriginal inhabitants stabilized. Presumably through natural growth, return and colonization, the Caquetio population then began to increase. In the last decades of Spanish occupation, Cura\u00e7ao was used as a large cattle ranch. At that point, Spaniards lived around Santa Barbara, Santa Ana and in the villages in the western part of the island, while the Caquetios are thought to have lived scattered all over the island.\nDutch colonial rule.\nIn 1634, during the Eighty Years' War of independence between the Republic of the Netherlands and Spain, the Dutch West India Company under Admiral Johann van Walbeeck invaded the island; the Spanish surrendered in San Juan in August. Approximately 30 Spaniards and many indigenous people were then deported to Santa Ana de Coro in Venezuela. About 30 Ta\u00edno families were allowed to live on the island while Dutch colonists started settling there.\nThe Dutch West India Company founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the Schottegat; the natural harbour proved an ideal place for trade. Commerce and shipping\u2014and piracy\u2014became Cura\u00e7ao's most important economic activities. Later, salt mining became a major industry, the mineral being a lucrative export at the time. From 1662, the Dutch West India Company made Cura\u00e7ao a centre of the Atlantic slave trade, often bringing slaves from West Africa to the island, before selling them elsewhere in the Caribbean and Spanish Main.\nSephardic Jews fleeing persecution in Spain and Portugal sought safe haven in Dutch Brazil and the Dutch Republic. Many settled in Cura\u00e7ao, where they made significant contributions to its civil society, cultural development, and economic prosperity. In 1674 the island became a free port.\nIn the Franco-Dutch War of 1672\u20131678, French Count Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es planned to attack Cura\u00e7ao. His fleet\u201412 men-of-war, three fire ships, two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers\u2014met with disaster, losing seven men-of-war and two other ships when they struck reefs off the Las Aves archipelago. The serious navigational error occurred on 11 May 1678, a week after the fleet set sail from Saint Kitts. To commemorate its narrow escape from invasion, Cura\u00e7ao marked the events with a day of thanksgiving, which was celebrated for decades into the 18th century.\nMany Dutch colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, building impressive colonial buildings in the capital of Willemstad; the city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1795, a major slave revolt took place under the leaders Tula Rigaud, Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and Pedro Wakao. Up to 4,000 slaves in northwest Cura\u00e7ao revolted, with more than 1,000 taking part in extended gunfights. After a month, the slave owners were able to suppress the revolt.\nCura\u00e7ao's proximity to South America resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas more than a century after the independence of the Netherlands from Spain. Architectural similarities can be seen between 19th century Willemstad neighborhoods and the nearby Venezuelan city of Coro in Falc\u00f3n State, which has also been designated a World Heritage Site. Netherlands established economic ties with the Viceroyalty of New Granada that included the present-day countries of Colombia and Venezuela. In the 19th century, Cura\u00e7aoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Bri\u00f3n were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of both Venezuela and Colombia. Political refugees from the mainland, such as Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, regrouped in Cura\u00e7ao.\nDuring the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, British forces twice occupied Cura\u00e7ao; the first occupation lasted from 1800 to 1803, and the second occupation from 1807 to 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars stable Dutch rule returned in 1815. After the signing of the Treaty of London, the island was incorporated into the colony of Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies.\nThe Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, causing vast changes in the economy with the shift to wage labour. Some Cura\u00e7ao inhabitants emigrated to other islands, such as Cuba, to work in sugarcane plantations. Other former slaves had nowhere to go and continued working for plantation owners under the tenant farmer system, in which former slaves leased land from former masters, paying most of their harvest to owners as rent. The system lasted until the early 20th century.\nHistorically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of the colonial administration, but its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Students on Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until the early 19th century, when the British occupied all three islands. Teaching of Spanish was restored when Dutch rule resumed in 1815. Also, efforts were made to introduce widespread bilingual Dutch and Papiamentu education in the late 19th century.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nWhen oil was discovered in the Venezuelan Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande in 1914, Cura\u00e7ao's economy was dramatically altered. In the early years, both Shell and Exxon held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to refineries in Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. Both Shell and Exxon were vertically integrated and controlled the entire industry, from pumping, transporting, and refining to sales. The refineries on Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues the sale of oil products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries.\nIn 1929, Cura\u00e7ao was attacked by Venezuelan rebel commander Rafael Sim\u00f3n Urbina, who, with 250 soldiers, captured the fort. The Venezuelans plundered weapons, ammunition, and the island's treasury. They also managed to capture the Governor of the island, Leonardus Albertus Fruytier (1882\u20131972), and hauled him off to Venezuela on a stolen American ship, \"Maracaibo\". Fruytier was criticized and had to resign as governor. After returning to the Netherlands, he settled for a position as chief inspector in Maastricht. The Dutch increased their military presence on the island.\nIn 1936 a burning bale of cotton thrown overboard by the crew of MS \"Colombia\", which lay anchored in the Schottegat, caused the oil floating on the water to catch fire. It took days to get the fire under control; houses had to be evacuated, but there were no casualties.\nDuring the Second World War, the island played an important role in the supply of fuel for the Allied forces. In 1940, before the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany, the British occupied Cura\u00e7ao and the French Aruba. The presence of powers other than the Netherlands alarmed the Venezuelan government given the proximity of these islands at the entrance to the Gulf of Venezuela and the fact they had historically been used as bases to launch incursions against Venezuelan territory. In 1941, US troops occupied the island and built the military airport \"Hato\". The main purpose was this deployment was to fight against expected future attacks by Axis submarines and potentially long-distance German bomber aircraft. The United States was also concerned over the potential threat of a German invasion of the continental US launched with the aid of German settlers in South America.\nIn 1942 the port of Willemstad, one of the main sources of fuel for the Allied operations, was besieged by German submarines on several occasions under Neuland Operation. In August 1942, the Germans returned to Cura\u00e7ao and attacked a tanker before receiving fire from a Dutch shore battery and slipping away. The United States Navy established the Fourth Fleet, which was responsible for countering enemy naval operations in the Caribbean and in the South Atlantic. The United States Army also sent aircraft and personnel to help protect the oil refineries and bolster the Venezuelan Air Force.\nIn 1954, Cura\u00e7ao and other Dutch Caribbean colonies were joined to form the Netherlands Antilles. Discontent with Cura\u00e7ao's seemingly subordinate relationship to the Netherlands, ongoing racial discrimination, and a rise in unemployment owing to layoffs in the Shell refinery led to a series of riots in 1969.\nA state of emergency was declared after rioters set fire to the Willemstad downtown and the bankers mansions. Protestors had to face the Dutch Navy marines dispatching from the local military base on the island, to quell the rebellion led by charismatic politicians such as Papa Godett and Stanley Browne. The riots resulted in two deaths, numerous injuries and severe property and infrastructural damage in Willemstad. In response, the Dutch government introduced far-reaching reforms, allowing Afro-Cura\u00e7aoans greater influence over the island's political and economic life, and increased the prominence of the local Papiamentu language.\nCura\u00e7ao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell's refinery on the island operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global overproduction, stronger competition, and low market expectations threatened the refinery's future. In 1985, after 70 years, Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Cura\u00e7ao. This came at a crucial moment. Cura\u00e7ao's fragile economy had been stagnant for some time. Several revenue-generating sectors suffered even more during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation of the bolivar, and a slowdown in the transportation sector had deleterious effects on the Antillean Airline Company and the Cura\u00e7ao Dry Dock Company. The offshore financial services industry also experienced a downturn due to new U.S. tax laws.\nIn the mid-1980s, Shell sold its refinery for the symbolic amount of one Antillean guilder to a local government consortium. In recent years, the aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that its emissions, including sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, far exceed safety standards. The government consortium leases the refinery to the Venezuelan PDVSA state oil company.\nContinuing economic hardship in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in much emigration to the Netherlands.\nOn 1 July 2007, Cura\u00e7ao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, like Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. On 28 November 2006, the change was delayed when the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007. On 15 December 2008, Cura\u00e7ao was again scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. A non-binding referendum on the move was held in Cura\u00e7ao on 15 May 2009; 52% of voters supported it.\nSince the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\nThe dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles came into effect on 10 October 2010. Cura\u00e7ao became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. The kingdom was also tasked with overseeing the island's finances under a debt-relief arrangement agreed upon between the two. Cura\u00e7ao's first prime minister was Gerrit Schotte. He was succeeded in 2012 by Stanley Betrian, \"ad interim\". After the 2012 elections, Daniel Hodge became the third prime minister on 31 December 2012. He led a demissionary cabinet until 7 June 2013, when a new cabinet under the leadership of Ivar Asjes was sworn in.\nAlthough Cura\u00e7ao is autonomous, the Netherlands has intervened in its affairs to ensure that parliamentary elections are held and to assist in finalizing accurate budgets. In July 2017, Cura\u00e7aoan Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath said he wanted Cura\u00e7ao to take full responsibility over its affairs, but asked for more cooperation and assistance from the Netherlands, with suggestions for more innovative approaches to help Cura\u00e7ao succeed and increase its standard of living. The Dutch government reminded the Cura\u00e7aoan government that it had provided assistance with oil refinery negotiations with the Chinese \"on numerous occasions\".\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted in austerity measures. Cura\u00e7ao had to impose spending cuts to qualify for additional aid from the Netherlands. As part of the austerity package, the Government of Cura\u00e7ao announced a 12.5% cut in benefits for civil servants. On 24 June 2020, a group of civil servants, together with waste collectors from Selikor, marched to Fort Amsterdam and demanded to speak with Rhuggenaath. The demonstration turned into a riot, and police cleared the square in front of Fort Amsterdam with tear gas. The city centre of Willemstad was later looted. 48 people were arrested, the city districts of Punda and Otrobanda were placed under lockdown for the night, and a general curfew was declared from 20:30 to 06:00.\nGeography.\nCura\u00e7ao lies on the continental shelf of South America and features a hilly topography with its highest point, named Christoffelberg, reaching above sea level. Cura\u00e7ao has a diverse range of beaches from its coastline's bays, inlets, lagoons, seasonal lakes, rough seas at its northshore, and spring water. In addition, Cura\u00e7ao has upwelling, which is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler and nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean moving towards the ocean surface, contributing to its source of natural minerals, thermal conditions, and seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, making the island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region. Furthermore, off the southeast coast of the main island of Cura\u00e7ao lies the tiny unhabitated Isle of Klein Cura\u00e7ao, which boasts a long stretched beach.\nFlora.\nCura\u00e7ao's flora differ from typical tropical island vegetation. The arid Guajira\u2013Barranquilla xeric scrub ecoregion is most notably different, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs, evergreen, and watapana trees (\"Libidibia coriaria\"; called \"divi-divi\" on Aruba), which are characteristic of the ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba. \"Brassavola nodosa\" is a drought-tolerant species of \"Brassavola,\" one of the few orchids present in the ABC islands. Cacti include \"Melocactus\" and \"Opuntia\" species such as \"Opuntia stricta\".\nFauna.\nCura\u00e7ao is semi-arid, and as such has not supported the numerous tropical species of mammals, birds, and lizards most associated with rainforests. Dozens of species of hummingbirds, bananaquits, orioles, and the larger terns, herons, egrets, and even flamingos make their homes near ponds or in coastal areas. The turpial, a black bird with a bright orange underbelly and white swatches on its wings, is common to Cura\u00e7ao. The mockingbird, called \"chuchubi\" in Papiamentu, resembles the North American mockingbird, with a long white-grey tail and a grey back. Near shorelines, big billed brown pelicans feed on fish. Other seabirds include several types of gulls and large cormorants.\nOther than field mice, small rabbits, and cave bats, Cura\u00e7ao's most notable animal is the white-tailed deer. This deer is related to the American white-tailed deer, or Virginia deer, found in areas from North America through Central America and the Caribbean, and as far south as Bolivia. It can be a large deer, some reaching in length and in height and weighing as much as . It has a long tail with a white underside and is the only type of deer on the island. It has been a protected species since 1926, and an estimated 200 live on Cura\u00e7ao. They are found in many parts of the island, but most notably at the west end's Christoffel Park, where about 70% of the herd resides. Archaeologists believe the deer were brought from South America to Cura\u00e7ao by its original inhabitants, the Arawaks.\nThere are several species of iguana, light green in colour with shimmering shades of aqua along the belly and sides, found lounging in the sun across the island. The iguanas found on Cura\u00e7ao serve not only as a scenic attraction but, unlike many islands that gave up the practice years ago, remain hunted for food. Along the west end of the island's north shore are several inlets that have become home to breeding sea turtles. These turtles are protected by the park system in Shete Boka Park and can be visited accompanied by park rangers.\nHistorically, Cura\u00e7ao contained a diverse ecosystem of stygofauna, including members from relictual crustacean groups such as \"Thermosbaenacea\". However, this network of aquatic species, involving numerous endemic taxa, have not been detected since the 1970s. Their abrupt disappearance is hypothesized to have resulted from a combination of habitat destruction and contamination of groundwater by oil and discharge, the result of oil industry activities in the late 1900s.\nClimate.\nCura\u00e7ao has a hot, semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BSh\") with a dry season from January to September and a wet season from October to December. Rainfall is scarce, only per year; in particular, the rainy season is drier than it normally is in tropical climates; during the dry season, it almost never rains. Owing to the scarcity of rainfall, the landscape of Cura\u00e7ao is arid; especially on the north coast of the island. Temperatures are relatively constant, with small differences measured throughout the year. The trade winds cool the island during the day and warm it at night. The coolest month is January with an average temperature of ; the hottest is September with an average temperature of . The year's average maximum temperature is . The year's average temperature is . The seawater around Cura\u00e7ao averages around and is coolest (avg. ) from February to March, and hottest (avg. ) from September to October.\nBecause Cura\u00e7ao lies North of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and in an area of low-level divergence where winds flow parallel to the coast, its climate is much drier than expected for the northeastern side of a continent at its latitude. Rainfall is also extremely variable from year to year, being strongly linked to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. As little as may fall in a strong El Ni\u00f1o year, but as much as is not unknown in powerful La Ni\u00f1a years.\nCura\u00e7ao lies outside the Main Development Region for tropical cyclones, but is still occasionally affected by them, as with Hurricanes Hazel in 1954, Anna in 1961, Felix in 2007, and Omar in 2008. No hurricane has made landfall in Cura\u00e7ao since the US National Hurricane Center started tracking hurricanes. Cura\u00e7ao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical storms several times; the latest being Hurricane Tomas in 2010, Cesar in 1996, Joan in 1988, Cora and Greta in 1978, Edith and Irene in 1971, and Francelia in 1969. Tomas brushed past Cura\u00e7ao as a tropical storm, dropping as much as of rain on the island, nearly half its annual precipitation in a single day. This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the island's history, as well as one of the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NA\u019250\u00a0million (US$28\u00a0million) in damage.\nAccording to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, average carbon dioxide emissions per person on the island were 52 tonnes in 2018, the second highest in the world.\nMeteo, the Cura\u00e7ao weather department, provides up-to-date information about weather conditions via its website and mobile apps for iOS and Android.\nClimate change.\nAverage temperatures have risen sharply in the past 40 years in the Caribbean Netherlands and Cura\u00e7ao has experienced more warm days and fewer cooler nights. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that should air temperatures increase by 1.4 degrees, there will be a 5% to 6% decrease in rainfall, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (including a 66% increase in hurricane intensity), and a 0.5- to 0.6-meter sea-level rise in the Caribbean Netherlands.\nGeology.\nThe northern seabed drops steeply within of the Cura\u00e7aoan shore. This drop-off is known as the \"blue edge\".\nOn Cura\u00e7ao, four major geological formations can be found: the lava formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Cura\u00e7ao formation and limestone formations.\nCura\u00e7ao lies within the Caribbean large igneous province (CLIP) with key exposures of those lavas existing on the island consisting of the Cura\u00e7ao Lava Formation (CLF). The CLF consists of of pillow lavas with some basalt intrusions. The ages of these rocks include 89 Ma for the lavas and 75 Ma for the poikilitic sills, though some sequences may have erupted as late as 62\u201366 Ma, placing them in the Cretaceous period. Their composition includes picrite pillows at the base, followed by tholeiitic lavas, then hyaloclastites, then the poikilitic sills. The CLF was gradually uplifted until Eocene-Miocene limestone caps formed, before final exposure above sea level. Christoffelberg and the Zevenbergen (Seven Hills) portion of the island have exposures of the Knip Formation. This formation includes deepwater deposits of calcareous sands and fine clays, capped by siliceous chert containing radiolarians. Middle Cura\u00e7ao contains alluvial soils from eroded CLF and limestone.\nBeaches.\nCura\u00e7ao has 37 beaches. Most are on the south side of the island. The best known are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArchitecture.\nThe island has diverse architectural styles reflecting the influence of the various historical rulers over the region, including Spain, the Netherlands, with more modern elements under Western influence primarily including the United States and other European countries. This ranges from ruins and colonial buildings to modern infrastructure.\nForts.\nWhen the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, and pirates. Six of the best-preserved forts can still be seen today:\nIn 1957, the hotel Van der Valk Plaza Cura\u00e7ao was built on top of the Waterfort.\nThe Rif Fort is located opposite of the Waterfort, across the Otrobanda harbour entrance. It contains restaurants and shops, and in 2009, the Renaissance Cura\u00e7ao Resort and Casino opened next to it.\nPolitics.\nAfter being part of the Netherlands Antilles, Cura\u00e7ao became autonomous, along with Sint Maarten island, while the less populated islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba remained special municipalities governed by the Netherlands.\nGovernment.\nCura\u00e7ao is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its governance takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. The King of the Netherlands is the head of state, represented locally by a governor, with the Prime Minister of Cura\u00e7ao serving as head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.\nThe judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Convicted felons are held at the Cura\u00e7ao Centre for Detention and Correction.\nCura\u00e7ao has full autonomy over most matters; the exceptions are outlined in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the title \"Kingdom affairs\".\nMilitary.\nDefence of the island is the responsibility of the Netherlands. The Netherlands Armed Forces deploy both ground and naval units in the Caribbean with some of these forces based on Cura\u00e7ao. These forces include:\nTwo Dutch naval bases, Parera and Suffisant, are located on the island of Cura\u00e7ao. Officers of the Arubaanse Militie complete additional training on Cura\u00e7ao. The Cura\u00e7ao Volunteer Corps is also stationed at the Suffisant Naval Barracks.\nOn the west side of Cura\u00e7ao International Airport are hangars for the two Bombardier Dash 8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft and two AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Until 2007, the site was a Royal Netherlands Navy air base which operated for 55 years with a wide variety of aircraft, including Fireflies, Avengers, Trackers, Neptunes, Fokker F-27s, P-3C Orions, Fokker F-60s and several helicopter types. After the political decision to sell off all Orions, the air base was not needed anymore.\nThe west end of the airport is a United States Air Force (USAF) Forward Operating Location (FOL). The base hosts airborne early warning and control systems (AWACS), cargo aircraft, aerial refueling planes, and reconnaissance aircraft. Until 1999, the USAF operated a small fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft from the FOL. The PAE corporation runs base operations at the FOL.\nConscription.\nSuffisant Naval Base has facilities used for conscription in the Caribbean. There has been no military conscription since 1997, but a form of civil conscription has replaced it, compelling underprivileged young Antilleans to undertake professional training.\nEconomy.\nCura\u00e7ao has an open economy; its most important sectors are tourism, international trade, shipping services, oil refining, oil storage and bunkering, and international financial services. Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA's lease on the island's oil refinery expired in 2019; the facility employs 1,000 people, refining oil from Venezuela for export to the United States and Asia. Schlumberger, the world's largest oil field services company, is incorporated in Cura\u00e7ao. The Isla oil refinery is said to be responsible for Cura\u00e7ao's position as one of the world's top five highest per capita CO2 emission-producing countries.\nAlong with Sint Maarten, Cura\u00e7ao uses the Caribbean guilder. On 1 July 2025 it formally discontinued the previous currency, the Netherlands Antillean guilder. Its economy is well-developed, supporting a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 27th in the world in terms of nominal GDP per capita. Cura\u00e7ao possesses a high-income economy as defined by the World Bank.\nActivities related to the port of Willemstad, such as the Free Trade Zone, make significant contributions to the economy. To achieve greater economic diversification, the Cura\u00e7aoan government is increasing its efforts to attract more foreign investment. This policy, called the \"Open Arms\" policy, features a heavy focus on attracting information technology companies.\nSince 2016, reduced foreign demand for goods due to the ongoing unrest and political uncertainty in Venezuela has led to decreased exports and increased domestic demand for goods and services, resulting in economic stagnation. While many economic sectors contracted, expansion took place in the construction, financial intermediation, and utilities sectors.\nTourism.\nWhile tourism plays a major role in Cura\u00e7ao's economy, the island is less reliant on tourism than many other Caribbean countries. Most tourists come to Cura\u00e7ao from the Netherlands, the eastern United States, South America and other Caribbean islands. Cura\u00e7ao was a Caribbean leader in cruise ship tourism growth, with 610,186 cruise passengers in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the previous year. Hato International Airport received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and announced capital investments totaling US$48\u00a0million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional hub by 2018.\nThe Cura\u00e7aoan insular shelf's sharp drop-off known as the \"Blue Edge\" is often visited by scuba diving tourists. Coral reefs for snorkeling and scuba diving can be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. At the westernmost point of the island is Watamula and the Cliff Villa Peninsula which are good locations for drift diving. The coastline of Cura\u00e7ao features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations for boats.\nIn June 2017, the island was named the Top Cruise Destination in the Southern Caribbean by \"Cruise Critic\", a major online forum. The winners of the Destination Awards were selected based on comments from cruise passengers who rated the downtown area of Willemstad as \"amazing\" and the food and shopping as \"excellent\". The historic centre of Willemstad is a World Heritage Site. Another attraction is the town's colourful street art. The Blue Bay Sculpture Garden with works from known Cura\u00e7ao artists is situated in a nearby resort. Landhuis Bloemhof is an art museum and gallery located in Willemstad.\nSome of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. Porto Marie Beach is experimenting with artificial coral reefs to improve the reef's condition. Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish. It is now under investigation to see if the sewer waste of hotels is a partial cause of the dying of the coral reef.\nEcotourism is a growing segment of Cura\u00e7aoan tourism. One site in particular \u2013 Mambo Beach, also known as \"Seaquarium Beach\" \u2013 is a popular destination due to the calm tides for children, frequent viewing of marine life, and vibrant coral reefs \u2013 some of which have been artificially planted to improve reef health.\nLabour.\nIn 2016, a Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicated that the unemployment rate was 13.3%. For residents ages 15\u201364, the employment rate was 70.4%.\nFinancial services.\nCura\u00e7ao's history in financial services dates back to the First World War. Prior to this period, the financial arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. However, at the turn of the 20th century, Cura\u00e7ao underwent industrialization, and a number of merchant houses established private commercial banks. As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually becoming full-fledged financial institutions.\nThe Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the Central Bank of Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the oldest central bank in the Western Hemisphere. The island's legal system supports a variety of corporate structures and is a corporate haven. Though Cura\u00e7ao is considered a tax haven, it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status from the United States Internal Revenue Service. It is an accepted jurisdiction of the OECD and Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act.\nOn 30 June 2014, Cura\u00e7ao was deemed to have an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the \"Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act\" of the United States of America. The Tax Information Exchange Agreement signed in Washington, D.C., on 17 April 2002 between the U.S. and the Kingdom of the Netherlands includes Cura\u00e7ao, and was updated with respect to Cura\u00e7ao in 2014, taking effect in 2016.\nTrade.\nCura\u00e7ao trades mainly with the United States, Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Cura\u00e7ao to export products to European markets, free of import duties and quotas. It is also a participant in the US Caribbean Basin Initiative allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.\nProstitution.\nProstitution in Cura\u00e7ao is legal only for foreign women who get a temporary permit to work in the large open-air brothel called \"Le Mirage\" or \"Campo Alegre\". Using prostitution services is legal for men (locals included). The brothel has operated near the airport since the 1940s. Cura\u00e7ao monitors, contains and regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners. However this approach does exclude local women (or men) to legally make a living from prostitution and does lead to loss of local income, as the foreign prostitutes send or take most of their earnings home.\nDevelopments of Campo Alegre (2020\u20132024).\nSince its closure in 2020 after 71 years of operation, Campo Alegre, Cura\u00e7ao's largest open-air brothel, has been at the center of significant developments. Following the closure, a government-appointed working group proposed three scenarios for the site: transforming it into a regulated prostitution area, repurposing it for commercial use, or converting it into a residential area.\nIn 2023, the property was put up for auction, attracting various potential buyers. In a significant move, the Cura\u00e7ao government purchased the Campo Alegre property, aiming to have more control over its future use.\nThe current ruling political party, Movement for the Future of Cura\u00e7ao (MFK), had made an election promise to reopen Campo Alegre as a regulated prostitution center. This promise aligns with the recommendations of the working group and reflects the party's stance on creating a controlled environment for sex work.\nAs of 2024, the government is evaluating scenarios to ensure that the chosen path will benefit the local economy and social landscape.\nThe U.S. State Department has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that, \"Cura\u00e7ao...[is a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked.\" The US Department of State has said that the government of Cura\u00e7ao frequently underestimates the extent of human trafficking problems.\nDemographics.\nOwing to the island's colonial past, the majority of Cura\u00e7ao's population is of full or partial African descent. There are also minorities of Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, Latin American, South Asian, East Asian and Lebanese descent.\nPortuguese laborers, namely from Madeira, migrated to Cura\u00e7ao to work in the island's oil and agricultural industries in the 20th century.\nAccording to 2022 data from the CIA, Curacao has a total of only 92 men for every 100 women.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe religious breakdown of the population of Cura\u00e7ao, according to a 2011 estimate:\nThere has been a shift towards the Charismatic movement in recent decades. Other denominations include the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Methodist Church. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practise Montamentu and other diaspora African religions. As elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also practising Muslims and Hindus.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Willemstad encompasses all the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean which includes Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten, and the islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba. The diocese is also a member of the Antilles Episcopal Conference.\nWhile small, Cura\u00e7ao's Jewish community has had a significant impact on the island's history. Cura\u00e7ao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Americas, dating to 1651. The Cura\u00e7ao synagogue is the oldest synagogue of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue. Additionally, there are both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish communities. As of the year 2000 there were approximately 300 Jewish people living on the island.\nLanguages.\nAccording to the 2023 census by language most used at home by Cura\u00e7ao's population; 78% speak Papiamentu, 8.4% speak Spanish, 7.9% speak Dutch, 3.8% speak English and 2% speak other languages.\nCura\u00e7ao is a multilingual society. The official languages are Dutch, Papiamentu and English. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters. Most of Cura\u00e7ao's population is able to converse in at least two, though more commonly in all four of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish.\nThe most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, a Portuguese-creole with African, Dutch and Spanish influences, which is spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced as a language of primary school education in 1993, making Cura\u00e7ao one of a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire basic literacy.\nSpanish and English also have a long historical presence in Cura\u00e7ao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish territories in what are now Venezuela and Colombia and several Venezuelan TV networks are received. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British occupied Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba and Bonaire. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted the widespread use of the English language.\nLocalities.\nCura\u00e7ao was divided into five districts from 1863 to 1925, after which it was reduced to the two outer districts of Bandabou and Bandariba and the city district of Willemstad. Over the years, the capital, Willemstad, encompassed the entire area surrounding the large natural harbour, the Schottegat. As a result, many formerly isolated villages have grown together to form a large urbanised area. The city covers approximately one third of the entire island in the east. Willemstad's most famous neighbourhoods are:\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2021) (Provisional) (Post-censal estimates.):\nEducation.\nPublic education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues for six years; secondary lasts for another four.\nThe main institute of higher learning is the University of Cura\u00e7ao (formerly University of The Netherlands Antilles), enrolling 2,100 students. The comprehensive model of education is influenced by both the Dutch and American education systems. Other higher education offerings on the island include offshore medical schools, universities, language schools and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.\nCulture.\nVisual art.\nVisual art in Cura\u00e7ao encompasses painting, sculptures, and street art.\nCura\u00e7ao promotes street art with a festival, Kaya Kaya, held in the Otrabanda neighborhood of Willemstad. The streets of Willemstad are filled with murals from multiple versions of the festival.\nLiterature.\nDespite the island's relatively small population, the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Cura\u00e7ao have generated a remarkable literary tradition, primarily in Dutch and Papiamentu. The oral traditions of the Arawak indigenous peoples are lost. West African slaves brought the tales of Anansi, thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by Joseph Sickman Corsen entitled \"Atardi\", published in the \"La Cruz\" newspaper in 1905. Throughout Cura\u00e7aoan literature, narrative techniques and metaphors best characterized as magic realism tend to predominate. Novelists and poets from Cura\u00e7ao have contributed to Caribbean and Dutch literature. Best known are Cola Debrot, Frank Martinus Arion, Pierre Lauffer, Elis Juliana, Guillermo Rosario, Boeli van Leeuwen and Tip Marugg.\nCuisine.\nLocal food is called \"Krioyo\" (pronounced the same as \"criollo\", the Spanish word for \"Creole\") and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. Dishes common in Cura\u00e7ao are found in Aruba and Bonaire as well. Popular dishes include stob\u00e1 (a stew made with various ingredients such as papaya, beef or goat), guiambo (soup made from okra and seafood), kadushi (cactus soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to fufu, ugali and polenta) and fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous side dish is fried plantain. Local bread rolls are made according to a Portuguese recipe. All around the island, there are sn\u00e8ks which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English pub.\nThe ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings of cheese, tuna, chicken, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed, such as the hallaca and pekel\u00e9, made out of salt cod. At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: kokada (coconut sweets), ko'i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and tentalaria (peanut sweets). The Cura\u00e7ao liqueur was developed here, when a local experimented with the rinds of the local citrus fruit known as laraha. Surinamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as satay, nasi goreng and lumpia (which are all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as croquettes and oliebollen are widely served in homes and restaurants.\nSports.\nIn 2004, the Little League Baseball team from Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, won the world title in a game against the United States champion from Thousand Oaks, California. The Willemstad lineup included Jurickson Profar, the standout shortstop prospect who is currently on the Atlanta Braves roster of Major League Baseball, and Jonathan Schoop.\nCura\u00e7aoan players Andruw Jones, Ozzie Albies, and Kenley Jansen have made multiple Major League Baseball All-Star Game appearances.\nThe 2010 documentary film \"Boys of Summer\" details Cura\u00e7ao's Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country's eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport.\nThe prevailing trade winds and warm water make Cura\u00e7ao a location for windsurfing.\nThere is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers and snorkelers may have visibility up to at the Cura\u00e7ao Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along of Cura\u00e7ao's southern coastline.\nCura\u00e7ao participated in the 2013 CARIFTA Games. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a distance of . Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 female with a time of 4:47.97.\nThe Cura\u00e7ao national football team won the 2017 Caribbean Cup by defeating Jamaica in the final, qualifying for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They then traveled to Thailand and participated in the 2019 King's Cup for the first time, eventually winning the tournament by beating Vietnam in the final.\nIn 2025, Cura\u00e7ao qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, becoming the smallest nation in history to do so.\nInfrastructure and transportation.\nAirport.\nCura\u00e7ao International Airport (also called Hato International Airport) is located on the northern coast of the island and offers connections to the Caribbean region, South America, North America and Europe. Cura\u00e7ao Airport is a fairly large facility, with the third longest commercial runway in the Caribbean region after Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Airport in Puerto Rico and Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre International Airport in Guadeloupe. Cura\u00e7ao international airport served as a main base for Insel Air, and for Air ALM, the former national airlines of Cura\u00e7ao.\nRailways.\nIn 1887 a horse drawn street tramway opened in Punda, the part of the capital Willemstad on the eastern side of Sint Annabaai. It had a U-shaped route about in length. In 1896, a tramway opened in Otrabanda on the opposite side of the bay, but it ceased operations within a few months. The Punda line was rebuilt in 1911, regauged to metre gauge, and the horse-drawn trams replaced by petrol engined ones. The line closed in 1920.\nPublic transportation.\nABC (\"Auto Busbedrijf Cura\u00e7ao\", \"Cura\u00e7ao Bus Company\") provides bus transportation in and around Willemstad with 21 lines, all departing from either Otrabanda and Punda bus stations, including lines 4A, 2A, 2B and 2C serving the airport. Fares range from 2.00 to 2.50 guilders.\nBridges.\nThe Queen Emma Bridge, a -long pontoon bridge, allows pedestrians to walk between the Punda and Otrobanda districts. The bridge swings open to allow the passage of ships to and from the port. The bridge was originally opened in 1888 and the current bridge was installed in 1939. It is best known and, more often than not, referred to by the locals as \"Our Swinging Old Lady\".\nThe Queen Juliana Bridge carries motor vehicle traffic between the same two districts and its 1974 opening allowed the Queen Emma Bridge to become a pedestrian-only bridge. At above the sea, the Queen Juliana Bridge is one of the highest bridges in the Caribbean.\nUtilities and sanitation.\nAqualectra, a government-owned company and a full member of CARILEC, delivers potable water and electricity to the island. Rates are controlled by the government. Water is produced by reverse osmosis or desalinization. It services 69,000 households and companies using 130,000 water and electric meters. The power generation company NuCura\u00e7ao opened wind farms in Tera Kora and Playa Kanoa in 2012, and expanded in Tera Kora in 2015. There is no natural gas distribution grid; gas is supplied to homes by pressurized containers.\nCurbside trash pickup is provided by the Selikor company. There is no recycling pickup, but there are drop-off centers for certain recycled materials at the Malpais landfill, and various locations operated by Green Force; private haulers recycle construction waste, paper, and cardboard.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His parents were Eorcenberht of Kent and Seaxburh of Ely, the daughter of Anna of East Anglia. In 676 the Mercian king \u00c6thelred invaded Kent and caused great destruction; according to Bede, even churches and monasteries were not spared, and Rochester was laid waste. The damage was so great that Putta, Bishop of Rochester, resigned. So too did his successor, Cwichhelm, due to the poverty of the see.\nHlothhere's rule survived this onslaught, however. He appears for a time to have reigned jointly with his nephew Eadric, son of Ecgberht I, since a code of laws still extant was issued under both their names. A law code, the Law of Hlothhere and Eadric, is jointly attributed to him and his successor Eadric. In 685, Eadric went into exile and led the South Saxons against Hlothhere, who was defeated and died of his wounds.\nThe information is derived from Bede, but Hlothhere is the earliest Kentish king for whom genuine charters survive. One charter known from a 15th-century copy, is precisely dated to 1 April 675 in the first year of Hlothhere's reign, which conflicts with the accession date attributed to him by Bede. The Charter of King Hlothhere of Kent, 679 survives in its original form. Two further charters attributed to Hlothere (S1648, S1648a), appear to have been altered copies of charters of Sw\u00e6fheard and Sw\u00e6fberht.

{"id": "65212", "revid": "50572952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65212", "title": "Hapkido", "text": "Korean martial art\nHapkido ( , , ), also spelled hap ki do or hapki-do is a Korean martial art. It is a hybrid form of self-defense that employs joint locks, grappling, chokeholds, throwing techniques, kicks, punches, and other striking attacks. It also teaches the use of traditional weapons, including knife, sword, rope, nunchaku (ssang juhl bong), cane (ji pang ee), short stick (dan bong), and middle-length staff (joong bong), gun (analogous to the Japanese j\u014d), and b\u014d (Japanese), which vary in emphasis depending on the particular tradition examined.\nHapkido employs both long-range and close-range fighting techniques, utilizing jumping kicks and percussive hand strikes at longer ranges, and pressure point strikes, joint locks, and throws at closer fighting distances. Hapkido emphasizes circular motion, redirection of force, and control of the opponent. Practitioners seek to gain advantage over their opponents through footwork and body positioning to incorporate the use of leverage, avoiding the use of brute strength against brute strength.\nThe art was adapted from Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu as it was taught by Choi Yong-sool (\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc220) when he returned to Korea after World War II after having lived in Japan for 30 years. This system was later combined by Choi's disciples with kicking and striking techniques of indigenous and contemporary arts such as Taekkyon and Tang Soo Do; as well as various throwing techniques and ground fighting from Japanese Judo.\nHapkido.\n\"Hapkido\" or in the native Korean writing system hangul is rendered as \u5354\u6c23\u9053 in hanja. This is similar to how the Japanese \"Aikido\" was written using Ky\u016bjitai in the pre-1946 period. Currently, though, the second character is preferably written in Japanese using shinjitai, which replaces the original \u6c23 with the modern, simplified \u6c17, thus reducing the number of strokes by four.\nIn hanja, the character \"hap\" means \"coordinated\"; \"ki\" literally means air, gas or breath but is used to mean spirit or so-called 'internal energy'; and \"do\" means \"way\" or \"art\", yielding a literal translation of \"joining-energy-way\". It is most often translated as \"the way of coordinating energy\", \"the way of coordinated power\", or \"the way of harmony\".\nAlthough Japanese Aikido and Korean hapkido share common technical origins, in time they have become separate and distinct from one another. They differ significantly in philosophy, range of responses, and manner of executing techniques. The fact that they share the same Japanese technical ancestry represented by their respective founders' practice of Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu, and that they share the same Chinese characters, despite being pronounced \"ai\" in Japanese and \"hap\" in Korean, has proved problematic in promoting hapkido internationally as a discipline with its own set of unique characteristics differing from those common to Japanese martial arts.\nHistory and major figures from Korea.\nThe birth of modern hapkido can be traced to the efforts of a group of Korean nationals in the post-Japanese colonial period of Korea: Choi Yong-sool (\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc220) (1904\u20131986) and his most prominent students; Chinil Chang, his personally chosen successor, Seo Bok-Seob, the first student of the art; Ji Han-jae (born 1936), one of the earliest promoters of the art; Jung Hwan Park, a long time student of Choi; Kim Moo-hong, a major innovator; Myung Jae-nam, a connector between the art of hapkido and aikido; and Myung Kwang-sik the historian and ambassador, all of whom were direct students of Choi or of his immediate students.\nChoi Yong-sool.\nChoi Yong-sool (\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc220)'s training in martial arts is a subject of contention. It is known that Choi was sent to Japan as a young boy and returned to Korea with techniques characteristic of Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu, a forerunner of aikido.\nThe subsequent history is quite controversial in Dait\u014d-ry\u016b circles but is claimed by many contemporary hapkido-ists and is attributed to Choi in an interview that took place during a trip Choi made to the United States in 1980 to visit his direct lineage successor Chin-il Chang in New York City. In the interview with Chin-il Chang, Choi claimed to have been adopted by Takeda S\u014dkaku when he was 11 years old and to have been given the Japanese name Yoshida Asao. He claims to have been taken to Takeda's home and dojo in Akita on Shin Shu mountain where he lived and trained with the master for 30 years. The interview also asserts that he travelled with him as a teaching assistant, that he was employed to catch war deserters and that he was the only student to have a complete understanding of the system taught by Takeda.\nThis is contradicted by other claims asserting that Choi was simply a worker in the home of Takeda. The meticulous enrollment and fee records of Tokimune Takeda, Takeda's eldest son and Dait\u014d-ry\u016b's successor, do not seem to include Choi's name among them. Therefore, except for claims made by Choi himself, there is little evidence that Choi was the adopted son of Takeda. Kondo Katsuyuki (current head of the mainline Daito Ryu) has however released a page from Takeda Sokaku's eimeiroku that contains Choi Yong-sul's name.\nStanley Pranin, then of Aiki News and now editor of the Aikidojournal.com, asked Kisshomaru Ueshiba about Choi Yong-sool and hapkido:\nWhile Kondo Katsuyuki has released documentation from Takeda Sokaku's eimeiroku that confirms that Choi Yong-sul did in fact study with him for a short time, some scholars believe it is likely that Choi received most of his training in Daito Ryu from Yoshida Kotaro.\nChoi Yong-sool's first student, and the man whom some claim helped him develop the art of hapkido was Seo Bok-seob, a Korean judo black belt when they met. Some of Choi's other respected senior students are: Chinil Chang, Lim Hyun-soo, Ji Han-Jae, Chung Kee-tae, Kim Moo-hong, and arguably https:// (Korean:\u00a0) and Lee Joo-bang (Korean:\u00a0) who went on to form the arts of Kuk Sool Won and modern Hwa Rang Do respectively (though some argue that their training stems from time spent training under Kim Moo-hong).\nChang (Jang) In-mok.\nGrand Patriarch Jang In-mok (born 15 August 1912) of Daegu, who also trained under Takeda Sokaku's lineage, returned to Daegu in 1945 like Grand Patriarch Choi Yong-sul. He was a doctor of Oriental medicine and taught aikijitsu as hapkido. Jang learned Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul Hapkido from his teachers Masuta Yutaka and Takeda Sokaku in Japan. Choi Yong-sool trained many students but Jang only trained a few. Jang's notable students included Han-young Choi (Chun Ki Do), Jang Seeung-ho, Song Joon-hwi, Hu Il-wong (teacher of Peter and Joseph Kim) and Song Il-hun. He introduced the Dae Don Ryu Sul system to Korea in 1960. He first learned martial arts in Japan in September 1928 with Daito-ryu Jujitsu and received his certificate in 1935 from Yutaka, a student of Sodaku.\nHan-young Choi.\nKwang Jang Nim Han-young Choi was born in Kyongkido, Korea December 11, 1935. He began his formal martial arts training at the age of four, instructed by his father (Chun-san Choi) and his uncle (Man-san Choi), in 1939 to learn his family's martial arts system, a system based on stepping, spinning, and jumping. The founder of https:// Grand Master Han-young Choi learned also Taekwondo Mudokwan under Grandmaster Hwang Kee Hwang Ki and was also a top student and pioneer of Taekwondo in Korea. Choi, Han-young Choi, was the first student of https:// Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul system in Seoul. His martial arts are based on stepping techniques (triangle step, cross step, skip step), turning and jumping. His early years of formal training at a Buddhist monastery in Kyongi do, where he learned meditation, breathing, and application into the physical world. Hounslow (developed into modern hapkido) \u2013 joint manipulation from Grandmaster Chang In Mok. Grandmaster Chang has the same training and lineage as Grandmaster Choi Yong-sul...both brought what is now known as hapkido to Korea from Japan, except Grandmaster Choi commercialized it and Grandmaster Chang did not. Grandmaster Chang focused on oriental medicine and acupuncture. He Choi learned acupuncture and pressure points from him. Before he founded the World Chun Ki Association, he belonged to the Daehan Hapkido association and Kuk Sool Won Association. One of his best friends was Suh In-hyuk's older brother, and he asked Grandmaster Choi to help spread Kuk Sool Won in Seoul. In the old days, they spread martial arts by fighting the owner of the neighbourhood schools. Then taking them over and changing the names and techniques. One school at a time, he went neighbourhood by neighbourhood, fighting school owners and taking over schools in the name of Kuk Sool Won. Then he moved to the U.S. and after getting fed up with the politics of Daehan and Kuk Sool Won, he quit and founded the World Chun Ki Do Association.\nChoi, Han-young, was also a pioneer of the Taekwondo Han Moo Kwan system. He held the number one Black Belt certificate from the Han Moo Kwan. Choi, after he had studied for three years under Dr. Chang In-mok, moved to Seoul and began to teach Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul. But he joined the Kuk Sool organization and taught Dae Dong Ryu Sul under the Kuk Sool name. One of his best friends was Suh In-hyuk's older brother, and he asked Choi to help spread Kuk Sool Won in Seoul. He also has been belonged to the Daehan Hapkido association. In 1972, Choi Han-young immigrated to the United States and moved to El Paso, Texas. He created his own system called Choi's Martial Arts, and later in the 90s, he renamed it to Chun Ki (Heavenly Power). It was his ambition to acquire do so that Chun Ki Do become accepted as a new style, and he achieves tenth-degree black belt status. Grandmaster's goal was to develop his own martial art to reach the 10th-degree black belt. So Chun Ki was born. It took a long time and a lot of work to add the long-dreamed-of Do, and Chun Ki Do gain worldwide recognition in the line of hapkido. As a new style in the colour hapkido world as its own style, Grand Master Han-young Choi was awarded the title of Grand Patriarch, the founder of Chun Ki Do Hapkido. He has trained over 50,000 students in Asia, Europe, and America and is respected by many as one of the few remaining original Hapkido Grandmasters. His belt examination program is methodical and didactically structured, all techniques are explained in simple steps and easy for everyone to understand. With his 15 hand levers, his bring techniques to the man are unique in martial arts. A few of the notable students were: His son Sam Choi, Daniel Ray Walker, and Roman Nikolaus Urban who founded the Chun Ki Do Association in https:// and https://, Jaeshin Cho his Nephew and Gregory Jump His first Top-student.\nSeo Bok-seob.\nChoi's first student and the first person known to have opened up a dojang under Choi was Seo Bok-seob (\uc11c\ubcf5\uc12d, also spelled Suh Bok-sup).\nIn 1948, when Seo Bok-sub was still in his early 20s, he had already earned his black belt in judo and was a graduate of Korea University. After watching Choi Yong-sool successfully defend himself against a group of men when an argument erupted in the yard of the Seo Brewery Company, Seo who was son of the chairman of the company, invited Choi to begin teaching martial arts to him and some workers at the distillery where he had prepared a dojang.\nIn 1951, Seo opened up the first proper dojang called the \"Daehan Hapki Yukwonsool Dojang (\ub300\ud55c\ud569\uae30\uc720\uad8c\uc220\ub3c4\uc7a5)\". Seo also incorporated many of judo's throws and ground work techniques to the teachings of master Choi. The first symbol for hapkido was designed by Seo, which was used to denote the art was the inverted arrowhead design featured in both the modern incarnation of the KiDo Association and by Myung Kwang-Sik's World Hapkido Federation. Choi Yong-sool was also employed during this time as a bodyguard to Seo's father who was a congressman. Seo and Choi agreed to shorten the name of the art from 'hapki yu kwon sool' to 'hapkido' in 1959.\nJi Han-jae.\nJi Han-jae (\uc9c0\ud55c\uc7ac) was undoubtedly the prime mover in the art of Korean hapkido. It is due to his physical skills, technical contributions, promotional efforts and political connections as head hapkido instructor to the presidential body guard under Korean President Park Chung-hee that hapkido became popularized, first within Korea and then internationally.\nIf the martial art education of Choi Yong-sool is unconfirmed, the same must be said for martial art history of Ji Han-jae's training, apart from his time as a student of Choi. Ji was an early student (Dan #14) of Choi. He details that prior to opening his martial art school in Seoul, the Sung Moo Kwan (\uc131\ubb34\uad00), he also supposedly studied from a man known as 'Taoist Lee' and an old woman he knew as 'Grandma'.\nAs a teacher of hapkido, Ji incorporated traditional Korean kicking techniques (from Taoist Lee and the art Sam Rang Do Tek Gi) and punching techniques into the system and gave the resulting synthesis the name hapkido in 1957.\nAlthough a founding member of the Korea Kido Association (\ub300\ud55c\uae30\ub3c4\ud68c) in 1963 with Choi Yong-sool as titular chairman and Kim Jeong-yoon as Secretary General and Head Instructor for the association, Ji found himself not able to exert as much control over the organization as he might have wished. To this end and with the support of the Head of the Security Forces, Park Jong-kyu, Ji founded the very successful Korea Hapkido Association (\ub300\ud55c \ud569\uae30\ub3c4 \ud611\ud68c) in 1965.\nLater, when this organization combined with the organizations founded by Myung Jae-nam (Korea Hapki Association/\ud55c\uad6d \ud569\uae30\ud68c) and Kim Moo-Hong (Korean Hapkido Association/\ud55c\uad6d \ud569\uae30\ub3c4 \ud611\ud68c) in 1973, they became the very extensive and influential organization known as the Republic of Korea Hapkido Association (\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ud569\uae30\ub3c4 \ud611\ud68c).\nIn 1984, after being released from prison for fraud, Ji moved first to Germany and then to the United States, and founded Sin Moo Hapkido (\uc2e0\ubb34 \ud569\uae30\ub3c4), which incorporates philosophical tenets, a specific series of techniques (including kicks) and healing techniques into the art. Three of Ji Han-jae's notable students in Korea were Kwon Tae-man (\uad8c\ud0dc\ub9cc), Myung Jae-nam (\uba85\uc7ac\ub0a8) and Chang Young-shil (\uc7a5\uc601\uc2e4) who is the current president of the International Hapkido Federation. Ji can be seen in the films \"Lady Kung-fu\" and \"Game of Death\" in which he takes part in a long fight scene against Bruce Lee.\nAfter the death of Choi Yong-sool in 1986, Ji came forward with the assertion that it was he who founded the Korean art of hapkido, asserting that Choi Yong-sool taught only yawara based skills and that it was he who added much of the kicking and weapon techniques we now associate with modern hapkido. The reality being that Grandmaster Choi Yong-sool taught him little of the original art and higher level techniques so he fabricated a new system on his own terms. He also asserted that it was he who first used the term 'hapkido' to refer to the art. While both claims are contested by some of the other senior teachers of the art, what is not contested is the undeniably huge contributions made by Ji to the art, its systematization and its promotion worldwide.\nChang Chin-il.\nA direct student of Choi, Chin-il Chang (\uc7a5\uc9c4\uc77c) inherited the title of Doju in Choi's personal and complete system of hapkido on January 15, 1985, becoming the second direct lineage Grandmaster.\nOn April 5, 1985, Choi personally awarded Chang with the title of Doju (Keeper of the way). Chang also had the privilege and honor of being the first hapkido master awarded the 9th Dan certificate by Choi in 1980.\nA large inauguration ceremony followed on April 11, 1985. The historic event was covered and documented by Korea Sports News and MBC Korean Television. Choi Young-sool, Chang, and Choi's son, the late Choi Bok-yeol, were in attendance.&lt;ref name=\"Chang Interview 02/02/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Choi left the full documentation and recordings of the system to Chang, who continued to research and document the full history and development of hapkido.\nFurthermore, the future Grandmaster, who was a personally trained, closed-door disciple of Choi, was given Letter of Appointment certificates, the second dated December 1, 1977, and the third dated March 5, 1980. This gave Chang more progressive power and authority in Choi's Hapkido Association. These specific certificates, along with his 9th Dan ranking in 1980, and Doju title in 1985, amply demonstrate that Choi was grooming Chang to be the future Grandmaster of Hapkido.\nChang's intimate video interview(one of several over decades) with his teacher Doju Choi during his visit to New York City has been abused through numerous interpretations and translations. Some have even claimed erroneously to have conducted the interview themselves, further clouding and distorting the truth and gravity inherent in the interview. These endless distortions were generally rebutted in various media each time they appeared.\nDoju Chang continues to teach in New York City after decades of maintaining a commercial school, as well as a stint teaching hapkido at the United Nations. He currently teaches a small group in NYC dedicated to the preservation of hapkido. Many detractors have spread endless conjecture about him. One lineage created further controversy by stating Choi passed the system to his only son, Choi Bok-yeol, which is incorrect, misleading, and insulting to the legacy and wishes of Choi. Black Belt Magazine, respecting Chin-il Chang as the second lineage successor, asked him to write a brief obituary on Choi that appeared in the April 1987 issue.\nDoju Chang died peacefully in his sleep on February 23, 2018, at the age of 77 as a result of hypertensive cardiovascular disease.\nKim Moo-hong.\nKim Moo-hong (\uae40\ubb34\ud64d; alternately rendered as Kim Moo-woong or Kim Mu-hyun) was a student from the Choi and Seo's Daehan Hapki Yukwonsool Dojang, who later taught at Seo's main dojang in Taegu. Seo, who promoted Kim to 4th degree, credits Kim with the development of many kicks which are still used in hapkido today. Kim apparentally took the concepts from very basic kicks he had learned from Choi and went to a temple to work on developing them to a much greater degree. Later, in 1961, Kim travelled to Seoul and while staying at Ji Han-jae's Sung Moo Kwan dojang they finalized the kicking curriculum.\nKim went on to found his Shin Moo Kwan dojang (\uc2e0\ubb34\uad00) in the Jongmyo section of Seoul, also in 1961. Won Kwang-hwa (\uc6d0\uad11\ud654) and Kim Jung-soo(\uae40\uc815\uc218) also served as instructors at this dojang. Kim's notable students were Lee Han-cheol (\uc774\ud55c\ucca0), Kim Woo-tak (\uae40\uc6b0\ud0c1; who founded the Kuk Sool Kwan Hapkido dojang), Huh Il-woong (\ud5c8\uc77c\uc6c5), Lee Joo-bang (\uc774\uc8fc\ubc29; who founded modern Hwa Rang Do), Na In-dong (\ub098\uc778\ub3d9), Shin Dong-ki (\uc2e0\ub3d9\uae30) and Seo In-hyuk (\uc11c\uc778\ud601; who founded Kuk Sool Won).\nOriginally a member of the Korea Kido Association, the organization sent Kim to teach hapkido in the United States in 1969. Upon returning to Korea in 1970, Kim looked to Ji Han-Jae's move to set up his own organization and with the encouragement of his students followed suit and founded the Korean Hapkido Association in 1971. Later he combined this organization with the groups led by Ji Han-Jae and Myung Jae-nam to form the Republic of Korea Hapkido Association.\nLim Hyun-soo.\nLim Hyun-soo was born in Geochang County, South Gyeongsang Province, of Korea on Sept. 7, 1944. In 1965 he visited hapkido founder Choi Yong-sool and experienced the martial art for the first time. In 1965, Lim began his training in hapkido under Kim Yeung-jae, the chief instructor at Choi's studio. From 1978, Lim attained all of his ranks and training directly from Choi. During his training, Lim endured strict and intense training. With Choi's blessing, he launched \"jungkigwan\" on October 24, 1974. In 1976, Choi retired and closed his studio and joined \"jungkigwan\", though he retired from public teaching. Choi privately taught Lim during his visits and also spent his days at the studio playing baduk (Go) with Lim. During these times, Lim asked Choi about Hapkido techniques. \nLim based \"jungkigwan\" in Daegu and was promoted to 9th dan by Choi. Lim is an accomplished swordsman and created Chung Suk Kuhapdo after studying sword styles in Japan and Korea. Choi told Lim that learning swordsmanship would be an essential component to his hapkido training. Lim attends his studio daily to teach students from home and abroad. Since 1996, he has visited the U.S. many times for seminars. In addition, he has hosted Hapkido and Chung Suk Kuhapdo seminars in European countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands.\nHan Bong-soo.\nHan Bong-soo (\ud55c\ubd09\uc218; alternately rendered as Bong-soo Han) began his training in hapkido after seeing a demonstration put on by the founder, Yong-sul Choi. From then on, he committed himself to hapkido training under Choi and other teachers, but never received any direct high ranking from Choi himself. Han was one of the world's foremost practitioners of hapkido, and is referred to as the Father of his own offshoot of modern hapkido in the Western World. He led a dedicated effort in the development of his own version of hapkido. He taught thousands of loyal students throughout his life with many becoming masters themselves. Other masters across all styles have sought out his wisdom and teachings.\nIn 1967, Han emigrated to the United States of America, first staying with and teaching at his friend S. O. Choi's hapkido school in California. Han later opened his own school in Los Angeles in 1968. His early years were difficult and he worked in a factory during the day while he taught at a struggling hapkido school in the evening located in an economically depressed area. Later, he relocated his school to the Pacific Palisades area in an effort to be closer to Hollywood and the movie industry.\nOn July 4, 1969, Han Bong-soo was giving a demonstration of hapkido at a park in Pacific Palisades, California. In the audience was Tom Laughlin. After a spectacular demonstration, Laughlin approached Han about being involved in a movie project called \"Billy Jack\". Han gained critical acclaim for staging and performing some of the most realistic martial arts fight sequences in a film. Before \"Billy Jack\", movies contained at most brief references to martial arts, with fights portrayed by actors who had little training. With \"Billy Jack\", Han introduced authentic hapkido techniques to Western audiences. In its sequel, \"The Trial of Billy Jack\", he received a co-starring part where he spoke about and demonstrated the art, mentioning the art by name for the first time.\nHan studied and refined this Korean martial art for more than 60 years. He was not a direct high level student of Grandmaster Yong-sul Choi but created and crafted his own limited version from various other teachers that he expanded and taught throughout the world.\nKim Jung-soo.\nKim Jung-soo (\uae40\uc815\uc218) was born and raised in the Taegu area, Korea, and started training Hapkido directly under Choi Yong-sool (\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc220) in 1957. He was one of the earlier students of Hapkido, and one source puts him as the eight original student of Choi Yong-sool. Kim Jung-soo trained sporadically under Choi Yong-sool (\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc220) along with his primary teachers and influencers Kim Moo-hong (\uae40\ubb34\ud64d) and Won Kwang-wha (\uc6d0\uad11\ud654) from 1957 until 1986.\nIn 1961, Kim Moo-hong (\uae40\ubb34\ud64d) moved to Seoul to open a dojang, and Kim Jung-soo (\uae40\uc815\uc218) and Won Kwang-wha (\uc6d0\uad11\ud654) went with him and became his dojang's primary instructors. Together, they developed the Shin Moo Kwan (\uc2e0\ubb34\uad00) branch of Hapkido. In 1963 Kim Jung-soo (\uae40\uc815\uc218) decided to go his own way and opened his own dojang in Taegu under the banner of Yun Bee Kwan (\uc724\ube44\uad00). Later, his students began opening branch schools throughout the greater Taegu aerea, under various names, but still considered to be part of the Yun Bee Kwan (\uc724\ube44\uad00) family. These schools are known to hold tightly to the original teachings of Choi, Yong-sool (\uae40\uc815\uc218), while also including most of the refinements done by Kim Moo-hong (\uae40\ubb34\ud64d) in terms of kicking methods.\nKim Jung-soo (\uae40\uc815\uc218) is mostly known for being the founder and president of the Korea-based World Hapkido General Federation, also known as World Hapkido Federation, collecting most of the schools under the Yun Bee Kwan (\uc724\ube44\uad00) linage in one federation. This organization has since expanded worldwide. While having a similar name, this organization is not to be confused with the U.S. based World Hapkido Federation founded by Kwang Sik Myung (\uad11\uc2dc\uc22d).\nKim Jung-soo is currently teaching from his dojang in Taegu City, South Korea.\nMyung Jae-nam.\nIn 1972, Myung Jae-nam (\uba85\uc7ac\ub0a8) was one of the original members of the Korea Hapkido Association (\ub300\ud55c \ud569\uae30\ub3c4 \ud611\ud68c), which was formed in 1965 at the request of the South Korean President Park Jeong-hee. The Korea Hapkido Association was formed with the assistance of Park Jong-kyu, who was the head of the Presidential Protective Forces and one of the most powerful men in Korea at the time.\nMyung Jae-nam exchanged martial art techniques and information with an Aikido practitioner named Hirata in 1965, for a period of about four years and included many aikido-like techniques into his version of hapkido. He has produced Several books and videos on the subject of hapkido self-defense. Later Myung Jae-nam broke away from all the other organizations and started to focus on promoting a new style, hankido. Until his death in 1999 he was the leader of the International Hapkido Federation.\nLee Chong-min.\nChong-min Lee was born and raised in Seoul, Korea. He began his study of hapkido as a teenager and continued studying hapkido throughout his life though not a direct student of the late Grandmaster Yong-sool Choi. He is a self-promoted 9th Degree Black Belt, the Master Instructor of Hapkido Center, President of The World Hapkido Association.\nLee served as an Instructor with the 1st Special Forces Group in the Korean Army, and has taught martial arts to the Police Departments in Seoul as well as Plainfield, New Jersey. He has also served as the director of Hapkido demonstrations for such dignitaries as Hubert H. Humphrey and the Chancellor of the Republic of China, Mr. Chang, during their visits to Seoul, Korea. Lee came to the United States in June 1980. He currently operates a Hapkido Center in Warren, New Jersey, and is also a member of the Law Enforcement Officers Association New Jersey State. He has been instructing students for over 42 years in hapkido.\nKim Myung-Yong.\nKim Myung-yong was born in Korea in 1942. He started at the age of 17 training at Seung Moo Kwan School under Grandmaster Ji Han-jae. He was a hapkido instructor in the military camp of Wang Shim Ri. His style of Hapkido Jin Jung Kwan has locations all over the world and is one of the largest hapkido styles practiced.\nKim Yun-sik.\nKim Yun-sik (\uae40\uc724\uc2dd) was born in Seoul in 1943. He is the founder of Bum Moo Kwan Hapkido. He began his martial arts training in 1954 under the direction of Choi Yong-sool, and received the black belt from Choi in 1957. That same year, he received the black belt in Tang Soo Do from Grandmaster Hwang Kee.\nKim is the founder of the Bum Moo Kwan style, in which the practitioner is instructed to finish the encounter quickly, using any available material as weapon or any part of his body, aiming the opponent's pressure or vital points. Bum Moo is one of the three original and government regulated Hapkido Kwans.\nResiding, teaching and training in Brazil since 1977, Kim was the master of several Hapkido World Champions, such as Norberto Serrano Jr., Rafael Tercarolli and Leandro Heck Gemeo.\nLim Chae-kwan.\nGrandmaster Lim Chae-kwan is the founder of Jin Mu Kwan. The Jin Mu Kwan (\"Jin\": \"authentic, true\"; \"Mu\": \"martial\"; \"Kwan\": \"school or training hall\") is a traditional art of hapkido. \nThis school was founded by Grandmaster Lim Chae-kwan in 2007 after many years of research and study into the Hapkido of Founder Choi Young-sul. As a high school student, Lim, Chea-kwan began his Hapkido training under Grand Master Lim, Hyun-soo. Through the courtesy of his teacher at that time Grand Master Lim, Hyun-soo, president of the Jung Ki-kwan, he obtained a 4th dan certificate signed by Founder Choi Yong-sul. Since Choi's death in 1986 GM Lim studied with the top students of Founder Choi. Some of these Grandmasters were GM Jun Jeong-pil (kicking), GM Lee Jae-young (advanced wrist technology), GM Lee Young-hee (clothing grab defense), GM Chae Hung-jun (special offensive techniques for joint locking and throwing), GM Kim Yeong-jae (special self-protection techniques).\nGM Lim Chae-kwan after studying Founder Choi's Hapkido style and feeling his very high level martial arts has studied diligently his whole life to become a skilled craftsman in Hapkido.\nPrinciples.\nOn the \"hard-soft\" scale of martial arts, hapkido stands somewhere in the middle, employing \"soft\" techniques similar to jujutsu and aikido as well as \"hard\" techniques reminiscent of taekwondo and tang soo do. Even the \"hard\" techniques, though, emphasize circular rather than linear movements. Hapkido is an eclectic, hybrid martial art, and different hapkido schools emphasize different techniques. However, some core techniques are found in each school (\"kwan\"), and all techniques should follow the three principles of hapkido:\nHwa, or harmony, is simply the act of remaining relaxed and not directly opposing an opponent's force. For example, if an opponent were to push against a hapkido practitioner's chest, rather than resist and push back, the hapkido practitioner would blend with the opponent, avoiding any direct confrontation by moving in the same direction as the push and utilizing the opponent's forward momentum to execute a throw. Thus, this principle is largely based on energy conservation, allowing the hapkido practitioner to remain strong and fresh while his opponent becomes tired throughout the conflict. \nWon, the circle principle, is a way to gain momentum for executing the techniques in a natural and free-flowing manner (much like being swept up in a vortex). If an opponent attacks in a linear motion, as in a punch or knife thrust, the hapkido practitioner would redirect the opponent's force by leading the attack in a circular pattern, thereby adding the attacker's power to his own. Once he has redirected that power, the hapkido practitioner can then execute any of a variety of techniques to incapacitate his attacker. The hapkido practitioner must learn to view an attacker as an \"energy entity\" rather than as a physical entity. The bigger the person is, the more energy a person has, and the better it is for the hapkido practitioner. Additionally, these circular motions are not limited to mere circles but can also take on spiral or even helical formations, which further serve to confound your adversaries.\nYu, the water principle, is analogous to the concept of a \"moving target\" wherein the saying, \"In regards to a stream, you can't step on the same water twice,\" the current forever moves the water downstream and that persistent flow can erode away just about anything, even a boulder, which is often perceived as a substance that's \"stronger\" than water. Hapkido is fluid and does not rely on brute force against force. Rather it is much like water as an adaptable entity, in that a hapkido master will attempt to deflect an opponent's strike in a way that is similar to free-flowing water being divided around a stone, only to return and envelop it.\nTechniques.\nHapkido seeks to be a fully comprehensive fighting style and as such tries to avoid narrow specialization in any particular type of technique or range of fighting. It maintains a wide range of tactics for striking, standing joint locks, throwing techniques (both pure and joint manipulating throws) and pinning techniques. Some styles also incorporate tactics for ground fighting. (Although, these tactics generally tend to be focused upon escaping and regaining footing or controlling, striking, and finishing a downed opponent, rather than lengthy wrestling or submission grappling engagements.)\nThe Korean term for technique is \"sool\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0). As terminology varies between schools, some refer to defensive maneuvers as \"soolgi\" (\uc220\uae30; loosely translated as \"technique-ing\"), while \"hoshinsool\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0; meaning \"self-defense\") is preferred by others.\nProper hapkido tactics include using footwork and a series of kicks and hand strikes to bridge the distance with an opponent. Then to immediately control the balance of the opponent (typically by manipulating the head and neck), for a take down or to isolate a wrist or arm and apply a joint twisting throw, depending upon the situation; Hapkido is a comprehensive system and once the opponent's balance has been taken, there are myriad techniques to disable and subdue the opponent.\nHapkido makes use of pressure points known in Korean as \"hyeol\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0) which are also used in traditional Asian medical practices such as acupuncture point. These pressure points are either struck to produce unconsciousness or manipulated to create pain allowing one to more easily upset the balance of one's opponent prior to a throw or joint manipulation.\nHapkido emphasizes self-defense over sport fighting and as such employs the use of weapons, including environmental weapons of opportunity, in addition to empty hand techniques. Some schools also teach \"hyeong\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0), the Korean equivalent of what is commonly known as \"kata\" (or \"forms\") in Japanese martial arts.\nKicking.\nThe wide variety of kicks in hapkido make it distinctly Korean. Taekwondo kicks appear to be similar to many of the kicks found in hapkido, though again circular motion is emphasized. Also, in contrast to most modern taekwondo styles, hapkido utilises a wide variety of low (below the waist), hooking or sweeping kicks, with one of the most distinctive being the low spinning (sweeping) heel kick.\nHapkido's method of delivery tends toward greater weight commitment to the strikes and less concern for quick retraction of the kicking leg. Traditionally, Choi Yong-sool's \"yu kwon sool\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0) kicking techniques were only to the lower body, but most derived varieties of hapkido, probably as a direct influence from other Korean arts, also include high kicks and jumping kicks. At the more advanced levels of Hapkido the practitioner learns \"blade kicks\" which utilize sweeping blade strikes of the inner and outer foot against pressure points of the body.\nTwo of the earliest innovators in this regard were Ji Han-jae and Kim Moo-hong, both of whom were exposed to what were thought to be indigenous Korean kicking arts. They combined these forms together with the yu sool concepts for striking taught to them by Choi and during a period of 8 months training together in 1961 finalized the kicking curriculum which would be used by the Korea Hapkido Association for many years to come.\nOther influences also were exerted on the kicking techniques of important hapkido teachers. Kwon Tae-man (\uad8c\ud0dc\ub9cc) initially studied under Ji Han-jae before immigrating to southern California in the United States. Han Bong-soo studied under \"Gwonbeop\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0) and Sh\u016bd\u014dkan karate from Yoon Byung-in (\uc724\ubcd1\uc778), whose students were influential in the later forming of Kong Soo Do and Taekwondo styles, specifically the Chang Moo Kwan and Jidokwan. He, like Kim Moo-hong, also trained briefly in the Korean art of Taekkyon under Lee Bok-yong (\uc774\ubcf5\uc6a9).\nMany other teachers like Myung Kwang-sik (\uba85\uad11\uc2dd), Jeong Kee-tae (\uc815\uae30\ud0dc), Lim Hyun-soo (\uc784\ud604\uc218), and many others trained in tang soo do and kong soo do, Shotokan and Sh\u016bd\u014dkan karate based systems which predated and influenced the forming of first tae soo do and later modern taekwondo styles.\nKim Sang-cook states that while many of the original yu kwon sool students were exposed to many different contemporary Korean arts the Chung Do Kwan was of particular importance in the transition from the original jujutsu based form to what we know today as modern hapkido.\nMost forms of hapkido include a series of double kicks used to promote balance, coordination and muscular control.\nAfter these kicks are mastered using one foot, the student moves on to jumping versions, alternating the kicking legs.\nKim Chong-sung (\uae40\uc885\uc131, Jang Mu Won Hapkido Founder) was one of the oldest living active hapkido instructors, who maintains that the source of these kicking methods is from the indigenous Korean kicking art of Taekkyon. Others feel that these kicks are more representative of kong soo do and tang soo do styles which emerged from an adaptation of Japanese karate forms.\nHand strikes.\nLike most martial arts, hapkido employs a great number of punches and hand strikes, as well as elbow strikes. A distinctive example of hapkido hand techniques is \"live hand\" strike that focuses energy to the \"baek hwa hyul\" in the hand, producing energy strikes and internal strikes. The hand strikes are often used to weaken the opponent before joint locking and throwing, and also as finishing techniques.\nHand striking in hapkido (unless in competition) is not restricted to punches and open hand striking; some significance is given to striking with fingernails at the throat and eyes; pulling at the opponent's genitals is also covered in conventional training.\nIn order to recall hand strikes more easily in an emotionally charged situation, beginning students are taught conventional, effective patterns of blocks and counter-attacks called \"makko chigi\" (\ub9c9\uace0 \uce58\uae30), which progress to more complex techniques as the student becomes familiar with them.\nJoint manipulation techniques.\nMany of hapkido's joint control techniques are said to be derived largely from Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu. They are taught similarly to Aikido and Ju Jutsu techniques, but in general the circles are smaller and the techniques are applied in a more linear fashion. Hapkido's joint manipulation techniques attack both large joints (such as the elbow, shoulder, neck, back, knee, and hip) and small joints (such as wrists, fingers, ankles, toes, and jaw).\nMost techniques involve applying force in the direction that a joint moves naturally and then forcing it to overextend or by forcing a joint to move in a direction that goes against its natural range of motion. These techniques can be used to cause pain and force a submission, to gain control of an opponent for 'come along' techniques (as is often employed in law enforcement), to assist in a hard or gentle throw or to cause the dislocation or breaking of the joint. Hapkido differs from some post-war styles of Aikido in its preservation of a great many techniques which are applied against the joint that were deemed by some to be inconsistent with Aikido's more pacifistic philosophy.\nHapkido is well known for its use of a wide variety of wristlocks. These techniques are derived from Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu although their manner of performance is not always identical to that of the parent art. Still many of the techniques found in hapkido are quite similar to those of Daito-ryu and of Aikido, which was derived from that art. Examples of such techniques are: the supinating wristlock, pronating wristlock, internal rotational wristlock, and the utilization of pressure points on the wrist. These techniques are common to many forms of Japanese Jujutsu, Chinese chin na, and even \"catch as catch can\" wrestling.\nAlthough well known for its wristlocking techniques, Hapkido has an equally wide array of tactics which center upon the manipulation of the elbow joint (see armlock). The first self-defense technique typically taught in many hapkido schools is the \"knife-hand elbow press\". This technique is thought to be derived from Dait\u014d-ry\u016b's \"ippondori\", a method of disarming and destroying the elbow joint of a sword-wielding opponent. Hapkido typically introduces this technique off a wrist-grabbing attack where the defender makes a circular movement with his hands to free himself from the opponent's grasp and applies a pronating wristlock while cutting down upon the elbow joint with their forearm, taking their opponent down to the ground, where an elbow lock is applied with one's hand or knee to immobilize the attacker in a pin. Both Daito-ryu and Aikido prefer to use hand pressure on the elbow throughout the technique rather than using the forearm as a \"hand blade (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0)\", cutting into the elbow joint, in the Hapkido manner.\nThrowing techniques.\nIn addition to throws which are achieved by unbalancing one's opponent through the twisting of their joints, hapkido also contains techniques of pure throwing which do not require the assistance of jointlocks. Some of these techniques are found within Daito-ryu but a great many of them are held in common with judo (pronounced \"yudo \uc720\ub3c4\" in Korean). Many of early practitioners of hapkido had extensive judo backgrounds including Choi Yong-sool's first student Seo Bok-seob.\nJudo techniques were introduced in the early years of the 20th century in Korea during the Japanese colonial period. Judo/Yudo tactics employ extensive use of throws, various chokes, hold downs, joint locks, and other grappling techniques used to control the opponent on the ground. It is believed that these techniques were absorbed into the hapkido curriculum from judo as there were a great many judo practitioners in Korea at that time and its tactics were commonly employed in the fighting of the period. Indeed, there also exists a portion of the hapkido curriculum which consists of techniques specifically designed to thwart judo style attacks.\nThe judo/yudo techniques were however adopted with adjustments made to make them blend more completely with the self-defence orientation which hapkido stresses. For example, many of the judo style throwing techniques employed in hapkido do not rely upon the use of traditional judo grips on the uniform, which can play a large role in the Japanese sport. Instead in many cases they rely upon gripping the limbs, head or neck in order to be successful.\nEven today Korea remains one of the strongest countries in the world for the sport of judo and this cross influence on the art of Korean hapkido to be felt in Hapkido influenced styles such as GongKwon Yusul (\uacf5\uad8c\uc720\uc220).\nWeapons.\nAs a hapkido student advances through the various belt levels (essentially the same as other Korean arts, e.g. taekwondo), he or she learns how to employ and defend against various weapons. The first weapon encountered is most often a knife (). Another initial weapon used to teach both control and the basic precepts of utilizing a weapon with Hapkido techniques is the Tan Bong (police baton sized stick), techniques and defenses against the 35\u00a0cm short stick (), a walking stick or cane (), and a rope are introduced in hapkido training. Many hapkido organisations may also include other weapons training such as a sword (), long staff (), choong bong length staff, nunchaku (), war-fan or other types of bladed weapons such as twin short swords. Some schools even teach students to defend against firearms. Hapkido weapons techniques are often incorporated into many military and law enforcement training curricula.\nTraining.\nHapkido training takes place in a dojang. While training methods vary, a typical training session will contain technique practice (striking techniques as well as defensive throws and grappling), break falling (), sparring, meditation and exercises to develop internal energy ().\nHapkido is predominantly a \"soft\" art, but this does not mean that it is easier on the opponent, or that training is easier (see Hard and soft (martial arts)). Hapkido training is vigorous and demanding. The practitioner could benefit in training by being lean and muscular. However, strength is not a prerequisite of hapkido; what strength and fitness is necessary to perform the techniques develops naturally as a result of training.\nThe following is an example of the Korea Hapkido Association technical requirements from 1st degree to 5th degree Black Belt as recorded by Hae-young Kim in 1991, created in association with Ji Han-jae. These techniques are now considered pre-dan level.\n1st Degree Black Belt\n2nd Degree Black Belt\n3rd Degree Black Belt\n4th Degree Black Belt\n5th Degree Black Belt\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The capital city is also called Cabinda, known locally as \"Tchiowa\", \"Tsiowa\" or \"Kiowa\". The province is divided into four municipalities\u2014Belize, Buco-Zau, Cabinda and Cacongo.\nModern Cabinda is the result of a fusion of three kingdoms: N'Goyo, Loango and Kakongo. It has an area of and a population of 716,076 at the 2014 census; the latest official estimate (as at mid-2019) is 824,143. According to 1988 United States government statistics, the total population of the province was 147,200, with a near even split between rural and urban populations. At one point an estimated one third of Cabindans were refugees living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; however, after the 2007 peace agreement, refugees started returning to their homes.\nCabinda is separated from the rest of Angola by a narrow strip of territory belonging to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly known, up until 1960, as the Belgian Congo), which bounds the province on the south and the east. Cabinda is bounded on the north by the Republic of the Congo (formerly known as French Congo), and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent to the coast are some of the largest offshore oil fields in the world. Petroleum exploration began in 1954 with the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, when the territory was under Portuguese rule.\nCabinda also produces hardwoods, coffee, cacao, rubber, and palm oil products; however, petroleum production accounts for most of Cabinda's domestic product. Cabinda produces of crude oil per day. Cabinda Oil is associated with Sonangol, Agip Angola Lda (41%), Chevron (39.2%), TotalEnergies (10%) and Eni (9.8%).\nIn 1885, the Treaty of Simulambuco established Cabinda as a protectorate of the Portuguese Empire, and Cabindan independence movements consider the occupation of the territory by Angola illegal. While the Angolan Civil War largely ended in 2002, an armed struggle persists in the exclave of Cabinda. Some of the factions have proclaimed an independent Republic of Cabinda, with offices in Paris.\nHistory.\nPortuguese Congo.\nPortuguese explorers, missionaries, and traders arrived at the mouth of the Congo River in the mid-15th century, making contact with the Manikongo, the powerful King of the Bakongo tribe. The Manikongo controlled much of the region through affiliation with smaller kingdoms, such as the Kingdoms of Ngoyo, Loango, and Kakongo in present-day Cabinda.\nOver the years, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English established trading posts, logging camps, and small palm oil processing factories in Cabinda. Trade continued and the European presence grew, resulting in conflicts between the rival colonial powers. Between 1827 and 1830, the Imperial Brazilian Navy maintained a naval base in the western part of Cabinda, making it the only Brazilian colony outside of South America.\nPortugal first claimed sovereignty over Cabinda in the February 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco, which gave Cabinda the status of a protectorate of the Portuguese Crown under the request of \"the princes and governors of Cabinda\". This is often the basis upon which the legal and historical arguments in defense of the self-determination of modern-day Cabinda are constructed. Article 1, for example, states, \"the princes and chiefs and their successors declare, voluntarily, their recognition of Portuguese sovereignty, placing under the protectorate of this nation all the territories by them governed\" [\"sic\"]. Article 2, which is often used in separatist arguments, goes even further: \"Portugal is obliged to maintain the integrity of the territories placed under its protection\". The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-R) argues that the above-mentioned treaty was signed between the emissaries of the Portuguese Crown and the princes and notables of Cabinda, then called Portuguese Congo, giving rise to not one, but three protectorates: Cacongo, Loango, and Ngoio.\nThrough the Treaty of Simulambuco in 1885 between the kings of Portugal and the princes of Cabinda, a Portuguese protectorate was decreed, reserving rights to the local princes and independent of Angola. Cabinda once had the Congo River as the only natural boundary with Angola, but in 1885, the Berlin Conference extended the territory of the Congo Free State along the Congo River to the river's mouth at the sea.\nDuring this time rubber was harvested and traded in Cabinda. Atrocities such as the cutting of hands were also committed there, although comprehensive reports on these atrocities were more scant and less publicly known compared to the neighbouring Congo Free State.\nAdministrative merger with Angola.\nBy the mid-1920s, the borders of Angola had been finally established in negotiations with the neighboring colonial powers. From there on Angola and Cabinda were treated distinctively under the Portuguese constitution of 1933 until 15 January 1975 under the Alvor Agreement.\nThe Portuguese constitution of 1933 distinguished between the colony of Angola and the protectorate of Cabinda, but in 1956, the administration of Cabinda was transferred to the governor-general of Angola. The legal distinction of Cabinda's status from that of Angola was also expressed in the Portuguese constitution of 1971. Yet, when Angola was declared an \"overseas province\" (Prov\u00edncia Ultramarina) within the empire of Portugal in 1951, Cabinda was treated as an ordinary district of Angola. In 1972, the name of Angola was changed to \"State of Angola\".\nUnder Portuguese rule, Cabinda was an important agricultural and forestry center, and in 1967, it discovered huge offshore oil fields. Oil, timber, and cocoa had been its main exports until then. The town of Cabinda, the capital of the territory, was a Portuguese administrative and services center with a port and airfield. The beaches of Cabinda were popular with Portuguese Angolans.\nAfter independence of Angola from Portugal.\nA 1974 military coup in Lisbon abolished the authoritarian regime established by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar that had prevailed in Portugal for decades. The new government decided immediately to grant all Portuguese colonies the independence for which nationalist guerilla movements had been striving. In Angola, the decolonization process took the form of a violent conflict between the different guerilla movements and their allies. In 1975, the Treaty of Alvor between Portugal and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) reconfirmed Cabinda's status as part of Angola. The treaty was rejected by the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda and other local political organizations which advocated for separate independence. Since then, Cabinda has been, on the one hand, a normal Angolan province, but on the other hand, there has been persistent political protest against this status; the \"Kabinda Free State\" says the exclave was a Portuguese protectorate until Angola invaded in 1974. They also say they control 85% of Kabinda territory and invite proposals for joint ventures. A number of guerrilla actions have also occurred in Cabinda.\nSecessionism.\nEthnic grounds for self-determination.\nThe arguments for self-determination are based on Cabindans' cultural and ethnic background. Prior to the Treaty of Simulambuco, three kingdoms existed in what is now referred to as Cabinda: Cacongo, Ngoyo, and Loango. The Cabindans belong to the Bakongo ethnic group whose language is Kikongo. The Bakongo also comprise the majority of the population in U\u00edge and Zaire provinces of Angola. However, despite this shared ancestry, the Cabindans developed a very different culture and distinct variants of the Kikongo language.\nSecessionist history.\nIn the early 1960s, several movements advocating a separate status for Cabinda came into being. The Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (MLEC) was formed in 1960 under the leadership of Luis Ranque Franque. Resulting from the merger of various \u00e9migr\u00e9 associations in Brazzaville, the MLEC rapidly became the most prominent of the separatist movements. A further group was the Alliama (Alliance of the Mayombe), representing the Mayombe, a small minority of the population. In an important development, these movements united in August 1963 to form a united front. They called themselves the FLEC, and the leadership role was taken by the MLEC's Ranque Franque.\nIn marked contrast with the FNLA, the FLEC's efforts to mobilize international support for its government in exile met with little success. In fact, the majority of Organization of African Unity (OAU) members, concerned that this could encourage separatism elsewhere on the continent, committed to the sanctity of state borders and firmly rejected recognition of the FLEC's government in exile.\nIn January 1975, Angola's MPLA, FNLA and UNITA liberation movements signed the Alvor Agreement with Portugal, to establish the modalities of the transition to independence. FLEC was not invited.\nOn 1 August 1975, at an OAU summit in Kampala which was discussing Angola in the midst of its turbulent decolonization process, Ranque Franque proclaimed the independence of the \"Republic of Cabinda\". Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko called for a referendum on the future of Cabinda.\nFLEC formed a provisional government, led by Henriques Tiago. Luiz Branque Franque was elected president. Following the declaration of Angolan independence in November 1975, Cabinda was invaded by forces of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), with the support of Cuban troops. The MPLA overthrew the provisional FLEC government and incorporated Cabinda into Angola.\nFor much of the 1970s and 1980s, FLEC operated a low intensity guerrilla war, attacking Angolan government troops and economic targets, or creating havoc by kidnapping foreign employees working in the province's oil and construction businesses.\nThe National Union for the Liberation of Cabinda (; UNLC), a militant separatist group, emerged in the 1990s under the leadership of Lumingu Luis Gimby.\nIn April 1997, Cabinda joined the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, a democratic and international organization whose members are indigenous peoples, occupied nations, minorities and independent states or territories. In 2010, Cabinda became a charter member of the Organization of Emerging African States (OEAS).\nRecent history.\nAn ad-hoc United Nations commission for human rights in Cabinda reported in 2003 that many atrocities had been perpetrated by the MPLA. In 2004, according to Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Human Rights Watch mission for Africa, the Angolan army continued to commit crimes against civilians in Cabinda.\nAlthough the Angolan government says FLEC is no longer operative, this is disputed by the Republic of Cabinda and its Premier, Joel Batila.\nEarlier increases in the price of oil have made Cabinda's untapped onshore oil reserves a valuable commodity.\nPeace deal.\nIn July 2006, after ceasefire negotiations in the Republic of Congo, Ant\u00f3nio Bento Bembe \u2013 as a president of Cabindan Forum for Dialogue and Peace, and vice-president and executive secretary of FLEC \u2013 announced that the Cabindan separatist forces were ready to declare a ceasefire. Bembe is the leader of the \"Cabindan Forum for Dialogue\", an organization which represents most Cabindan groups. The peace was recognized by the United States, France, Portugal, Russia, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the African Union.\n\"We're going to sign a cease-fire with the Angolans who in return have accepted the principle of granting special status to Cabinda\", he announced, implying that while his group is resigned to be a part of Angola, they have gotten a promise of some form of autonomy.\nFrom Paris, FLEC-FAC contended Bembe has no authority or mandate to negotiate with the Angolans, and that the only acceptable solution is total independence.\nTogo football team bus attack.\nOn 8 January 2010, the bus carrying the Togo national football team traveling through Cabinda en route to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournament was attacked by gunmen, even though it had an escort of Angolan forces. The ensuing gunfight resulted in the deaths of the assistant coach, team spokesman and bus driver, and caused injuries to several others as well.\nAn offshoot of the FLEC claimed responsibility. Rodrigues Mingas, secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (FLEC-PM), said his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. \"This attack was not aimed at the Togolese players but at the Angolan forces at the head of the convoy\", Mingas told France\u00a024 television. \"So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don't have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for the total liberation of Cabinda.\"\nEconomy.\n Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber, and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil. Conservative estimates say that Cabinda accounts for close to 60% of Angola's oil production, estimated at approximately , and it is estimated that oil exports from the province are worth the equivalent of US$100,000 per annum for every Cabindan. Yet Cabinda remains one of the poorest provinces in Angola. An agreement in 1996 between the national and provincial governments stipulated that 10% of Cabinda's taxes on oil revenues would be given back to the province, but Cabindans often feel that these revenues do not benefit the population as a whole, largely because of corruption. The private sector, particularly the oil industry, has both affected and been affected by the secessionist conflict. During the early days of Cabinda's struggle, the oil companies were perceived as sympathetic to, if not supportive of, Cabinda's self-determination cause. The strategy used by the separatists to gain international attention, was most evident in 1999 and 2000. During 1999, FLEC-R kidnapped four foreign workers (two Portuguese and two French citizens), but released them after several months, having failed to attract the attention of the international community. FLEC-FAC also increased its activities during 2000 with the more widely publicized kidnapping of three Portuguese workers employed by a construction company, while FLEC-R kidnapped another five Portuguese civilians. These hostages were not freed until June 2001, following diplomatic intervention by the governments of Gabon and the Republic of the Congo.\nMunicipalities.\nThe province of Cabinda consists of four municipalities (); listed below with their areas (in km2) and populations at the 2014 Census and according to the latest official estimates:\nThe city of Cabinda contains 87% of the provincial population. The other three municipalities lie to the north of the city.\nCommunes.\nThe province of Cabinda contains the following communes (); sorted by their respective municipalities:\nGeology.\nTwo giant oil fields, the \"Malonga North\" and \"Malonga West\" were discovered in 1967 and 1970, respectively, both pre-salt or pre-Aptian producers.\nLocated in water depths of 50 to 75\u00a0m, oil was discovered in Barremian deposits in 1971, then the Cenomanian section in 1979.\nFour offshore oil fields, the \"Wamba\", \"Takula\", \"Numbi\" and \"Vuko\", are located in the greater Takula area, producing from the Upper Cretaceous, Cenomanian Vermelha sandstone deposited in the coastal environment.\nCretaceous and Paleocene vertebrates, including fossil turtles as \"Cabindachelys\" have been collected from L\u00e2ndana.\nList of governors of Cabinda.\nUp to 1991, the official name was Provincial Commissioner\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the Rock of Gibraltar. A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history, with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco. The term was applied in antiquity: Pliny the Elder included the Pillars of Hercules in his \"Naturalis historia\" (Book III:3).\nHistory.\nAccording to Greek mythology adopted by the Etruscans and Romans, when Hercules had to perform twelve labours, one of them (the tenth) was to fetch the Cattle of Geryon of the far West and bring them to Eurystheus; this marked the westward extent of his travels. A lost passage of Pindar quoted by Strabo was the earliest traceable reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\". Since there has been a one-to-one association between Heracles and Melqart since Herodotus, the \"Pillars of Melqart\" in the temple near Gades/G\u00e1deira (modern C\u00e1diz) have sometimes been considered to be the true \"Pillars of Hercules\".\nPlato placed the legendary island of Atlantis beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\". Renaissance tradition says the pillars bore the warning \"Ne plus ultra\" (also , \"nothing further beyond\"), serving as a warning to sailors and navigators to go no further.\nAccording to some Roman sources, while on his way to the garden of the Hesperides on the island of Erytheia, Hercules had to cross the mountain that was once Atlas. Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the Strait of Gibraltar. One part of the split mountain is Gibraltar and the other is either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name.\nDiodorus Siculus, however, held that, instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules \"narrowed\" an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea.\nIn some versions, Heracles instead built the two to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas from his damnation.\nPhoenician connection.\nBeyond Gades, several important Mauretanian colonies (in modern-day Morocco) were founded by the Phoenicians as the Phoenician merchant fleet pushed through the Pillars of Hercules and began constructing a series of bases along the Atlantic coast starting with Lixus in the north, then Chellah and finally Mogador.\nNear the eastern shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern C\u00e1diz, just beyond the strait) Strabo describes the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic Melqart, by . Strabo notes that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making. The columns of the Melqart temple at Tyre were also of religious significance.\nThe Pillars in Syriac geography.\nSyriac scholars were aware of the Pillars through their efforts to translate Greek scientific works into their language as well as into Arabic. The Syriac compendium of knowledge known as \"Ktaba d'ellat koll 'ellan\" (\"Cause of All Causes\") is unusual in asserting that there were three, not two, columns.\nIn art.\nDante's \"Inferno\".\nIn \"Inferno\" XXVI Dante Alighieri mentions Ulysses in the pit of the Fraudulent Counsellors and his voyage past the Pillars of Hercules. Ulysses justifies endangering his sailors by the fact that his goal is to gain knowledge of the unknown. After five months of navigation in the ocean, Ulysses sights the mountain of Purgatory but encounters a whirlwind from it that sinks his ship and all on it for their daring to approach Purgatory while alive, by their strength and wits alone.\nSir Francis Bacon's \"Novum Organum\".\nThe Pillars appear prominently on the engraved title page of Sir Francis Bacon's \"Instauratio Magna\" (\"Great Renewal\"), 1620, an unfinished work of which the second part was his influential \"Novum Organum\". The motto along the base says \"Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia\" (\"Many will pass through and knowledge will be the greater\"). The image was based on the use of the pillars in Spanish and Habsburg propaganda.\nStatue of the pillars of Hercules in Ceuta.\nThe Spanish enclave in the extreme north of the African continent, the town of Ceuta is home to a modern-day statue called \"The Pillars of Hercules\" (Spanish: Columnas de H\u00e9rcules).\nThe statue consists of two huge bronze pillars, which are held apart by Hercules. The statue was made by Ceuta artist Gin\u00e9s Serr\u00e1n-Pag\u00e1n.\nIn architecture.\nOn the Spanish coast at Los Barrios are Torres de Hercules which are twin towers that were inspired by the \"Pillars of Hercules\". These towers were the tallest in Andalusia until Cajasol Tower was completed in Seville in 2015.\nIn the southern wall of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Central Library, the mural \"Historical Representation of Culture\", created by the artist Juan O'Gorman, portrays a depiction of the Pillars of Hercules as an allusion to the colonial past of Mexico and the house of Charles V.\nCoat of arms.\nThe Pillars appear as supporters of the coat of arms of Spain, originating in the impresa of Spain's sixteenth century king Charles I, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. It was an idea of the Italian humanist Luigi Marliano. It bears the motto \"Plus Ultra\", Latin for \"further beyond\", implying that the pillars were a gateway. This was modified from the phrase \"Nec plus ultra\", \"Nothing more beyond\" after the discovery of the Americas, which laid to rest the idea of the Pillars of Hercules as the westernmost extremity of the inhabitable world which had prevailed since Antiquity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Part of the greater region of Karabakh, it spans the area between Lower Karabakh and Syunik. Its terrain mostly consists of mountains and forestland.\nMost of Nagorno-Karabakh was governed by ethnic Armenians under the breakaway Republic of Artsakh \u2013 also known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) \u2013 from the end of the first Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1994 to the announcement of the dissolution of the republic in September 2023. Representatives from the two sides held numerous inconclusive peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group regarding the region's disputed status, with its majority-Armenian population over time variously advocating either for Artsakh's independence from both states or for its integration into Armenia.\nThe region is usually equated with the administrative borders of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, comprising ; however, the region's historical extent encompasses approximately .\nOn 27 September 2020, the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War broke out with an Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. Azerbaijan made significant gains during the war, regaining all of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and capturing one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh, including Shusha and Hadrut. The war ended on 10 November 2020 when a trilateral ceasefire agreement was signed between Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia, under which all the remaining occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh were formally returned to Azerbaijani control. The Republic of Artsakh became an isolated rump state connected with Armenia only by a narrow Russian-controlled corridor.\nOn 19 September 2023, after a blockade lasting several months, Azerbaijan launched a fresh large-scale military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Artsakh forces collapsed rapidly, resulting in an Azerbaijani victory, the dissolution of the Republic of Artsakh, the exodus of almost the entire Armenian population from the region, and the entry of Azerbaijani security forces into the former Artsakh capital of Stepanakert, known as Khankendi by Azerbaijan. On 1 January 2024, the Republic of Artsakh was formally dissolved, marking the end of a millennia-old Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh. Various political analysts, along with residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, accused Azerbaijan of committing ethnic cleansing.\nEtymology.\nThe prefix \"Nagorno-\" derives from the Russian attributive adjective (), which means \"highland\". The Azerbaijani names of the region include the similar adjectives (mountainous) or (upper). Such words are not used in the Armenian name, but appeared in the region's official name during the Soviet era as Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Other languages apply their own wording for \"mountainous\", \"upper\", or \"highland\"; for example, the official name used for the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in French is , meaning \"Upper Karabakh\".\nThe names for the region in the various local languages all translate to \"mountainous Karabakh\", or \"mountainous black garden\":\nArmenians living in the area often call Nagorno-Karabakh \"Artsakh\" (), the name of the 10th province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. Urartian inscriptions (9th\u20137th centuries BC) use the name for the region. Ancient Greek sources called the area .\nHistory.\nAntiquity and Early Middle Ages.\nNagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the Kura-Araxes culture who lived between the two rivers Kura and Araxes.\nThe ancient population of the region consisted of various autochthonous local and migrant tribes who were mostly non-Indo-Europeans. According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians who came to the region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd (or possibly earlier, the 4th) century BC. Other scholars suggest that the Armenians settled in the region as early as the 7th century BC.\nAround 180 BC, Artsakh became one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom and remained so until the 4th century. While formally having the status of a province (), Artsakh possibly formed a principality on its own\u00a0\u2013 like Armenia's province of Syunik. Other theories suggest that Artsakh was a royal land, belonging directly to the king of Armenia. King Tigran the Great of Armenia (who ruled from 95 to 55 BC) founded in Artsakh one of four cities named Tigranakert after himself. The ruins of the ancient Tigranakert, located north-east of Stepanakert, are being studied by a group of international scholars.\nIn 387 AD, after the partition of Armenia between the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia, two Armenian provinces \u2013 Artsakh and Utik \u2013 became part of the Sassanid satrapy of Caucasian Albania, which in turn came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence. At the time the population of Artsakh and Utik consisted of Armenians and several Armenized tribes.\nArmenian culture and civilization flourished in the early medieval Nagorno-Karabakh. In the 5th century, the first-ever Armenian school was opened on the territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh at Amaras Monastery through the efforts of St. Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. St. Mesrop was very active in preaching the Gospel in Artsakh and Utik. Overall, Mesrop Mashtots made three trips to Artsakh and Utik, ultimately reaching pagan territories at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus. The 7th-century Armenian linguist and grammarian Stephanos Syunetsi stated in his work that Armenians of Artsakh had their own dialect, and encouraged his readers to learn it.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nAround the mid 7th century, the region was conquered by the invading Muslim Arabs through the Muslim conquest of Persia. Subsequently, it was ruled by local governors endorsed by the Caliphate. According to some sources, in 821 the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian revolted in Artsakh and established the House of Khachen, which ruled Artsakh as a principality until the early 19th century. According to other sources, Sahl Smbatian \"was of the Zamirhakan family of kings\", and in the year 837\u2013838 he acquired sovereignty over Armenia, Georgia, and Albania. The name \"Khachen\" originated from Armenian word , which means \"cross\". By 1000 the House of Khachen proclaimed the Kingdom of Artsakh with John Senecherib as its first ruler. Initially Dizak in southern Artsakh also formed a kingdom ruled by the ancient House of Aranshahik, descended from the earliest Kings of Caucasian Albania. In 1261, after the daughter of the last king of Dizak married the king of Artsakh, Armenian prince Hasan Jalal Dola, the two states merged into one Armenian Principality of Khachen. Subsequently, Artsakh continued to exist as a de facto independent principality.\nLate Middle Ages.\nIn the 15th century, the territory of Karabakh was part of the states ruled subsequently by the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkic tribal confederations. According to Abu Bakr Tihrani, during the period of Jahan Shah (1438\u20131468), the ruler of Kara Koyunlu, Piri bey Karamanli held the governorship of Karabakh. However, according to Robert H. Hewsen, the Turkoman lord Jahan Shah (1437\u20131467) assigned the governorship of upper Karabakh to local Armenian princes, allowing a native Armenian leadership to emerge consisting of five noble families led by princes who held the titles of \"meliks\". These dynasties represented the branches of the earlier House of Khachen and were the descendants of the medieval kings of Artsakh. Their lands were often referred to as the Country of Khamsa ('five' in Arabic). In a Charter (2 June 1799) of the Emperor Paul I titled \"About their admission to Russian suzerainty, land allocation, rights and privileges\", it was noted that the Christian heritage of the Karabakh region and all their people were admitted to the Russian suzerainty. However, according to Robert Hewsen, the Russian Empire recognized the sovereign status of the five princes in their domains by the charter of Emperor Paul I dated 2 June 1799.\nThe Armenian meliks were granted supreme command over neighbouring Armenian principalities and Muslim khans in the Caucasus by the Iranian king Nader Shah, in return for the meliks' victories over the invading Ottoman Turks in the 1720s. These five principalities in Karabakh were ruled by Armenian families who had received the title Melik (prince) and were the following:\nFrom 1501 to 1736, during the existence of the Safavid Empire, the province of Karabakh was governed by the Ziyadoghlu Qajar dynasty, until Nader Shah took over Karabakh from their rule. The Armenian meliks maintained full control over the region until the mid-18th century. In the early 18th century, Iran's Nader Shah took Karabakh out of control of the Ganja khans in punishment for their support of the Safavids, and placed it under his own control In the mid-18th century, as internal conflicts between the meliks led to their weakening, the Karabakh Khanate was formed. The Karabakh khanate, one of the largest khanates under Iranian suzerainty, was headed by Panah-Ali khan Javanshir. For the reinforcement of the power of Karabakh khanate, Khan of Karabakh, Panah-Ali khan Javanshir, built up \"the fortress of Panahabad (today Shusha)\" in 1751. During that time, Otuziki, Javanshir, Kebirli, and other Turkic tribes constituted the majority of the overall population.\nModern era.\nKarabakh (including modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh), became a protectorate of the Russian Empire by the Kurekchay Treaty, signed between Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh and general Pavel Tsitsianov on behalf of Tsar Alexander I in 1805, according to which the Russian monarch recognized Ibrahim Khalil Khan and his descendants as the sole hereditary rulers of the region. However, its new status was only confirmed following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), when through the loss in the war, Persia formally ceded Karabakh to the Russian Empire per the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), before the rest of Transcaucasia was incorporated into the Empire in 1828 by the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which came as an outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828).\nIn 1822, 9 years after it passed from Iranian to Russian control, the Karabakh Khanate was dissolved and the area became part of the Elizavetpol Governorate within the Russian Empire. In 1823 the five districts corresponding roughly to modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh were 90.8% Armenian-populated.\nSoviet era.\nAfter the October Revolution, Karabakh became part of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian states. Over the next two years (1918\u20131920), there were a series of short wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions, including Nagorno-Karabakh. Between 1918 and 1920, Nagorno-Karabakh's de jure affiliation with Armenia or Azerbaijan was disputed and not adjudicated by the League of Nations.\nIn July 1918, the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a National Council and government. Later, Ottoman troops entered Karabakh, meeting armed resistance by Armenians.\nAfter the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, British troops occupied Karabakh. The British command provisionally affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov (appointed by the Azerbaijani government) as the governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the Paris Peace Conference. The decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians. In February 1920, the Karabakh National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction, while Armenians elsewhere in Karabakh continued guerrilla fighting, never accepting the agreement. The agreement itself was soon annulled by the Ninth Karabagh Assembly, which declared union with Armenia in April.\nIn April 1920, while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan was taken over by Bolsheviks. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached. In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks. After the Sovietization of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Kavbiuro (Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)) decided that Karabakh would remain within Azerbaijan SSR with broad regional autonomy, with the administrative centre in the city of Shusha (the administrative center was later moved to Stepanakert). The oblast's borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages. The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority.\nWith the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region, the conflict over the region died down for several decades until the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the question of Nagorno-Karabakh re-emerged. Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced Azerification of the region, the majority Armenian population, with ideological and material support from the Armenian SSR, started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the Armenian SSR. In August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union with Armenia with tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow.\nWar and secession.\nOn 13 February 1988, Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in Stepanakert, in favour of unification with the Armenian republic. Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan. On 20 February, the Soviet of People's Deputies in Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This unprecedented action by a regional Soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians' demands. The confrontation between the Azeris and the police near Askeran degenerated into the Askeran clash, which left two Azeris dead, one of them allegedly killed by an Azeri police officer. Fifty Armenian villagers and an unknown number of Azeris and police officers were injured. Large numbers of refugees left Armenia and Azerbaijan as violence began against the minority populations of the respective republics. On 7 July 1988, the European Parliament passed a resolution that condemned the violence employed against Armenian demonstrators in Azerbaijan, and supported the demand of the Armenians for reunification with the Soviet Republic of Armenia.\nOn 29 November 1989, direct rule in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended and the region was returned to Azerbaijani administration. The Soviet policy backfired, however, when a joint session of the Armenian Supreme Soviet and the National Council, the legislative body of Nagorno-Karabakh, proclaimed the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. On 26 November 1991 Azerbaijan abolished the status of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, rearranging the administrative division and bringing the territory under direct control of Azerbaijan.\nOn 10 December 1991, in a referendum boycotted by local Azerbaijanis, Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh approved the creation of an independent state. A Soviet proposal for enhanced autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan satisfied neither side and a full-scale war subsequently erupted between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, with the latter receiving support from Armenia. According to Armenia's former president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and \"they thought they could get more.\"\nThe struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh escalated after both Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In the post-Soviet power vacuum, military action between Azerbaijan and Armenia was heavily influenced by the Russian military. Furthermore, both the Armenian and Azerbaijani military employed a large number of mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia. Between fifteen and twenty-five hundred Afghan mujahideen, along with fighters from Chechnya, participated in the fighting on Azerbaijan's side. Russia provided Armenia with heavy artillery and tanks. Many survivors from the Azerbaijani side found shelter in 12 emergency camps set up in other parts of Azerbaijan to cope with the growing number of internally displaced people due to the first Nagorno-Karabakh war.\nBy the end of 1993, the conflict had caused about 30,000 casualties and created hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides. By May 1994, the Armenians were in control of 14% of the territory of Azerbaijan. At that stage, for the first time during the conflict, the Azerbaijani government recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as a third party in the war and started direct negotiations with the Karabakh authorities. As a result, a ceasefire was reached on 12 May 1994 through Russian mediation.\nPost-1994 ceasefire.\nDespite the ceasefire, fatalities due to armed conflicts between Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers continued. On 25 January 2005, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted PACE Resolution 1416, which condemned ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis. On 15\u201317 May 2007 the 34th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Conference adopted resolution No. 7/34-P, considering the occupation of Azerbaijani territory as the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan and recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity, and condemning the destruction of archaeological, cultural and religious monuments in the occupied territories. The 11th session of the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference held on 13\u201314 March 2008 in Dakar adopted resolution No. 10/11-P (IS). In the resolution, OIC member states condemned the occupation of Azerbaijani lands by Armenian forces and Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan, ethnic cleansing against the Azeri population, and charged Armenia with the \"destruction of cultural monuments in the occupied Azerbaijani territories\". On 14 March of the same year the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution No. 62/243 which \"demands the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan\". On 18\u201320 May 2010, the 37th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Conference in Dushanbe adopted another resolution condemning the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan, recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity and condemning the destruction of archaeological, cultural, and religious monuments in occupied territories. On 20 May of the same year, the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted the resolution on \"The need for an EU Strategy for the South Caucasus\" on the basis of the report by Evgeni Kirilov, the Bulgarian member of the Parliament. The resolution states in particular that \"the occupied Azerbaijani regions around Nagorno-Karabakh must be cleared as soon as possible\". On 26 January 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted Resolution 2085, which deplored the fact that the occupation by Armenia of Nagorno-Karabakh and other adjacent areas of Azerbaijan creates humanitarian and environmental problems for the citizens of Azerbaijan, condemned ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis and Assembly requested immediate withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from the region concerned.\nSeveral world leaders have met with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the years, but efforts to maintain the ceasefire have failed.\nOn 2 April 2016 Azerbaijani and Armenian forces again clashed in the region. The Armenian Defense Ministry alleged that Azerbaijan launched an offensive to seize territory in the region. At least 30 soldiers were killed during the fighting and a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and tank were also destroyed, with 12 of the fallen soldiers belonging to the Azerbaijani forces and the other 18 belonging to the Armenian forces, as well as an additional 35 Armenian soldiers reportedly wounded.\n2020 war and ceasefire agreement.\nOn 27 September 2020, a new war erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The United Nations strongly condemned the conflict and called on both sides to deescalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay.\nThe war ended on 10 November 2020, when a trilateral ceasefire agreement was signed among Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia. According to the ceasefire agreement, Azerbaijan regained all of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and capturing one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh proper, including Shusha and Hadrut.\nBlockade (2022\u20132023).\nIn December 2022, Azerbaijanis claiming to be environmental activists blocked the Lachin corridor, the sole road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and the outside world. On 23 April 2023, Azerbaijani forces installed a checkpoint on the Lachin corridor. The blockade led to a humanitarian crisis for the population in Artsakh and imports of essential goods were blocked, as well as humanitarian convoys of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers, trapping the 120,000 residents of the region. Limited traffic had been conducted by Russian peacekeepers and the International Committee of the Red Cross to transport patients in need of medical care and provide humanitarian supplies. However, starting on 15 June 2023, Azerbaijan intensified the blockade, blocking all passage of food, fuel, and medicine from the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers through the Lachin corridor. On 19 September, Azerbaijan launched a military operation.\nAzerbaijani offensive (2023).\nOn 19 September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh. One day after the offensive started, on 20 September, an agreement on establishing a complete cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh was reached at the mediation of the Russian peacekeeping command in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan held a meeting with representatives of the Artsakh Armenian community on 21 September in Yevlakh to start the process of re-integrating the region into Azerbaijan. Ceasefire violations by Azerbaijan were nonetheless reported by both Artsakh and local residents in Stepanakert on 21 September. In the aftermath of the offensive, an exodus of Armenians from the region started. On 28 September 2023, the Republic of Artsakh agreed to dissolve itself by 1 January 2024.\nGeography.\nNagorno-Karabakh has a total area of . Approximately half of Nagorno-Karabakh terrain is over above sea level. The borders of Nagorno-Karabakh resemble a kidney bean with the indentation on the east side. It has tall mountain ridges along the northern edge and along the west and mountainous south. The part near the indentation of the kidney bean itself is a relatively flat valley, with the two edges of the bean, the districts of Martakert and Martuni, having flatlands as well. Other flatter valleys exist around the Sarsang reservoir, Hadrut, and the south. The entire region lies, on average, above sea level. Notable peaks include the border mountain Murovdag and the Great Kirs mountain chain in the junction of Shusha and Hadrut districts. The territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh forms a portion of the historic region of Karabakh, which lies between the rivers Kura and Araxes, and the modern Armenia-Azerbaijan border. Nagorno-Karabakh in its modern borders is part of the larger region of Upper Karabakh.\nNagorno-Karabakh does not directly border Armenia but is connected to the latter through the Lachin corridor, a mountain pass under the control of the Russian peacekeeping forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.\nThe major cities of the region are Stepanakert, which once served as the capital of the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Shusha, which lies partially in ruins. Vineyards, orchards, and mulberry groves for silkworms are developed in the valleys.\nEnvironment.\nNagorno-Karabakh's environment vary from steppe on the Kura lowland through dense forests of oak, hornbeam, and beech on the lower mountain slopes to birchwood and alpine meadows higher up. The region possesses numerous mineral springs and deposits of zinc, coal, lead, gold, marble, and limestone.\nDemographics.\nAntiquity \u2013 1918.\nHistorically, the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 then part of the province of Artsakh \u2014 were confirmed by Ancient Greek and Roman sources \"long before our era\" to be Armenian. In the early 15th century, German traveller Johann Schiltberger after visiting the region stated that \"although the Muslims had taken possession of Karabagh, there were still Armenian villages in the region\". Historian Victor Schnirelmann writes that \"In the mid-18th century, \u2026 Turkic tribes \u2026 gained access to the highland territories [of Karabakh] and began to settle in Shusha \u2026 by the end of the 18th century, a substantial number of its former Armenian inhabitants had left Nagorny Karabagh. Just at the turn of the 19th century, the Turkic population significantly outnumbered the local Armenians, but this only lasted \u2026 [until the] end of the 1820s, [when] the Armenians began to come back to Karabagh, and they accounted for the majority of its population by the mid-19th century\". Edmund Herzig and Marina Kurkchiyan present an alternative view that \"Armenians had already been a majority in some areas such as mountainous Karabagh\", compared to the Yerevan province which had \"regained an Armenian majority for the first time in several hundred years.\"\nAccording to an 1823 Russian survey published in Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi) in 1866, Armenians made up 97 percent of the population in the five districts (\"mahals\") of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus proving, contrary to claims in Azerbaijani historiography, that Armenians formed an overwhelming majority of Nagorno-Karabakh prior to 1828. Historian George Bournoutian writes that Russian statistics from 1810 show that Armenians made up 21 percent of the Karabakh region's population; In 1823, the Armenian population of Karabakh had increased by 30 percent \"after the return of those who had fled the region\", and by 1832, the Armenian population had increased to one-third of Karabakh. Moreover, the \"one-third\" of the population of Karabakh composed of Armenians resided in one-third of the territory of Karabakh, the mountainous territory (i.e. Nagorno-Karabakh), where they \"constituted an overwhelming majority of the population.\"\n1918\u20131920.\nAccording to Armenian sources, the \"historical Nagorno-Karabakh\" region had a population of 300,000\u2013330,000 in 1918\u20131920, rising to 700,000\u2013800,000 by 1988. As a result of \"Turkish-Azerbaijani aggression\", the region's population declined by 20 percent in 1918\u20131920. In this period, Azerbaijani forces carried out massacres against Armenians in Ghaibalishen, Jamilli, Karkijahan, and Pahlul (600\u2013700 dead), Stepanakert (several hundred dead), and Shusha (several hundred to 12,000 dead). As a result of the Shusha massacre, 5,000\u20136,000 Armenians were displaced to the regions of Varanda and Dizak. By 11 April 1920, some thirty villages in Nagorno-Karabakh had been \"devastated\" by Azerbaijani forces as a result of the uprising, leaving 25,000 homeless (including nearly 6,000 refugees from Shusha).\n1921\u20131987.\n1923 statistics indicate that the NKAO was 94.8 percent Armenian, numbering 149,600, whilst the Azerbaijani population numbered 7,700. Historian Cory Welt writes of a \"discrepancy\" of the Armenian population jumping by over 25,000 individuals between the 1921 and 1923 censuses, also pointing out that the Armenian population declined to 111,700 in 1926, thus indicating an \"unexplained drop\" of 38,000 individuals. In the 1920s, the NKAO had a population of 131,500 people, 94.4 percent (124,136) of whom were ethnic Armenians and only 5.6 percent (7,364) of whom were ethnic Azerbaijanis. In 1933, Nagorno-Karabakh had a population of 147,308, 10,751 (7.3 percent) of whom were urban dwellers, and 136,557 (92.7 percent) of whom were rural residents. On 1 January 1973, the oblast had a population of 153,000.\nDiscrimination and stagnation.\nWhilst the region was a part of the Azerbaijan SSR, the Armenian share of the population dropped from 94.7 to 76.9 percent, whilst the Azerbaijani share of the population quadrupled from 5.1 to 21.5 percent as a result of \"migratory influx\" \u2014 indicative of the socio-economic difficulties local Armenians experienced under Soviet Azerbaijani leadership which led them to emigrate from Karabakh. Emeritus professor of law M. Cherif Bassiouni writes of the stagnation of the Armenian population \"due to the discriminatory policies of Azerbaijani authorities that compelled Armenians to emigrate\"; also adding that 600,000 Armenians from Karabakh reside in Armenia and the countries of the CIS. According to historian Deon Geldenhuys, \"[t]his was due to Baku's deliberate promotion of Azerbaijani settlement in Karabagh as part of a policy of 'cultural de-Armenization' of the region\"; further adding that Azerbaijan \"neglected the economic needs of the territory\". Stuart J. Kaufman, a professor of political science and international relations, writes of the difficulties of Karabakh Armenians:\u2026 Armenian-language education was not easily available, Armenian history was not taught at all, and those who went to Armenia for training were discriminated against in competing for jobs in the province, \u2026 Underinvestment in the region\u2014also blamed on Baku\u2014meant less economic development and poor infrastructure even by Soviet standards, and therefore fewer jobs overall, especially for Armenians. Cultural ties with Armenia were strangled in red tape in Baku, and a decision to make Armenian-language television available in the region was left unimplemented. One result of these policies was a continuing exodus of Armenians from Karabagh in search of greener pastures.\n1988\u2013present.\nFollowing the Sumgait pogrom and the exodus of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, Azerbaijanis in Stepanakert and Armenians in Shusha were expelled in September 1988. As local Armenian forces gained possession of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts (amounting to 14 percent of the internationally recognised territory of Azerbaijan) during the First Nagorno-Karabakh war, hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis were expelled from their lands. During the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan regained control over the surrounding districts and southern parts of the former NKAO, thus displacing approximately 70,000 Armenians.\nTransport.\nAir.\nIn the post-Soviet era, Stepanakert Airport, the region's only airport, has not seen scheduled flights.\nRail.\nDuring the rule of the Soviet Union, the Yevlakh\u2013Aghdam\u2013Stepanakert railway line connected the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with the main part of Azerbaijan. In 1993, After the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the abandonment of Aghdam, the line's service was cut back to service only between Yevlax and K\u0259t\u0259lparaq, without any section in Nagorno-Karabakh. Services were restored in August 2025. The former line between K\u0259t\u0259lparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.\nIn land controlled by the former Republic of Artsakh, the (Tbilisi\u2013Gyumri\u2013)Yerevan\u2013Nakhchivan\u2013Horadiz\u2013Shirvan(\u2013Baku) main railway was also dismantled between Ordubad and Horadiz, as well as a branch-line from Mincivan to the Armenian city of Kapan. Currently, the Azerbaijani trains only travel to Horadiz. The railway at the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic still operates, but it is separated from the main Azerbaijani lines, and only has a connection to Iran. Construction of a new Horadiz-Agbend line began in 2023, with the first section completed in September 2025.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a professor at University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, and MIT Sloan School of Management.\nEarly life and education.\nModigliani was born on 18 June 1918 in Rome to the Jewish family of a pediatrician father and a voluntary social worker mother.\nHe entered university at the age of seventeen, enrolling in the faculty of Law at the Sapienza University of Rome. In his second year at Sapienza, his submission to a nationwide contest in economics sponsored by the official student organization of the state, won first prize and Modigliani received an award from the hand of Benito Mussolini.\nHe wrote several essays for the fascist magazine \"Lo Stato\" where he showed an inclination for the fascist ideological currents critical of liberalism.\nAmong his early works in Fascist Italy was an article about the organization and management of production in a socialist economy, written in Italian and arguing the case for socialism along lines laid out by earlier market socialists like Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange.\nBut, that early enthusiasm evaporated soon after the passage of racial laws in Italy. In 1938, Modigliani left Italy for Paris together with his then-girlfriend, Serena Calabi, to join her parents there. After briefly returning to Rome to defend his \"laurea\" thesis at the city's university, he obtained his diploma on 22 July 1939, and returned to Paris.\nThe same year, they all immigrated to the United States and he enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research. His Ph.D. dissertation, an elaboration and extension of John Hicks' IS\u2013LM model, was written under the supervision of Jacob Marschak and Abba Lerner, in 1944, and is considered \"ground breaking.\"\nCareer.\nFrom 1942 to 1944, Modigliani taught at Columbia University and Bard College as an instructor in economics and statistics. In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1948, he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty. From 1952 to 1962, he was a member of the Carnegie Mellon University faculty.\nIn 1962, he joined the faculty of MIT, as an Institute Professor.\nContributions to economic theory.\nModigliani, beginning in the 1950s, was an originator of the life-cycle hypothesis, which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy. The hypothesis that consumers aim for a stable level of consumption throughout their lifetime (for example by saving during their working years and then spending during their retirement).\nThe rational expectations hypothesis is considered by economists to originate in the paper written by Modigliani and Emile Grunberg in 1954.\nWhen he was a member of the Carnegie Mellon University faculty, he formulated in 1958, along with Merton Miller, the Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem for corporate finance. The theorem posits that, under certain assumptions, the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by equity (selling shares) or by debt (borrowing money), meaning that the debt-to-equity ratio is unimportant for private firms.\nIn the early 1960s, his response, co-authored with Albert Ando, to the 1963 paper of Milton Friedman and David I. Meiselman, initiated the so-called \"monetary/fiscal policy debate\" among economists, which went on for more than sixty years.\nIn 1975, Modigliani, in a paper whose co-author was his former student Lucas Papademos, introduced the concept of the \"NIRU\", the non-inflationary rate of unemployment, ostensibly an improvement over the \"natural rate of unemployment\" concept. The terms refer to a level of unemployment below which inflation rises.\nIn 1997, Modigliani and his granddaughter, Leah Modigliani, developed what is now called the \"Modigliani Risk-Adjusted Performance,\" a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of an investment portfolio that was derived from the Sharpe ratio, adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of a benchmark, e.g. the \"market.\"\nAppointments and awards.\nIn October 1985, Modigliani was awarded the Nobel prize in Economics \"for his pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets.\"\nIn 1985, Modigliani received MIT's James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award. In 1997, he received an \"honoris causa\" degree in Management Engineering from the University of Naples Federico II in 1997.\nLate in his life, Modigliani became a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security organization, formerly \"Economists Allied for Arms Reduction\" and was considered an \"influential adviser\": in the late 1960s, on a contract with the Federal Reserve, he designed the \"MIT-Pennsylvania-Social Science Research Council\" model, a tool that \"guided monetary policy in Washington for many decades.\"\nA collection of Modigliani's papers is housed at Duke University's Rubenstein Library.\nCriticism.\nModigliani's work on fiscal policy came under criticism from followers of Post-Keynesian economics, who disputed the \"Keynesianism\" of his viewpoints, pointing out his contribution to the NAIRU concept, as well as his general stance on fiscal deficits. The Modigliani-Miller theorem implies that, for a closed economy, state borrowing is merely deferred taxation, since state spending can be financed only by \"printing money\", taxation, or borrowing, and therefore monetary financing of state spending implies the subsequent imposition of a so-called \"inflation tax,\" which ostensibly has the same effect on permanent income as explicit taxation.\nNonetheless, they acknowledged his dissenting voice on the issue of unemployment, in which Modigliani concurred early on with heterodox economists that Europe-wide unemployment in the late 20th century was caused by the lack of demand induced by austerity policies.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1939, while they were in Paris, Modigliani married Serena Calabi. They had two children, Andre and Sergio Modigliani.\nModigliani died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2003, while still working at MIT, and teaching until the last months of his life. He was 85. Serena Modigliani-Calabi, active to the end in progressive politics, most notably with the League of Women Voters, and an outspoken believer in participatory democracy, died in 2008.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65228", "revid": "6908984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65228", "title": "Saving", "text": "Income which is not immediately spent or otherwise used for consumption\nSaving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. In economics, a broader definition is any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs.\nMethods of saving include putting money in, for example, a savings account, a pension account, an investment fund, or kept as cash. In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher. Saving does not automatically include interest.\n\"Saving\" differs from \"savings\". The former refers to the act of not consuming one's assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one's assets in the form of cash. Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to \"saving\" as \"savings\".\nIn different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. For example, the part of a person's income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as \"saving\" unless the institutions and people who receive them save them.\nSaving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter. By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth.\nHowever, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. However, savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to a loan (interest-free) to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan.\nIn a primitive agricultural economy, savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. If the whole crop were consumed the economy would convert to hunting and gathering the next season.\nInterest rates.\nClassical economics posited that interest rates would adjust to equate saving and investment, avoiding a pile-up of inventories (general overproduction). A rise in saving would cause a fall in interest rates, stimulating investment, hence always investment would equal saving.\nBut John Maynard Keynes argued that neither saving nor investment was very responsive to interest rates (i.e. that both were interest-inelastic) so that large interest rate changes were needed to re-equate them after one changed. Furthermore, it was the demand for and supplies of stocks of money that determined interest rates in the short run. Thus, saving could exceed investment for significant amounts of time, causing a general glut and a recession.\nSaving in personal finance.\nWithin personal finance, the act of \"saving\" corresponds to nominal \"preservation\" of money for future use. A savings account paying interest is typically used to hold money for future needs, \"i.e.\" an emergency fund, to make a capital purchase (car, house, vacation, etc.) or to give to someone else (children, tax bill etc.). Cash savings accounts are considered to have minimal risk. In the United States, all banks are required to have deposit insurance, typically issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC. In extreme cases, a bank failure can cause deposits to be lost as it happened at the start of the Great Depression. The FDIC has prevented that from happening ever since.\nWithin personal finance, money used to purchase stocks, put in an investment fund or used to buy any asset where there is an element of capital risk is deemed an investment. This distinction is important as the investment risk can cause a capital loss when an investment is realized, unlike cash saving(s). \nIn many instances the terms saving and investment are used interchangeably. For example, many deposit accounts are labeled as \"investment accounts\" by banks for marketing purposes. As a rule of thumb, if money is \"invested\" in cash, then it is savings. If money is used to purchase some asset that is hoped to increase in value over time, but that may fluctuate in market value, then it is an investment.\nSaving in economics.\nIn economics, saving is defined as after-tax income minus consumption. The fraction of income saved is called the average propensity to save, while the fraction of an increment to income that is saved is called the marginal propensity to save. The rate of saving is directly affected by the general level of interest rates. The capital markets equilibrate the sum of (personal) saving, government surpluses, and net exports to physical investment.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien's legendarium\nValinor (Quenya\": Land of the Valar\"), the Blessed Realm, or the Undying Lands is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the home of the immortal Valar and Maiar on the continent of Aman, far to the west of Middle-earth; he used the name Aman mainly to mean Valinor. It includes Eldamar, the land of the Elves, who as immortals are permitted to live in Valinor.\nThe name \"the Undying Lands\" does not mean that the land itself causes mortals to live forever. Generally, only immortal beings are allowed to reside there. Exceptions are made for the surviving bearers of the One Ring: Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, who dwell there for a time, and the dwarf Gimli.\nTolkien's myth of the attempt of N\u00famenor to capture Aman has been likened to the biblical Tower of Babel and the ancient Greek Atlantis, and the resulting destruction in both cases. They note, too, that a mortal's stay in Valinor is only temporary, not conferring immortality, just as, in medieval Christian theology, the Earthly Paradise is only a preparation for the Celestial Paradise that is above.\nOthers have compared the account of the beautiful Elvish part of the Undying Lands to the place dreamed of in the Middle English poem \"Pearl\", and stated that the closest literary equivalents of Tolkien's descriptions of these lands are the \"imrama\" Celtic tales such as those about Saint Brendan from the early Middle Ages. The Christian theme of good and light (from Valinor) opposing evil and dark (from Mordor) has also been discussed.\nGeography.\nPhysical.\nValinor lies in Aman (\"Unmarred\"), a continent on the west of Belegaer, the ocean to the west of Middle-earth. Ekkaia, the encircling sea, surrounds both Aman and Middle-earth. Tolkien wrote that the name \"Aman\" was \"chiefly used as the name of the land in which the Valar dwelt\". The Pel\u00f3ri mountains run along the east coast; their highest peak is Taniquetil. Tolkien created no detailed maps of Aman; those drawn by Karen Wynn Fonstad, based on Tolkien's rough sketch of Arda's landmasses and seas, show Valinor about wide, west to east (from the Great Sea to the Outer Sea), and about long north to south. The continent of Aman extends from the Arctic latitudes of the Helcarax\u00eb to the subpolar southern region of Arda \u2013 about .\n\"Eldamar\" is \"Elvenhome\", the \"coastal region of Aman, settled by the Elves\", wrote Tolkien. Eldamar was the true Eldarin name of Aman. In \"The Hobbit\" it is named \"Faerie\". The land is well-wooded, as Finrod \"walk[ed] with his father under the trees in Eldamar\" and the Teleri Elves have timber to build their ships. The city of the Teleri, on the north shore of the Bay is Alqualond\u00eb, the Haven of the Swans, whose halls and mansions are made of pearl. The harbour is entered through a natural arch of rock, and the beaches are strewn with gems given by the Noldor Elves. In the bay is the island of Tol Eress\u00eba.\n\"Calacirya\" (Quenya: \"Light Cleft\", for the light of the Two Trees that streams through the pass into the world beyond) is the pass in the Pel\u00f3ri mountains where the Elven city Tirion is set. It is close to the Girdle of Arda (the Equator). After the hiding of Valinor, this is the only gap through the mountains of Aman.\nIn the extreme north-east, beyond the Pel\u00f3ri, is the Helcarax\u00eb, a vast ice sheet that joins the two continents of Aman and Middle-earth before the War of Wrath. \nTo prevent anyone from reaching the main part of Valinor's east coast by sea, the Valar create the Shadowy Seas, and within these seas they set a long chain of islands called the Enchanted Isles.\nPolitical.\nValinor is the home of the Valar (singular Vala), spirits that often take humanoid form, sometimes called \"gods\" by the Men of Middle-earth. Other residents of Valinor include the related but less powerful spirits, the Maiar, and most of the Elves.\nEach Vala has his or her own region of the land. The Mansions of Manw\u00eb and Varda, two of the most powerful spirits, stands upon the top of Taniquetil. Yavanna, the Vala of Earth, Growth, and Harvest, resides in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the land, west of the Pel\u00f3ri. Nearby are the mansions of Yavanna's spouse, Aul\u00eb the Smith. Orom\u00eb, the Vala of the Hunt, lives in the Woods of Orom\u00eb to the north-east of the pastures. Nienna lives in the far west of the island. Just south of Nienna's home, and to the north of the pastures, are the Halls of Mandos; he lives with his spouse Vair\u00eb the weaver. To the east of the Halls of Mandos is the Isle of Est\u00eb, in the lake of L\u00f3rellin within the Gardens of L\u00f3rien.\nIn east-central Valinor at the Girdle of Arda is Valmar, the capital of Valinor (also called Valimar, the City of Bells), the residence of the Valar and the Maiar in Valinor. The first house of the Elves, the Vanyar, settles there as well. The mound of Ezellohar, on which stand the Two Trees, and M\u00e1hanaxar, the Ring of Doom, are outside Valmar. Farther east is the Calacirya, the only easy pass through the Pel\u00f3ri, a huge mountain range fencing Valinor on three sides, created to keep Morgoth's forces out. The city of the Noldor (and for a time the Vanyar Elves also) is Tirion, built on the hill of T\u00fana, inside the Calacirya mountain pass; it is just north of Taniquetil, facing both the Two Trees and the starlit seas.\nIn the northern inner foothills of the Pel\u00f3ri, far to the north of Valmar, is F\u00ebanor's city of Formenos, built after his banishment from Tirion.\nHistory.\nYears of the Trees.\nValinor is first established on the western continent Aman when Melkor (a Vala later named Morgoth, \"the black foe\", by the Elves) destroys the Valar's original home on the island Almaren in primeval Middle-earth, ending the Years of the Lamps. To defend their new home from attack, they raise the Pel\u00f3ri Mountains. They also establish Valimar, the future dwelling place of many of Aman\u2019s Elven residents, such as the Vanyar, a more major the radiant Two Trees, and their dwelling-places. Valinor is said to surpass Almaren in beauty. Later, the Valar hear of the awakening of the Elves in Middle-earth, where Melkor is unopposed. They propose to bring the Elves to the safety of Valinor, but to do that, they need to get Melkor out of the way. A war is fought, and Melkor's stronghold Utumno is destroyed. Then, many Elves come to Valinor, and establish their cities Tirion and Alqualond\u00eb, beginning Valinor's age of glory. Melkor comes back to Valinor as a prisoner, and after three Ages is brought before the Valar; he sues for pardon, vowing to assist the Valar and make amends for the hurts he has done. Manw\u00eb grants him pardon, but confines him within Valmar to remain under watch. After his release, Melkor starts planting seeds of dissent in the minds of the Elves, including between F\u00ebanor and his brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin. F\u00ebanor uses some of the light of the Two Trees to forge the three Silmarils, beautiful, unmarrable, and irreplaceable jewels.\nThe Darkening of Valinor.\nBelatedly, the Valar learn what Melkor has done. Knowing that he is discovered, Melkor goes to the home of the Noldor's High King Finw\u00eb, kills him and steals the Silmarils. He then destroys the Two Trees with the help of Ungoliant, plunging Valinor into darkness, the Long Night, relieved only by stars. Melkor and Ungoliant flee to Middle-earth.\nThe Hiding of Valinor.\nThe Valar manage to save one last luminous flower from one of the Two Trees, Telperion, and one last luminous fruit from the other, Laurelin. These become the Moon and the Sun. The Valar carry out further titanic labours to improve the defences of Valinor. They raise the Pel\u00f3ri mountains to even greater and sheerer heights. Off the coast, eastwards of Tol Eress\u00eba, they create the Shadowy Seas and their Enchanted Isles; both the Seas and the Isles present numerous perils to anyone attempting to get to Valinor by sea.\nLater history.\nFor centuries, Valinor took no part in the struggles between the Noldor and Morgoth in Middle-earth. But near the end of the First Age, when the Noldor are in total defeat, the mariner E\u00e4rendil convinces the Valar to make a last attack on Morgoth. A mighty host of Maiar, Vanyar and the remaining Noldor in Valinor destroy Morgoth's gigantic army and his stronghold Angband, and cast Morgoth into the void.\nDuring the Second Age, the Valar create the island of N\u00famenor as a reward to the Edain, Men who had fought alongside the Noldor. Centuries later the kingdom of N\u00famenor grows so powerful and so arrogant that Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the twenty-fifth and last king, dares to attempt an invasion of Valinor. When the creator Eru Il\u00favatar responds to the call of the Valar, N\u00famenor sinks into the sea, and Aman is removed beyond the reach of the Men of Arda. Arda itself becomes spherical, and is left for Men to govern. The Elves can go to Valinor only by the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the spheres of the earth.\nAnalysis.\nParadise.\nKeith Kelly and Michael Livingston, writing in \"Mythlore\", note that Frodo's final destination, mentioned at the end of \"The Lord of the Rings\", is Aman, the Undying Lands. In Tolkien's mythology, they write, the islands of Aman are initially just the dwelling-places of the Valar (in the Ages of the Trees, while the rest of the world lies in darkness). The Valar help The One, Eru Il\u00favatar, to create the world. Gradually some of the immortal and ageless Elves are allowed to live there as well, sailing across the ocean to the West. After the fall of N\u00famenor and the reshaping of the world, Aman becomes the place \"\"between\" (sic) Over-heaven and Middle-earth\". It is accessible only in special circumstances like Frodo's, allowed to come to Aman through the offices of the Valar and of Gandalf, one of the Valar's emissaries, the Istari or Wizards. However, Aman is not, they write, exactly paradise. Firstly, being there does not confer immortality, contrary to what the N\u00famen\u00f3reans supposed. Secondly, those mortals like Frodo who are allowed to go there will eventually choose to die. They note that in another of Tolkien's writings, \"Leaf by Niggle\", understood to be a journey through Purgatory (the Catholic precursor stage to paradise), Tolkien avoids describing paradise at all. They suggest that to the Catholic Tolkien, it is impossible to describe Heaven, and it might be sacrilege to make the attempt. The Tolkien scholar Michael D. C. Drout comments that Tolkien's accounts of Eldamar \"give us a good idea of his conceptions of absolute beauty\". He notes that these resemble the paradise described in the Middle English poem \"Pearl\".\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey adds that in 1927 Tolkien wrote a poem, \"The Nameless Land\", in the complex stanza-form of \"Pearl\". It spoke of a land further away than paradise, and more beautiful than the Irish T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, the deathless otherworld. Kelly and Livingston similarly draw on \"Pearl\", noting that it states that \"fair as was the hither shore, far lovelier was the further land\" where the Dreamer could not pass. So, they write, each stage looks like paradise, until the traveller realises that beyond it lies something even more paradisiacal, glimpsed and beyond description. The Earthly Paradise can be described; Aman, the Undying Lands, can thus be compared to the Garden of Eden, the paradise that the Bible says once existed upon Earth before the Fall of Man. The Celestial Paradise of Tolkien's \"Leaf by Niggle\" lies \"beyond (or above)\", as it does, they note, in Dante's \"Paradiso\". Matthew Dickerson notes that Valinor resembles the Garden of Eden in having two trees.\nGood against evil.\nThe scholar of English literature Marjorie Burns writes that one of the female Vala, Varda (Elbereth to the Elves) is sung to by the Elf-queen of Middle-earth Galadriel. Burns notes that Varda \"sits far off in Valinor on Oioloss\u00eb\", looking from her mountain-peak tower in Aman towards Middle-earth and the Dark Tower of Sauron in Mordor: she notes Timothy O'Neill's view that the white benevolent feminine symbol opposes the evil masculine symbol. Further, Burns suggests, Galadriel is an Elf from Valinor \"in the Blessed Realm\", bringing Varda's influence with her to Middle-earth. This is seen in the phial of light that she gives to Frodo, and that Sam uses to defeat the evil giant spider Shelob: Sam invokes Elbereth when he uses the phial. Burns comments that Sam's request to the \"Lady\" sounds distinctly Catholic, and that the \"female principle, embodied in Varda of Valinor and Galadriel of Middle-earth, most clearly represents the charitable Christian heart.\"\nOriginal sin.\nThe scholar of literature Richard Z. Gallant comments that while Tolkien made use of pagan Germanic heroism in his legendarium, and admired its Northern courage, he disliked its emphasis on \"overmastering pride\". This created a conflict in his writing. The pride of the Elves in Valinor resulted in a fall, analogous to the biblical fall of man. Tolkien described this by saying \"The first fruit of their fall was in Paradise [Valinor], the slaying of Elves by Elves\"; Gallant interprets this as an allusion to the fruit of the biblical tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the resulting exit from the Garden of Eden. The leading prideful elf is F\u00ebanor, whose actions, Gallant writes, set off the whole dark narrative of strife among the Elves described in \"The Silmarillion\"; the Elves fight and leave Valinor for Middle-earth.\n\"Beowulf\".\nThe passage at the start of the Old English poem \"Beowulf\" about Scyld Scefing contains a cryptic mention of \"\u00fe\u0101\" (\"those\") who have sent Scyld as a baby in a boat, presumably from across the sea, and to whom Scyld's body is returned in a ship funeral, the vessel sailing by itself. Shippey suggests that Tolkien may have seen in this both an implication of a Valar-like group who behave much like gods, and a glimmer of his Old Straight Road, the way across the sea to Valinor forever closed to mortal Men by the remaking of the world after N\u00famenor's attack on Valinor.\nLost home.\nPhillip Joe Fitzsimmons compares \"The Silmarillion's\" faraway Valinor, forbidden to Men and lost to the Elves, though it constantly calls to them to return, to Tolkien's fellow-Inkling, Owen Barfield's \"lost home\". Barfield writes of the loss of \"an Edenic relationship with nature\", part of his theory that man's purpose is to serve as \"the Earth's self-consciousness\". Barfield argued that rationalism creates individualism, \"unhappy isolation ... [and] the loss of a mutual relationship with nature.\" Further, Barfield believed that ancient civilisations, as recorded in their languages, had a connection to and inner experience of nature, so that the modern situation represents a loss of that state of grace. Fitzsimmons states that the lost home motif recurs throughout Tolkien's writings. He does not suggest that Barfield influenced Tolkien, but that the ideas of the two men grew from \"the same time, place, and even social circle\".\nAtlantis, Babel.\nKelly and Livingston state that while Aman could be home to Elves as well as Valar, the same was not true of mortal Men. The \"prideful\" Men of N\u00famenor, imagining they could acquire immortality by capturing the physical lands of Aman, were punished by the destruction of their own island, which is engulfed by the sea, and the permanent removal of Aman \"from the circles of the world\". Kelly and Livingston note the similarity to the ancient Greek myth of Atlantis, the greatest human civilisation lost beneath the sea; and the resemblance to the biblical tale of the Tower of Babel, the hubristic and \"sacrilegious\" attempt by mortal men to climb up into God's realm.\nCeltic influence.\nThe scholar of English literature Paul H. Kocher writes that the Undying Lands of the Uttermost West including Eldamar and Valinor, is \"so far outside our experience that Tolkien can only ask us to take it completely on faith.\" Kocher comments that these lands have an integral place both geographically and spiritually in Middle-earth, and that their closest literary equivalents are the \"imrama\" Celtic tales from the early Middle Ages. The \"imrama\" tales describe how Irish adventurers such as Saint Brendan sailed the seas looking for the \"Land of Promise\". He notes that it is certain that Tolkien knew these stories, since in 1955 he wrote a poem, entitled \"Imram\", about Brendan's voyage.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled \u00d1oldor, meaning \"those with knowledge\" in his constructed language Quenya) are a kindred of Elves who migrate west to the blessed realm of Valinor from the continent of Middle-earth, splitting from other groups of Elves as they went. They then settle in the coastal region of Eldamar. The Dark Lord Morgoth murders their first leader, Finw\u00eb. The majority of the Noldor, led by Finw\u00eb's eldest son F\u00ebanor, then return to Beleriand in the northwest of Middle-earth. This makes them the only group to return and then play a major role in Middle-earth's history; much of \"The Silmarillion\" is about their actions. They are the second clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. \nAmong Elves, the Noldor show the greatest talents for intellectual pursuits, technical skills and physical strength, yet are prone to unchecked ambition and pride in their ability to create. Scholars such as Tom Shippey have commented that these attributes lead to their decline and fall, especially through F\u00ebanor who creates and covets the magical jewels, the Silmarils. Others including Dimitra Fimi have linked the Noldor to the mythical Irish warriors and sorcerers, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann.\nEtymology and origins.\n\"Noldor\" or \"\u00d1oldor\" means those who have great knowledge and understanding. The Noldor are called \"Golodhrim\" or \"G\u00f3dhellim\" in Sindarin, and \"Goldui\" by another kindred of Elves, the Teleri of Tol Eress\u00eba. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \"Noldo\" and the adjective is \"Noldorin\", which is also the name of their dialect of Quenya.\nIn early drafts of his legendarium, Tolkien used the name \"Gnomes\" for the group later called the Noldor, and their language, the Noldorin dialect of Sindarin, was called \"Gnomish\" or \"Noldorin\". Tolkien had chosen \"gnome\" thinking that it derived from the Greek \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"gn\u014dsis\" (knowledge), and hence was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common association with garden gnomes, Tolkien abandoned the term.\nAttributes.\nThe Noldor are counted among the Calaquendi (\"Elves of the Light\") or High Elves, as they had seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. The most distinctive aspect of Noldorin culture is their fondness for craftwork and skill of their workmanship, which ranges from lapidary to embroidery to the craft of language. Among the Elven kindreds, the Noldor are the most beloved by the Vala Aul\u00eb, who originally taught them craftsmanship. As a result of their renown as the most skilled of all peoples in lore, warfare and crafts, the Noldor are sometimes called the \"Deep Elves\". Following their return to Middle-earth at the end of the First Age, the Noldor build great cities within their realms in the land of Beleriand, such as Nargothrond and Gondolin.\nWhen the Noldor are in Valinor they speak Quenya; in Middle-earth they also speak Sindarin. Among the wisest of the Noldor is R\u00famil, creator of the first writing system, Sarati, and author of many books of lore. F\u00ebanor, son of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel, is the greatest of their craftsmen, \"mightiest in skill of word and of hand\", and creator of the Silmarils. F\u00ebanor also devised the Tengwar script.\nTolkien gave some Noldorin leaders like Finw\u00eb and Fingolfin their own heraldic devices, carefully distinguishing their ranks by the number of points touching the rim.\nThe Noldor are the proudest of the Elves, as they vaunt in particular their ability to create: in the words of the Sindar, \"they needed room to quarrel in\". Equally, this causes in them an arrogance that plagues their history and causes them great suffering.\nThe Noldor are tall and physically strong. Their hair colour is usually a very dark shade of brown; Tolkien hesitated over whether their hair might be black. Red and even white (\"silver\") hair occasionally exists among some individuals. Their eyes are usually grey or dark, with the inner light of Valinor reflected in their eyes; the Sindarin term \"Lachend\" means \"flame-eyed\".\nFictional history.\nEarly history.\n\"The Silmarillion\" tells the history of the Noldor. The Elves are placed, asleep, in Cuivi\u00e9nen on Middle-earth by the creator, Il\u00favatar. According to Elven-lore, the Noldor as a clan is founded by Tata, the second Elf to awaken, his spouse Tati\u00eb and their 54 companions. The fate of Tata and Tati\u00eb is not recorded; it is Finw\u00eb who leads the Noldor to Valinor, where he becomes their King, and their chief dwelling-place is the city of Tirion upon T\u00fana. In Valinor \"great became their knowledge and their skill; yet even greater was their thirst for more knowledge, and in many things they soon surpassed their teachers. They were changeful in speech, for they had great love of words, and sought ever to find names more fit for all things they knew or imagined.\"\nThe Noldor draw the ire of the rogue Vala Melkor, who envies their prosperity and, most of all, the Silmarils crafted by F\u00ebanor. So he often goes among them, offering advice, and the Noldor listen, being eager for knowledge. But Melkor sows lies, and in the end the peace in Tirion is poisoned. F\u00ebanor, having assaulted his half-brother Fingolfin and thus broken the laws of the Valar, is banished to his fortress Formenos, and with him goes Finw\u00eb his father. Fingolfin remains as the ruler of the Noldor of Tirion.\nWith the aid of the spider spirit Ungoliant, Melkor destroys the Two Trees of Valinor, slays Finw\u00eb, steals the Silmarils and departs from Aman. Driven by vengeance, F\u00ebanor rebels against the Valar and rouses the Noldor to leave Valinor, follows Melkor to Middle-earth and wages war against him for the recovery of the Silmarils. Though the greater part of the Noldor still hold Fingolfin as the rightful leader, they follow F\u00ebanor out of kinship and to avenge Finw\u00eb. F\u00ebanor and his sons swear an oath of vengeance against Melkor (whom F\u00ebanor renames Morgoth) or anyone who comes into possession of a Silmaril.\nFlight of the Noldor: exile to Middle-earth.\nIn the port city of Alqualond\u00eb, the Noldor hosts led by F\u00ebanor demand that the Falmari, those of the Teleri who had come to Valinor, let them use their ships. When the Teleri refuse, F\u00ebanor's forces take the ships by force, committing the first Kinslaying. A messenger from the Valar comes later and delivers the Prophecy of the North, pronouncing the Doom of Mandos on the Noldor for the Kinslaying, and warning that a grim fate awaits them should they proceed with their rebellion. Some of the Noldor who had had no hand in the Kinslaying, including Finarfin, son of Finw\u00eb and Indis, return to Valinor, and the Valar forgive them. The majority of the Noldor, some blameless for the Kinslaying, remain determined to leave Valinor for Middle-earth. Among them are Finarfin's children, Finrod and Galadriel, who choose to follow Fingolfin instead of F\u00ebanor and his sons.\nThe Noldor cross the sea to Middle-earth in the stolen ships, leaving Fingolfin and his people behind. Upon his arrival in Middle-earth, F\u00ebanor has the ships burned. When the Noldor led by Fingolfin discover their betrayal, they go far to the north and cross the sea at the Grinding Ice or Helcarax\u00eb. Suffering substantial losses along the way, this greatly adds to their animosity for F\u00ebanor and his sons. The deaths of the Two Trees and the departure of the Noldor out of the Undying Lands mark the end of the Years of the Trees, and the beginning of the Years of the Sun, when the Valar create the Moon and the Sun out of Telperion's last flower and Laurelin's last fruit. F\u00ebanor's company is soon attacked by Morgoth in the Battle under Stars or \"Dagor-nuin-Giliath\". F\u00ebanor himself is mortally wounded by Balrogs, who had issued forth from Morgoth's fortress of Angband and captured his eldest son Maedhros.\nFingon, the eldest son of Fingolfin, saves Maedhros (his half-cousin) from captivity, which settles the rift between their houses for a time. Maedhros is due to succeed F\u00ebanor, but he regrets his part in the Kinslaying as well as the abandonment of Fingolfin, and leaves the leadership of the Noldor in Middle-earth to his uncle Fingolfin, who becomes High King of the Noldor. Maedhros's brothers dissent and begin to call themselves \"the Dispossessed\", paying little deference to Fingolfin or his successors, and are still determined to fulfil the oath they swore to recover the Silmarils on behalf of their father. \nIn Beleriand, in the north-west of Middle-earth, the Noldor make alliances with the Sindar and later with Men of the Three Houses of the Edain. Fingolfin reigns long in the land of Hithlum, and his younger son Turgon builds the hidden city of Gondolin. The Sons of F\u00ebanor rule the lands in Eastern Beleriand, while Finrod Finarfin's son is the King of Nargothrond and his brothers Angrod and Aegnor hold Dorthonion. Fingolfin's reign is marked by warfare against Morgoth; in the year 60 of the First Age, after their victory in the battle of Dagor Aglareb, the Noldor start the Siege of Angband, the great fortress of Morgoth. In 455 the siege is broken by Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach, or Battle of Sudden Flame, in which the north-eastern Elvish realms are conquered, with the exception of Maedhros' fortress at Himring. A man, Barahir, saves Finrod's life; Finrod gives him a ring which had been made in Valinor. Fingolfin in despair rides to Angband and challenges Morgoth to single combat, dealing the Dark Lord seven wounds before perishing. Fingolfin is succeeded by his eldest son Fingon the Valiant, who becomes the second High King of the Noldor in Beleriand.\nIn 472, Maedhros organises an attack on Morgoth, which leads to the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. The Noldor and their allies are utterly defeated when they are betrayed by the Easterlings and surrounded by Morgoth's forces. Fingon is killed by Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs, and is succeeded by his brother Turgon. Morgoth scatters the remaining forces led by the sons of F\u00ebanor, and in 495 Nargothrond too is conquered. Turgon had already withdrawn to Gondolin, which had been kept hidden from both Morgoth and other Elves; his realm is betrayed to Morgoth by his nephew Maeglin in 510. Turgon dies during the Fall of Gondolin, though his daughter Idril leads many of his people to escape and find their way south. Gil-galad, son of Fingon, succeeds Turgon and becomes the fourth and last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth.\nBetween 545 and 583, the War of Wrath is fought between Morgoth and the host of the Valar. As the result of the cataclysmic destruction from the war, Beleriand sinks into the sea, except for a part of Ossiriand later known as Lindon, and a few islands. The defeat of Morgoth marks the end of the First Age and the start of the Second, when most of the Noldor return to Aman, though some like Galadriel or Celebrimbor, grandson of F\u00ebanor, refuse the pardon of the Valar and remain in Middle-earth.\nSecond and Third Ages.\nGil-galad founds a new kingdom at Lindon and rules throughout the Second Age, longer than any of the High Kings before him. After Sauron re-emerges and manipulates Celebrimbor and the smiths of Eregion into forging the Rings of Power, he fortifies Mordor and begins the long war with the remaining Elves in Middle-earth. His forces attack Eregion, destroying it, but are repelled at Rivendell and Lindon. With the aid of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, the Noldor manage to defeat him for a time.\nIn the year 3319 of the Second Age, Sauron manipulates the N\u00famen\u00f3reans and their King, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, to rebel against the Valar. N\u00famenor is destroyed. Elendil escapes to the mainland with his sons An\u00e1rion and Isildur, who establish the realms of Arnor and Gondor. Gil-galad sets out for Mordor in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with Elendil's forces and defeats Sauron in the Siege of Barad-d\u00fbr, though Gil-galad himself perishes with no successors as High King of the Noldor. Among the lineal descendants of Finw\u00eb in Middle-earth, only Galadriel and some Half-elven remain.\nIn the Third Age, the Noldor in Middle-earth dwindle, and at the end of the Third Age the remaining Noldor depart to Valinor. In \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" Frodo meets a band of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion from the House of Finrod who are returning from a pilgrimage at the White Towers.\nHouse of Finw\u00eb.\nThe Sons of F\u00ebanor are (in the order of their birth) Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Caranthir, Amras, and Amrod.\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that the family tree of the House of Finw\u00eb is \"essential\", as Tolkien allocates character by ancestry; thus, F\u00ebanor is pure Noldor, and so excellent as a craftsman, but his half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin have Vanyar blood from their mother, Indis. They are accordingly less skilful as craftsmen, but superior \"in restraint and generosity\".\nAnalysis.\nTuatha D\u00e9 Danaan.\nScholars including Dimitra Fimi, Anne Kinniburgh, and John Garth have connected the Noldor with the Irish Tuatha D\u00e9 Danaan as a possible influence. The parallels are both thematic and direct. In Irish mythology, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danaan invade Ireland as a tall pale fair-haired race of immortal warriors and sorcerers. They have godlike attributes but human social organisation. They enter Ireland with what Kinniburgh calls a \"historical trajectory\", entering in triumph, living with a high status, and leaving diminished, just as the Noldor do in Middle-earth. They are semi-divine as Sons of Danu, just as the Noldor are counted among the first of the sentient races, the Children of Il\u00favatar. Their immortality keeps them from disease and the frailty of age, but not from death in battle, an exact parallel with the Noldor. Nuada Airgetl\u00e1m, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danaan's first high king, is killed by Balor of the Evil Eye; F\u00ebanor is killed by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Celebrimbor's name means \"Silver Hand\" in Sindarin, the same meaning as Nuada's epithet Airgetl\u00e1m in Irish Gaelic. Celebrimbor's making of powerful but dangerous rings, too, has been linked with the finding of a curse on a ring at the temple of Nodens, a Roman god whom Tolkien in his work as a philologist identified with Nuada. Like Nuada, Maedhros loses a hand.\nGermanic influence.\nThe Tolkien scholar Leslie A. Donovan notes that Tolkien's concept of exile, as principally exemplified by the Noldor, derives in part from Anglo-Saxon culture, in which he was an expert.\nThe medievalist Elizabeth Solopova makes a connection between Middle English and Tolkien's description of Finw\u00eb's first wife M\u00edriel as the most skilful of the Noldor at weaving and needlework; Solopova notes that Tolkien had proposed an etymology for the Middle English term \"burde\", meaning lady or damsel, linking it to Old English \"borde\", embroidery, and that he had given examples from both Old English and Old Norse where women were called weavers or embroiderers.\nSub-creation.\nShippey writes that Tolkien was himself fascinated with artefacts and their \"sub-creation\". He comments that in \"The Hobbit\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"The Silmarillion\", Tolkien consistently chooses to write about the \"restless desire to make things\". This is not quite, he notes, the same as the Christian sin of avarice or possessiveness. This made sense in the case of the Noldor, as for consistency their besetting sin ought not to be the same as Adam and Eve's, which was pride. In Valinor, Shippey writes, the equivalent of the Fall \"came when conscious creatures became 'more interested in their own creations than in God's'\", with F\u00ebanor's forging of the Silmarils. He adds that the smith-Vala Aul\u00eb is not only the patron of all craftsmen but the Vala most like Melkor, the first Dark Lord. The kinds of craftsmanship he encouraged among the Noldor was not only of physical things, but \"'those that make not, but seek only for the understanding of what is' \u2014 the philologists, one might say\", writes Shippey, including Tolkien's profession along with the Noldor's skill with letters and poetry. \nDecline and fall.\nThe Tolkien scholar Bradford Lee Eden states that in \"The Silmarillion\", Tolkien focused on the Noldor as their history is \"filled with the doom and fate so typical of medieval literature that determines the entire history of Middle-earth from the First Age to the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\" He notes that in many \"parallel stories and tales\" the fates of Elves and Men are tightly interwoven, leading inexorably to the decline and fading of the Elves and the rise of Men as the dominant race in the modern Earth. The Tolkien scholar Matthew Dickerson writes that the theft of the Silmarils by Morgoth leads F\u00ebanor and his sons into swearing their dreadful oath and leading the Noldor out of Valinor back to Middle-earth. This is, he comments, at once a free choice and a self-imposed exile.\nColonialism.\nThe Swedish archaeologist Martin Rundkvist writes that Tolkien's account of Finrod Felagund includes \"a transparently colonial passage\" where the Elf, having arrived in a new country, \"immediately takes up the White Man's Burden and spends a year educating the humans about his religious beliefs ('true knowledge'). They think this is great and become his feudal subjects. Then to avoid conflict with the Green-elves he re-settles the new arrivals in a thinly populated area ruled by some of his relatives.\"\nIn culture.\n\"Nightfall in Middle-Earth\", a 1998 studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, contained multiple references to the Noldor and the events they experience within the narrative of \"The Silmarillion\". For example, \"Face the Truth\" has Fingolfin tell how he crossed the icy Helcarax\u00eb, while in \"Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)\" he regrets having left Valinor; \"Battle of Sudden Flame\" recalls the battle of Dagor Bragollach, which marked the turning point of the Noldor's war against Morgoth in the Dark Lord's favour; \"The Dark Elf\" recounts the birth of Maeglin, the son of Fingolfin's daughter Aredhel and E\u00f6l the titular Dark Elf; \"Nom the Wise\" is an elegy by Beren to his friend Finrod Felagund. The Tolkien scholar Bradford Lee Eden writes that \"although one can assume that Tolkien was not a headbanger\", he finds that in the opinion of his students, the \"driving energy\" of the power metal sound is appropriate for the stories: \"The music conveys rage and despair, which fits lyrics such as 'The doom of the Noldor drew near/ The words of a banished king, \u201cI swear revenge!\u201d'\" Eden adds that this facilitates discussion of Tolkien's Christian view of the fall of man.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. Finw\u00eb is the first King of the Noldor Elves; he leads his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. His first wife is M\u00edriel, who, uniquely among immortal Elves, dies while giving birth to their only child F\u00ebanor, creator of the Silmarils; her spirit later serves the godlike Vala queen Vair\u00eb. Finw\u00eb is the first person to be murdered in Valinor: he is killed by the Dark Lord Morgoth, who is intent on stealing the Silmarils. The event sets off the Flight of the Noldor from Valinor back to Beleriand in Middle-earth, and its disastrous consequences.\nTolkien commented on the importance of the story of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel on his legendarium, stating that had Finw\u00eb chosen differently, the whole course of Middle-earth's history would have been better. Tolkien called M\u00edriel's decision to let go of life disastrous; he associated it with the Biblical Fall of man. Scholars have debated whether Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel were to blame for the subsequent disastrous history of the Elves in Middle-earth. They have remarked that M\u00edriel was extremely skilful in craftsmanship, and passed on her skill to her son F\u00ebanor, whose other name, Curufinw\u00eb, means \"Skill-Finw\u00eb\" in one of Tolkien's constructed languages, Quenya. They have commented, too, on the lasting consequences of M\u00edriel's death, through F\u00ebanor's uncontrolled and divisive actions.\nFictional history.\nIn Middle-earth.\nAmong the Elves who first awoke at Cuivi\u00e9nen, a bay on the Sea of Helcar in the East of Middle-earth, the Noldor are the \"Deep-Elves\", always interested in knowledge, skill, and understanding; their leader is Finw\u00eb. The godlike Valar ask the Elves to come and live with them in their blessed realm of Valinor. The Elves are doubtful about this, so the Vala Orom\u00eb picks three leaders of the Elves, Elw\u00eb, Finw\u00eb, and Ingw\u00eb, to come and see Valinor for themselves. Delighted by what they see, the three ambassadors return to their people and invite them to make the journey to Valinor. The Fair-Elves of Ingw\u00eb go and stay; the Deep-Elves of Finw\u00eb go, but many later return to Middle-earth; while the Elves of Elw\u00eb are divided, and though they set out together, many do not complete the journey. The ambassadors become the Kings of their respective peoples.\nIn Valinor.\nFinw\u00eb marries M\u00edriel, the most skilful of the Noldor in needlework and weaving. M\u00edriel gives birth to their only child, Curufinw\u00eb, commonly called F\u00ebanor; he inherits her skill, becoming the most gifted and brilliant of all the Noldor, the mightiest in crafts, especially the making of jewels.\nM\u00edriel, an immortal elf, is so exhausted by the birth, \"consumed in spirit and body\" by the fiery creative energy of her son F\u00ebanor, that she wilfully gives up her spirit. She thus becomes the first sentient being in the blessed realm of Aman to experience death. This leaves Finw\u00eb on his own, not through his own choice; such a thing had never occurred before, and he chooses to remarry. His second wife is Indis of the Vanyar, the Fair-Elves of Ingw\u00eb. She bears him two sons: Fingolfin and Finarfin, and two daughters: Findis and Lalwen, their names echoing his.\nF\u00ebanor comes to resent Finw\u00eb's other sons, his half-brothers; there is constant strife between them. F\u00ebanor makes the Silmarils, three star-like jewels that embody some of the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.\nDuring the Dark Lord Melkor's attempt to corrupt the Noldor, Finw\u00eb tries to exert a moderating influence over his people and lead them back to the Valar. When F\u00ebanor is exiled from the Elvish city of Tirion after he openly threatens Fingolfin, Finw\u00eb goes with him to their northern fortress, Formenos. There he is the first to be murdered in Valinor when Melkor, seeking the Silmarils, kills him at the doors of Formenos. This directly leads to the Flight of the Noldor, the disastrous rebellion of the Noldor against the Valar, which in turn leads the First Kinslaying, when Elves killed other Elves.\nIn the Halls of Mandos.\nAfter their deaths, Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel meet again in the Halls of Mandos, the place where the shades of dead Elves go in Aman. The Valar had allowed Finw\u00eb to remarry, given that M\u00edriel had made clear she would never again live in a body; they did not want an Elf to have two living wives. As with Elves killed in battle, the Valar offer Finw\u00eb the choice to live again; he decides instead to let M\u00edriel have this chance. M\u00edriel feels that there is no longer a place for her among the Noldor, since Finw\u00eb had remarried, and declines the offer. She chooses to become an eternal assistant to Vair\u00eb, the weaver of the godlike Valar: she helps to weave the tapestries of time for the duration of the world's existence.\nAnalysis.\nCreative power.\nMegan Fontenot, writing on \"Tor.com\", notes that when M\u00edriel says she will have no more children after the effort of having F\u00ebanor, Finw\u00eb \"becomes depressed\", but ultimately gets the Vala Manw\u00eb to do as M\u00edriel wishes, and let her go to the garden of L\u00f3rien, in the South of Aman, which is the realm of the Vala Irmo, the master of dreams. There she falls asleep and her spirit departs for the Halls of Mandos. Finw\u00eb visits her and calls her names, but she does not return. Fontenot comments that Tolkien's drafts of the tale of M\u00edriel are complex. One strand of Tolkien's accounts of her tells that her needlework is so fine that just one piece would be worth more than a kingdom; Tolkien likens her creative power to that of the Vala Yavanna, she who loves all trees and plants that grow in the earth. In Fontenot's view, M\u00edriel's creativity \"celebrates and amplifies the beauty already present in the world around her. Her art doesn't hoard light and beauty\". Further, Fontenot writes, it is significant that Yavanna made the Two Trees of Valinor, while M\u00edriel made F\u00ebanor, who made the Silmarils, which captured some of the light of the Two Trees.\nImportant choices.\nSome of Tolkien's drafts of the story describe similarities of character between F\u00ebanor and M\u00edriel. Tolkien calls both of them determined, hardly ever changing their mind once they had said they would do something. In another draft, Tolkien adds that M\u00edriel was both \"proud and obdurate\"; the mention of pride directly echoes F\u00ebanor's ill-fated oath.\nTolkien rewrote the tale of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel several times, as it assumed \"an extraordinary importance in [his] later work on \"The Silmarillion\"\". \"The Silmarillion\", prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father's unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel; Tolkien may have intended to incorporate a fuller version. In Tolkien's works, Elves are immortal, their shades going to the Halls of Mandos after death, and marriage is forever. Tolkien noted that had Finw\u00eb chosen differently, the whole history of Middle-earth would have changed for the better, thus making his choice a pivotal event in the mythology; it showed the importance Tolkien attached to unbreakable relationships.\nSkill of mother and son.\nThe Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger comments that M\u00edriel's death has deep-running consequences through her son F\u00ebanor's \"unchecked nature\". She notes that his usual name means \"Spirit of Fire\", and that it is not his true name, which is Curufinw\u00eb (Quenya: \"Curu\", \"Skill\", and his father's name); in her view, the use of an epithet implies a strong emphasis on his fire element. The first thing his fire consumes is M\u00edriel's body; \"The Silmarillion\" says she is \"consumed in spirit and body\". The poet and essayist Melanie Rawls writes that F\u00ebanor's consuming nature, always taking things in, is \"a negative-feminine trait\", implying a disharmony of the genders. Flieger writes that his fire then drives his creativity, making the beautiful letters of the F\u00ebanorian script, and jewels, including, fatefully, the Silmarils. She states that Tolkien, choosing his words very carefully, calls F\u00ebanor two things. Firstly, he uses the word \"subtle\", by etymology from Latin \"sub-tela\", \"under the warp (of a weaving)\", hence the crosswise weft threads that go against the grain, a dangerous part of the fabric of life. Secondly, he applies the word \"skilled\", by etymology from Indo-European \"skel-\", \"to cut\", like the Noldor as a whole tending to cause division among the Elves. His choices, and the Silmarils, do in fact lead to division and war, to the Kinslaying of Elf by Elf, the theft of the Telerin Elves' ships in Aman, and in turn to further disasters across the sea in Beleriand.\nBoth Matthew Dickerson in \"The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" and Elizabeth Solopova in \"A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien\" note that \"The Silmarillion\" emphasises M\u00edriel's skill, naming her in early versions \"Byrde\", later \"Serind\u00eb\", \"the broideress\"; she passes on her \"surpassing skill\" in craftsmanship to her only son. Solopova suggests a possible link to Tolkien's study of the Middle English word \"burde\", conventionally meaning \"lady, damsel\"; he proposed that it derived from Old English , \"embroidery\" and pointed out that in Old Norse and Old English poetry, stock terms for \"woman\" included \"weaver\" and \"embroideress\".\n\"A strange case\".\nTolkien mentions in a letter \"a strange case of an Elf (M\u00edriel mother of F\u00ebanor) that tried to \"die\", which had disastrous results, leading to the 'Fall' of the High-elves\"; he discusses it in the context of the Fall of Man. Dickerson writes that while F\u00ebanor is held responsible by the Valar, \"neither Finw\u00eb nor M\u00edriel is blameless\". He states that no reason is given in \"The Silmarillion\" for M\u00edriel's decision, beyond the enormous amount of energy, \"enough for many children\", that she put into F\u00ebanor. However, he notes that Morgoth had already worked his evil on the Elves when they were still at Cuivi\u00e9nen, where they first awakened, in the east of Middle-earth, sowing \"the seeds of despair\"; this might, he suggests, have contributed to M\u00edriel's loss of hope. Tolkien wrote in \"Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\" that \"Ni\u00ebnna came to Manw\u00eb, and she said: 'Lord of Aman, it is now made clear that the death of M\u00edriel was an evil of Arda Marred, for with the coming hither of the Eldar the Shadow hath found an entrance even into Aman.'\"\nFontenot notes that Tolkien's drafts differ widely in how long M\u00edriel lives after F\u00ebanor's birth, and hence in whether she can influence his ill humour directly. This in turn affects the issue of how far Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel can be blamed for the consequences of F\u00ebanor's actions. It is a question that the Valar debate amongst themselves.\nPhilosophical themes.\nThe scholar of religion Amelia Rutledge identifies what she calls Pauline constructs (like the language used by Paul the Apostle in the Bible) in the legalistic wording relating to the tale of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel. She notes that Elizabeth Whittingham and Douglas Kane discuss instead the eschatology relating to the tale. Whittingham considers what she calls \"some of the most interesting glimpses of Tolkien as sub-creator\" in his stories and essays on the nature of mortal Men and immortal Elves, exploring the question of death and immortality raised by the voluntary death of M\u00edriel. Kane discusses Mandos's Second Prophecy, with an illustration of \"The spirit of M\u00edriel appearing before Mandos and Manw\u00eb, and taking a last look at Finw\u00eb\".\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65293", "revid": "34871045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65293", "title": "F\u00ebanor", "text": "Character in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth\nF\u00ebanor () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Silmarillion\". He creates the Tengwar script, the palant\u00edr seeing-stones, and the three Silmarils, the skilfully forged jewels that give the book their name and theme, triggering division and destruction. He is the eldest son of Finw\u00eb, the King of the Noldor Elves, and his first wife M\u00edriel.\nF\u00ebanor's Silmarils form a central theme of \"The Silmarillion\" as Men and Elves battle with the forces of evil for their possession. After the Dark Lord Morgoth steals the Silmarils, F\u00ebanor and his seven sons swear the Oath of F\u00ebanor, vowing to fight anyone and everyone\u2014whether Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala\u2014who withholds the Silmarils.\nThe oath commands F\u00ebanor and his sons to press to Middle-earth, in the process committing atrocities against their fellow Elves, the first Kinslaying, at the havens of the Teleri. F\u00ebanor dies soon after his arrival in Middle-earth; his sons unite in the cause of defeating Morgoth and retrieving the Silmarils, but end up causing further harm among the Elves.\nThe Tolkien scholar Jane Chance has seen F\u00ebanor's pride as leading to his downfall, alongside Morgoth's corruption of Elves and Men as reflecting Satan's temptation of Adam and Eve, and the desire for godlike knowledge as in the Garden of Eden. Others have likened F\u00ebanor to the Anglo-Saxon leader Byrhtnoth whose foolish pride led to defeat and death at the Battle of Maldon. Tom Shippey writes that the pride is specifically a desire to make things that reflect their own personality, and likens this to Tolkien's own desire to sub-create. John Ellison further likens this creative pride to that of the protagonist in Thomas Mann's 1947 novel \"Doctor Faustus\", noting that both that novel and Tolkien's own legendarium were responses to World War.\nFictional history.\nEarly life.\nF\u00ebanor's father is Finw\u00eb, the first King of the Noldor; his mother, M\u00edriel, dies, \"consumed in spirit and body\", shortly after giving birth to him. F\u00ebanor \"was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Il\u00favatar, and a bright flame was in him.\" Finw\u00eb remarries and has several children, including F\u00ebanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin. F\u00ebanor studies under his father-in-law Mahtan, who was a student of the godlike Vala Aul\u00eb. He becomes a craftsman and gem-smith, inventor of the Tengwar script, and the creator of the magical seeing-stones, the palant\u00edri.\nSilmarils.\nF\u00ebanor, \"in the greatest of his achievements, captured the light of the Two Trees to make the three Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels, though they were not mere glittering stones, they were alive, imperishable, and sacred.\" Even the Valar with their godlike powers could not copy them. In fact, F\u00ebanor himself could not copy them, as part of his essence goes into their making. Their worth is close to infinite, as they are unique and irreplaceable. The Vala \"Varda hallowed the Silmarils so that thereafter no mortal flesh, nor hands unclean, nor anything of evil will might touch them, for it would be scorched and withered.\"\nF\u00ebanor prizes the Silmarils, and grows suspicious of the Valar and Elves who he believes covet them. The Vala Melkor, recently released from imprisonment and now residing in Valinor, sees an opportunity to sow dissent among the Noldor. F\u00ebanor refuses to communicate with Melkor, but is still caught in his plot. F\u00ebanor angrily warns Fingolfin not to spread lies, and threatens to kill him. As punishment, the Valar exile F\u00ebanor to his remote home Formenos for twelve years. Finw\u00eb too withdraws to Formenos.\nThe Valar learn that Melkor is manipulating F\u00ebanor, and send one of their number, Tulkas, to capture Melkor, but he has already escaped. F\u00ebanor wisely realises that Melkor's goal is to obtain the Silmarils, \"and he shut the doors of his house in the face of the mightiest of all the dwellers in E\u00e4.\" The Valar invite F\u00ebanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offers a hand to his half-brother, recognising F\u00ebanor's place as the eldest. F\u00ebanor accepts, but soon Melkor and Ungoliant destroy The Two Trees, leaving the Silmarils as the only surviving light of the Trees. The Valar ask F\u00ebanor to give them up so that they can restore the Trees. F\u00ebanor replies: \"It may be that I can unlock my jewels, but never again shall I make their like; and if I must break them, I shall break my heart.\" He refuses to give up the Silmarils of his own free will. Messengers from Formenos tell him that Melkor has killed Finw\u00eb and stolen the Silmarils. Yavanna is thus unable to heal the Two Trees.\nFor this deed, F\u00ebanor names Melkor \"Morgoth\", \"Black Enemy\". F\u00ebanor rails against the Great Enemy, blaming the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He gives a speech in the Elvish city of Tirion, persuading most of his people to return to Middle-earth to avenge Finw\u00eb and free themselves from the Valar. Together with his seven sons, they swear the Oath of F\u00ebanor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il\u00favatar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not... ...vowing to pursue with vengeance and hatred to the ends of the World Vala, Demon, Elf or Man as yet unborn or any creature, great or small, good or evil, that time should bring forth unto the end of days, whoso should hold or take or keep a Silmaril from their possession.\nReturn to Beleriand.\nTo get to Middle-earth, F\u00ebanor goes to the shores of Aman, and asks the seafaring Teleri for their aid. When they refuse, F\u00ebanor orders the Noldor to steal the ships. The Teleri resist, and many of them are killed. The battle became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb, or the first kinslaying. His sons later commit two other acts of warfare against Elves in Middle-earth in his name. In repentance, Finarfin, Finw\u00eb's third son, takes his host and turns back. They are accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin rules as High-King of the Noldor in Valinor. The remaining Elves, those who follow F\u00ebanor and Fingolfin, become subject to the Doom of Mandos, that they will come to harm if they continue their rebellion against the Valar. There are not enough ships to carry all the Noldor across the sea, so F\u00ebanor and his sons lead the first group. Upon arriving in the far west of Beleriand, they decide to burn the ships and leave Fingolfin and his people behind. Fingolfin, furious, returns to Beleriand by the long and hard land route, via the northern ice.\nMorgoth summons his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacks F\u00ebanor's encampment in Mithrim. This battle was called the Battle under the Stars, or \"Dagor-nuin-Giliath\", for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Noldor win the battle. F\u00ebanor presses on toward Angband with his sons. He comes within sight of Angband, but is ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few Elves about him. He fights mightily with Gothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons come upon the Balrogs with a great force of Elves, and drive them off; but F\u00ebanor knows his wounds are fatal. He curses Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he sees that his Elves, unaided, will never throw down the dark towers of Thangorodrim.\nAftermath.\nThe Oath of F\u00ebanor affects the lovers Beren and L\u00fathien. They steal a Silmaril from Morgoth, leading to Kinslaying and years of strife among the Elves, until E\u00e4rendil carries the Silmaril off into the West. That Silmaril is lost to the Sons of F\u00ebanor, but the other two remain in the crown of Morgoth. They too are stolen, one ending in the earth, one in the sea.\nAccording to Mandos' prophecy, following Melkor's final return and defeat in the Dagor Dagorath, the world will be changed and the Valar will recover the Silmarils. F\u00ebanor will be released from the Halls of Mandos and will give Yavanna the Silmarils. F\u00ebanor will break them, and Yavanna will revive the Two Trees. The Pel\u00f3ri Mountains will be flattened and the light of the Two Trees will fill the world in eternal bliss.\nHouse of F\u00ebanor.\n Kings of the Noldor in Valinor\n High Kings of the Noldor in Exile (in Middle-earth)\nAll the characters shown are Elves. The above tree follows the late note \"The Shibboleth of F\u00ebanor\". In the published Silmarillion, the birth order of F\u00ebanor's sons is Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin (father of Celebrimbor), Amrod, and Amras; F\u00ebanor's half-sisters Findis and Lalwen do not appear.\nDevelopment.\nF\u00ebanor was originally named Curufinw\u00eb (\"skilful [son of] Finw\u00eb\") in Tolkien's fictional language of Quenya. He is known as F\u00eban\u00e1ro, \"spirit of fire\" in Quenya, from \"f\u00eba\" (\"spirit\") and \"n\u00e1r\" (\"flame\"). F\u00eban\u00e1ro is his \"mother-name\" or \"Amiless\u00eb\", the name given by an Elf's mother at, or some years after, birth and it was one of their true names.\nTolkien wrote at least four versions of the Oath of F\u00ebanor itself, as found in \"The History of Middle-earth.\" The three earliest versions are found in \"The Lays of Beleriand\": in alliterative verse (circa 1918\u20131920s), in chapter 2, \"Poems Early Abandoned\" \"The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor\". Lines 132\u2013141; in rhyming couplets (circa 1928), in chapter 3, \"The Lay of Leithian\". Canto VI, lines 1628\u20131643; and in a different form as restated by Celegorm, third son of F\u00ebanor, in chapter 3, \"The Lay of Leithian.\" Canto VI, lines 1848\u20131857. A later version is found in \"Morgoth's Ring\". F\u00ebanor is among those major characters whom Tolkien, who also used to illustrate his writings, supplied with a distinct heraldic device.\nAnalysis.\nPride and downfall.\nThe Tolkien scholar Jane Chance sees Morgoth's corruption of Elves and Men as clearly Biblical, as it \"mirrors that of Adam and Eve by Satan; the desire for power and godlike being is the same desire for knowledge of good and evil witnessed in the Garden of Eden.\" She treats the Silmarils as symbols of that same desire. She identifies F\u00ebanor's wish to be like the Valar in creating \"things of his own\" as rebellious pride, and that, like Melkor, he \"succumbs to a 'greedy love'\" of his creations that causes his downfall. She points out that F\u00ebanor's rebellion is echoed by that of the N\u00famen\u00f3rean man Ar-Pharazon, and then at the end of \"The Silmarillion\" by the (angelic) Maia, Sauron, who becomes the Dark Lord of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nThe philologist Elizabeth Solopova suggests that the character of F\u00ebanor was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon leader Byrhtnoth, and in particular his appearance in the poem \"The Battle of Maldon\". The poem tells how he is slain in that battle, which took place in the year 991. Tolkien wrote a short play in verse, \"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son\" on the character's misplaced pride, and described Byrhtnoth as misled by \"pride and misplaced chivalry proven fatal\" and as \"too foolish to be heroic\". F\u00ebanor is similarly driven by \"overmastering pride\" that causes his death and that of countless followers.\nPride in sub-creation.\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that F\u00ebanor and his Silmarils relate to \"The Silmarillion\"'s theme in a particular way: the sin of the Elves is not human pride, as in the Biblical fall, but their \"desire to make things which will forever reflect or incarnate their own personality\". This Elvish form of pride leads F\u00ebanor to forge the Silmarils, and, Shippey suggests, led Tolkien to write his fictions: \"Tolkien could not help seeing a part of himself in F\u00ebanor and Saruman, sharing their perhaps licit, perhaps illicit desire to 'sub-create'.\"\nJohn Ellison, writing in the Tolkien Society's journal \"Mallorn\", draws a comparison between F\u00ebanor and the Faust legend, in particular Thomas Mann's version in his 1947 novel \"Doctor Faustus\". In Ellison's view, the life history of both characters is of \"genius corrupted finally into insanity; the creative drive turns on its possessor and destroys him, and with him a good part of the fabric of society.\" He describes as parallel Mann's depiction of his Faust character Leverk\u00fchn in a collapsing Nazi Germany and Tolkien's starting his mythology amidst the collapse of pre-1914 Europe in the First World War. F\u00ebanor is, he writes, not an exact equivalent of Doctor Faustus: he does not make a pact with the devil; but both F\u00ebanor and Leverk\u00fchn outgrow their teachers in creative skill. Ellison calls Leverk\u00fchn \"a F\u00ebanor of our times\", and comments that far from being a simple battle of good versus evil, Tolkien's world as seen in F\u00ebanor has \"the creative and destructive forces in man's nature ... indivisibly linked; this is the essence of the 'fallen world' in which we live.\" He adds that F\u00ebanor is central to the whole of Tolkien's legendarium, \"the hinge on which the whole great Tale ... turns.\"\nLike Shippey, Ellison relates F\u00ebanor's making of the Silmarils to what he supposes was Tolkien's own belief: that it was \"a dangerous and impermissible act\" that went beyond what the Creator had intended for the Elves. Further, Ellison suggests that while F\u00ebanor does not directly represent Tolkien, there is something about his action that can be applied to Tolkien's life. Tolkien calls F\u00ebanor \"fey\"; Ellison notes that Tolkien analysed his own name as \"tollk\u00fchn\", with the same meaning. Further, Tolkien seems, Ellison writes, to have felt a conflict between his own \"sub-creation\" and his Catholic faith.\nAncestry as guide to character.\nShippey and the Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger both note that Tolkien intended ancestry to be a guide to character. Shippey writes that \"The Silmarillion\" echoes Norse mythology in this belief, and that one perhaps needs to study the family trees to see clearly how it all works:\n\"Subtle\" and \"skilled\".\nFlieger writes that F\u00ebanor's fire drives his creativity, making the beautiful letters of the F\u00ebanorian script, and jewels, including, fatefully, the Silmarils. She comments that Tolkien, choosing his words very carefully, calls F\u00ebanor both \"subtle\", by etymology from Latin \"sub-tela\", \"under the warp (of a weaving)\", hence the crosswise weft threads that go against the grain, a dangerous part of the fabric of life; and \"skilled\", by etymology from Indo-European \"skel-\", \"to cut\", like the Noldor as a whole tending to cause division among the Elves; and indeed his choices, and the Silmarils, lead to division and war, to the Kinslaying of Elf by Elf, the theft of the Telerin Elves' ships in Aman, and in turn to further disasters across the sea in Beleriand.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The series is set in \"London Below\", a magical realm coexisting with the more familiar London, referred to as \"London Above\". It was devised by Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry and directed by Dewi Humphreys. Gaiman adapted the series into a novel, which was released in September 1996. The series and book were partially inspired by Gene Wolfe's novel \"Free Live Free\".\nPlot.\nRichard Mayhew, a Scottish man living in London, encounters an injured girl named Door on the street one night. Despite his fianc\u00e9e's protests he decides to help her; upon doing so he ceases to exist on Earth and becomes real only to the denizens of \"London Below\", whose inhabitants are generally invisible and non-existent to the people of \"London Above\". He loses his flat, his job, and nearly his mind as he travels London Below to make sense out of it all, find a way back, and help Door survive as she is hunted by assassins.\nIn London Below the various familiar names of London all take on a new significance, Knightsbridge becomes \"Night's Bridge\", a stone bridge whose darkness takes its toll in human life; The Angel, Islington is an angel. London Below is a parallel world in and beneath the sewers. Its inhabitants are the homeless and people from other times, such as Roman legionaries and medieval monks, as well as fictional and fantastical characters.\nEpisodes.\n\"Neverwhere\" was first broadcast on BBC Two from 12 September 1996. There are six half-hour episodes:\nBackground.\nThe idea for the story came from a conversation between Gaiman and Henry about a possible television series. Henry suggested a story with tribes of homeless people in London. Gaiman was initially reluctant to commit, as he feared that making the homeless appear \"cool\" might cause more young people to attempt to emulate the characters, but decided that the effect could be avoided by making the story more removed from reality.\n\"Neverwhere\" received some criticism for its appearance. One major problem lay in the original plan to shoot on video (for budgetary reasons), and then later \"filmise\" the footage to make it look as if it had been shot on film. For this reason, the programme had been lit and shot in a manner appropriate to a film-based production, but the decision to apply the filmisation process was later reversed. In addition to what some considered the old-fashioned appearance of un-filmised video, the lighting set up with film in mind appeared garish and unsubtle on the more clinical medium. Gaiman himself commented that the loss of quality resulting from multi-generational VHS copies actually improved the appearance in this respect.\nDVD releases.\nAfter a two-cassette VHS video release, the six episodes were released in the US and Canada to DVD as a two-disc set in September 2003 in conjunction with A&amp;E Network. Despite the DVDs often being advertised as region 1, some of the actual discs are region zero. The BBC released the series on DVD on 23 April 2007. The opening theme tune on the original BBC2 transmission was the same as the music over the closing credits. The opening theme on the Region 2 DVD version is a series of abstract sounds, while the closing music remains intact. The music for the series was made by Brian Eno.\nAdaptations.\nNovelisation.\nNeil Gaiman wrote a novelisation of the television series that was first released in 1996, during the television show's transmission. This was accompanied by a spoken word release on CD and cassette. The text was later re-written for the US market (Gaiman's publisher insisting that many of the references of London were too obscure for US tastes) and a third version is now available which combines elements of both earlier versions of the novel.\nGraphic novel.\nA nine-issue graphic novel limited series began in June 2005, written by Mike Carey (who had worked on \"Lucifer\", a spin-off from Gaiman's \"The Sandman\"), with art by Glenn Fabry. Vertigo changed a character, the Marquis De Carabas, that had been portrayed in the TV series and on the radio as a man from the African Diaspora into a creature with a black skin tone not seen in the real world. The comic is an adaptation inspired by the novelisation, rather than the original TV series. Thus the characters and settings do not generally resemble those seen in the series. The series was published by DC Comics's Vertigo imprint. The collected volume was also published by Vertigo, in February 2007 ().\nStage.\nIn 2006, a world-premiere stage adaptation of the novel, developed by writer and actress Eve Butler and director Sasha Travis, was produced by the Savannah Actor's Theatre in Savannah, Georgia. In 2008, a stage adaptation of the novel was created and performed by the Actors Gymnasium in Evanston, Illinois. In 2010, Lifeline Theatre in Chicago performed an adaptation written by Robert Kauzlaric. The eight-week run proved so successful that it was extended another four weeks. The play was viewed by Neil Gaiman and the co-creator of the original BBC series, Lenny Henry, during the extension. In February 2012, Calgary-based theatre company Mob Hit Productions performed a two-week run of Kauzlaric's adaptation. In May 2011, the first school production of Kauzlaric's adaptation was performed at Northwest Academy in Portland, Oregon. In February 2013, Kauzlaric's adaption was performed at Friends Academy in Locust Valley, New York. On 5 April 2013, the Sacred Fools Theater Company in Los Angeles performed the American West Coast premiere of Kauzlaric's adaptation. Originally scheduled to run through 11 May, it was extended an additional two weeks due to its popularity. The play was viewed by Neil Gaiman. In August 2013, Washington, D.C.\u2013based company Rorschach Theatre performed Kauzlaric's adaptation after a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nFilm.\nA script was written for a film version in 2009 and was optioned by The Weinstein Company. The project has been abandoned since.\nRadio.\nA radio dramatisation in six parts was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra in March 2013, written by Dirk Maggs and co-directed with producer Heather Larmour. During one of his book signings Gaiman indicated that it would be released for sale in late 2013. The radio play starred James McAvoy as Richard Mayhew and Natalie Dormer as Lady Door.\nSequels.\nSince at least 2014, Gaiman said a sequel to the book titled \"The Seven Sisters\" was a possibility, later confirming in 2017 that he was in fact writing it.\n\"How the Marquis Got His Coat Back\" is a short story written by Neil Gaiman and set in the Neverwhere universe. It was published in \"Rogues\", a short story anthology edited by Gardner Dozois and George RR Martin. Audible adapted it as an audio story as well.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65307", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65307", "title": "World War III", "text": "Hypothetical future global conflict\nWorld War III, also known as the Third World War, is a hypothetical future global conflict subsequent to World War I (1914\u20131918) and World War II (1939\u20131945). It is widely predicted that such a war would involve all of the great powers, like its two predecessors, and the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, thereby surpassing all prior conflicts in scale, devastation, and loss of life.\nWorld War III was initially synonymous with the escalation of the Cold War (1947\u20131991) into direct conflict between the US-led Western Bloc and Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. Since the United States' development and use of nuclear weapons in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, the risk of a nuclear apocalypse causing widespread destruction and the potential collapse of modern civilization or human extinction has been central in speculation and fiction about World War III. The Soviet Union's development of nuclear weapons in 1949 spurred the nuclear arms race and was followed by several other countries.\nRegional proxy wars including the Korean War (1950\u20131953), Vietnam War (1955\u20131975), and Soviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989), while significant, did not lead to a full-scale global conflict. A global conflict was planned for by military and civil personnel around the world, with scenarios ranging from conventional warfare to limited or total nuclear warfare. The certainty of escalation from one stage to the next was extensively debated. For example, the Eisenhower administration promulgated a policy of massive retaliation with nuclear forces, to a minor conventional attack. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, which brought the US and Soviet Union to the brink of war, the strategic doctrine of mutually assured destruction, which held that a full-scale nuclear war would annihilate all parties, became widely accepted. At their 1985 summit, US and Soviet leaders first jointly stated \"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\". Advocates of deterrence theory hold that nuclear weapons prevent World War III\u2013like great power conflict, while advocates of nuclear disarmament hold that their risks far outweigh this.\nSince the end of the Cold War in 1991, speculation about World War III shifted toward emerging threats, including terrorism and cyberwarfare. Great-power competition was renewed between the United States, China, and Russia, sometimes termed a Second Cold War. Various conflicts, most significantly the Russo-Ukrainian war (2022\u2013present), the Middle Eastern crisis (2023\u2013present), and rising tensions over the status of Taiwan, have been perceived as flashpoints for a third world war.\nEtymology.\n\"Time\" magazine.\n\"Time\" magazine was an early adopter, if not originator, of the term \"World WarIII\". The first usage appears in its 3 November 1941 issue (preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941) under its \"National Affairs\" section and entitled \"World WarIII?\" about Nazi refugee Hermann Rauschning, who had just arrived in the United States. In its 22 March 1943, issue under its \"Foreign News\" section, \"Time\" reused the same title \"World WarIII?\" about statements by then\u2013US Vice President Henry A. Wallace: \"We shall decide sometime in 1943 or 1944... whether to plant the seeds of World War III.\" \"Time\" continued to entitle with or mention in stories the term \"World WarIII\" for the rest of the decade and onwards: 1944, 1945, 1946 (\"bacterial warfare\"), 1947, and 1948. \"Time\" persists in using this term, for example, in a 2015 book review entitled \"This Is What World War III Will Look Like\".\nMilitary plans.\nMilitary strategists have used war games to prepare for various war scenarios and to determine the most appropriate strategies. War games were utilized for World War I and World War II.\nOperation Unthinkable.\nBritish prime minister Winston Churchill was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet Red Army forces deployed in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of World War\u00a0II and the perceived unreliability of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, there was a serious threat to Western Europe. In April\u2013May 1945, the British Armed Forces developed Operation Unthinkable, thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War. Its primary goal was \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire\". The plan was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible.\nOperation Dropshot.\nOperation Dropshot was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union in the Western European and Asian theaters. Although the scenario made use of nuclear weapons, they were not expected to play a decisive role.\nAt the time, the US nuclear arsenal was limited in size, based mostly in the United States, and depended on bombers for delivery. Dropshot included mission profiles that would have used 300 nuclear bombs and 29,000 high-explosive bombs on 200 targets in 100 cities and towns to wipe out 85% of the Soviet Union's industrial potential in a single stroke. Between 75 and 100 of the 300 nuclear weapons were targeted to destroy Soviet combat aircraft on the ground.\nThe scenario was devised before the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. It was also devised before US president John F. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara changed the US Nuclear War plan from the 'city killing' countervalue strike plan to a \"counterforce\" plan (targeted more at military forces). Nuclear weapons at this time were not accurate enough to hit a naval base without destroying the city adjacent to it, so the aim of using them was to destroy the enemy's industrial capacity to cripple their war economy.\nBritish-Irish cooperation.\nIreland started planning for a possible nuclear war in the late 1940s. Co-operation between the United Kingdom and Ireland would be formed in the event of WWIII, where they would share weather data, control aids to navigation, and coordinate the Wartime Broadcasting Service that would occur after a nuclear attack. Operation Sandstone in Ireland was a top-secret British-Irish military operation. The armed forces from both states began a coastal survey of Britain and Ireland cooperating from 1948 to 1955. This was a request from the United States to identify suitable landing grounds for the US in the event of a successful Soviet invasion. By 1953, the co-operation agreed upon sharing information on wartime weather and the evacuation of civilian refugees from Britain to Ireland. Ireland's Operation Sandstone ended in 1966.\nExercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace.\nIn January 1950, the North Atlantic Council approved NATO's military strategy of containment. NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the Korean War in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a \"force under a centralized command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defense of Western Europe\". Allied Command Europe was established under General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. Army, on 2 April 1951. The Western Union Defence Organization had previously carried out Exercise Verity, a 1949 multilateral exercise involving naval air strikes and submarine attacks.\nExercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defense of Denmark and Norway from the Soviet attack in 1952. It was the first major NATO exercise. The exercise was jointly commanded by Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, United States Navy, and Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Matthew B. Ridgeway, U.S. Army, during the autumn of 1952.\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Netherlands, and Belgium participated.\nExercises Grand Slam and Longstep were naval exercises held in the Mediterranean Sea during 1952 to practice dislodging an enemy occupying force and amphibious assault. It involved over 170 warships and 700 aircraft under the overall command of Admiral Robert B. Carney. The overall exercise commander, Carney summarized the accomplishments of Exercise Grand Slam by stating: \"We have demonstrated that the senior commanders of all four powers can successfully take charge of a mixed task force and handle it effectively as a working unit.\"\nThe Soviet Union called the exercises \"war-like acts\" by NATO, with particular reference to the participation of Norway and Denmark and prepared for its military maneuvers in the Soviet Zone.\nExercise Strikeback.\nExercise Strikeback was a major NATO naval exercise held in 1957, simulating a response to an all-out Soviet attack on NATO. The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the United States Navy, the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, Exercise Strikeback was characterized by military analyst Hanson W. Baldwin of \"The New York Times\" as \"constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World WarII\".\nExercise Reforger.\nExercise Reforger (return of forces to Germany) was an annual exercise conducted during the Cold War by NATO. While US troops could be easily flown across the Atlantic, the heavy equipment and armor reinforcements would have to come by sea and be delivered to POMCUS (Pre-positioned Overseas Materiel Configured to Unit Sets) sites. These exercises tested the United States and allied abilities to carry out transcontinental reinforcement. Timely reinforcement was a critical part of the NATO reinforcement exercises. The United States needed to be able to send active-duty army divisions to Europe within ten days as part of a wartime NATO general deployment. In addition to assessing the capabilities of the United States, Reforger also monitored the personnel, facilities, and equipment of the European countries playing a significant role in the reinforcement effort. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO could quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, and especially in tanks and armoured vehicles. Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces defending against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced.\nReforger was not merely a show of force. In the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as Operation Reforger. The political goals of Reforger were to promote extended deterrence and foster NATO cohesion. Important components in Reforger included the Military Airlift Command, the Military Sealift Command, and the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.\nSeven Days to the River Rhine.\nSeven Days to the River Rhine was a top-secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact. It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the Vistula river valley in a first-strike scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties. In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day. Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges and that large numbers of troops would die of radiation sickness. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit to get them to withhold the use of their nuclear weapons.\nExercise Able Archer.\nExercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the U.S. European Command that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on the transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.\n\"Able Archer 83\" was a five-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) command post exercise starting on 7 November 1983, that spanned Western Europe, centered on the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) Headquarters in Casteau, north of the city of Mons. Able Archer's exercises simulated a period of conflict escalation, culminating in a coordinated nuclear attack.\nThe realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with deteriorating relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of strategic Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a ruse of war, obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear first strike. In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in East Germany and Poland on alert.\nThis \"1983 war scare\" is considered by many historians to be the closest the world has come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The threat of nuclear war ended with the conclusion of the exercise on 11 November.\nStrategic Defense Initiative.\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by US president Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983. In the latter part of his presidency, numerous factors (which included watching the 1983 movie \"The Day After\" and hearing through a Soviet defector that Able Archer 83 almost triggered a Russian first strike) had turned Reagan against the concept of winnable nuclear war, and he began to see nuclear weapons as more of a \"wild card\" than a strategic deterrent. Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike. However, the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since a unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.\nThe SDI concept was to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.\nNATO nuclear sharing.\nNATO operational plans for a Third World War have involved NATO allies who do not have their nuclear weapons, using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan, under the direction of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander.\nOf the three nuclear powers in NATO (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States), only the United States has provided weapons for nuclear sharing. As of \u00a02009[ [update]], Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are still hosting US nuclear weapons as part of NATO's nuclear sharing policy. Canada hosted weapons until 1984, and Greece until 2001. The United Kingdom also received US tactical nuclear weapons such as nuclear artillery and Lance missiles until 1992, despite the UK being a nuclear weapons state in its own right; these were mainly deployed in Germany.\nIn peacetime, the nuclear weapons stored in non-nuclear countries are guarded by US airmen though previously some artillery and missile systems were guarded by US Army soldiers; the codes required for detonating them are under American control. In case of war, the weapons are to be mounted on the participating countries' warplanes. The weapons are under custody and control of USAF Munitions Support Squadrons co-located on NATO main operating bases that work together with the host nation forces.\nAs of 2005,[ [update]] 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs of the 480 US nuclear weapons believed to be deployed in Europe fall under the nuclear sharing arrangement. The weapons are stored within a vault in hardened aircraft shelters, using the USAF WS3 Weapon Storage and Security System. The delivery warplanes used are F-16 Fighting Falcons and Panavia Tornados.\nHistorical close calls.\nWith the initiation of the Cold War arms race in the 1950s, an apocalyptic war between the United States and the Soviet Union became a real possibility. During the Cold War era (1947\u20131991), several military events have been described as having come close to potentially triggering World WarIII. Even after the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some incidents afterward have been described as close calls as well.\nKorean War: 25 June 1950\u00a0\u2013 27 July 1953.\nThe Korean War was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the Korean Peninsula: a communist coalition including North Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States and the United Nations Command. Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the U.S., the U.S.S.R., and China. CBS News war correspondent Bill Downs wrote in 1951, \"To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World WarIII. The brilliant landings at Inchon and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea. But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world.\" Downs afterwards repeated this belief on \"ABC Evening News\" while reporting on the USS \"Pueblo\" incident in 1968. Secretary of State Dean Acheson later acknowledged that the Truman administration was concerned about the escalation of the conflict and that General Douglas MacArthur warned him that a U.S.-led intervention risked a Soviet response.\nBerlin Crisis: 4 June \u2013 9 November 1961.\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was a political-military confrontation between the armed forces of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. at Checkpoint Charlie with both several American and Soviet/East German tanks and troops at the stand-off at each other only 100 yards on either side of the checkpoint. The reason behind the confrontation was the occupational status of the German capital city, Berlin, and of post\u2013World War II Germany. The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin. The crisis culminated in the city's de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall. This stand-off ended peacefully on 28 October following a U.S.\u2013Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks and reduce tensions.\nCuban Missile Crisis: 15\u201329 October 1962.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis, a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a third World War. The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day:\nDespite what many believe to be the closest the world has come to a nuclear conflict, throughout the entire standoff, the Doomsday Clock, which is run by the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" to estimate how close the end of the world, or doomsday, is, with midnight being the apocalypse, stayed at a relatively stable seven minutes to midnight. This has been explained as being due to the brevity of the crisis since the clock monitored more long-term factors such as the leadership of countries, conflicts, wars, and political upheavals, as well as societies' reactions to said factors.\nThe \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" now credits the political developments resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis with having enhanced global stability. The \"Bulletin\" posits that future crises and occasions that might otherwise escalate, were rendered more stable due to two major factors:\nSino-Soviet border conflicts: 2 March \u2013 11 September 1969.\nThe Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military border war between the Soviet Union and China at the height of the Sino-Soviet split in 1969. The most serious of these border clashes, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 in the vicinity of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria.\nThe conflict resulted in a ceasefire, with a return to the status quo. Critics point out that the Chinese attack on Zhenbao was to deter any potential future Soviet invasions; that by killing some Soviets, China demonstrated that it could not be 'bullied'; and that Mao wanted to teach them 'a bitter lesson'.\nChina's relations with the USSR remained sour after the conflict, despite the border talks, which began in 1969 and continued inconclusively for a decade. Domestically, the threat of war caused by the border clashes inaugurated a new stage in the Cultural Revolution; that of China's thorough militarization. The 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held in the aftermath of the Zhenbao Island incident, confirmed Defense Minister Lin Biao as Mao Zedong's heir apparent.\nFollowing the events of 1969, the Soviet Union further increased its forces along the Sino-Soviet border, and in the Mongolian People's Republic.\nYom Kippur War superpower tensions: 6\u201325 October 1973.\nThe Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with a surprise invasion of Israeli-occupied territories by a coalition of Arab states, aided by the Soviet Union. Israel successfully counterattacked with the aid of the US. Tensions grew between the two superpowers: American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other in the Mediterranean Sea. Admiral Daniel J. Murphy of the US Sixth Fleet reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent. The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4to3. The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under UNSC 339.\nNORAD computer error: 9 November 1979.\nThe United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD systems indicated that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched. No attempt was made to use the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors. A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic. A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes.\nSoviet radar malfunction: 26 September 1983.\nA false alarm occurred on the Soviet nuclear early warning system, showing the launch of American LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles from bases in the United States. A retaliatory attack was prevented by Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet Air Defence Forces officer, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations).\nAble Archer 83 escalations: 2\u201311 November 1983.\nDuring Able Archer 83, a ten-day NATO exercise simulating a period of conflict escalation that culminated in a DEFCON 1 nuclear strike, some members of the Soviet Politburo and armed forces treated the events as a ruse of war concealing a genuine first strike. In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the Warsaw Pact states of East Germany and Poland under high alert. However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises.\nNorwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995.\nThe Norwegian rocket incident was the first World WarIII close call to occur after the Cold War had ended. This incident occurred when Russia's Olenegorsk early warning station accidentally mistook the radar signature from a Black Brant XII research rocket (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from And\u00f8ya Rocket Range), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a Trident SLBM missile. In response, Russian president Boris Yeltsin was summoned and the \"Cheget\" nuclear briefcase was activated for the first and only time. However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation. It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians.\nIncident at Pristina airport: 12 June 1999.\nOn 12 June 1999, the day following the end of the Kosovo War, some 250 Russian peacekeepers occupied the Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO troops and were to secure the arrival of reinforcements by air. American NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Wesley Clark ordered the use of force against the Russians. Mike Jackson, a British Army general who contacted the Russians during the incident, refused to enforce Clark's orders, famously telling him \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you\". Captain James Blunt, the lead officer at the front of the NATO column in the direct armed stand-off against the Russians, received the \"Destroy!\" orders from Clark over the radio, but he followed Jackson's orders to encircle the airfield instead and later said in an interview that even without Jackson's intervention he would have refused to follow Clark's order.\nShootdown of Sukhoi bomber: 24 November 2015.\nOn 24 November 2015, at the border between Turkey and Syria, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Sukhoi attack aircraft. The Turks claimed that the aircraft violated Turkish airspace, a claim denied by the Russians; the plane was in the region as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, in which Turkey supported opposing forces. The incident was the first destruction of a Russian or Soviet Air Forces warplane by a NATO member state since the attack on the Sui-ho Dam during the Korean War in 1953. The incident led to numerous media and individuals commenting that it could have sparked and escalated into a world war.\nIran\u2013Israel war: 13\u201324 June 2025.\nOn 13 June 2025, Israel's military launched a series of missile strikes against Iran targeting its nuclear and military infrastructure. This marked a major escalation in the Middle Eastern crisis and in what had been a decades-long proxy conflict between Iran and Israel. The strikes, which included the assassination of top Iranian military figures and attacks on critical nuclear facilities like Natanz and Isfahan, came shortly after the IAEA declared Iran non-compliant with nuclear obligations, and U.S. negotiations with Iran collapsed.\nIran retaliated with a barrage of missiles and drones, striking Israeli cities and military targets. The conflict had drawn limited involvement from the U.S., though Trump toyed with the idea of joining the conflict against Iran, saying \"I may do it, I may not do it,\" and \"Nobody knows what I'm going to do.\" This followed earlier comments by Iranian defense minister Aziz Nasirzadeh on 10 June warnied that if negotiations with the U.S. collapsed and conflict erupted, Iran would target American bases in the region. He stated that all U.S. bases in nearby countries were within reach. Trump had also repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if no deal was reached. U.S. defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military was getting ready in case the talks fail. On 22 June, Trump announced that the US had bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities. On 23 June 2025, Iran launched missiles targeting a U.S. base in Qatar and military facilities in Iraq, according to officials. In response, the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait closed their airspace. Qatar reported intercepting a rocket attack, with no casualties reported.\nThe war follows escalating regional tensions after the October 7 attacks and the ensuing Gaza war, with Israel increasingly targeting Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Previous tit-for-tat strikes in 2024 foreshadowed this broader confrontation. Some suggested that the war is a precursor to a third world war, with Putin echoing this sentiment on 20 June. A ceasefire has been in place since 24 June.\nCurrent potential flashpoints.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine: 24 February 2022 \u2013 present.\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014. The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War\u00a0II. Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, while others have suggested the contrary.\nBecause of the invasion, at least fifty countries have provided some kind of military aid to Ukraine, including all member states of NATO. The Russian government has threatened retaliation against countries supplying military aid to Ukraine, and said it meant NATO was waging a \"proxy war\" against Russia. Senior Russian politicians\u2014including president Putin, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and United Russia party leader Dmitry Medvedev\u2014have made statements widely seen as nuclear blackmail. They have implied that Russia may use nuclear weapons if certain \"red lines\" are crossed, such as helping Ukraine to strike back at mainland Russia. Officials from the United States and NATO, including US president Joe Biden and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, have stressed the need to prevent the conflict escalating into a third world war, while also affirming that NATO members will defend each other. The US warned Russia's government that the country would suffer \"catastrophic\" consequences if it used nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Former CIA Director, David Petraeus, said NATO would likely respond by destroying all Russian forces in Ukraine. Several incidents have risked a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, such as Russian breaches of NATO airspace and a missile explosion in Poland. In early 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in New START, the last remaining nuclear treaty between Russia and the US, and announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\nRussian threats have been described as a way to intimidate Western countries, to deter them from helping Ukraine. Fearing escalation, NATO countries held back from sending advanced weapons to Ukraine, and forbade Ukraine to fire NATO weapons into Russia. Since July 2024, they have allowed Ukraine to use NATO weapons to strike military targets in Russia, but only near the border in self-defense. Russia's government has not followed through on its threats against NATO and has not used nuclear weapons, despite most of its \"red lines\" being crossed.\nIran and North Korea have provided weapons and ammunition to Russia during the invasion, including ballistic missiles. In 2024, Russia and North Korea signed a defense pact, and that November, Russia further escalated the conflict by deploying 10,000 North Korean troops on its border to fight Ukraine. In November 2024, Putin said that the war \"has acquired elements of a global character\", adding that Russia was entitled to strike military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against mainland Russia.\nIn February 2025, U.S. president Donald Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy met to discuss signing an agreement for U.S. access to Ukrainian oil, gas, and rare-earth minerals. During the meeting, an argument erupted, with President Trump at one point chiding Zelenskyy for not being grateful enough for U.S. military and political support for Ukraine during the war, telling him he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" The agreements were not signed, and Trump later said that Zelenskyy \"is not ready for peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\"\nOn June 25, Russian-Chechen General Apti Alaudinov, head of the Akhmat special forces, stated that World War III is already underway and the fact that nuclear strikes have not been carried out does not mean that it has not begun.\nOn September 9, nineteen military drones entered Polish airspace after being launched from the territories of Russia and Belarus. Eight of them were shot down by the Polish Air Force, and NATO Quick Reaction Alert aircraft scrambled. Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that a large military conflict was closer than at any time since WWII.\nExtended usage of the term.\nCold War.\nAs Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post\u2013World WarII period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World WarIII was ever-present. A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World WarIII to have already started.\nIn 2004, commentator Norman Podhoretz proposed that the Cold War, lasting from the surrender of the Axis powers until the fall of the Berlin Wall, might rightly be called World WarIII. By Podhoretz's reckoning, \"World WarIV\" would be the global campaign against Islamofascism.\nStill, the majority of historians would seem to hold that World WarIII would necessarily have to be a worldwide \"war in which large forces from many countries fought\" and a war that \"involves most of the principal nations of the world\". The Cold War received its name from the lack of action taken from both sides. The lack of action was out of fear that a nuclear war would possibly destroy humanity. In his book \"Secret Weapons of the Cold War\", Bill Yenne concludes that the military superpower standoff from the 1940s through to 1991 was not World WarIII.\nWar on terror.\nThe \"war on terror\" that began with the September 11 attacks has been claimed by some to be World War III or sometimes World War IV (assuming the Cold War was World War III). Others have disparaged such claims as \"distorting American history\". While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a \"World War\" might now no longer require such worldwide and large-scale aggression and carnage. Still, such claims of a new \"lower threshold of aggression\", that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a \"World War\" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians.\nWar on the Islamic State.\nOn 1 February 2015, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari declared that the war against the Islamic State was effectively \"World WarIII\", due to the Islamic State's aims for a worldwide caliphate, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the Levant region. In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, King of Jordan Abdullah II stated \"We are facing a Third World War [within Islam]\".\nIn his State of the Union Address on 12 January 2016, US president Barack Obama warned that news reports granting ISIL the supposed ability to foment a third World War might be excessive and irresponsible, stating that \"as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World WarIII just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.\"\nMultiple small wars as a \"third war\".\nIn multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World WarI andII to the ongoing lower-intensity wars of the 21st century, Pope Francis has said, \"The world is at war because it has lost the peace\", and \"perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal\". His successor, Pope Leo XIV, reiterated the description during a visit to Turkey in 2025.\nHypothetical scenarios.\nIn 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of World War\u00a0II, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible World War\u00a0III would be so catastrophic upon human civilization so as to revert mankind to the Stone Age. When asked by journalist Alfred Werner what types of weapons Einstein believed World WarIII might be fought with, Einstein warned, \"\"I know not with what weapons World WarIII will be fought, but World WarIV will be fought with sticks and stones\"\".\nAs for the extermination of the human race as a consequence of atomic war, Leslie A. White challenged Einstein, \"this too may be admitted as possibility, and all we can say is that if it is to come, it will come. Extravagant expressions of horror will not alter the course of events.\" Crane Brinton also doubted the psychological pacification of Einstein: \"Teachers, preachers, educators, even politicians are telling the growing generation that there must be no war and, therefore, there will be no war. I have doubts as to whether this is wise teaching...\" In spite of the atomic bomb, there will be another general war and humanity will survive it, according to Brinton. James Burnham of the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the CIA), also believed in survival: The uniqueness of the atomic weapons is commonly found in that they can totally annihilate human life, including through climatic and geological chain reaction, but such is not the case. The great principles of military strategy stand unaltered. An atomic war will look different from older wars but it will be decided by the same combination of resources, morale and strategy.\nA 1998 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" overview found that \"Although many people believe that the threat of a nuclear attack largely disappeared with the end of the Cold War, there is considerable evidence to the contrary\". In particular, the United States\u2013Russia mutual detargeting agreement in 1994 was largely symbolic and did not change the amount of time required to launch an attack. The most likely \"accidental-attack\" scenario was believed to be a retaliatory launch due to a false warning, similar to the 1983 incident. Historically, World War\u00a0I happened through an escalating crisis; World War\u00a0II happened through deliberate action. Hypothesized flashpoints in the 2010s and the 2020s include the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Estonia-Russia tensions (see Narva scenario), Chinese expansion into adjacent islands and seas, Sino-Indian border dispute, Chinese threats of military operation against Taiwan, Indo-Pakistani border conflicts, and foreign involvement in the Syrian civil war. Other hypothesized risks are that a war involving or between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Israel and Iran, United States and Iran, Poland and Belarus, South Korea and North Korea, or Taiwan and China could escalate via alliances or intervention into a war between \"great powers\" such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, India, Japan or an all out war between military alliances NATO and CSTO, or even the possibility of a \"rogue commander\" under any nuclear power might launch an unauthorized strike that escalates into a full-blown war.\nAccording to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal \"Nature Food\" in August 2022, a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, releasing over 150 Tg of stratospheric soot, could indirectly kill more than five billion people by starvation during a nuclear winter. More than two billion people could die of starvation from a smaller-scale (5\u201347\u2009Tg) nuclear war between India and Pakistan. In the event of a nuclear war between Russia and the United States, 99% of the population in the belligerent countries, as well as Europe and China, would die.\nSome scenarios involve risks due to upcoming changes from the known status quo. In the 1980s the Strategic Defense Initiative made an effort at nullifying the USSR's nuclear arsenal; some analysts believe the initiative was \"destabilizing\". In his book \"Destined for War\", Graham Allison views the global rivalry between the established power, the US, and the rising power, China, as an example of the Thucydides Trap. Allison states that historically, \"12 of 16 past cases where a rising power has confronted a ruling power\" have led to fighting. In 2020 and 2023, the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" advanced its Doomsday Clock, citing among other factors a predicted destabilizing effect from upcoming hypersonic weapons.\nEmerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, could hypothetically generate risk in the decades ahead. A 2018 RAND Corporation report has argued that AI and associated information technology \"will have a large effect on nuclear-security issues in the next quarter century\". A hypothetical future AI could provide a destabilizing ability to track \"second-launch\" launchers. Incorporating AI into decision support systems used to decide whether to launch, could also generate new risks, including the risk of an adversarial exploitation of such an AI's algorithms by a third party to trigger a launch recommendation. A perception that some sort of emerging technology would lead to \"world domination\" might also be destabilizing, for example by leading to fear of a pre-emptive strike.\nCyberwarfare is the exploitation of technology by a nation-state or international organization to attack and destroy the opposing nation's information networks and computers. The damage can be caused by computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks (DoS). Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly common, threatening cybersecurity and making it a global priority. There has been a proliferation of state-sponsored attacks. The trends of these attacks suggest the potential of a cyber World War III. The world's leading militaries are developing cyber strategies, including ways to alter the enemy's command and control systems, early warning systems, logistics, and transportation. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns about a large-scale cyberattack, with Russia having previously launched cyberattacks to compromise organizations across Ukraine. Nearly 40 discrete attacks were launched by Russia which permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations, with 40% aimed at critical infrastructure sectors in Ukraine. Russia's use of cyberwarfare has turned the war into a large-scale \"hybrid\" war in Ukraine.\nIn fiction.\nThe concept of World War III is a common trope of science fiction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
