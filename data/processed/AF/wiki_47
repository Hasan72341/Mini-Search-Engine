It is often denoted using the \"percent sign\" (%), although the abbreviations \"pct.\", \"pct\", and sometimes \"pc\" are also used. A percentage is a dimensionless number (pure number), primarily used for expressing proportions, but percent is nonetheless a unit of measurement in its orthography and usage.\nExamples.\nFor example, 45% (read as \"forty-five percent\") is equal to the fraction , or 0.45. \nPercentages are often used to express a proportionate part of a total.\nExample 1.\nIf 50% of the total number of students in the class are male, that means that 50 out of every 100 students are male. If there are 500 students, then 250 of them are male.\nExample 2.\nAn increase of $0.15 on a price of $2.50 is an increase by a fraction of = 0.06. Expressed as a percentage, this is a 6% increase.\nWhile many percentage values are between 0 and 100, there is no mathematical restriction and percentages may take on other values. For example, it is common to refer to values such as 111% or \u221235%, especially for percent changes and comparisons.\nHistory.\nIn Ancient Rome, long before the existence of the decimal system, computations were often made in fractions in the multiples of . For example, Augustus levied a tax of on goods sold at auction known as \"centesima rerum venalium\". Computation with these fractions was equivalent to computing percentages.\nAs denominations of money grew in the Middle Ages, computations with a denominator of 100 became increasingly standard, such that from the late 15th century to the early 16th century, it became common for arithmetic texts to include such computations. Many of these texts applied these methods to profit and loss, interest rates, and the Rule of Three. By the 17th century, it was standard to quote interest rates in hundredths.\nPercent sign.\nThe term \"percent\" is derived from the Latin \"per centum\", meaning \"hundred\" or \"by the hundred\". \nThe sign for \"percent\" evolved by gradual contraction of the Italian term \"per cento\", meaning \"for a hundred\". The \"per\" was often abbreviated as \"p.\"\u2014eventually disappeared entirely. The \"cento\" was contracted to two circles separated by a horizontal line, from which the modern \"%\" symbol is derived.\nCalculations.\nThe percent value is computed by multiplying the numeric value of the ratio by 100. For example, to find 50 apples as a percentage of 1,250 apples, one first computes the ratio = 0.04, and then multiplies by 100 to obtain 4%. The percent value can also be found by multiplying first instead of later, so in this example, the 50 would be multiplied by 100 to give 5,000, and this result would be divided by 1,250 to give 4%.\nTo calculate a percentage of a percentage, convert both percentages to fractions of 100, or to decimals, and multiply them. For example, 50% of 40% is:\n\u00d7 = 0.50 \u00d7 0.40 = 0.20 = = 20%.\nIt is not correct to divide by 100 and use the percent sign at the same time; it would literally imply division by 10,000. For example, 25% = = 0.25, not , which actually is = 0.0025. A term such as % would also be incorrect, since it would be read as 1 percent, even if the intent was to say 100%.\nWhenever communicating about a percentage, it is important to specify what it is relative to (i.e., what is the total that corresponds to 100%). The following problem illustrates this point.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a certain college 60% of all students are female, and 10% of all students are computer science majors. If 5% of female students are computer science majors, what percentage of computer science majors are female?\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of female computer science majors to all computer science majors. We know that 60% of all students are female, and among these 5% are computer science majors, so we conclude that \u00d7 = or 3% of all students are female computer science majors. Dividing this by the 10% of all students that are computer science majors, we arrive at the answer: = or 30% of all computer science majors are female.\nThis example is closely related to the concept of conditional probability.\nBecause of the commutative property of multiplication, reversing expressions does not change the result; for example, 50% of 20 is 10, and 20% of 50 is 10.\nVariants of the percentage calculation.\nThe calculation of percentages is carried out and taught in different ways depending on the prerequisites and requirements. In this way, the usual formulas can be obtained with proportions, which saves them from having to remember them. In so-called mental arithmetic, the intermediary question is usually asked what 100% or 1% is (corresponds to).\nExample:\n42\u00a0kg is 7%. How much is (corresponds to) 100%?Given are \"W\" (percentage) and \"p\" % (percentage).We are looking for \"G\" (basic value).\nPercentage increase and decrease.\nDue to inconsistent usage, it is not always clear from the context what a percentage is relative to. When speaking of a \"10% rise\" or a \"10% fall\" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the \"initial value\" of that quantity. For example, if an item is initially priced at $200 and the price rises 10% (an increase of $20), the new price will be $220. Note that this final price is 110% of the initial price (100% + 10% = 110%).\nSome other examples of percent changes:\nIn general, a change of \"x\" percent in a quantity results in a final amount that is 100\u00a0+\u00a0\"x\" percent of the original amount (equivalently, (1\u00a0+\u00a00.01\"x\") times the original amount).\nCompounding percentages.\nPercent changes applied sequentially \"do not add up\" in the usual way. For example, if the 10% increase in price considered earlier (on the $200 item, raising its price to $220) is followed by a 10% decrease in the price (a decrease of $22), then the final price will be $198\u2014\"not\" the original price of $200. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the two percent changes (+10% and \u221210%) are measured relative to different initial values ($200 and $220, respectively), and thus do not \"cancel out\".\nIn general, if an increase of \"x\" percent is followed by a decrease of \"x\" percent, and the initial amount was \"p\", the final amount is \"p\"(1 + 0.01\"x\")(1 \u2212 0.01\"x\") = \"p\"(1 \u2212 (0.01\"x\")2); hence the net change is an overall decrease by \"x\" percent \"of\" \"x\" percent (the square of the original percent change when expressed as a decimal number). Thus, in the above example, after an increase and decrease of \"x\" = 10 percent, the final amount, $198, was 10% of 10%, or 1%, less than the initial amount of $200. The net change is the same for a decrease of \"x\" percent, followed by an increase of \"x\" percent; the final amount is \"p\"(1 - 0.01\"x\")(1 + 0.01\"x\") = \"p\"(1 \u2212 (0.01\"x\")2).\nThis can be expanded for a case where one does not have the same percent change. If the initial amount \"p\" leads to a percent change \"x\", and the second percent change is \"y\", then the final amount is \"p\"(1 + 0.01\"x\")(1 + 0.01\"y\"). To change the above example, after an increase of \"x\" = 10 percent and decrease of \"y\" = \u22125 percent, the final amount, $209, is 4.5% more than the initial amount of $200.\nAs shown above, percent changes can be applied in any order and have the same effect.\nIn the case of interest rates, a very common but ambiguous way to say that an interest rate rose from 10% per annum to 15% per annum, for example, is to say that the interest rate increased by 5%, which could \"theoretically\" mean that it increased from 10% per annum to 10.5% per annum. It is clearer to say that the interest rate increased by 5 percentage points (pp). The same confusion between the different concepts of percent(age) and percentage points can potentially cause a major misunderstanding when journalists report about election results, for example, expressing both new results and differences with earlier results as percentages. For example, if a party obtains 41% of the vote and this is said to be a 2.5% increase, does that mean the earlier result was 40% (since 41 = 40 \u00d7 (1 + )) or 38.5% (since 41 = 38.5 + 2.5)?\nIn financial markets, it is common to refer to an increase of one percentage point (e.g. from 3% per annum to 4% per annum) as an increase of \"100 basis points\".\nWord and symbol.\nIn most forms of English, \"percent\" is usually written as two words (\"per cent\"), although \"percentage\" and \"percentile\" are written as one word. In American English, \"percent\" is the most common variant (but \"per mille\" is written as two words).\nIn the early 20th century, there was a dotted abbreviation form \"\"per cent.\", as opposed to \"per cent\". The form \"per cent.\"\" is still in use in the highly formal language found in certain documents like commercial loan agreements (particularly those subject to, or inspired by, common law), as well as in the \"Hansard\" transcripts of British Parliamentary proceedings. The term has been attributed to Latin \"per centum\". The symbol for percent (%) evolved from a symbol abbreviating the Italian \"per cento\". In some other languages, the form \"procent\" or \"prosent\" is used instead. Some languages use both a word derived from \"percent\" and an expression in that language meaning the same thing, e.g. Romanian \"procent\" and \"la sut\u0103\" (thus, \"10%\" can be read or sometimes written \"ten for [each] hundred\", similarly with the English \"one out of ten\"). Other abbreviations are rarer, but sometimes seen.\nGrammar and style guides often differ as to how percentages are to be written. For instance, it is commonly suggested that the word percent (or per cent) be spelled out in all texts, as in \"1\u00a0percent\" and not \"1%\". Other guides prefer the word to be written out in humanistic texts, but the symbol to be used in scientific texts. Most guides agree that they always be written with a numeral, as in \"5\u00a0percent\" and not \"five percent\", the only exception being at the beginning of a sentence: \"Ten percent of all writers love style guides.\" Decimals are also to be used instead of fractions, as in \"3.5 percent of the gain\" and not \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 percent of the gain\". However the titles of bonds issued by governments and other issuers use the fractional form, e.g. \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442% Unsecured Loan Stock 2032 Series 2\". (When interest rates are very low, the number 0 is included if the interest rate is less than 1%, e.g. \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;0+3\u20444% Treasury Stock\", not \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444% Treasury Stock\".) It is also widely accepted to use the percent symbol (%) in tabular and graphic material.\nIn line with common English practice, style guides\u2014such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\"\u2014generally state that the number and percent sign are written without any space in between.\nHowever, the International System of Units and the ISO 31-0 standard require a space.\nOther uses.\nPercent used to indicate a road's steepness down.\nThe word \"percentage\" is often a misnomer in the context of sports statistics, when the referenced number is expressed as a decimal proportion, not a percentage: \"The Phoenix Suns' Shaquille O'Neal led the NBA with a .609 field goal percentage (FG%) during the 2008\u201309 season.\" (O'Neal made 60.9% of his shots, not 0.609%.) Likewise, the winning percentage of a team, the fraction of matches that the club has won, is also usually expressed as a decimal proportion; a team that has a .500 winning percentage has won 50% of their matches. The practice is probably related to the similar way that batting averages are quoted.\nAs \"percent\" it is used to describe the grade or slope, the steepness of a road or railway, formula for which is 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100. This is the ratio of distances a vehicle would advance vertically and horizontally, respectively, when going up- or downhill, expressed in percent.\nPercentage is also used to express composition of a mixture by mass percent and mole percent.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used as a plate. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, herbs, chilies, or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.\n\"Tamale\" is an anglicized version of the Spanish word (plural: ). comes from the Nahuatl .\nThe English \"tamale\" is a back-formation from , with English speakers applying English pluralization rules, and thus interpreting the \"-e-\" as part of the stem, rather than part of the plural suffix \"-es\".\nOrigin.\nTamales originated in Mesoamerica as early as 8000 to 5000 BC.\nThe preparation of tamales is likely to have spread from the indigenous cultures in Mesoamerica to the rest of the Americas. According to archaeologists Karl Taube, William Saturno, and David Stuart, tamales may date from around 100 AD. They found pictorial references in the Mural of San Bartolo, in Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala.\nThe Aztec and Maya civilizations, as well as the Olmec and Toltec before them, used tamales as easily portable food for hunting trips, traveling large distances, and nourishing their armies. Tamales were also considered sacred, as they were seen as the food of the gods. The Aztec, Maya, Olmecs, and Toltecs as peoples considered corn as a central part of their cultural identity, so tamales played a large part in their rituals and festivals.\nMesoamerica.\nAztec.\nThe different forms of tamales eaten and sold in Aztec markets are well documented in the extensive Florentine Codex written by Reverend Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan. In book X he describes how Aztec tamales used a variety of corn for their flour base and were cooked in earth ovens, or olla, which were heated by the steam of dried cane grown and harvested for the express purpose of cooking tamales. Fillings would consist of meat (turkey, fish, frog, axolotl, gopher), fruit, bean, squash seed, turkey egg and even no filling. They would be seasoned with chilis or seeds if they were savory and honey if they were sweet.\nTamales also held great religious and spiritual importance within Aztec culture. It was customary for Aztec women to stay up for two to three days cooking tamales before a wedding. (Codex, Book IX). In terms of festivities, the most notable was Uauhquiltamalcualiztli, which was celebrated during the 18th month of the calendar round. The name of the celebration translates to 'The Eating of Tamales Stuffed with Amaranth Greens' and was a celebration of the fire deity Ixcozauhqui. Another significant ritual for the Aztecs was the feast of Atamalcualiztli (eating of water tamales). This ritual, held every eight years for a whole week, was done by eating tamales without any seasoning, spices, or filling, which allowed the maize freedom from being overworked in the usual tamale cooking methods.\nMaya (pre-Columbian).\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the Mayas ate tamales and often served them at feasts and festivals. The Classic Maya hieroglyph for tamales has been identified on pots and other objects dating back to the Classic Era (200\u20131000 CE), although they likely were eaten much earlier. Tamales appear often in ceramic ware from the Mayan Classic era (200\u20131000 CE). The Fenton vase shows a plate of unwrapped tamales being offered as a penance to a powerful Mayan nobleman. While tortillas are the basis for the contemporary Maya diet, remarkably little evidence exists for tortilla production among the Classic period Maya. A lack of griddles in the archaeological record suggests that the primary foodstuff of the Mesoamerican diet may have been the \"tamal\", a cooked, vegetal-wrapped mass of maize dough. Tamales are cooked without the use of ceramic technologies and therefore the form of the tamale is thought to predate the tortilla. Similarities between the two maize products can be found in both the ingredients, preparation techniques, and the linguistic ambiguity exhibited by the pan-Mayan term \"wa\" referring to a basic, daily consumed maize product that can refer to either tortillas or tamales.\nToltec.\nWhile the exact origin of tamales has yet to be determined, the oldest people confirmed to have eaten them were the Toltecs, as archaeologists have found fossilized corn husks around the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan. (c. 250 BC \u2013 750 CE)\nNorth America.\nBelize.\nThe tamale is a staple in Belize, where it is also known as \"dukunu\", a sweet corn tamale that gets its name from the Garifuna people. Dukunus are mostly vegetarian and consist of roasted corn kernels blended with coconut milk as a base. Butter, salt, and sugar are also added. Dukunus filled with different meats are also made.\nEl Salvador.\nTamales are a traditional dish in El Salvador. Tamales are typically eaten during holidays, like Christmas. Salvadoran tamales have a corn masa base and are wrapped in banana leaves. They contain fillings like chicken, vegetables, and/or beans. Corn tamales, or \"tamales de elote\", are also popular. Bean tamales, or \"tamales pisques\", are also consumed, typically during Holy Week.\nGuatemala.\nPre-Columbian Guatemala.\nIn the classical times of the Maya of Central America (Guatemala in particular), the great Mayan lords delighted in a baked dough bun during the winter solstice, made of maize mixed with turkey, \"tepezcuintle\" (lowland paca) or venison, spices, and chili pepper, among other ingredients.\nThis meal was later integrated into modern Guatemalan traditions. For example, on Christmas Eve, families prepare black, red, or sweet tamales for family and friends to show gratitude. The tamales are often accompanied with chocolate, yolk bread, and punch, and participate in the Mass of Gallo, at midnight.\nIn Guatemala, eating tamales at midnight on December 24 and 31 is customary. Guatemalans also eat tamales for holiday celebrations, birthdays, and baptisms, so the tamale is considered an important dish in the culture of Guatemala.\nGuatemala has many tamale varieties, from the traditional corn-husked tamale called a , to a sweet version of tamale, which uses the same corn dough, but is seasoned with honey or sugar combined with chocolate, almonds, plums, seeds, and peppers. Tamales are sold in stores and private homes (especially on Saturdays). A red light on a home at night is a sign that tamales are for sale at that home.\nNicaragua.\nThe most popular version of the Tamal in Nicaragua is the \"nacatamal\" and sometimes serves as an entire meal in itself. It is a traditional dish with indigenous origins. The name comes from the Nawat language spoken by the Nicarao, who were situated on the Southern Pacific coast of Nicaragua, and translates to \"meat tamale\". The is perhaps the most produced within traditional Nicaraguan cuisine and it is an event often reserved for Sundays at mid-morning. It is usually eaten together with fresh bread and coffee. Enjoying during special occasions and to invite extended family and neighbors to also partake is a common occurrence.\n are much larger in size in comparison to their counterparts, and made up of mostly nixtamalized corn (a kind of dough traditionally made from a process called ) and lard). The masa and liquified concoction of onion, garlic, tomato, salt, (annatto), naranja agria and bell pepper is cooked and the result becomes the base for the nacatamal and it is also referred to as . This base is ladled onto plantain leaves used for wrapping into large individual portions. The filling usually consists of annatto-seasoned pork meat, rice, slices of potatoes, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions; olives, spearmint sprigs, and chile congo, a very small, egg-shaped chile found in Nicaragua. On occasion, prunes, raisins, or capers can be added. The \"masa\" and filling are then wrapped in plantain leaves, tied with a string, and made into pillow-shaped bundles \u2013 . They are then steamed or pressure-cooked for several hours. The entire process is very labor-intensive, and it often requires preparation over the course of two days; involving the whole family may be needed to complete it.\nModern Mexico.\nIn the present day, it is common in certain Maya areas to steam tamales in a spherical vessel known as a \"tamalero,\" as opposed to boiling them\",\" this practice has been linked back to the Classic Maya period due to the presence of boiler scale in Classic Maya pottery. The other common method of cooking tamales was on a \"comal\" which is a large flat stone, this method is also used to cook tortillas. In addition to the leaves of plantain and banana which are commonly used today, Mayan tamales were commonly wrapped in the leaves of avocado or piper plants, which would be gathered by men during the rainy season. While meat and fish were the customary fillings of tamales of this era, squash seeds and flowers, and greens such as \"chaya,\" or \"chipilin\" were also common. Fray Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n also spoke of 'special breads' [tamales] which were used specifically as offerings, with fillings such as deer heart, or quail. Because of the convenience offered by tamales, specific tamales were made for hunters and travelers. These tamales were cooked with extra wood ashes in order to create a hard 'shell' around the tamales when dried, this allowed tamales to keep for up to 20 days.\nTamales begin with a dough made from ground nixtamalized corn (hominy), called \"masa\", or alternatively a rehydrated \"masa\" powder, such as Maseca. It is combined with lard or vegetable shortening, along with broth or water, to bring the dough to the consistency of a very thick batter. It is traditional to whisk the lard, and whisk the resulting batter, with the intent of producing the signature soft and fluffy texture. Modern recipes may use baking powder to achieve a similar effect. Chili purees or dried chili powders are also occasionally added to the batter, which in addition to the spice can cause some tamales to appear red in color. Tamales are generally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves before being steamed, with the choice of husk depending on the region. They usually have a sweet or savory filling and are usually steamed until firm.\nTamale-making is a ritual that has been part of Mexican life since pre-Hispanic times, when special fillings and forms were designated for each specific festival or life event. Today, tamales are typically filled with meats, cheese, or vegetables, especially chilies. Preparation is complex and time-consuming, and an excellent example of Mexican communal cooking, where this task usually falls to the women. Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot \"atole\" or \"champurrado\" and \"arroz con leche\" (rice porridge, \"rice with milk\") or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin. Street vendors can be seen serving them from huge, steaming, covered pots () or \"ollas\".\nInstead of corn husks, banana or plantain leaves are used in tropical parts of the country, such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. These tamales are rather square in shape, often very large\u201415\u00a0inches (40\u00a0cm)\u2014and these larger tamales are commonly known as \"pibs\" in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Another very large type of tamale is , made in the Huasteca region of Mexico. Depending on the size, can feed between 50 and 200 people; they are made during festivals and holidays, for quincea\u00f1eras, and on Sundays to be sold at the markets.\nCaribbean.\nCuba.\nIn Cuba, before the 1959 Revolution, street vendors sold Mexican-style tamales wrapped in corn husks, usually made without any kind of spicy seasoning. Cuban tamales being identical in form to those made in Mexico City suggests they were brought over to Cuba during the period of intense cultural and musical exchange between Cuba and Mexico after the 1920s.\nA well-known Cuban song from the 1950s, \"\", (a cha-cha-cha sung by Orquesta Arag\u00f3n) celebrated the delicious tamales sold by a street vendor in Cienfuegos. A peculiarly Cuban invention is the dish known as , basically consisting of tamale masa with the meat stuffing stirred into the masa, and then cooked in a pot on the stove to form a kind of hearty cornmeal porridge.\nDominican Republic.\nIn the Dominican Republic, are Dominican tamales stuffed with \"picadillo\". The name has its origin in the native Ta\u00ednos.\nPuerto Rico.\n\"Guanime\" is a Puerto Rican dish that can be traced back to pre-Columbian times. It consists of corn masa that is stuffed with beans, seafood, nuts, or meat, and then wrapped in corn husks slowly cooked on a grill.\n are prepared in a plain version, without the stuffing, and served with stewed salted cod fish. Since the arrival of Europeans, have lost their stuffing. Contemporary are made with corn masa seasoned with coconut milk, lard, broth, and annatto, wrapped in a banana leaf or corn husk.\nThe several versions of can be made with green plantains, cassava, and a sweet version made with sweet plantains and cornmeal.\nThe is also related to the pastel, a root tamale dating to around the same time as the native Ta\u00edno .\nTrinidad and Tobago.\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the dish is called a \"pastelle\" and is popular in many households during the entire Christmas season and New Year celebrations. It is usually made with cornmeal and filled with cooked, seasoned meat (chicken and beef being the most popular), raisins, olives, capers, and other seasonings. The entire \"pastelle\" is wrapped in a banana leaf, bound with twine and steamed. When fully cooked, the banana leaf is removed to reveal the brightly yellow-colored dish. It is often enjoyed as is or along with a meal. The sweet version is called \"paymee\".\nJamaica.\nIn Jamaica, there is a traditional dessert called duckunoo or \"duckanoo\", also referred to as \"tie-a-leaf\" or \"blue drawers\" (draws). It is a variation of \"tamal dulce (sweet tamale)\", and is typically made with batata or sweet potato, coconut, and/or cornmeal, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and anise, brown sugar, coconut milk and vanilla. Sometimes, raisins and grated green banana are added. The mixture is tied up in a banana leaf or corn husk, and then cooked in boiling water. \nSimilarly, it is also made in Belize, Haiti, French Guiana and some other Caribbean islands. Other names include: \"dokonon\" (in French Guiana), \"doukounou\" (in Haiti), \"paime\" (in Trinidad &amp; Tobago), penmi (in St Lucia) and \"dukunu\" / \"ducunu\" or \"tamalito\" (in Belize).\nSouth America.\nHumitas (from Quechua humint'a) is a Native South American dish from pre-Hispanic times, a traditional food from the Andes and it can be found in Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Northwest Argentina. It consists of fresh choclo (Peruvian corn) pounded to a paste, wrapped in a fresh corn husk, and slowly steamed or boiled in a pot of water. In Bolivia it is known as huminta and in Brazil as pamonha, made of fresh, not nixtamalized, corn paste.\nVenezuela.\nHallaca is a traditional meal from Venezuela that resembles the aspect of a tamal. It consists of corn dough stuffed with a stew of beef, pork, or chicken and other ingredients such as raisins, capers, and olives, fresh onion rings, red and green bell pepper slices. There are also vegetarian options with black beans or tofu. Hallacas are folded in plantain leaves, tied with strings, and boiled. The dish is traditionally served during the Christmas season and has several regional variants in Venezuela. It has been described as a national dish of Venezuela but it can be found also in variants. A characteristic of the hallaca is the delicate corn dough made with consomm\u00e9 or broth and lard colored with annatto.\nPeru.\nTamales were one of the dishes that the Peruvian chef Juan Jos\u00e9 Cabezudo was famous for serving from his food stand near the Plaza Mayor in Lima.\nPhilippines and Guam.\nIn the Philippines and Guam, which were governed by Spain as a province of Mexico, different forms of tamale-like foods exist. In the Philippines, they merged with the native leaf-wrapped rice cakes (\"kakanin\") and are made with a dough derived from ground rice and are filled with seasoned chicken or pork with the addition of peanuts and other seasonings such as sugar. In some places, such as Pampanga, where it is popularly known as \"bobotu\", and Batangas provinces, the tamales are wrapped in banana leaves, but sweet corn varieties from the Visayas region are wrapped in corn husks similar to the sweet corn tamales of the American Southwest and Mexico. Because of the work involved in the preparation of tamales, they usually only appear during the special holidays or other big celebrations. Various recipes have practically disappeared under the pressures of modern life and the ease of fast food. Several varieties of tamales are also found in the Philippines.\nTamales, \"tamalis\", \"tamalos\", and \"pasteles\" are different varieties found throughout the region. Some are sweet, some are savory, and some are sweet and savory. Mostly wrapped in banana leaves and made of rice, either the whole grain or ground and cooked with coconut milk and other seasonings, they are sometimes filled with meat and seafood, or are plain and have no filling. There are certain varieties, such as \"tamalos\", that are made of a sweet corn masa wrapped in a corn husk or leaf. There are also varieties made without masa, like \"tamalis\", which are made with small fish fry wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, similar to the from Mexico, where the small fish are cooked whole with herbs and seasonings wrapped inside a corn husk without masa. The number of varieties has dwindled through the years so certain types of tamales that were once popular in the Philippines have become lost or are simply memories. The variety found in Guam, known as \"tamales guiso\", is made with corn masa and wrapped in corn husks, and as with the Philippine tamales, are clear evidence of the influence of the galleon trade that occurred between the ports of Manila and Acapulco.\nUnited States.\nWhile Mexican-style and other Latin American-style tamales are featured at ethnic restaurants throughout the United States, some distinctly indigenous styles also are made.\nThe Choctaw and Chickasaw make a dish called \"banaha\", which can be stuffed or not (plain). Usually, the filling (ranging from none, fried bacon, turkey, deer, nuts, and vegetables such as onions, potatoes, squash, and sweet potatoes) can either be filled or mixed with the masa and steamed in a corn husk.\nCherokee tamales, also known as bean bread or \"broadswords\", were made with hominy (in the case of the Cherokee, the masa was made from corn boiled in water treated with wood ashes instead of lime) and beans, and wrapped in green corn leaves or large tree leaves and boiled, similar to the meatless pre-Columbian bean and masa tamales still prepared in Chiapas, central Mexico, and Guatemala.\nIn northern Louisiana, tamales have been made for several centuries. The Spanish established presidio Los Adaes in 1721 in modern-day Robeline, Louisiana. The descendants of these Spanish settlers from central Mexico were the first tamale makers to arrive in the eastern US. Zwolle, Louisiana, has a Tamale Fiesta every year in October.\nIn the Mississippi Delta, African Americans developed a spicy tamale called the hot tamale that is made from cornmeal instead of masa and is boiled in corn husks.\nTamales have been eaten in the broader United States since at least 1893, when they were featured at the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1894, when tamales were the most popular ethnic food in Los Angeles, XLNT Foods started making them. The company is the oldest continuously operating Mexican food brand in the United States, and one of the oldest companies in Southern California.\nA tradition of roving tamale sellers was documented in early 20th-century blues music. They are the subject of the well-known 1937 blues/ragtime song \"They're Red Hot\" by Robert Johnson.\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, the name \"tamale pie\" was given to meat pies and casseroles made with a cornmeal crust and typical tamale fillings arranged in layers. Although characterized as Mexican food, these forms are not popular in Mexican American culture in which the individually wrapped style is preferred.\nThe Indio International Tamale Festival held every December in Indio, California, has earned two Guinness World Records: the largest tamale festival (154 000 in attendance, December 2002) and the world's largest tamale, over one foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 40 feet (12.2 m) in length, created by Chef John Sedlar, since beaten by H. Ayuntamiento de Centro Villahermosa (Mexico) in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, on 25 November 2018. The current record stands at 50.05 m. The 2006 Guinness book calls the festival \"the world's largest cooking and culinary festival\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prior Ethernet speed was 10 Mbit/s. Of the Fast Ethernet physical layers, 100BASE-TX is by far the most common.\nFast Ethernet was introduced in 1995 as the IEEE 802.3u standard and remained the fastest version of Ethernet for three years before the introduction of Gigabit Ethernet. The acronym \"GE/FE\" is sometimes used for devices supporting both standards.\nNomenclature.\nThe \"100\" in the media type designation refers to the transmission speed of 100 Mbit/s, while the \"BASE\" refers to baseband signaling. The letter following the dash (\"T\" or \"F\") refers to the physical medium that carries the signal (twisted pair or fiber, respectively), while the last character (\"X\", \"4\", etc.) refers to the line code method used. Fast Ethernet is sometimes referred to as 100BASE-X, where \"X\" is a placeholder for the FX and TX variants.\nGeneral design.\nFast Ethernet is an extension of the 10-megabit Ethernet standard. It runs on twisted pair or optical fiber cable in a star wired bus topology, similar to the IEEE standard 802.3i called 10BASE-T, itself an evolution of 10BASE5 (802.3) and 10BASE2 (802.3a). Fast Ethernet devices are generally backward compatible with existing 10BASE-T systems, enabling plug-and-play upgrades from 10BASE-T. Most switches and other networking devices with ports capable of Fast Ethernet can perform autonegotiation, sensing a piece of 10BASE-T equipment and setting the port to 10BASE-T half duplex if the 10BASE-T equipment cannot perform autonegotiation itself. The standard specifies the use of CSMA/CD for media access control. A full-duplex mode is also specified and in practice, modern networks use Ethernet switches and operate in full-duplex mode, even as legacy devices that use half duplex still exist.\nA Fast Ethernet adapter can be logically divided into a media access controller (MAC), which deals with the higher-level issues of medium availability, and a physical layer interface (PHY). The MAC is typically linked to the PHY by a four-bit 25\u00a0MHz synchronous parallel interface known as a media-independent interface (MII), or by a two-bit 50\u00a0MHz variant called reduced media independent interface (RMII). In rare cases, the MII may be an external connection but is usually a connection between ICs in a network adapter or even two sections within a single IC. The specs are written based on the assumption that the interface between MAC and PHY will be an MII but they do not require it. Fast Ethernet or Ethernet hubs may use the MII to connect to multiple PHYs for their different interfaces.\nThe MII fixes the theoretical maximum data bit rate for all versions of Fast Ethernet to 100 Mbit/s. The information rate actually observed on real networks is less than the theoretical maximum, due to the necessary header and trailer (addressing and error-detection bits) on every Ethernet frame, and the required interpacket gap between transmissions.\nCopper.\n100BASE-T is any of several Fast Ethernet standards for twisted pair cables, including: 100BASE-TX (100 Mbit/s over two-pair Cat5 or better cable), 100BASE-T4 (100\u00a0Mbit/s over four-pair Cat3 or better cable, defunct), 100BASE-T2 (100 Mbit/s over two-pair Cat3 or better cable, also defunct). The segment length for a 100BASE-T cable is limited to (the same limit as 10BASE-T and gigabit Ethernet). All are or were standards under IEEE 802.3 (approved 1995). Almost all 100BASE-T installations are 100BASE-TX.\n100BASE-TX.\n100BASE-TX is the predominant form of Fast Ethernet, and runs over two pairs of wire inside a Category 5 or above cable. Cable distance between nodes can be up to . One pair is used for each direction, providing full-duplex operation at 100 Mbit/s in each direction.\nLike 10BASE-T, the active pairs in a standard connection are terminated on pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. Since a typical Category 5 cable contains four pairs and the performance requirements of 100BASE-TX do not exceed the capabilities of even the worst-performing pair, one typical cable can carry two 100BASE-TX links with a simple wiring adaptor on each end. Cabling is conventionally wired to one of ANSI/TIA-568's termination standards, T568A or T568B. 100BASE-TX uses pairs 2 and 3 (orange and green).\nThe configuration of 100BASE-TX networks is very similar to 10BASE-T. When used to build a local area network, the devices on the network (computers, printers etc.) are typically connected to a hub or switch, creating a star network. Alternatively, it is possible to connect two devices directly using a crossover cable. With today's equipment, crossover cables are generally not needed as most equipment supports auto-negotiation along with auto MDI-X to select and match speed, duplex and pairing.\nWith 100BASE-TX hardware, the raw bits, presented 4 bits wide clocked at 25\u00a0MHz at the MII, go through 4B5B binary encoding to generate a series of 0 and 1 symbols clocked at a 125\u00a0MHz symbol rate. The 4B5B encoding provides DC equalization and spectrum shaping. Just as in the 100BASE-FX case, the bits are then transferred to the physical medium attachment layer using NRZI encoding. However, 100BASE-TX introduces an additional, medium-dependent sublayer, which employs MLT-3 as a final encoding of the data stream before transmission, resulting in a maximum fundamental frequency of 31.25\u00a0MHz. The procedure is borrowed from the ANSI X3.263 FDDI specifications, with minor changes.\n100BASE-T1.\nIn 100BASE-T1 the data is transmitted over a single copper pair, 3 bits per symbol, each transmitted as code pair using PAM3. It supports full-duplex transmission. The twisted-pair cable is required to support 66\u00a0MHz, with a maximum length of 15\u00a0m. No specific connector is defined. The standard is intended for automotive applications or when Fast Ethernet is to be integrated into another application. It was developed as Open Alliance BroadR-Reach (OABR) before IEEE standardization.\n100BASE-T2.\nIn 100BASE-T2, standardized in IEEE 802.3y, the data is transmitted over two copper pairs, but these pairs are only required to be Category 3 (voice grade) rather than the Category 5 required by 100BASE-TX. Data is transmitted and received on both pairs simultaneously thus allowing full-duplex operation. Transmission uses 4 bits per symbol. The 4-bit symbol is expanded into two 3-bit symbols through a non-trivial scrambling procedure based on a linear-feedback shift register. This is needed to flatten the bandwidth and emission spectrum of the signal, as well as to match transmission line properties. The mapping of the original bits to the symbol codes is not constant in time and has a fairly large period (appearing as a pseudo-random sequence). The final mapping from symbols to PAM-5 line modulation levels obeys the table on the right. 100BASE-T2 was not widely adopted but the technology developed for it is used in 1000BASE-T.\n100BASE-T4.\n100BASE-T4 was an early implementation of Fast Ethernet. It required four twisted copper pairs of voice grade twisted pair (Category 3), a lower-performing cable compared to Category 5 cable used by 100BASE-TX. Maximum distance was limited to 100 meters. One pair was reserved for transmit and one for receive, and the remaining two switched direction. The fact that three pairs were used to transmit in each direction made 100BASE-T4 inherently half-duplex. Using three cable pairs allowed it to reach 100 Mbit/s while running at lower carrier frequencies, which allowed it to run on older cabling that many companies had recently installed for 10BASE-T networks.\nA very unusual 8B6T code was used to convert 8 data bits into 6 base-3 digits (the signal shaping is possible as there are nearly three times as many 6-digit base-3 numbers as there are 8-digit base-2 numbers). The two resulting 3-digit base-3 symbols were sent in parallel over three pairs using 3-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-3).\n100BASE-T4 was not widely adopted but some of the technology developed for it is used in 1000BASE-T. Very few hubs were released with 100BASE-T4 support. Some examples include the 3com 3C250-T4 Superstack II HUB 100, IBM 8225 Fast Ethernet Stackable Hub and Intel LinkBuilder FMS 100 T4. The same applies to network interface controllers. Bridging 100BASE-T4 with 100BASE-TX required additional network equipment.\n100BaseVG.\nProposed and marketed by Hewlett-Packard, 100BaseVG was an alternative design using category 3 cabling and a token concept instead of CSMA/CD. It was slated for standardization as IEEE 802.12 but it quickly vanished when switched 100BASE-TX became popular. The IEEE standard was later withdrawn.\nVG was similar to T4 in that it used more cable pairs combined with a lower carrier frequency to allow it to reach 100 Mbit/s on voice-grade cables. It differed in the way those cables were assigned. Whereas T4 would use the two extra pairs in different directions depending on the direction of data exchange, VG instead used two transmission modes. In one, control, two pairs are used for transmission and reception as in classic Ethernet, while the other two pairs are used for flow control. In the second mode, transmission, all four are used to transfer data in a single direction. The hubs implemented a token passing scheme to choose which of the attached nodes were allowed to communicate at any given time, based on signals sent to it from the nodes using control mode. When one node was selected to become active, it would switch to transfer mode, send or receive a packet, and return to control mode.\nThis concept was intended to solve two problems. The first was that it eliminated the need for collision detection and thereby reduced contention on busy networks. While any particular node may find itself throttled due to heavy traffic, the network as a whole would not end up losing efficiency due to collisions and the resulting rebroadcasts. Under heavy use, the total throughput was increased compared to the other standards. The other was that the hubs could examine the payload types and schedule the nodes based on their bandwidth requirements. For instance, a node sending a video signal may not require much bandwidth but will require it to be predictable in terms of when it is delivered. A VG hub could schedule access on that node to ensure it received the transmission timeslots it needed while opening up the network at all other times to the other nodes. This style of access was known as demand priority.\nFiber optics.\nFiber variants use fiber-optic cable with the listed interface types. Interfaces may be fixed or modular, often as Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP).\nFast Ethernet SFP ports.\nFast Ethernet speed is not available on all SFP ports, but supported by some devices. An SFP port for Gigabit Ethernet should not be assumed to be backwards compatible with Fast Ethernet.\nOptical interoperability.\nTo have interoperability there are some criteria that have to be met:\n100BASE-X Ethernet is not backward compatible with 10BASE-F and is not forward compatible with 1000BASE-X.\n100BASE-FX.\n100BASE-FX is a version of Fast Ethernet over optical fiber. The 100BASE-FX physical medium dependent (PMD) sublayer is defined by FDDI's PMD, so 100BASE-FX is not compatible with 10BASE-FL, the 10 Mbit/s version over optical fiber.\n100BASE-FX is still used for existing installation of multimode fiber where more speed is not required, like industrial automation plants.\n100BASE-LFX.\n100BASE-LFX is a non-standard term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 100BASE-FX but achieves longer distances up to 4\u20135\u00a0km over a pair of multi-mode fibers through the use of Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot laser transmitter running on 1310\u00a0nm wavelength. The signal attenuation per km at 1300\u00a0nm is about half the loss of 850\u00a0nm.\n100BASE-SX.\n100BASE-SX is a version of Fast Ethernet over optical fiber standardized in TIA/EIA-785-1-2002. It is a lower-cost, shorter-distance alternative to 100BASE-FX. Because of the shorter wavelength used (850\u00a0nm) and the shorter distance supported (up to 300\u00a0m), 100BASE-SX may use less expensive optical components.\nBecause it uses the same wavelength as 10BASE-FL, the 10 Mbit/s version of Ethernet over optical fiber, 100BASE-SX can be backward-compatible with 10BASE-FL. Cost and compatibility makes 100BASE-SX an option for those upgrading from 10BASE-FL and who do not require longer distances.\n100BASE-LX10.\n100BASE-LX10 is a version of Fast Ethernet over optical fiber standardized in 802.3ah-2004 clause 58. It has a 10\u00a0km reach over a pair of single-mode fibers.\n100BASE-BX10.\n100BASE-BX10 is a version of Fast Ethernet over optical fiber standardized in 802.3ah-2004 clause 58. It uses an optical multiplexer to split TX and RX signals into different wavelengths on the same fiber. It has a 10\u00a0km reach over a single strand of single-mode fiber.\n100BASE-EX.\n100BASE-EX is very similar to 100BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up to 40\u00a0km over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a LX10, running on 1310\u00a0nm wavelength lasers. 100BASE-EX is not a formal standard but industry-accepted term. It is sometimes referred to as 100BASE-LH (long haul), and is easily confused with 100BASE-LX10 or 100BASE-ZX because the use of -LX(10), -LH, -EX, and -ZX is ambiguous between vendors.\n100BASE-ZX.\n100BASE-ZX is a non-standard but multi-vendor term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission using 1,550\u00a0nm wavelength to achieve distances of at least 70\u00a0km over single-mode fiber. Some vendors specify distances up to 160\u00a0km over single-mode fiber, sometimes called 100BASE-EZX. Ranges beyond 80\u00a0km are highly dependent upon the path loss of the fiber in use, specifically the attenuation figure in dB per km, the number and quality of connectors/patch panels and splices located between transceivers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Any chamber used as a burial place is considered a catacomb, although the word is most commonly associated with the Roman Empire.\nEtymology and history.\nThe first place to be referred to as \"catacombs\" was the system of underground tombs between the 2nd and 3rd milestones of the Appian Way in Rome, where the bodies of the apostles Peter and Paul, among others, were said to have been buried. The name of that place in Late Latin was \"catacumbas\" (feminine nominative plural; the singular is \"catacumba\") \u2014 a word of obscure origin, possibly deriving from a proper name or a derivation of the Greek phrase \"cata cumbas\", \"below the quarries\". The word referred originally only to the Roman catacombs, but was extended by the 19th century to refer to any subterranean receptacle of the dead, as in the 18th-century Paris catacombs. The ancient Christians carved the first catacombs from soft tufa rock.\nAll Roman catacombs were located outside city walls since it was illegal to bury a dead body within the city, providing \"a place\u2026where martyrs' tombs could be openly marked\" and commemorative services and feasts held safely on sacred days.\nAround the world.\nCatacombs around the world include:\nThere are also catacomb-like burial chambers in Anatolia, Turkey; in Sousse, Tunisia; in Syracuse, Italy; Trier, Germany; Kyiv, Ukraine. Capuchin catacombs of Palermo, Sicily, were used as late as the 1920s. Catacombs were available in some of the grander English cemeteries founded in the 19th century, such as Sheffield General Cemetery (above ground) and West Norwood Cemetery (below ground). There are catacombs in Bulgaria near Aladzha Monastery and in Romania as medieval underground galleries in Bucharest. In Ukraine and Russia, catacomb (used in the local languages' plural \"katakomby\") also refers to the network of abandoned caves and tunnels earlier used to mine stone, especially limestone.\nIn Italy, possible Catacombs are also located in Alezio, beside the \"Sanctuary of Santa Maria dell'Assunta\", as well as the basement of \"Santa Maria della Lizza Sanctuary\".\nDecorations.\nCatacombs, although most notable as underground passageways and cemeteries, also house many decorations. There are thousands of decorations in the centuries-old catacombs of Rome, Paris, and other sites, some of which include inscriptions, paintings, statues, ornaments, and other items placed in the graves over the years.\nMost of these decorations were used to identify, immortalize and show respect for the dead. The catacombs of Rome were primarily decorated with images and words exalting Christ or depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. Much of the sculpture work and art, other than engravings on the walls or tombs, has been preserved in places such as the Museum of Saint John Lateran, Christian Museum of Berlin University, and the Vatican.\nThree representations of Christ as Orpheus charming animals with peaceful music have been found in the catacombs of Domatilla and St. Callista. Another figure was made of gilded glass and dates back to the fourth century, featuring Jesus with the world balanced in his hand and a scroll at his feet.\nInscriptions.\nAlthough thousands of inscriptions were lost as time passed, many of those remaining indicate the social rank or job title of its inhabitants; however, most of the inscriptions simply indicate how loving a couple was, or the love of parents and such. A common and particularly interesting one found in Roman catacombs is the Ichthys, or \"Monogram of Christ\" which reads \u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3, standing for \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior\".\nBacteria.\nIn recent years unique strains of bacteria have been discovered that thrive in catacombs, inducing mineral efflorescence and decay. These include \"Kribbella sancticallisti\", \"Kribbella catacumbae\", and three types of non-thermophilic (low-temperature) \"Rubrobacter\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The organization focuses on empowering young people to make a progressive social impact. The AIESEC network includes approximately 40,000 members in 120+ countries.\nAIESEC is a non-governmental in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), is an independent arm of the UN DPI and UN's Office of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth, member of ICMYO, and is recognized by UNESCO. AIESEC's international headquarters are in Montreal, Canada.\nName.\n\"AIESEC\" (pronounced: eye-sek) was originally a French acronym for (English: International Association of Students in Economics and Business). The full name is no longer officially used, as members can now be graduate and undergraduate from any university background.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe idea behind AIESEC started after World War II, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students had been carrying out internships in other countries, mostly on their own initiative, but this came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II. In 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of Czechoslovakia) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium), founded \"AIESEC\" on July 2, 1948, under the name (\"AIESEc\") with a headquarter in Prague and Jaroslav Zich as the first President of the association.\nAt the time of AIESEC's founding at the end of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to itAIESEC in Estonias population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem. AIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. In 1948, a renewing development of the association was initiated, with implementation of international meetings (congresses), replacing the practice of governance from the headquarter. The first broad meeting was held by students from 9 universities of 7 countries in April 1948 in Li\u00e8ge (Belgium). Then the official, constitutive assembly (the congress) was organized in 1949 in Stockholm with Bengt Sj\u04e7strand as the President and Sweden as the Presiding Country for 1949/1950. Students from seven nations: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, came together for that first International Congress of AIESEC.\nIn 1949, 89 students were exchanged by AIESEC among the member nations. The next two annual congresses were conducted in Stockholm, presided by Bengt Sj\u04e7strand, and in Paris, presided by Jean Choplin, respectively. At those congresses the organization's mission was stated: \"to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.\" Also a constitution for the organization defined a purpose: \"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members.\"\nGlobal expansion.\nThe organization grew exponentially in the following years, with more than 1,000 exchanges taking place in 1955 alone. In the following few years, AIESEC quickly became global by establishing its first North American member, the United States, in 1957, and its first South American and African members, Colombia, Venezuela, and South Africa, in 1958.\nFor the first years of its existence, AIESEC had no central governing body, but was instead managed jointly by a Presiding Country Committee composed of the National Committee Presidents of each member nation. As the organization grew, a central governing body was created and led by a democratically elected Secretary General. Morris Wolff, from the United States, was chosen as the first Secretary General in 1960, and established the first permanent international office for AIESEC in Geneva, Switzerland. Over the following decade, AIESEC expanded to eastern Asia, Australia, and deeper within Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, having a presence in 43 countries by 1969.\nIn 2010, AIESEC surpassed 10,000 exchanges delivered in a single year for the first time. By 2020, more than 230,000 interactions will have been provided.\nProjects.\nMembership.\nAIESEC members are typically young people aged 18 to 30 who participate in the organization\u2019s leadership, management, and exchange programs. Members take part in organizing events, facilitating international internships, and managing local chapters worldwide. The membership model emphasizes leadership development, cultural exchange, and global networking.\nGlobal Talent.\nGlobal Talent is a professional internship program under AIESEC that places young adults, generally between 18 and 30 years old, in startups, small and medium enterprises, or multinational corporations abroad. The internships last from six weeks to one and a half years depending on the placement. Participants gain practical work experience, develop cross-cultural competencies, and build global professional networks, with support from AIESEC throughout the application, placement, and logistical process.\nGlobal Teacher.\nGlobal Teacher is a teaching internship program offered by AIESEC, aimed at individuals aged 18\u201330 with prior teaching experience and language proficiency. Internships typically last between six and seventy-eight weeks and include responsibilities such as lesson planning, classroom management, and intercultural engagement. The program provides salary or stipend support, professional development opportunities, and logistical assistance including visa processing, accommodation, and onboarding. AIESEC collaborates with over 300 educational institutions across more than 35 countries, involving more than 1,000 young educators annually.\nGlobal Host program.\nGlobal Host is an AIESEC program that enables individuals and organizations to host international interns and volunteers locally. The program supports cultural exchange and global understanding by providing opportunities for young people from various countries to live and work within host communities and businesses. Hosts engage with diverse cultures while facilitating the personal and professional development of participants. The program operates in multiple countries and partners with startups, SMEs, NGOs, and other organizations offering practical work experiences and community projects.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn July 2015, AIESEC was recognized for the ninth time on the WorldBlu list of \"Most Freedom Centred Workplaces.\" Organizations are included on the list based on a Freedom at Work assessment completed by employees. The assessment evaluates organizational design on a spectrum from fear-based to freedom-centred across leadership, individual performance, and systems and processes. The recognition reflects AIESEC\u2019s commitment to fostering an autonomous workplace culture.\nMembers.\nAs of 2023, AIESEC is found in 100+ countries and territories worldwide, including:\nAlumni.\nThis is a non-exhaustive list of notable AIESEC alumni:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64578", "revid": "33316798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64578", "title": "History of Iceland", "text": "The recorded history of Iceland began with the settlement by Viking explorers and the people they enslaved from Western Europe, particularly in modern-day Norway and the British Isles, in the late ninth century. Iceland was still uninhabited long after the rest of Western Europe had been settled. Recorded settlement has conventionally been dated back to 874, although place names and storytellings indicate Gaelic monks from Ireland, known as papar from sagas, may have settled Iceland earlier.\nThe land was settled quickly, mainly by Norsemen who may have been fleeing conflict or seeking new land to farm. By 930, the chieftains had established a form of governance, the \"Althing\", making it one of the world's oldest parliaments. Towards the end of the tenth century, Christianity came to Iceland through the influence of the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason. During this time, Iceland remained independent, a period known as the Old Commonwealth, and Icelandic historians began to document the nation's history in books referred to as sagas of Icelanders. In the early thirteenth century, the internal conflict known as the age of the Sturlungs weakened Iceland, which eventually became subjugated to Norway over the 13th century. The Old Covenant (1262\u20131264), and the adoption of J\u00f3nsb\u00f3k (1281) effectively ended the Icelandic Commonwealth. Norway, in turn, was united with Sweden (1319) and then Denmark (1376). Eventually all of the Nordic states were united in one alliance, the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523), but on its dissolution, Iceland fell under Danish rule. The subsequent strict Danish\u2013Icelandic Trade Monopoly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was detrimental to the economy. Iceland's resultant poverty was aggravated by severe natural disasters like the M\u00f3\u00f0uhar\u00f0indin or \"Mist Hardships\". During this time, the population declined.\nIceland remained part of Denmark, but in keeping with the rise of nationalism around Europe in the nineteenth century, an independence movement emerged. The Althing, which had been suspended in 1799, was restored in 1844, and Iceland gained sovereignty after World War I, becoming the Kingdom of Iceland on 1 December 1918. However, Iceland shared the Danish Monarchy until World War II. Iceland was neutral in the Second World War. Nazi Germany had begun Operation Weser\u00fcbung (Denmark was overrun by the German Wehrmacht) and won the Norwegian campaign (also because the British retreated the Day when Nazi Germany began the Battle of France by invading the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\nOn 10 May, the United Kingdom invaded and peacefully occupied it in 1940 to forestall a Nazi occupation. \nDue to the island's strategic position in the North Atlantic, the Allies occupied the island until the end of the war, with the United States taking over occupation duties from the British in 1941. In 1944, Iceland severed its remaining ties with Denmark (then still under Nazi occupation) and declared itself a republic. Following the Second World War, Iceland was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and joined the United Nations one year after its establishment. Its economy grew rapidly, largely through fishing, although this was marred by disputes with other nations.\nAfter the 1980 Icelandic presidential election, Vigdis Finnbogadottir assumed Iceland's presidency on August 1, 1980, the first elected female head of state in the world.\nFollowing rapid financial growth, the 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis occurred. Iceland continues to remain outside the European Union.\nIceland is very remote, and so has been spared the ravages of European wars but has been affected by other external events, such as the Black Death and the Protestant Reformation imposed by Denmark. Iceland's history has also been marked by a number of natural disasters.\nIceland is a relatively young island in the geological sense, being formed about 20 million years ago by a series of volcanic eruptions in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is still growing from fresh volcanic eruptions. The oldest stone specimens found in Iceland date back to c.\u200916 million years ago.\nGeological background.\nIn geological terms, Iceland is a young island. It started to form in the Miocene era about 20 million years ago from a series of volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it lies between the North American Plate and Eurasian Plate. These plates spread at a rate of approximately 2.5 centimeters per year. This elevated portion of the ridge is known as the \"Reykjanes Ridge\". The volcanic activity is attributed to a hotspot, the \"Iceland hotspot\", which in turn lies over a mantle plume (the \"Iceland Plume\"), a column of anomalously hot rock in the Earth's mantle which is likely to be partly responsible for the island's creation and continued existence. For comparison, it is estimated that other volcanic islands, such as the Faroe Islands have existed for about 55 million years,\n the Azores (on the same ridge) about 8 million years, and Hawaii less than a million years. The younger rock strata in the southwest of Iceland and the central highlands are only about 700,000 years old. The Geological history of the Earth is divided into ice ages, based on temperature and climate. The last glacial period, commonly referred to as \"The Ice Age\" is thought to have begun about 110,000 years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago. While covered in ice, Iceland's icefalls, fjords and valleys were formed.\nEarly history.\nIceland remained, for a long time, one of the world's last uninhabited larger islands (alongside New Zealand and Madagascar). It has been suggested that the land called Thule by the Greek geographer Pytheas (fourth century BCE) was actually Iceland, although it seems highly unlikely considering Pytheas' description of it as an agricultural country with plenty of milk, honey, and fruit; the name is more likely to have referred to Norway, or possibly the Faroe Islands or Shetland. Many of the early settlers were Thelir, fleeing the recent union of Norway under Harald Fairhair and came from Telemark. A similar argument explains the name of Greenland from Grenland, neighbouring Telemark and also populated by Thelir. The exact date that humans first reached the island is uncertain. Roman currency dating to the third century has been found in Iceland, but it is unknown whether they were brought there at that time or came later with Vikings after circulating for centuries.\nIrish monks.\nThere is some literary evidence that monks from a Hiberno-Scottish mission may have settled in Iceland before the arrival of the Norsemen. The \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\" (\"Book of Settlements\"), written in the 1100s, mentions the presence of Irish monks, called the Papar, prior to Norse settlement and states that the monks left behind Irish books, bells, and crosiers, among other things. According to the same account, the Irish monks abandoned the country when the Norse arrived or had left prior to their arrival. The twelfth-century scholar Ari \u00deorgilsson's \"\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k\" reasserts that items including bells corresponding to those used by Irish monks were found by the settlers. No such artifacts have been discovered by archaeologists, however. Some Icelanders claimed descent from Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge, King of Osraige in southeastern Ireland, at the time of the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\"'s creation.\nAn archaeological excavation has revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula (close to Keflav\u00edk International Airport). Carbon dating reveals that the cabin was abandoned somewhere between 770 and 880, suggesting that Iceland was populated well before 874. This archaeological find may also indicate that the monks left Iceland before the Norse arrived.\nNorse discovery.\nAccording to the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", Iceland was discovered by Naddodd, one of the first settlers in the Faroe Islands, who was sailing from Norway to the Faroes but lost his way and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddodd called the country \"Sn\u00e6land\" \"Snowland\". Swedish sailor Gar\u00f0ar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and called it \"Gar\u00f0arsh\u00f3lmi\" \"Gar\u00f0ar's Islet\" and stayed for the winter at H\u00fasav\u00edk.\nThe first Norseman who deliberately sailed to Iceland was Hrafna-Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson. Fl\u00f3ki settled for one winter at Bar\u00f0astr\u00f6nd. After the cold winter passed, the summer came and the whole island became green, which stunned Fl\u00f3ki. Realizing that this place was in fact habitable, despite the horribly cold winter, and full of useful resources, Fl\u00f3ki restocked his boat. He then returned east to Norway with resources and knowledge.\nSettlement (874\u2013930).\nThe first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson and his wife, Hallveig Fr\u00f3\u00f0ad\u00f3ttir. According to the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", he threw two carved pillars (\u00d6ndvegiss\u00falur) overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as Reykjanesskagi. There he settled with his family around 874, in a place he named Reykjav\u00edk \"Smoke Cove\", probably from the geothermal steam rising from the earth. This place eventually became the capital and the largest city of modern Iceland. It is recognized, however, that Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson may not have been the first one to settle permanently in Iceland\u2014that may have been N\u00e1ttfari, one of Gar\u00f0ar Svavarsson's men who stayed behind when Gar\u00f0ar returned to Scandinavia.\nMuch of the information on Ing\u00f3lfur comes from the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", written some three centuries after the settlement. Archeological findings in Reykjav\u00edk are consistent with the date given there: there was a settlement in Reykjav\u00edk around 870.\nAccording to Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k, Ing\u00f3lfur was followed by many more Norse chieftains, their families and slaves who settled all the habitable areas of the island in the next decades. Archeological evidence strongly suggests that the timing is roughly accurate; \"that the whole country was occupied within a couple of decades towards the end of the 9th century.\" These people were primarily of Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish origin. Some of the Irish and Scots were slaves and servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the sagas of Icelanders, the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", and other documents. Some settlers coming from the British Isles were \"Hiberno-Norse,\" with cultural and family connections both to the coastal and island areas of Ireland and/or Scotland and to Norway.\nThe traditional explanation for the exodus from Norway is that people were fleeing the harsh rule of the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair, whom medieval literary sources credit with the unification of some parts of modern Norway during this period. Viking incursions into Britain were also expelled thoroughly during this time, potentially leading to a need for peaceful settlement in other lands. It is also believed that the western fjords of Norway were simply overcrowded in this period.\nThe settlement of Iceland is thoroughly recorded in the aforementioned \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", although the book was compiled in the early 12th century when at least 200 years had passed from the age of settlement. Ari \u00deorgilsson's \"\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k\" is generally considered more reliable as a source and is probably somewhat older, but it is far less thorough. It does say that Iceland was fully settled within 60 years, which likely means that all arable land had been claimed by various settlers.\nIn 2016, archaeologists uncovered a longhouse in St\u00f6\u00f0varfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur that has been dated to as early as 800. Other, similar finds in Iceland have been dated to a similar time, preceding the traditional settlement date significantly.\nCommonwealth (930\u20131262).\nIn 930, the ruling chiefs established an assembly called the \"Al\u00feingi\" (Althing). The parliament convened each summer at \u00deingvellir, where chieftains (Go\u00f0or\u00f0smenn or Go\u00f0ar) amended laws, settled disputes and appointed juries to judge lawsuits. Laws were not written down but were instead memorized by an elected Lawspeaker (\"l\u01ebgs\u01ebguma\u00f0r\"). The Al\u00feingi is sometimes said to be the world's oldest existing parliament. Importantly, there was no central executive power, and therefore laws were enforced by the chieftains. This gave rise to feuds, which provided the writers of the sagas with plenty of material.\nIceland enjoyed a mostly uninterrupted period of growth in its commonwealth years. Settlements from that era have been found in southwest Greenland and eastern Canada, and sagas such as \"Saga of Erik the Red\" and \"Greenland saga\" speak of the settlers' exploits.\nChristianisation.\nThe settlers of Iceland were predominantly pagans and worshiped the Norse gods, among them Odin, Thor, Freyr, and Freyja. By the tenth century, political pressure from Europe to convert to Christianity mounted. As the end of the first millennium grew near, many prominent Icelanders had accepted the new faith.\nAround 961, Eldgj\u00e1, a volcano in Southern Iceland, erupted 7.7 square miles of lava and lifted up huge clouds of sulfuric gas that affected all of Northern Europe and spanned out as far as Northern China. It also created rare hazes and multiple food crises in different parts of the world, including that year and many years that followed. Early Norse settlers in Iceland followed Paganism; however, after the Eldgj\u00e1 volcano eruption, many thought of it as an act from God and started to convert to Christianity instead with the help of Al\u00feingi. It is also believed they converted to Christianity to maintain peace with their European neighbors and the Catholic church.\nIn the year 1000, as a civil war between the religious groups seemed likely, the Al\u00feingi appointed one of the chieftains, Thorgeir Ljosvetningagodi, to decide the issue of religion by arbitration. He decided that the country should convert to Christianity as a whole, but that pagans would be allowed to worship privately.\nThe first Icelandic bishop, \u00cdsleifur Gissurarson, was consecrated by bishop Adalbert of Hamburg in 1056.\nCivil war and the end of the commonwealth.\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, the centralization of power had worn down the institutions of the commonwealth, as the former notable independence of local farmers and chieftains gave way to the growing power of a handful of families and their leaders. The period from around 1200 to 1262 is generally known as the Age of the Sturlungs. This refers to Sturla \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson and his sons, Sighvatr Sturluson, and Snorri Sturluson, who were one of two main clans fighting for power over Iceland, causing havoc in a land inhabited almost entirely by farmers who could ill-afford to travel far from their farms, across the island to fight for their leaders.\nIn 1220, Snorri Sturluson became a vassal of Haakon IV of Norway; his nephew Sturla Sighvatsson also became a vassal in 1235. Sturla used the power and influence of the Sturlungar family clan to wage war against the other clans in Iceland. The Norwegian king's power of Iceland increased over the course of the 13th century. After decades of internal conflict, the Icelandic chieftains agreed to accept the sovereignty of Norway and signed the Old Covenant (\"Gamli s\u00e1ttm\u00e1li\") establishing a union with the Norwegian monarchy. The end of the Icelandic Commonwealth is typically dated to the signing of the Old Covenant (1262\u20131264) or to the adoption of J\u00f3nsb\u00f3k in 1281.\nThe period also saw the \"sta\u00f0am\u00e1l\", two major disputes over whether secular aristocrats should benefit from the tithes of proprietary churches they had founded. The latter, concluded in 1297, saw a significant shift of wealth and power from the aristocracy to the Church, which was increasingly independent of secular influence.\nIceland under Norwegian and Danish kings (1262\u20131918).\nNorwegian rule.\nLittle changed in the decades following the treaty. Norway's consolidation of power in Iceland was slow, and the Althing intended to hold onto its legislative and judicial power. Nonetheless, the Christian clergy had unique opportunities to accumulate wealth via the tithe, and power gradually shifted to ecclesiastical authorities as Iceland's two bishops in Sk\u00e1lholt and H\u00f3lar acquired land at the expense of the old chieftains.\nAround the time Iceland became a vassal state of Norway, a climate shift occurred\u2014a phenomenon now called the Little Ice Age. Areas near the Arctic Circle such as Iceland and Greenland began to have shorter growing seasons and colder winters. Since Iceland had marginal farmland in good times, the climate change resulted in hardship for the population. A serfdom-like institution called the vistarband developed, in which peasants were bound to landowners for a year at a time.\nIt became more difficult to raise barley, the primary cereal crop, and livestock required additional fodder to survive longer and colder winters. Icelanders began to trade for grain from continental Europe, which was an expensive proposition. Church fast days increased demand for dried codfish, which was easily caught and prepared for export, and the cod trade became an important part of the economy.\nKalmar Union.\nIceland remained under Norwegian kingship until 1380, when the death of Olaf II of Denmark extinguished the Norwegian male royal line. Norway (and thus Iceland) then became part of the Kalmar Union, along with Sweden and Denmark, with Denmark as the dominant power. Unlike Norway, Denmark did not need Iceland's fish and homespun wool. This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland's trade. The small Greenland colony, established in the late 10th century, died out completely before 1500.\nWith the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark\u2013Norway in 1660 under Frederick III of Denmark, the Icelanders relinquished their autonomy to the crown, including the right to initiate and consent to legislation. Denmark, however, did not provide much protection to Iceland, which was raided in 1627 by a Barbary pirate fleet that abducted almost 300 Icelanders into slavery, in an episode known as the Turkish Abductions.\nAfter the end of the Kalmar Union, the royal government asserted greater control of Iceland. In particular, it took stronger actions to stop the involvement of English traders with Iceland.\nForeign merchants and fishermen.\nEnglish and German merchants became more prominent in Iceland at the start of the 15th century. Some historians refer to the 15th century as the \"English Age\" in Iceland's history, due to the prominence of English traders and fishing fleets. What drew foreigners to Iceland was primarily fishing in the fruitful waters off the coast of Iceland. The Icelandic trade was important to some British ports; for example, in Hull, the Icelandic trade accounted for more than ten percent of Hull's total trade. The trade has been credited with raising Icelandic living standards.\nThe 16th century has been referred to as the \"German Age\" by Icelandic historians due to the prominence of German traders. The Germans did not engage in much fishing themselves, but they owned fishing boats, rented them to Icelanders and then bought the fish from Icelandic fishermen to export to the European Continent.\nAn illicit trade continued with foreigners after the Danes implemented a trade monopoly. Dutch and French traders became more prominent in the mid-17th century.\nReformation and Danish trade monopoly.\nBy the middle of the 16th century, Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on his subjects. J\u00f3n Arason and \u00d6gmundur P\u00e1lsson, the Catholic bishops of Sk\u00e1lholt and H\u00f3lar respectively, opposed Christian's efforts at promoting the Protestant Reformation in Iceland. \u00d6gmundur was deported by Danish officials in 1541, but J\u00f3n Arason put up a fight.\nOpposition to the reformation ended in 1550 when J\u00f3n Arason was captured after being defeated in the Battle of Sau\u00f0afell by loyalist forces under the leadership of Da\u00f0i Gu\u00f0mundsson. J\u00f3n Arason and his two sons were subsequently beheaded in Sk\u00e1lholt. Following this, the Icelanders became Lutherans and remain largely so to this day.\nIn 1602, Iceland was forbidden to trade with countries other than Denmark, by order of the Danish government, which at this time pursued mercantilist policies. The Danish\u2013Icelandic Trade Monopoly remained in effect until 1786.\nThe eruption of Laki.\nIn the 18th century, climatic conditions in Iceland reached an all-time low since the original settlement. On top of this, Laki erupted in 1783, spitting out of lava. Floods, ash, and fumes killed 9,000 people and 80% of the livestock. The ensuing starvation killed a quarter of Iceland's population. This period is known as the \"M\u00f3\u00f0uhar\u00f0indin\" or \"Mist Hardships\".\nDanish Iceland in the beginning of the 19th century.\nIn 1809 Danish adventurer J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen arrived in Iceland, declared the country independent from Denmark\u2013Norway and pronounced himself its ruler. However, with the arrival of HMS \"Talbot\" two months later, Danish rule in Iceland was restored and J\u00f8rgensen was arrested.\nWhen the two kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were separated by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark kept Iceland, as well as Faroe and Greenland, as dependencies.\nIndependence movement.\nThroughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow worse, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly Manitoba in Canada. However, a new national consciousness was revived in Iceland, inspired by romantic nationalist ideas from continental Europe. This revival was spearheaded by the \"Fj\u00f6lnismenn\", a group of Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals.\nAn independence movement developed under the leadership of a lawyer named J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson. In 1843, a new Althing was founded as a consultative assembly. It claimed continuity with the Althing of the Icelandic Commonwealth, which had remained for centuries as a judicial body and had been abolished in 1800.\nHome rule and sovereignty.\nIn 1874, a thousand years after the first acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule over domestic matters, which was expanded in 1904. The constitution was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjav\u00edk, was made responsible to the Althing, the first of whom was Hannes Hafstein.\nIceland and Denmark signed the Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union on 1 December 1918, recognizing the Kingdom of Iceland as a fully sovereign state joined with Denmark in a personal union with the Danish king. Iceland established its own flag. Denmark was to represent its foreign affairs and defense interests. Iceland had no military or naval forces, and Denmark was to give notice to other countries that it was permanently neutral. The act would be up for revision in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement was not reached. By the 1930s the consensus in Iceland was to seek complete independence by 1944 at the latest.\nWorld War I.\nIn the quarter of a century preceding the war, Iceland had prospered. However, Iceland became more isolated during World War I and suffered a significant decline in living standards. The treasury became highly indebted, and there was a shortage of food and fears over an imminent famine.\nIceland was part of neutral Denmark during the war. Icelanders were, in general, sympathetic to the cause of the Allies. Iceland also traded significantly with the United Kingdom during the war, as Iceland found itself within its sphere of influence. In their attempts to stop the Icelanders from trading with the Germans indirectly, the British imposed costly and time-consuming constraints on Icelandic exports going to the Nordic countries. There is no evidence of any German plans to invade Iceland during the war.\n1,245 Icelanders, Icelandic Americans, and Icelandic Canadians were registered as soldiers during World War I. 989 fought for Canada and 256 for the United States. 391 of the combatants were born in Iceland, the rest were of Icelandic descent. 10 women of Icelandic descent and 4 women born in Iceland served as nurses for the Allies during World War I. At least 144 of the combatants died during World War I (96 in combat, 19 from wounds suffered during combat, 2 from accidents, and 27 from disease), 61 of them were Iceland-born. Ten men were taken as prisoners of war by the German Empire.\nThe war had a lasting impact on Icelandic society and Iceland's external relations. It led to major government interference in the marketplace that lasted until the post-World War II period. Iceland's competent governance of internal affairs and relations with other states\u2014while relations with Denmark were interrupted during the war\u2014showed that Iceland was capable of acquiring further powers, which resulted in Denmark recognizing Iceland as a fully sovereign state in 1918. \nIt has been argued that the thirst for news of the war helped \"Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0\" to gain a dominant position among Icelandic newspapers.\nThe Great Depression.\nIcelandic post-World War I prosperity ended with the outbreak of the Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic crash starting after the Wall Street crash of 24 October 1929.\nThe depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted. The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million kronur in 1932, and did not rise again to the pre-1930 level until after 1939. Government involvement in the economy increased: \"Imports were regulated, trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state-owned banks, and loan capital was largely distributed by state-regulated funds\". The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (July 1936) cut Iceland's exports of saltfish by half, and the depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II, when prices for fish exports soared.\nWorld War II.\nWith war looming in March 1939 (Nazi Germany occupated Czechoslovakia), Iceland realized its exposed position would be very dangerous in wartime. An all-party government was formed, and Lufthansa's request for civilian airplane landing rights was rejected. German ships were all about, however, until the British blockade of Germany put a stop to that when Hitler started war on 1 September 1939 by beginning the Invasion of Poland. Iceland demanded Britain allow it to trade with Germany, to no avail.\nThe occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany began on 9 April 1940 (Operation Weser\u00fcbung), severing communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Parliament of Iceland took temporary control of foreign affairs (setting up what would be the forerunner of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) and the Coast Guard. Parliament also elected a provisional governor, Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson, who later became the Republic's first president. Iceland became \"de facto\" fully sovereign with these actions. At the time, Icelanders and the Danish King considered this state of affairs to be temporary and believed that Iceland would return these powers to Denmark when the occupation was over.\nIceland turned down British offers of protection after the occupation of Denmark, because that would have violated Iceland's neutrality. Britain and the U.S. opened direct diplomatic relations, as did Sweden and Norway. The German takeover of Norway left Iceland highly exposed; Britain decided it could not risk a German takeover of Iceland.\nOn 10 May 1940, British military forces began an invasion of Iceland when they sailed into Reykjav\u00edk harbour in Operation Fork.\nThere was no resistance, but the government protested against what it called a \"flagrant violation\" of Icelandic neutrality, though Prime Minister Hermann J\u00f3nasson called on Icelanders to treat the British troops with politeness, as if they were guests. They behaved accordingly, and there were no mishaps. The occupation of Iceland lasted throughout the war.\nAt the peak, the British had 25,000 troops stationed in Iceland, all but eliminating unemployment in the Reykjav\u00edk area and other strategically important places. In July 1941, responsibility for Iceland's occupation and defence passed to the United States under a U.S.-Icelandic agreement which included a provision that the U.S. recognize Iceland's absolute independence. The British were replaced by up to 40,000 Americans, who outnumbered all adult Icelandic men. (At the time, Iceland had a population of around 120,000.)\nApproximately 159 Icelanders' lives have been confirmed to have been lost in World War II hostilities. Most were killed on cargo and fishing vessels sunk by German aircraft, U-boats or mines. An additional 70 Icelanders died at sea, but it has not been confirmed whether they lost their lives as a result of hostilities.\nThe occupation of Iceland by the British and the Americans proved to be an economic boom, as the occupiers injected money into the Icelandic economy and launched various projects. This eradicated unemployment in Iceland and raised wages considerably. \nAccording to one study, \"by the end of World War II, Iceland had been transformed from one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries to one of the world\u2019s wealthiest.\"\nRepublic of Iceland (1944\u2013present).\nFounding of the republic.\nOn 31 December 1943, the Act of Union agreement expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with the King of Denmark and establish a republic. The vote was 97% in favour of ending the union and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution. \nIceland became an independent republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson as its first president. Denmark was still occupied by Germany at the time. Danish King Christian X sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.\nIceland had prospered during the course of the war, amassing considerable currency reserves in foreign banks. In addition to this, the country received the most Marshall Aid per capita of any European country in the immediate postwar years (at US$209, with the war-ravaged Netherlands a distant second at US$109).\nThe new republican government, led by an unlikely three-party majority cabinet made up of conservatives (the Independence Party, \"Sj\u00e1lfst\u00e6\u00f0isflokkurinn\"), social democrats (the Social Democratic Party, \"Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0uflokkurinn\"), and socialists (People's Unity Party \u2013 Socialist Party, \"S\u00f3s\u00edalistaflokkurinn\"), decided to put the funds into a general renovation of the fishing fleet, the building of fish processing facilities, the construction of a cement and fertilizer factory, and a general modernization of agriculture. These actions were aimed at keeping Icelanders' standard of living as high as it had become during the prosperous war years.\nThe government's fiscal policy was strictly Keynesian, and their aim was to create the necessary industrial infrastructure for a prosperous developed country. It was considered essential to keep unemployment down and to protect the export fishing industry through currency manipulation and other means. Because of the country's dependence both on reliable fish catches and foreign demand for fish products, Iceland's economy remained unstable well into the 1990s, when the country's economy was greatly diversified.\nNATO membership, US defense agreement, and the Cold War.\nIn October 1946, the Icelandic and United States governments agreed to terminate U.S. responsibility for the defense of Iceland, but the United States retained certain rights at Keflav\u00edk, such as the right to re-establish a military presence there, should war threaten. Around that time, the Cold War began.\nIceland became a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 30 March 1949, with the reservation that it would never take part in offensive action against another nation. The membership came amid an anti-NATO riot in Iceland. After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, and pursuant to the request of NATO military authorities, the United States and Iceland agreed that the United States should again take responsibility for Iceland's defense. This agreement, signed on 5 May 1951, was the authority for the controversial U.S. military presence in Iceland, which remained until 2006. The U.S. base served as a hub for transports and communications to Europe, a key chain in the GIUK gap, a monitor of Soviet submarine activity, and a linchpin in the early warning system for incoming Soviet attacks and interceptor of Soviet reconnaissance bombers.\nAlthough U.S. forces no longer maintain a military presence in Iceland, the alliance with NATO and the Bilateral Defense Agreement of 1951 between Iceland and the United States remain fundamental pillars of Iceland's security and defense. Iceland is a country without a military and has emphasized a comprehensive and multilateral approach in security affairs and is a member of key organizations, such as the United Nations, NATO, and the OSCE. Iceland has retained strong ties to the other Nordic countries. As a consequence, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and other European nations have increased their defense and rescue cooperation with Iceland since the withdrawal of U.S. forces.\nAccording to a 2018 study in the \"Scandinavian Journal of History\", Iceland benefited massively from its relationship with the United States during the Cold War. The United States provided extensive economic patronage, advocated on Iceland's behalf in international organizations, allowed Iceland to violate the rules of international organizations, and helped Iceland to victory in the Cod Wars. Despite this, the relationship with the United States was contentious in Icelandic domestic politics, leaving some scholars to describe Iceland as a \"rebellious ally\" and \"reluctant ally.\" \nIceland repeatedly threatened to leave NATO or cancel the US defence agreement during the Cold War, which was one reason why the United States went to great lengths to please the Icelanders.\nCod Wars.\nThe Cod Wars were a series of militarized interstate disputes between Iceland and the United Kingdom from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The Proto Cod War (1952\u20131956) revolved around Iceland's extension of its fishery limits from 3 to 4 nautical miles. The First Cod War (1958\u20131961) was fought over Iceland's extension from 4 to 12 nautical miles (7 to 22\u00a0km). The Second Cod War (1972\u20131973) occurred when Iceland extended the limits to 50 miles (93\u00a0km). The Third Cod War (1975\u20131976) was fought over Iceland's extension of its fishery limits to 200 miles (370\u00a0km). Icelandic patrol ships and British trawlers clashed in all four Cod Wars. The Royal Navy was sent to the contested waters in the last three Cod Wars, leading to highly publicized clashes.\nDuring these disputes, Iceland threatened closure of the U.S. base at Keflav\u00edk, and the withdrawal of its NATO membership. Due to Iceland's strategic importance during the Cold War, it was important for the U.S. and NATO to maintain the base on Icelandic soil and to keep Iceland as a member of NATO. While the Icelandic government did follow through on its threat to break off diplomatic relations with the UK during the Third Cod War, it never went through on its threats to close the U.S. base or to withdraw from NATO.\nIt is rare for militarized interstate disputes of this magnitude and intensity to occur between two democracies with as close economic, cultural, and institutional ties as Iceland and the UK.\nEEA membership, economic reform and evolving U.S. defense cooperation.\nIn 1991, the Independence Party, led by Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Oddsson, formed a coalition government with the Social Democrats. This government set in motion market liberalisation policies, privatising a number of state-owned companies. Iceland then became a member of the European Economic Area in 1994. Economic stability increased and previously chronic inflation was drastically reduced.\nIn 1993 Iceland and the United States reassessed the mutual defense requirements at Keflav\u00edk, based on the 1951 bilateral defense agreement. The results, contained in an understanding signed on January 4 1994, called for reductions in force levels to reflect the relaxation of tension in the North Atlantic region.\nIn 1995, the Independence Party formed a coalition government with the Progressive Party. This government continued with free market policies, privatising two commercial banks and the state-owned telecom Landss\u00edminn. Corporate income tax was reduced to 18% (from around 50% at the beginning of the decade), inheritance tax was greatly reduced, and the net wealth tax was abolished. A system of individual transferable quotas in the Icelandic fisheries, first introduced in the late 1970s, was further developed.\nThe coalition government remained in power through elections in 1999 and 2003. In 2004, Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Oddsson stepped down as prime minister after 13 years in office. Oddsson was Iceland's longest-serving prime minister and held the job from 1991 until 2004. \nHalld\u00f3r \u00c1sgr\u00edmsson, leader of the Progressive Party, took over as prime minister from 2004 to 2006, followed by Geir H. Haarde, Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Oddsson's successor as leader of the Independence Party.\nFollowing a recession in the early 1990s, economic growth was considerable, averaging about 4% per year from 1994. The governments of the 1990s and 2000s adhered to a staunch but domestically controversial pro-U.S. foreign policy, lending nominal support to the NATO action in the Kosovo War and signing up as a member of the Coalition of the willing during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nIn March 2006, the US President Bush announced that the U.S. intended to withdraw the greater part of the Icelandic Defence Force. On 12 August 2006, the last four F-15's left Icelandic airspace. The United States closed the Keflav\u00edk Air Base in September 2006. A Joint Understanding was also negotiated in which both sides affirm their continuing commitment to the 1951 Defense Agreement. The Joint Understanding also lists bilateral activities designed to create a basis for future cooperation between Iceland and the United States in the areas of defense and security. In 2016, it was reported that the United States (Presidency of Barack Obama) was considering re-opening the base.\nFollowing election in May 2007, the Independence Party, headed by Haarde, remained in government, albeit in a new coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance.\nFinancial crisis.\nIn October 2008, the Icelandic banking system collapsed, prompting Iceland to seek large loans from the International Monetary Fund and friendly countries. Widespread protests in late 2008 and early 2009 resulted in the resignation of the Haarde government, which was replaced on 1 February 2009 by a coalition government led by the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement. Social Democrat minister J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir was appointed prime minister, becoming the world's first openly homosexual head of government of the modern era. \nAn Election took place in April 2009, and a continuing coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Left-Green Movement was established in May 2009.\nThe financial crisis gave rise to the Icesave dispute, where Iceland on the one hand and the United Kingdom and Netherlands on the other disputed whether Iceland was obligated to repay British and Dutch depositors who lost their savings when Icesave collapsed.\nThe crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net exodus of 5,000 people in 2009.\n2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.\nIn 2010, a series of volcanic events at Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull in Iceland caused enormous disruption to air travel across Western Europe. The eruption was relatively small, but its impact was massive, leading to an air travel chaos for almost one month, because of a plume of volcanic ash over nine kilometers into the sky.\nSince 2012.\nIceland's economy stabilized under the government of J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012, but many Icelanders remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies; the centre-right Independence Party was returned to power, in coalition with the Progressive Party, in the 2013 elections. In September 2017, the 9-month-old center-right coalition of Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, leader of the Independence Party, collapsed after one party, a small centrist Bright Future, left the government. However, the ruling centre-right parties lost their majority after a tight 2017 election. On 30 November 2017, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir became Iceland's new prime minister despite the fact her party, Left-Green Movement, came second in the election - behind the Independence Party.\nOn 1 August 2016, Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson became the new president of Iceland. He was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of the vote in the 2020 presidential election.\nAfter the 2021 parliamentary election, the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. \nIn April 2024, Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence party succeeded Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir as prime minister. \nIn June 2024, Halla Tomasdottir won Iceland\u2019s presidential election to become the country\u2019s second female president. \nIn November 2024, centre-left Social Democratic Alliance became the biggest party in a snap election, meaning Social Democratic Kristrun Frostadottir became the next Prime Minister of Iceland.\nHistoriography.\nDivision of history into named periods.\nWhile it is convenient to divide history into named periods, it is also misleading because the course of human events neither starts nor ends abruptly in most cases, and movements and influences often overlap. One period in Icelandic history, as Gunnar Karlsson describes, can be considered the period from 930 CE to 1262\u20131264, when there was no central government or leader, political power being characterised by chieftains (\"go\u00f0ar\"). This period is referred to therefore as the \"\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0veldis\u00f6ld\" or \"go\u00f0aveldis\u00f6ld\" (National or Chieftain State) period by Icelandic authors, and the \"Old Commonwealth\" or \"Freestate\" by English ones.\nThere is little consensus on how to divide Icelandic history. Gunnar's own book \"A Brief History of Iceland\" (2010) has 33 chapters with considerable overlap in dates. J\u00f3n J.

The island country is the world's 18th largest in area and one of the most sparsely populated. It is the westernmost European country when not including Greenland and has more land covered by glaciers than continental Europe. Its total size is and possesses an exclusive economic zone of .\nStatistics.\nIceland is an island country in Northern Europe, straddling the Eurasian and North American plates between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the British Isles.\nExtent (locations outside mainland in parentheses)\nNorth: Rifstangi, 66\u00b032\u20323\" N (Kolbeinsey, 67\u00b008,9 N)\nSouth: K\u00f6tlutangi, 63\u00b023\u20326\" N (Surtsey, 63\u00b017,7 N)\nWest: Bjargtangar, 24\u00b032\u20321\" W\nEast: Gerpir, 13\u00b029\u20326\" W (Hvalbakur, 13\u00b016,6 W)\nArea: \n\"Total\": \n\"Land\": 100,329\u00a0km2\n\"Water\": 2,796\u00a0km2\nMaritime claims: \n\"Territorial sea\": \n\"Exclusive economic zone\": with \n\"Continental shelf\": or to the edge of the continental margin\nElevation extremes: \n\"Lowest point\": Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\"Highest point\": Hvannadalshn\u00fakur 2,110 m\nNatural resources:\nMarine life, diatomite, hydropower, geothermal power\n\"Arable land:\" 1.21%\n\"Permanent crops\": 0%\n\"Other\": 98.79% (2012)\n 170 km3 (2011)\n\"Total\": 0.17 km3/yr (49%/8%/42%)\n\"Per capita\": 539.2 m3/yr (2005)\nVolcanism, earthquakes, avalanches, and glacial lake outburst flooding (or \"j\u00f6kulhlaups\")\nWater pollution from fertilizer runoff; inadequate wastewater treatment\nPhysical geography.\nIceland consists of eight geographical regions, Capital Region, Southern Peninsula, West, Westfjords, Northwest, Northeast, East and South. Twenty per cent of the land is used for grazing, while only one per cent is cultivated. Iceland has lost most of the woodland that previously covered large areas of the country, but an ambitious reforestation program is currently underway. Fossilized tree pollen and descriptions by the early settlers indicate that prior to human settlement, now thought to have occurred from around AD 800 onwards, trees covered between thirty and forty per cent of the island. Today, however, there are only small patches of the original birch forests left, the most prominent being Hallormssta\u00f0ask\u00f3gur and Vaglask\u00f3gur. The country of Iceland contains 36 islands. The longest river on the island is \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 at . Iceland has three national parks: Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park, Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull National Park, and \u00deingvellir National Park. The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest, while the central highlands are all but uninhabited. The island's terrain is mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields and a coast deeply indented by bays and fjords.\nHighlands.\nThe Highlands make up about half of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin and consists of a mountainous lava desert (highest elevation above sea level) and other wastelands. The area is mostly uninhabited and uninhabitable.\nWestfjords.\nThe Westfjords region is composed of a large, mountainous peninsula on Iceland's northwestern coast. The coastline is marked by numerous fjords as its name suggests. The peninsula contains Iceland's northernmost glacier, Drangaj\u00f6kull.\nSouthern Peninsula.\nThe Southern Peninsula, also known as the Reykjanes Peninsula, is located in the southwestern corner of Iceland. The area contains little vegetation because of active volcanism and large lava fields. There are hot springs and sulphur springs in the southern portion of the peninsula, in the Kleifarvatn lake and the Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk geothermal area.\nCapital Region.\nHome to Iceland's capital, Reykjav\u00edk, the Capital Region is the most densely populated area in Iceland. It is located on the southwest coast of the island near the Southern Peninsula. The majority of Reykjav\u00edk is located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula. Mount Esja, at 914 metres (2,999\u00a0ft), is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjav\u00edk. Several natural harbours exist and provide good fishing grounds.\nWest.\nLocated in the western portion of the island and north of the Capital Region. In Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjord rests the second-tallest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur. West is also home to Borgarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, a fjord with volcanic activity such as Deildartunguhver, a powerful hotspring. The Hafnarfjall Mountain rises over the landscape.\nSouth.\nThe southern portion of Iceland contains some of its most notable volcanoes such as Hekla, Eldgj\u00e1, and Katla. Alongside the volcanoes exist numerous glaciers such as Vatnaj\u00f6kull, M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull, and Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. Basalt columns and black sand beaches are examples of the volcanic activity of the area. The area also contains mountain ranges and Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnj\u00fakur, as well as the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago.\nEast.\nEast Iceland contains the majority of the island's vegetation and birch forests.\nAtlantic.\nThe Atlantic contains large amounts of ice.\nGlaciers.\nAround 10.2 per cent of the total land area is covered by glaciers, although these are retreating at an accelerating rate. The four largest Icelandic glaciers are:\nOther notable glaciers include:\nClimate.\nBecause of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Current, the climate is temperate and characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. Reykjav\u00edk has an average temperature of in July and in January It has a K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification of Subpolar oceanic climate (\"Cfc\") with most of the island classified as Tundra (\"ET\").\nGeology.\nIceland has extensive volcanic and geothermal activity. The rift associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which marks the division between the Eurasian Plate and North American tectonic plates, runs across Iceland from the southwest to the northeast. This geographic feature is prominent at the \u00deingvellir National Park, where the promontory creates an extraordinary natural amphitheatre. The site was the home of Iceland's parliament, the Al\u00feing, which was first convened in 930. It is a common misconception that \u00deingvellir is at the juncture between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. However, they are in fact at the juncture of the North American continental plate and a smaller plate (approx. 10,000\u00a0km2) called the Hreppar Microplate (Hreppaflekinn). From 1963 to 1967, the island of Surtsey was created on the southwest coast by a volcanic eruption.\nGeological activity.\nA geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the Iceland hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with earthquakes and volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgj\u00e1, Her\u00f0ubrei\u00f0 and Eldfell. Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (1,666 m) erupted in 2010, disrupting European air traffic. To demonstrate the geothermal activity, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said that during a single week in February 2021, around 17,000 earthquakes have hit the southwestern region of Reykjanes.\nIceland has many geysers, including Geysir, from which the English word \"geyser\" is derived. With the widespread availability of geothermal power, and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating, and electricity. The island is composed primarily of basalt, a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes, with approximately 30 active volcanic systems.\nEnvironment\u2014international agreements.\nParty to:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Wetlands, Whaling\nSigned, but not ratified:\nEnvironmental Modification, Marine Life Conservation\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64580", "revid": "1319755833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64580", "title": "Demographics of Iceland", "text": "The demographics of Iceland include population density, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\nAs of 2025, the Icelandic population is 389,444. In 2024, 69,691 residents (18.2%) were immigrants.\nAbout 99% of the nation's inhabitants live in localities with populations greater than 200, and 64% live in the Capital Region.\nHistory.\nThe population of Iceland probably wavered between about 30,000 and 80,000 for most of the time since settlement. Official statistics begin in 1703, since when the population has grown from 50,358 to 389,000 (August 2025).\nMigration.\nSettlement.\nMost Icelandic people are descendants of Norwegian settlers, and of Gaels from Ireland and Scotland who were brought over as slaves during the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century AD. Recent DNA analysis suggests that about 66 percent of the male settler-era population was of Norse ancestry and that the female population was 60 percent Celtic. Iceland remained extremely homogenous from its settlement era until the twentieth century.\nEmigration.\nLarge numbers of Icelanders began to emigrate from Iceland in the 1850s. It has been estimated that 17,000 Icelanders migrated to North America in the period 1870\u20131914, and that 2,000 of them moved back to Iceland; this net loss, 15,000, was about 20% of the Icelandic population in 1887. According to historian Gunnar Karlsson, \"migration from Iceland is unique in that most went to Canada, whereas from most or all other European countries the majority went to the United States. This was partly due to the late beginning of emigration from Iceland after the Canadian authorities had begun to promote emigration in cooperation with the Allan Line, which already had an agent in Iceland in 1873. Contrary to most European countries, this promotion campaign was successful in Iceland, because emigration was only just about to start from there and Icelandic emigrants had no relatives in the United States to help them take the first steps\".\nIn the wake of the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis, many Icelanders went to work abroad.\nImmigration.\nBefore the 1990s, there was little immigration to Iceland, and most of it was from other Scandinavian countries: about 1% of Icelanders in 1900 were of Danish heritage (born either in Denmark or to Danish parents). In the mid-1990s, 95% of Icelanders had parents of Icelandic origin, and 2% of Icelanders were first-generation immigrants (born abroad with both parents and all grandparents foreign-born).\nImmigration to Iceland rose rapidly in the late twentieth century, encouraged by Iceland's accession to the European Economic Area in 1994, its entry into the Schengen Agreement in 2001, and the country's economic boom in the early twenty-first century. The largest ethnic minority is Poles, who are about a third of the immigrant population. In 2017, 10.6% of the people were first-generation immigrants.\nIceland is also developing relatively small populations of religious minorities, including Catholics (about 15,000 in 2020, 4.02% of Icelanders), Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds (about 400 in 2010), Jews (about 250 in 2018), Buddhists (about 1,500 in 2021), Muslims (about 1,300 in 2015), and Eastern Orthodox (about 995 in 2024).\nResearch on the experience of immigrants to Iceland is in its early days. There is some evidence that racism is not as acute in Iceland as in neighbouring countries. But, while it is popularly believed in Iceland that racism does not exist there, there is evidence that in some respects immigrant populations experience prejudice and inequalities. For example, Iceland has a higher dropout rate from upper secondary school among young immigrants than the EEA average.\nIceland does not formally collect data on the ethnicity or racial identification of its citizens, but does collect data of the origin and background group by birth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMigration data.\nDue to a shortage of labor, immigration to Iceland will most likely increase in the future. As of 2024, immigrants made up over 18% of Iceland's total population.\nPatronymy.\nMost Icelandic names are based on patronymy, and consist of the given name(s) followed by the father's first given name (in the genitive case), followed by \"son\" or \"daughter\". For example, Magn\u00fas and Anna, children of a man named P\u00e9tur J\u00f3nsson, would have the full names Magn\u00fas P\u00e9tursson and Anna P\u00e9tursd\u00f3ttir, respectively. Magn\u00fas's daughter Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur \u00c1sta would be Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur \u00c1sta Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir, and would remain so for the rest of her life regardless of marriage. An Icelandic patronymic is essentially only a designation of fatherhood, and is therefore redundant in Icelandic social life except to differentiate people of the same first name\u00a0\u2013 the phone directory, for example, lists people by their given name first, patronymic second. Thus it has little in common with surnames in other countries except for its position after the given name. It is legally possible in Iceland to use a matronymic instead of a patronymic, using the mother's name instead of the father's. Use of the patronymic system is required by law, except for descendants of those who acquired family names before 1913 (about 10% of the population). One notable Icelander with an inherited family name is football star Ei\u00f0ur Sm\u00e1ri Gu\u00f0johnsen.\nUrbanisation.\nAccording to University of Iceland economists Dav\u00edd F. Bj\u00f6rnsson and Gylfi Zoega, \"The policies of the colonial masters in Copenhagen delayed urbanisation. The Danish king maintained a monopoly in trade with Iceland from 1602 until 1855, which made the price of fish artificially low \u2013 the price of fish was higher in Britain \u2013 and artificially raised the price of agricultural products. Instead, Denmark bought the fish caught from Iceland at below world market prices. Although the trade monopoly ended in 1787, Icelanders could not trade freely with other countries until 1855. Following trade liberalisation, there was a substantial increase in fish exports to Britain, which led to an increase in the number of sailing ships used in fishing, introduced for the first time in 1780. The growth of the fishing industry then created demand for capital, and in 1885 Parliament created the first state bank (Landsbanki). In 1905 came the first motorised fishing vessel, which marked an important step in the development of a specialised fishing industry in Iceland. Iceland exported fresh fish to Britain and salted cod to southern Europe, with Portugal an important export market. Fishing replaced agriculture as the country\u2019s main industry. These developments set the stage for the urbanisation that was to follow in the twentieth century.\"\nA 2017 study looking at individuals going to the capital area for higher education found that \"Only about one in three University of Iceland students from regions beyond commuting distance return after graduation, while about half remain in the capital area and others mostly emigrate.\"\nReligion.\nIn 2016, 71.6% of the population belonged to the state church (the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland), approximately 5% in free churches, 3.7% to the Roman Catholic Church, approximately 1% to the \"\u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0\" (a legally recognized revival of the pre-Christian religion of Iceland), approximately 1% to Zuism, 8% in unrecognized or unspecified religious groups, and 9% do not belong to any religious group.\nIcelandic National Registry.\nAll living Icelanders, as well as all foreign citizens with permanent residence in Iceland, have a personal identification number (\"kennitala\") identifying them in the National Registry. This number is composed of 10 digits, whereof the first six are made up of the individual's birth date in the format DDMMYY. The next two digits are chosen at random when the \"kennitala\" is allocated, the 9th digit is a check digit, and the last digit indicates the period of one hundred years in which the individual was born (for instance, '9' for the period 1900\u20131999). An example would be 120192-3389. While similar, all-inclusive personal registries exist in other countries, the use of the national registry is unusually extensive in Iceland. It is worth noting that the completeness of the National Registry eliminates any need for census to be performed.\nSummary of vital statistics since 1900.\nData according to Statistics Iceland, which collects the official statistics for Iceland.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.I.2020): \nLife expectancy.\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics.\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\"0\u201314 years:\"\n19.8% (male 36,692/female 35,239)\n\"15\u201364 years:\"\n63.2% (male 116,210/female 113,810)\n\"65 years and over:\"\n17.1% (male 29,366/female 32,719) (2024 est.)\n\"at birth:\"\n1.05 males: 1 female\n\"under 15 years:\"\n1.04 males: 1 female\n\"15\u201364 years:\"\n1.02 males: 1 female\n\"65 years and over:\"\n0.9 males: 1 female\n\"total population:\"\n1 male: 1 female (2024 est.)\n3 deaths/100,000 live births (2020 est.)\n1.6 deaths/1,000 live births (2024 est.)\n\"total population:\"\n84 years\n\"male:\"\n81.8 years\n\"female:\"\n86.3 years (2024 est.)\n9.6% of GDP (2020)\n4.14 physicians/1,000 population (2019)\n21.9% (2016)\n7.7% of GDP (2020 est.)\n28.7 (2020 est.)\n\"noun:\"\nIcelander(s)\n\"adjective:\"\nIcelandic\n78.7% Icelandic, 5.8% Polish, 1% Danish, 1% Ukrainian, 13.5% other (2024 est.)\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland (official) 58.6%, Roman Catholic 3.8%, Independent Congregation of Reykjavik 2.6%, Independent Congregation of Hafnarfjordur 1.9%, Pagan Worship 1.5%, Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association 1.4%, other or unspecified 18.7%, none 7.7% (2024 est.)\nIcelandic (English and a second Nordic language, Danish by default, are also a part of the Icelandic compulsory education).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64581", "revid": "43252809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64581", "title": "Politics of Iceland", "text": "The politics of Iceland take place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state, while the prime minister of Iceland serves as the head of government in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament, the Althing. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nIceland is arguably the world's oldest assembly democracy, and has been rated as a \"full democracy\" in 2021.\nExecutive branch.\nElected to a four-year term, the President has limited powers and is poised in a largely ceremonial office that serves as a diplomat and figurehead.\nOn 1 August 2024, Halla T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir was elected as the current President.\nThe prime minister and cabinet exercise most executive functions. The head of government is the prime minister, who, together with the cabinet, takes care of the executive part of government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after general elections to Althing; however, this process is usually conducted by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed (under the condition that it has majority support in Althing). Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in reasonable time does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet themselves. This has never happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 the regent of the country (Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson, who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941) appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn in fact became the country's first president in 1944. The governments of Iceland have almost always been coalitions with two or more parties involved because no single political party has received a majority of seats in the Althing during Iceland's republican period. The extent of the political powers possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.\nThe president is elected every four years (last 2024), the cabinet is elected every four years (last 2021) and town council elections are held every four years (last 2022).\nLegislative branch.\nThe modern parliament, called the \"Althing\" or \"\", was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish king. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799. The Althing is composed of 63 members, elected every 4 years unless it is dissolved sooner. Suffrage for presidential and parliamentary elections is 18 years of age and is universal. Members of the Althing are elected on the basis of proportional representation from six constituencies. Until 1991, membership of the Althing was divided between a lower and upper house but this was changed to a fully unicameral system.\nPolitical parties and the elections.\nAfter four four-year terms as the world's first elected woman president, the widely popular Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir chose not to run for re-election in 1996. More than 86% of voters turned out in the 29 June 1996 presidential elections to give former leftist party chairman \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson a 41% plurality and relatively comfortable 12% victory margin over the closest of three other candidates. Traditionally limited to 6\u201312 weeks, Iceland's campaign season was marked by several intensely personal attacks on \u00d3lafur Ragnar, a former finance minister who tried to erase memories of his controversial support of inflationary policies and opposition to the U.S. military presence at the NATO base in Keflav\u00edk. \u00d3lafur Ragnar successfully used his largely ceremonial office to promote Icelandic trade abroad and family values at home. The last presidential elections took place on 27 June 2020.\nThe last parliamentary elections took place on 25 September 2021. A three-party coalition was formed following the 2017 parliamentary elections by the Independence Party (\"Sj\u00e1lfst\u00e6\u00f0isflokkurinn\"), the Progressive Party (\"Frams\u00f3knarflokkurinn\") and the Left-Green Movement (\"Vinstrihreyfingin \u2013 gr\u00e6nt frambo\u00f0\"). These political parties were again the three largest in Iceland after the latest elections and subsequently continued the coalition for another term. This was the first time since 2009 in which existing coalition is renewed in Iceland. A total of 203,898 votes were cast consulting 80.1% of the 254,681 electorates.\nPolitical history.\n1990s.\nIn losing four seats in April 1995 parliamentary elections, the IP and SDP (so-called \"Vi\u00f0ey government\") mustered a simple majority in the 63-seat Althing. However, Prime Minister and IP leader Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Oddsson chose the resurgent Progressive Party (PP) as a more conservative partner to form a stronger and more stable majority with 40 seats. Splintered by factionalism over the economy and Iceland's role in the European Union (EU), the SDP also suffered from being the only party to support Iceland's EU membership application.\n2000s\u20132010s.\nThe beginning of the millennium saw a merger of all the left parties to form the Social Democratic Alliance. Some members chose to join another new left party instead, the Left-Green Movement. After the PP's loss in the 2007 elections its longstanding alliance with the IP ended despite still being able to form a majority. Instead, the IP's leader Geir Haarde chose a stronger but somewhat unstable coalition with the Social Democrats (the \u00deingvellir government).\nGeir's administration fell apart in January 2009 and he called for an early election before standing down as party leader. The Social Democrats subsequently formed an interim government with the LGM. In the resulting election, J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir's administration prevailed, the first time Icelanders voted for a majority left-wing government.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, there has been an increasing fractionalization of the Icelandic party system. The increase in the number of parties has made it harder for coalition governments to form. What's more, since the initial resignation of the government in January 2009 after the banking collapse, revelations of subsequent political scandals have resulted in the government collapsing in 2016, following the Panama Papers, and again in 2017, following revelations of impropriety within the ranks of the political class; both instances culminated in anti-government protests being staged. Organized protests held to highlight and challenge political corruption since 2008 have therefore come to stress the necessity for the new Icelandic constitution that was co-drafted by the 2009 leftist government and select members of the public to be enshrined into law.\n2020s.\nAfter the 2021 parliamentary election, the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. In April 2024, Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence party succeeded Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir as prime minister. In November 2024, centre-left Social Democratic Alliance became the biggest party in a snap election, meaning Social Democratic Kristrun Frostadottir became the next Prime Minister of Iceland.\nJudicial branch.\nThe judiciary consists of the Supreme Court (H\u00e6stir\u00e9ttur) and district courts. Justices are appointed for life by the minister of justice. The Constitution protects the judiciary from infringement by the other two branches.\nAdministrative divisions.\nIceland is divided into 8 regions, which are further subdivided into 77 municipalities.\nUntil 1988, Iceland was divided in 23 counties (\"s\u00fdslur\", singular \"s\u00fdsla\") and 14 independent towns* (\"kaupsta\u00f0ir\", singular \"kaupsta\u00f0ur\"); Akranes*, Akureyri*, \u00c1rness\u00fdsla, Austur-Bar\u00f0astrandars\u00fdsla, Austur-H\u00fanavatnss\u00fdsla, Austur-Skaftafellss\u00fdsla, Borgarfjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, Dalas\u00fdsla, Eyjafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, Gullbringus\u00fdsla, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur*, H\u00fasav\u00edk*, \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur*, Keflav\u00edk*, Kj\u00f3sars\u00fdsla, K\u00f3pavogur*, M\u00fdras\u00fdsla, Neskaupsta\u00f0ur*, Nor\u00f0ur-\u00cdsafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, Nor\u00f0ur-M\u00falas\u00fdsla, Nor\u00f0ur-\u00deingeyjars\u00fdsla, \u00d3lafsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur*, Rang\u00e1rvallas\u00fdsla, Reykjav\u00edk*, Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur*, Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur*, Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur*, Skagafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, Sn\u00e6fellsnes- og Hnappadalss\u00fdsla, Strandas\u00fdsla, Su\u00f0ur-M\u00falas\u00fdsla, Su\u00f0ur-\u00deingeyjars\u00fdsla, Vestmannaeyjar*, Vestur-Bar\u00f0astrandars\u00fdsla, Vestur-H\u00fanavatnss\u00fdsla, Vestur-\u00cdsafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, Vestur-Skaftafellss\u00fdsla\nInternational organization participation.\nArctic Council, Australia Group, BIS, CBSS, CE, EAPC, EBRD, ECE, EFTA, FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICC, ICRM, IDA, IEA (observer), IFC, IFRCS, IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, ISO, ITU, ITUC, NATO, NC, NEA, NIB, OECD, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNMIK, UNU, UPU, WCO, WEU (associate), WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTrO\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64582", "revid": "50757959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64582", "title": "Economy of Iceland", "text": "The economy of Iceland is a highly developed mixed market economy. In 2011, the gross domestic product (GDP) was US$12 billion. By 2018, it had increased to a nominal GDP of US$27 billion, and by 2025, it reached US$35 billion. As of 2025, it has the fifth highest nominal GDP per capita ($91,000) and fourteenth highest GDP per capita by PPP ($81,000). In 2025 Iceland topped the Human Development Index.\nIceland has a mixed economy with high levels of free trade and government intervention. However, government consumption is lower compared to other Nordic countries. 100% of Iceland's electrical grid is produced from renewable sources. Geothermal and Hydropower are the primary sources of energy in Iceland.\nA founding member of the OECD, Iceland has the third lowest Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) rate among the youth.\nThe 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis produced a decline in GDP and employment, which has since been reversed entirely by a recovery aided by a tourism boom starting in 2010. Tourism accounted for more than 10% of Iceland's GDP in 2017. After a period of robust growth, Iceland's economy slowed down according to an economic outlook for the years 2018\u20132020 published by Arion Research in April of 2018.\nIn the 1990s Iceland undertook extensive free market reforms, which initially produced strong economic growth. As a result, Iceland was rated as having one of the world's highest levels of economic freedom as well as civil freedoms. In 2007, Iceland topped the list of nations ranked by Human Development Index and was one of the most egalitarian, according to the calculation provided by the Gini coefficient.\nFrom 2006 onwards, the economy faced problems of growing inflation and current account deficits. Partly in response, and partly as a result of earlier reforms, the financial system expanded rapidly before collapsing entirely in the 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis. Iceland had to obtain emergency funding from the International Monetary Fund and a range of European countries in November 2008. The economy has since rebounded since 2010, and continues to grow to this day.\nHistory.\nIn medieval Iceland, trade was traditionally conducted through barter. The traditional nationalistic historical narrative says that Iceland had experienced a golden age from 874 until the 11th century, when the country came under foreign rule and \"suffered humiliation\" as its economy declined. There is very little evidence to support this narrative.\nIceland had among the lowest GDP per capita out of all the Western European countries at the start of the 20th century. An assessment by economists at the Central Bank of Iceland stated that the country's \"post-World War II economic growth has been both significantly higher and more volatile than in other OECD countries\", and that \"the Icelandic business cycle has been largely independent of the business cycle in other industrialised countries.\" Iceland has had a total of twenty financial crashes since 1875, according to Reuters.\nFishing became a large part of the Icelandic economy after the 1880s, partly due to expanded fishing with sailing smacks. During the Second World War, the UK imposed trade sanctions on Iceland to prevent them from trading with Germany. After the British and later American occupations of the island, the economy was boosted by a substantial amount, and Iceland went from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the wealthiest. This was furthered by Iceland being included as part of the post-WWII Marshall Plan, receiving the largest amount per capita between 1948 and 1951, almost double the amount of the next highest recipient.\nTowards the end of the 20th century, Iceland's economy continued to grow. A coalition between the Independence and Progressive parties led to the privatization of state-owned banks and telecommunications. Corporate income tax was reduced to 18%, inheritance tax was greatly reduced, and the net wealth tax was completely abolished. The term \"Nordic Tiger\" became heavily used refer to the period of economic prosperity in Iceland that began in the 1990s.\nThe \"Nordic Tiger\" period came to a sudden end as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. Iceland went from being the 10th richest country in the world in 2007 to the 21st in 2010. Banks made risky loans and manipulated markets, with the country's regulators understaffed and not properly supervising them. The Icelandic kr\u00f3na underwent sharp inflation, with the three largest banks in the country being placed under government control. Iceland's central bank raised its interest rate to 18% in an attempt to combat the inflation.\nWith help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Iceland's economy stabilized and managed to pay off all of its loans by the end of 2015. Economists \u00c1sgeir J\u00f3nsson and Hersir Sigurj\u00f3nsson said that \"Iceland was treated differently from developing countries and former IMF clients. There was no call for Iceland to adopt sharp austerity measures at the inception of the joint economic plan. Instead, the government would be allowed to maintain large public deficits in the first year \u2013 2009 \u2013 allowing fiscal multipliers to counteract the output contraction that was underway. Iceland also was not asked to downsize its Scandinavian-type welfare system.\"\nGeography and resources.\nIceland occupies a land area of 103,000 square kilometers. It has a 4,790 kilometer coastline and a 200 nautical mile (370.4\u00a0km) exclusive economic zone extending over 758,000 square kilometers of water. Approximately only 0.7% of Iceland's surface area is arable, since the island's terrain is mostly mountainous and volcanic.\nIceland has few proven mineral resources. In the past, deposits of sulphur have been mined, and diatomite (skeletal algae) was extracted from Lake M\u00fdvatn until recently. However, today most sulphur is obtained in the desulfurization of petroleum and fossil gas. The diatomite plant has closed for environmental reasons. The only natural resource conversion in Iceland is the manufacture of cement. Concrete is widely used as building material, including for all types of residential housing.\nBy harnessing the abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power sources, Iceland's renewable energy industry provides close to 85% of all the nation's primary energy \u2013 proportionally more than any other country \u2013 with 99.9% of Iceland's electricity being generated from renewables.\nBy far the largest of the many Icelandic hydroelectric power stations is K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar Hydropower Plant (690\u00a0MW) in the area north of Vatnaj\u00f6kull. Other stations include B\u00farfell (270\u00a0MW), Hrauneyjarfoss (210\u00a0MW), Sigalda (150\u00a0MW), Blanda (150\u00a0MW), and more. Iceland has explored the feasibility of exporting hydroelectric energy via submarine cable to mainland Europe and also actively seeks to expand its power-intensive industries, including aluminium and ferro-silicon smelting plants.\nSectors.\nIn 2017 the proportion of Iceland's exports was: tourism 42%, seafood 17%, aluminium 16%, other 24%.\nTourism.\nTourism is one of Iceland's largest export sector. Tourism accounted for more than 12% of the country's GDP in 2017. Iceland is one of the most tourism-dependent countries on Earth. In October 2017 the tourism sector directly employed around 26,800 people, with the total number of employees in the country being 186,900.\nAt the start of the growth period around 2010, tourism benefited from a weak ISK, but a strong ISK then cooled down the sector. From 2010 to 2018, tourist arrivals in Iceland increased by 378%.\nManufacturing.\nIceland is the world's largest electricity producer per capita. The presence of abundant electrical power due to Iceland's geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources has led to the growth of the manufacturing sector. Power-intensive industries, which are the largest components of the manufacturing sector, produce mainly for export. Manufactured products constituted 36% of all merchandise exports, an increase from the 1997 figure of 22%. Power-intensive products' share of merchandise exports is 21%, compared to 12% in 1997.\nAluminium.\nAluminium smelting is the most important power-intensive industry in Iceland. There are currently three plants in operation with a total capacity of over 850,000 metric tons per year (t/yr) in 2019, putting Iceland at 11th place among aluminium-producing nations worldwide as of 2023.\nRio Tinto Alcan operates Iceland's first aluminium smelter (plant name: ISAL), in Straumsv\u00edk, near the town of Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The plant has been in operation since 1969. Its initial capacity was 33,000 metric tons (t) per year, but it has since been expanded several times and now has a capacity of about 189,000 t/yr.\nThe second plant started production in 1998 and is operated by Nor\u00f0ur\u00e1l, a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S.-based Century Aluminum Company. It is located in Grundartangi in Western Iceland near the town of Akranes. Its former capacity was 220,000 t/yr but an expansion to 260,000 t/yr has already finished. In 2012, the plant produced 280,000 metric tons which was valued at 610 million dollars or 76 billion kr\u00f3nur. 4,300 gigawatts hours were used in the production that year, amounting to nearly one-fourth of all electrical energy produced in the country. In October 2013, Nor\u00f0ur\u00e1l announced the start of a five-year project aimed at increasing its production by a further 50,000 t/yr.\nUnited States\u2013based aluminium manufacturer Alcoa runs a plant near the town of Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The plant, known as \"Fjarda\u00e1l\" (or \"aluminium of the fjords\"), has a capacity of 346,000 t/yr and was put into operation in April 2008. To power the plant, Landsvirkjun built K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar, a 690-MW hydropower station. The project was enormous in the context of the Icelandic economy, increasing total installed electric power capacity from under 1,600 MW to around 2,300 MW.\nAccording to Alcoa, construction of Fjarda\u00e1l entailed no human displacement, no impact on endangered species, and no danger to commercial fisheries; there will also be no significant effect on reindeer, bird and seal populations. However, the project drew considerable opposition from environmentalist groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, which called on Alcoa to abandon the plan to build Fjarda\u00e1l. In addition, Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk was a notable early opponent to the plan; protesting the proposed construction, the singer's mother, Hildur R\u00fana Hauksd\u00f3ttir, went on a hunger strike in 2002.\nSeveral other aluminium smelter projects have been planned. Between 2005 and 2011, Alcoa conducted a feasibility study for a second plant in Iceland near H\u00fasav\u00edk. That plant was to have a 250,000 t/yr capacity, to be powered entirely by geothermal power, although later estimates showed a potential need for other sources of power. In October 2011, Alcoa announced its decision to cancel the Bakki project. In 2006, Nordur\u00e1l signed a memorandum of understanding with two Icelandic geothermal power producers, Hitaveita Su\u00f0urnesja and Orkuveita Reykjav\u00edkur, to purchase electricity for its own aluminium reduction project in Helguv\u00edk. The power supplied will initially support aluminium production of 150,000 t/yr, which will eventually grow to support 250,000 t/yr.\nFisheries.\nFisheries and related sectors\u2014in recent years labelled \"the ocean cluster\"\u2014was the single most important part of the Icelandic economy (it has now been replaced by tourism) representing an overall contribution to GDP of 27.1% in 2011. The fisheries sector directly employs around 9,000 people (4,900 in fishing and 4,100 in fish processing; approximately 5 per cent of Iceland's workforce), although it is estimated that a total of between 25,000 and 35,000 people (up to 20 per cent of the workforce) depend on the ocean cluster for their livelihood. Many of these jobs are provided by technological companies that manufacture equipment for fisheries firms and by companies engaged in the advanced processing of marine products or in biotechnical production. By contrast, aquaculture remains a very small industry in Iceland, employing only around 250 people for a production of 5,000 tonnes.\nIceland is the second biggest fisheries nation in the North East Atlantic behind Norway, having overtaken the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. Since 2006, Icelandic fishing waters have yielded a total catch of between 1.1m and 1.4m tonnes of fish annually, although this is down from a peak of over 2m tonnes in 2003.\nCod remains the most important species harvested by Icelandic fisheries, with a total catch of 178,516 tonnes in 2010. The catch of cod has stagnated in recent years due to quotas, and was supplemented by the catch of blue whiting, which is used mainly for processing. The Icelandic catch of this previously insignificant fish increased from a negligible 369 tonnes in 1995 to a peak of 501,505 tonnes in 2003. Subsequently, the stock showed signs of instability and quotas were reduced, leading to a decline in the catch to 87,121 tonnes in 2010. There have been increased numbers of Atlantic mackerel (the \"Miracle of the Mackerel\") in the 21st century as the Atlantic Ocean has slightly warmed.\nFinance.\nBanks.\nThe Icelandic banking system has been completely overhauled after the 2008 financial crisis. There are now three major commercial banks: Landsbankinn (National Bank since 2008), Arion Bank (formerly Kaupthing Bank) and Islandsbanki (formerly Glitnir), and Kvika banki (formerly MP Straumur). There are smaller banks and some savings banks, however they are not publicly traded.\nThere has been extensive consolidation of smaller banks, with Sparisjodur Keflavikur being taken over by Landsbanki and Byr being taken over by Islandsbanki. Arion Bank, Islandsbanki, and Kvika Banki are the only banks listed on Iceland Stock Exchange. Arion Bank is mostly owned by foreign creditors while Landsbanki and Islandsbanki are now wholly owned by the State. The ownership stake of the Icelandic State in the banks is managed by Bankasysla rikisins (State Financial Investments), which aims to privatise its shares in the banks in coming years.\nStock market.\nBecause of historically persistent inflation, historical reliance on fish production and the long-standing public ownership of the commercial banks, equity markets were slow to develop. Nasdaq Iceland, formerly the Iceland Stock Exchange (XICE) was created in 1985. Trading in Icelandic T-Bonds began in 1986 and trading in equities commenced in 1990. All domestic trading in Icelandic companies' shares, bonds and mutual funds takes place on Nasdaq Iceland.\nNasdaq Iceland has used electronic trading systems since its creation. Since 2000, SAXESS, the joint trading system of the NOREX alliance, has been used. There are currently two equities markets on Nasdaq Iceland. The Main Market is the larger and better known of the two. The Alternative Market is a less regulated over-the-counter market. Because of the small size of the market, trading is illiquid in comparison with larger markets. A variety of firms across all sectors of the Icelandic economy are listed on Nasdaq Iceland.\nThe most important stock market index was the OMX Iceland 15; however, this index was discontinued after the 2008 financial crisis following a decade in which it had been the worst-performing stock market index in the entire world, being \"more or less wiped out.\"\nOther financial markets.\nHistorically, investors tended to be reluctant to hold Icelandic bonds because of the persistence of high inflation and the volatility of the kr\u00f3na. What did exist was largely limited to bonds offered by the central government. The bond market on the ICEX has boomed since the 2010s, however, largely because of the resale of mortgages as housing bonds.\nA mutual fund market exists on the ICEX in theory, but no funds are currently listed. A small derivatives market formerly existed, but was closed in 1999 because of illiquidity.\nBy the end of 2018, Bitcoin mining was expected to consume more electricity in Iceland than all the country's residents combined.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017. Inflation under 2% is in green.\nExternal trade.\nIceland's economy is highly export-driven. Marine products account for the majority of goods exports. Other important exports include aluminium, ferro-silicon alloys, machinery and electronic equipment for the fishing industry, software, woollen goods. Most of Iceland's exports go to the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, the United States, and Japan. The 2020 value of Iceland's exports was $7.43 billion FOB.\nThe main imports are machinery and equipment, petroleum products, foodstuffs and textiles. Cement is Iceland's most imported product. The total 2020 value of imports was $7.55 billion. In 2019, Iceland's primary import partner was Norway (11%), followed by the Netherlands (10%), Germany (8%), Denmark (8%), United States (7%), United Kingdom (6%), PRC China (6%), and Sweden (5%). Most agricultural products are subject to high tariffs; the import of some products, such as uncooked meat, is greatly restricted for phyto-sanitary reasons.\nIceland's relatively liberal trading policy has been strengthened by accession to the European Economic Area in 1993 and by the Uruguay Round, which also brought significantly improved market access for Iceland's exports, particularly seafood products. However, the agricultural sector remains heavily subsidized and protected; some tariffs range as high as 700%.\nThe fishing industry is one of the most important industries. It provides 40% of export income and employs 7.0% of the workforce; therefore, the state of the economy remains sensitive to world prices for fish products.\nWhen corrected for the dramatic depreciation of the Icelandic kr\u00f3na in 2008 (approximately 50% against the euro and US dollar), imports since the 2007 peak have been negative.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomic agreements and policies.\nIceland became a full European Free Trade Association member in 1970 and entered into a free trade agreement with the European Community in 1973. Under the agreement on a European Economic Area, effective January 1, 1994, there is basically free cross-border movement of capital, labor, goods, and services between Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, and the EU countries. However, many of Iceland's political parties remain opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland also has bilateral free trade agreements with several countries outside the EEA. The most extensive of these is the Hoyv\u00edk Agreement between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, this agreement goes even further than the EEA agreement by establishing free trade in agricultural products between the nations.\nIceland and China signed a free trade agreement on 15 april 2013, the fist such agreement China made with a western country.\nIceland has a free trade agreement with Mexico on November 27, 2000.\nCurrency and monetary policy.\nThe currency of Iceland is the \"kr\u00f3na\" (plural: \"kr\u00f3nur\"), issued exclusively by the Central Bank of Iceland since the bank's founding in 1961.\nDuring the 1970s the oil shocks (1973 and 1979 energy crisis) hit Iceland hard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987 but rising to 30% in 1988. Iceland experienced moderately strong GDP growth (3% on average) from 1995 to 2004. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but the economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. Growth in 2005 exceeded 6%. Inflation averaged merely 1.5% from 1993 to 1994, and only 1.7% from 1994 to 1995. Inflation over 2006 topped at 8.6%, with a rate of 6.9% as of January 2007. Standard &amp; Poor's reduced their rating for Iceland to AA\u2212 from A+ (long term) in December 2006, following a loosening of fiscal policy by the Icelandic government ahead of the 2007 elections. Foreign debt rose to more than five times the value of Iceland's GDP, and Iceland's Central Bank raised short-term interest rates to nearly 15% in 2007. Due to the plunging currency against the euro and dollar, in 2008 inflation was speculated to be at 20-25%.\nInflation increased during the 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis, and the Central Bank of Iceland pegged the krona's value to the euro at increasingly higher and higher rates in an attempt to keep the currency stable, eventually pegging it at 340 kronur per euro before all trade in the currency was suspended. The krona similarly fell in value against the US dollar, going from around 50\u201380 per dollar to about 110\u2013115 per dollar. By November 2008, it had continued to lower to 135 to the dollar. By early April 2009, the value hovered around 119 per dollar, roughly maintaining that value over the next two years. The currency has stabalized since the crisis, with 1 US$ being worth 137.22 Icelandic kronur in September 2024.\nDespite being heavily integrated into European Union via the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Schengen Agreement, Iceland does not use the euro. Then-Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, Arn\u00f3r Sighvatsson, said that Iceland would not adopt the euro \"as it entails extra cost of purchase of new base money for the banking system and larger precautionary foreign exchange reserves.\nGrowth.\nIceland's economy had been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the 1990s, and new developments in software production, biotechnology, and financial services were taking place. The tourism sector was also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale watching. However, in 2008, the Icelandic economy entered a deep recession during the Great Recession. Although Iceland's economy grew 3.3% during the last quarter of 2009, the overall contraction in GDP over 2009 was 6.5%, less than the 10% originally forecasted by the IMF.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Iceland has a highly developed telecommunications sector with modern infrastructure. Multiple wholesale and retail providers are operated in a competitive market. As of 2024, Iceland's telecom infrastructure is fully digitised and mostly fibre based, with 93% of households having full-fibre availability. Landlines are based on VoIP technology. Mobile telecoms in Iceland adheres to the GSM standard and 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G services are available, as well as a TETRA network for emergency communications. Iceland is connected by four submarine cables to both Europe and North America. Broadcasting is based on DVB-T2 standard for television and FM for radio. There are a few printed newspapers, although most mass media is consumed online. Postal service is provided under universal obligation by the state-owned Iceland Post, but other private postal companies also operate.\nHistory.\nThe first submarine telegraph cable connection to the British Isles reached Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in Iceland in 1906 by the Great Northern Telegraph Co. Around the same time telephone communication was opened between Reykjavik and nearby Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. By 1911 a telephone line connected Reykjavik in the west of Iceland to Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the east via Akureyri in the north. A line to the Vestmannaeyjar was constructed a few years later, and by 1929 a line along the south coast of the island connected Reykjavik to Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur via V\u00edk, completing the ring around Iceland. \nAs a backup to the submarine telegraph cable, and for wider communications to other countries and ships, the Wireless Telegraphy Station in Melarnir was built in 1918. It operated using a T-antenna hung from two masts and was known as Reykjav\u00edk Radio, call sign TFA. It was a breakthrough in maritime safety in Iceland as ships were able to communicate to land for the first time. The transmissions were moved in 1953 to a site in Gufunes and Rj\u00fapnah\u00e6\u00f0.\nA teleprinter service was introduced to the island in 1930. As of 1933, there were 55 telephones for every 1000 inhabitants on the island. The first short-wave radio station was established in Iceland in 1935\u201336, linking the country up to international radio-telephone services. By January 1936 there were 106 radio-licence holders for every 1000 Icelandic inhabitants. Due to the Icelandic naming system, people were listed by their first name in the telephone directory, and not by their last name (which is usually a patronym).\nThe first automatic telephone exchanges opened in Reykjav\u00edk and Hafnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in 1932, and by 1976 all towns had automatic telephone exchanges.\nIn 1962, the SCOTICE (to Scotland) and ICECAN (Canada) coaxial submarine telephone cables were put into use, greatly increasing reliability and capacity of international telephone and telegraph traffic as well as opening up telex services for the first time. These new cables rendered the original 1906 telegraph cable obsolete and it was taken out of use. They had a capacity of 32 and 24 telephone circuits respectively.\nIn 1980, the first satellite ground station was opened in Iceland, called Skyggnir. Initially connecting to the Intelsat system, most international telephone and telex traffic now used satellite communications. These new ground stations enabled International Direct Dialling, as well as allowing Iceland to access time-shifted as well as live television broadcast material from abroad, including Iceland's participation in Eurovision in 1986. Iceland's first internet connection was via satellite in 1986 with a 300\u20131200 bit/s UUCP link to Amsterdam. By 1987 the older coaxial submarine cables SCOTICE and ICECAN were taken out of use after a secondary backup ground station opened near H\u00f6fn in eastern Iceland, leaving Iceland solely dependent on satellite communications for international traffic during this period.\nThe first digital telephone exchange was opened in 1984 and all telephone exchanges were digitalised in the country by 1995. By 1986 all rural shared party lines were upgraded to individual lines.\nIn 1986, mobile telephony was available for the first time using an NMT 1G (first generation) network, followed by GSM services in 1994 and SMS messaging in 1997, followed by MMS in 2003.\nIn 1991, a fibre ring was completed that circles the country, roughly following the route of Iceland's ring road (Route 1), passing through most towns and cities. It was constructed by the Icelandic Government and NATO to link radar stations of the Iceland Air Defence System, as well as to enhance domestic telecommunications. It consists of 8 fibres and is still in use as of 2023.\nIn 1994, the first fibre submarine cable, CANTAT-3, reached Iceland linking it to Canada, Germany, UK and Denmark with a capacity of 7.5\u00a0Gbit/s. This greatly increased bandwidth and allowed internet connections to become more widely available.\nAs bandwidth and reliability demands grew in the 21st century, more fibre submarine cables were launched to Iceland: FARICE in 2003 to the UK and Faroe Islands; DANICE in 2009 to Denmark; Greenland Connect in 2009 to Greenland and Canada and lastly IRIS in 2023 to Ireland. With multiple redundant submarine fibre routes, the satellite ground station Skyggnir was taken out of use in 2005 and CANTAT-3 became defunct in 2009.\nIn the mid-1990s, the telecom market was opened to competition, breaking the state-owned Iceland Telecom's monopoly, and it was later privatised in 2005.\nIn 1994, dial-up internet services became available; in 1999 ADSL services launched, followed by VDSL in 2009. Fibre to the home services began rolling out in 2004 and had expanded to 90% of the population by 2022.\nIn 2010, the NMT (1G) mobile network was shut down. 3G launched in 2006, 4G in 2013 and 5G in 2020.\nIn 2018, telegram services were discontinued.\nAnalogue PSTN/POTS and ISDN telephone services (along with dial-up internet) were phased out from 2020 to 2024, replaced by VoIP services. Copper-based DSL services continue to be available. In April 2024, M\u00edla announced plans for a complete copper shut down by 2028, including DSL services, fully transitioning Icelandic telecoms to fibre based services. 2G and 3G services are due to be shut down by year end 2025.\nSubmarine connectivity.\nCurrent internet and telephone services rely on submarine communications cables for external traffic, with a total capacity of 60.2\u00a0Tbit/s.\nServices.\nInternet.\nInternet service providers.\nThe largest Internet service providers in Iceland:\nInternet hosting service.\nIceland has numerous internet hosting services:\nInternet exchange points.\nIceland has two Internet exchange points. They are the Reykjavik Internet Exchange (RIX) and M\u00fali-IXP.\nMail.\n\u00cdslandsp\u00f3stur is the national postal service of Iceland and operates under a universal service obligation. Other private companies also operate, such as DHL, UPS and FedEx.\nRadio.\nIceland uses FM radio broadcasts, all stations are also available over internet radio, with some smaller stations being only distributed over internet radio. Nationwide networks which cover the whole country include public radio stations R\u00e1s 1 and R\u00e1s 2 as well as Bylgjan. Other commercial broadcasters mostly operate in the Reykjav\u00edk area, and many are available in more populated areas.\nTelephone.\nLandline.\nAs of 2022 there are 116,142 landlines in use in Iceland. The number of landlines in Iceland has been slowly decreasing since their peak in 2001 at 196,528. Analogue PSTN/POTS and ISDN telephone services were phased out from 2020 to 2024, replaced by VoIP services.\nMobile.\nAs of 2022, there are 521,722 active mobile subscriptions in use in Iceland. 4G and 5G services are operated by 3 mobile operators, and 2G and 3G are still in operation until 2025. NOVA was the first network to offer 4G in 2013 and first to offer 5G in 2020. S\u00edminn and Vodafone launched their 4G service in 2013 and 5G in 2021. 2G and 3G services are due to be shut down in 2025. The NMT (1G) network was shut down in 2010.\nTelephone numbers.\nThere are no area codes in Iceland as such, and all ordinary telephone numbers have seven digits. The international dialling code is +354. Numbers of mobile phones tend to begin with either 6, 7 or 8, while landline numbers start with 5 (in Reykjav\u00edk) or 4 (outside Reykjav\u00edk).\nTelevision.\nTelevision in Iceland began in September 1966 by the public broadcaster R\u00daV. Iceland's television distribution is based on the DVB-T2 system but most television is consumed through IPTV and over-the-top internet services. The privately owned St\u00f6\u00f0 2, owned by S\u00fdn, began as Iceland's second largest broadcaster in 1986. S\u00edminn also operates television channels and broadcasting services.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Domestically, the principal mode of transportation is by road, supplemented by air transport for longer distances. International transport is mostly by sea for freight and by air for passenger services, post and perishable goods. There are no railways, although there are passenger bus services. \nThe Icelandic Transport Authority regulates all modes of transport in Iceland. Most of the country's transport infrastructure is concentrated near the Greater Reykjav\u00edk Area, which is home to 64% of the country's population. \nRail.\nIceland has no railways, although proposals to build a passenger line between Keflav\u00edk and Reykjav\u00edk have been made as well as proposals to build a light rail system in Reykjav\u00edk.\nIn the past, two locomotive-powered railways were used during certain construction projects as well as cable and manually hauled railways have been used, but these have long since been dismantled.\nRoad.\nTransport in Iceland is heavily dependent on roads and most domestic freight and passenger transport is carried by road. As of 2025, Iceland has of public highways, of which are paved. Most highways are two-lane roads, but in the southwestern corner of the country dual carriageways are prevalent, including in and around Reykjav\u00edk. Roads to remote areas, including the highlands are usually unpaved. Iceland has 14 road tunnels, including one undersea tunnel, totalling around 60 km. \nIceland drives on the right. The national speed limit is ; in tunnels and through urban areas. Road signs in Iceland are based on the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals but it is not a signatory. Iceland is a party to the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic. \nThe Ring Road of Iceland (Route 1) circles the entire country. It is a major trunk route and is considered to be the most important piece of transport infrastructure in Iceland as it connects the majority of towns together in the most densely populated areas of the country. Economically, it carries a large proportion of goods traffic as well as tourist traffic. The total length of the road is , making it the longest ring road in Europe. Most other routes branch off the ring road. \nVegager\u00f0in, the Icelandic Road Administration, manages the country's road network. 11.4% of passenger-kilometres are by bus and 88.6% by car, as of 2018. Iceland has one of the highest rates of car ownership in the world\u2014with 779 cars per 1000 people as of 2024.\nCycling.\nDedicated cycling infrastructure exists within the Greater Reykjav\u00edk Area and other towns. Cycling on national highways is permitted, but discouraged due to unsafe conditions on high traffic two-lane roads. Dedicated cycle paths exist between Keflav\u00edk Airport and the town of Keflav\u00edk, as well as between Selfoss and Eyrarbakki. \nSea.\nAs an island country, Iceland has always been reliant on the sea for transportation. Most towns in Iceland are located on the coast for this reason, as shipping was the only viable option and for access to fishing grounds. Domestic freight shipping went into decline with the development of the road network in the late 20th century. All ports in Iceland are ice-free year round. In the early 21st century, there was a significant increase in cruise ship traffic to, from and around Iceland.\nMerchant marine.\nEimskip and Samskip are the major shipping companies of Iceland providing container routes to Europe and North America. Other shipping companies also provide service.\nTransport ferries.\nThe only habitable islands around Iceland are connected with the mainland by regular ferries:\nThere is one international roll-on/roll-off ferry, Norr\u00f6na, between Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur on the east coast of Iceland to Hirtshals, Denmark via T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands. It is run by Smyril Line.\nAir.\nAs of 2024, there are 83 airports in Iceland, of which 12 are served by regular scheduled passenger air service. Keflav\u00edk International Airport is by far largest airport and is the country's international transport hub; almost all journeys to and from Iceland pass through this airport. Akureyri Airport is also served by scheduled international services. Reykjav\u00edk Airport, located within the city, is the country's domestic hub. \nThe largest airline is Icelandair, which provides both international and domestic connectivity. Norlandair provides air service to more remote domestic destinations. Iceland is unusually well connected, considering its population, with over 80 destinations served primarily to North America and Europe, as a result of its tourism industry and role as a transatlantic bridge.\nPublic transport.\nPublic transport in Iceland is based entirely on buses, as no railways or rapid transit systems exist. The largest bus system is in the Greater Reykjav\u00edk Area, operated by Str\u00e6t\u00f3. Urban bus systems also operate in the towns of Akureyri, Akranes, Egilssta\u00f0ir and Reykjanesb\u00e6r (Keflav\u00edk).\nStr\u00e6t\u00f3 also manages long-distance buses around the country which are operated from the Mj\u00f3dd terminal in Reykjav\u00edk. Most towns in Iceland are served by long-distance bus services and regional systems also operate in \u00c1rborg (Selfoss), the Westfjords and in North and East Iceland. Long-distance services are infrequent and mainly targeted towards schoolchildren, although some trunk routes are better served. All ferries, as described in the previous section, carry passengers. Many in Iceland consider domestic air travel a form of public transport.\nAutomobile ownership in Iceland is high\u2014the country has one of the highest rates in the world\u2014with 779 cars per 1000 people (as of 2024), a figure similar to the United States. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, government policy and investment was based on road transport, including in Reykjav\u00edk. As a result, Iceland is highly car-dependent and public transport systems in Iceland are relatively underdeveloped. Long-distance travel between towns in Iceland was previously dependent on air travel, due to terrain and underdeveloped road networks, as such long-distance buses never became very prevalent.\nA bus rapid transit system is planned for the Greater Reykjav\u00edk Area, called Borgarl\u00edna. Originally envisioned as a light rail system, the network will be composed of dedicated rights of way for buses and prioritised junctions. As of 2025, the first phase is due to open in 2031.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64585", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64585", "title": "Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania", "text": "City in Pennsylvania\nWilkes-Barre ( or ) is a city in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. Located along the Susquehanna River in Northeastern Pennsylvania, it had a population of 44,328 in the 2020 census. It is part of the Wyoming Valley metropolitan area, which includes five cities and more than 40 boroughs forming a contiguous urban corridor with an estimated 574,000 residents. Wilkes-Barre is located north-northwest of Allentown, north-northwest of Philadelphia, and west-northwest of New York City.\nWilkes-Barre is framed by the Pocono Mountains to the east, the Endless Mountains to the north and west, and the Lehigh Valley to the south. The city was founded in 1769, incorporated as a borough in 1806, and re-incorporated as a city in 1869. It experienced significant growth in the 19th century due to the development of nearby anthracite coal mines and a large influx of immigrant labor. Industrial expansion continued into the early 20th century, with the population peaking at over 86,000 in 1930. Following World War II, the city's economy declined due to the collapse of industry and the 1959 Knox Mine disaster, which rendered much of the region's coal mining infrastructure unusable. In the 21st century, the city's population is approximately half its 1930 peak, but it remains the largest city in Luzerne County and the 13th-largest city in Pennsylvania.\nHistory.\n18th century.\nBy the 18th century, the Wyoming Valley was inhabited by the Shawnee and Lenape, also known as Delaware Indian tribes. In 1753, the Susquehanna Company was founded in Connecticut for settling the Wyoming Valley in present-day Pennsylvania. Connecticut succeeded in purchasing the land from the Native Americans; however, Pennsylvania already claimed the very same territory through a purchase they made in 1736. In 1762, roughly two hundred Connecticut settlers (Yankees) established a settlement near Mill Creek. They planted wheat and constructed log cabins. The Yankees returned to New England for the winter.\nThe Connecticut settlers returned in the spring of 1763 with their families and additional supplies. A party of Iroquois also visited the area with the dual purpose of turning the Lenape tribe against the colonists and killing Teedyuscung, a local Lenape chief. On April 19, 1763, the residence of the chief, along with several others, was set ablaze. Chief Teedyuscung perished in the inferno. The Iroquois let the Lenape believe that this atrocity was committed by the settlers. As a result, the Lenape attacked the colonists on October 15, 1763, killing thirty settlers and taking several others as prisoners. Those who managed to escape fled back to New England. The Lenape then burned what was left of the settlement.\nIn 1769, the Yankees returned to the Wyoming Valley. Five townships were established by Connecticut. Each one was five square miles and divided amongst forty settlers. Wilkes-Barre Township was one of the original townships; it was named in honor of John Wilkes and Isaac Barr\u00e9\u2014two British members of Parliament who supported colonial America. Pennsylvanians (Pennamites) also arrived in the valley that same year.\nThe Connecticut settlers established Fort Durkee, which was named in honor of their leader, Colonel Durkee. This was immediately followed by the Pennamite-Yankee War\u2014a series of skirmishes between Pennsylvanian and Connecticut settlers. The land changed hands several times between the two groups. The Congress of the Confederation was asked to resolve the matter. With the Decree of Trenton, on December 30, 1782, the confederation government officially decided that the region belonged to Pennsylvania, and the Wyoming Valley became part of Northumberland County.\nDuring the Revolutionary War two forts were built at Wilkes-Barre. Fort Wilkes-Barre was completed in 1778 but was abandoned and burned later that year following the Battle of Wyoming. Fort Wyoming (later renamed Fort Dickinson) was constructed when the Continental Army reoccupied the Wyoming Valley and served as a staging area for the Sullivan Expedition in 1779.\nAfter the Revolutionary War the State of Pennsylvania ruled that the Connecticut settlers were not citizens of Pennsylvania. They were not permitted to vote and were ordered to give up their property claims. In May 1784, armed men from Pennsylvania force-marched the Connecticut settlers away from the valley. By November, the Yankees returned with a greater force. They captured and destroyed Fort Dickinson in Wilkes-Barre. With that victory, a new state (which was separate from both Connecticut and Pennsylvania) was proposed. The new state was to be named Westmoreland. To ensure that they did not lose the land, Pennsylvania's state government negotiated a compromise with the Connecticut (Yankee) settlers. The Yankee settlers would become citizens of Pennsylvania and their property claims would be restored prior to the Decree of Trenton. As part of the compromise, Pennsylvania would establish a new county in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Yankees agreed to the terms.\nOn September 25, 1786, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a resolution which created Luzerne County. It was formed from a section of Northumberland County and named after Chevalier de la Luzerne, a French soldier and diplomat during the 18th century. Wilkes-Barre became the seat of government for the new territory. This resolution ended the idea of creating a new state.\nIn 1797, several decades after the community's founding, Louis Philippe, later the King of France from 1830 to 1848, stayed in Wilkes-Barre while traveling to the French Asylum settlement.\n19th century.\nWilkes-Barre's population skyrocketed due to the discovery of anthracite coal in the 19th century. In 1808, Judge Jesse Fell of Wilkes-Barre discovered a solution to ignite anthracite with the usage of an iron grate; it allowed for the coal to light and burn more easily. This invention increased the popularity of anthracite as a fuel source. This led to the expansion of the coal industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania; Wilkes-Barre was nicknamed \"The Diamond City\" due to its high productivity of mining coal. The growing demand for coal as a domestic heat source resulted in changes to patterns of immigration to Wilkes-Barre in the 19th century. The Pennsylvania guide, compiled by the Writers' Program of the Works Progress Administration in 1940, noted that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Until 1870 all immigration was from the north of Europe, with the Irish predominating. Then mine operators sent representatives to central and southern Europe to induce peasants to come to the American coal fields. Many of the older workers consequently were supplanted by newcomers willing to work for low wages, and bitter conflicts followed. The cleavage along national lines, however, gave to Wilkes-Barre such picturesque sections as Five Points, now East End, where a crowd of miners used to gather nightly on the steps of Mackin Brothers' Store, a scene described by Con Carbon in a popular ballad of the 1890s:&lt;poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"&gt;\nAnd once thy peaceful tide\nThe Far Downs and Connaught men\nFight, and then make up again,\nDutch and Scotch and English men\u2014\nAll like chickens in a pen.\nThe powder smoke does be so thick,\nYou could not cut it with a pick,\nThe smell of gas would make you sick\nIn front of Mackin's store.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThroughout the 1800s, canals and railroads were constructed to aid in the mining and transportation of coal. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants flocked to the city; they were seeking jobs in the numerous mines and collieries that sprang up throughout the region. In 1806, Wilkes-Barre Borough was formed from a segment of Wilkes-Barre Township; it was later incorporated as a city in 1871. This was the direct result of the population boom. At its peak, Wilkes-Barre had a population of over 86,000 in the 1930s and 40s.\nNew industries were established and the Vulcan Iron Works was a well-known manufacturer of railway locomotives from 1849 to 1954. During Wilkes-Barre's reign as an industrial and economic force in America, several major companies and franchises became based in the city, such as Woolworth's, Sterling Hotels, Miner's Bank, Bell Telephone, Luzerne National Bank, and Stegmaier.\nEven though the overall economy was doing very well, the city was still prone to natural disasters. Besides frequent flooding from the Susquehanna River, Wilkes-Barre also endured a devastating F3 tornado on August 19, 1890. The twister killed 16 people, injured 50, damaged or destroyed 260 buildings, and cost at least $240,000 (in 1890 money).\n20th century.\nWilkes-Barre is located within Pennsylvania's Coal Region. The anthracite coal mining industry, and its extensive use of child labor in the early 20th century, was one of the industries targeted by the National Child Labor Committee and its hired photographer, Lewis Hine. Many of Hine's subjects were photographed in the mines and coal fields near Wilkes-Barre. The impact of the Hine photographs led to the enactment of child labor laws across the country.\nThe coal industry continued despite several disasters, including an explosion at Wilkes-Barre's Baltimore Colliery in 1919, which killed 92 miners. The industry declined when the United States switched to other energy sources, and most coal operations had left Wilkes-Barre by the end of World War II. The 1959 Knox Mine Disaster, resulting in the flooding of numerous mines, marked the end of large-scale coal mining in the area. Industrial restructuring also caused the city to lose jobs and begin a decades-long decline.\nIn 1926, Planters Peanuts Company was founded in Wilkes-Barre by two Italian immigrants. The company maintained its headquarters in the city until 1961. In 1929, baseball player Babe Ruth hit one of the longest home runs in history at Artillery Park in Wilkes-Barre.\nOn November 8, 1972, Wilkes-Barre became the birthplace of modern cable television programming when Home Box Office (HBO) launched over the city's Teleservice Cable system (now Service Electric Cable). Around 365 Teleservice subscribers were the first to receive the premium cable service when it commenced broadcasts. As local ordinances prohibiting direct-to-cable telecasts of theatrical feature films prevented Time-Life from launching HBO over its New York City-based Sterling Manhattan cable franchise, the company initially sought an agreement with Teleservice to launch it on the provider's Allentown system; possible television blackout conflicts for HBO-televised NBA games, as Allentown was located within the Philadelphia 76ers's blackout radius, resulted in Teleservice electing to offer it on its Wilkes-Barre system instead.\nWilkes-Barre became the site of a shooting spree on September 25, 1982. George Emil Banks killed 13 people and wounded one. Banks was deemed incompetent to be executed yet currently resides on death row.\nFlooding.\nManufacturing and retail remained Wilkes-Barre's strongest industries, but the city's economy took a major blow from Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972. The storm pushed the Susquehanna River to a height of nearly , four feet above the city's levees, flooding downtown with nine feet of water. A total of 128 deaths were attributed to the storm. Most drowning deaths were caused by people trapped in their cars. Almost 400,000 homes and businesses were destroyed and 220,000 Pennsylvanians were left homeless (as were hundreds of thousands in other states). Damage was estimated to be $2.1 billion in Pennsylvania alone. President Richard Nixon sent aid to the area, after flying over in his helicopter on his way to his Camp David retreat (on June 24, 1972).\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Wilkes-Barre attempted to prevent the damage from storms as intense as Agnes by building a levee system that rises ; completed in January 2003, the network of levees cost roughly $250 million. It has successfully resisted other threatening floods in 1996, 2004, and 2006. The Army Corps of Engineers has praised the quality of the levees. In 2006, the city made the front page of national newspapers when 200,000 residents were told to evacuate in the wake of flooding that was forecast to reach levels near that of 1972, though the flooding fell short of predictions.\nIn late August 2011, Hurricane Irene, centered off the New Jersey coast, caused the Susquehanna River to rise to flood level, but there was no cause for alarm. Then, from September 6 to 8, heavy rains from the inland remnants of Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Katia offshore funneled heavy rain over the Wyoming Valley and into the Susquehanna River watershed. The Susquehanna swelled to record levels across the state. In Wilkes-Barre, it crested on September 9 at an all-time record of , nearly higher than water levels reached during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The levees protected Wilkes-Barre, but nearby boroughs did not escape, as West Pittston, Plymouth, and parts of Plains Township were affected by extreme flooding.\n21st century.\nRevitalization and construction.\nOn June 9, 2005, Thomas M. Leighton, the city's mayor, unveiled his \"I\u00a0believe...\" campaign for Wilkes-Barre, which was intended to boost the city's spirits. Construction began on a planned downtown theatre complex, which had a grand opening on June 30, 2006. Renovation of the landmark Hotel Sterling was being pursued by CityVest, a nonprofit developer. The expansion of Wilkes University and King's College took place. Also, the canopy and matching street lights in Public Square and across downtown were removed; they were replaced by new green lampposts.\nWilkes-Barre celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2006. Several events, including a Beach Boys concert, were planned but canceled due to extremely heavy rains. Most of the city's population was ordered to evacuate on June 28, 2006, and the Bicentennial celebration was postponed to Labor Day weekend.\nThe Riverfront revitalization project (River Common), broke ground in 2007 and was completed in early 2010. It has made the riverfront accessible to the public. The area also has a new amphitheater for live performances and improved access through ramps and sidewalks. Fountains and color-changing lights have been added underneath two bridges which carry pedestrian traffic across the normally-open levee. The project stretches approximately four blocks from the Luzerne County Courthouse to the intersection of South River Street and West South Street. The River Common has since hosted concerts and charity events.\nSince completion of the River Common, additional improvements to city infrastructure have been progressing. New crosswalks have been installed downtown, including signage emphasizing that pedestrians have the right-of-way. The completion of the James F. Conahan Intermodal Transportation Facility has added parking and relocated Luzerne County buses from their former Public Square staging sites. This has reduced traffic congestion around the square. Private carrier Martz offers coach bus service from the terminal as well.\nThe widening and realignment of Coal Street, a major road connecting Wilkes-Barre City with Wilkes-Barre Township, was completed in 2012. The new Coal Street provides four lanes over the original two lanes, making travel between the highly commercial Wilkes-Barre Township and the city much easier. In 2013, Hotel Sterling was demolished due to flood damage in the hotel's basement (which compromised the building's integrity). As of today, several buildings are in the process of being constructed on the site of the former hotel.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.60%, is water. The city is bordered by the Susquehanna River to the west. Most of Downtown is located on a wide floodplain. Floodwalls were constructed to protect a large percentage of the city. The elevation of the downtown area is about above sea level. As you travel inland, away from the river, the elevation rises. Wilkes-Barre Mountain is a physical barrier southeast of the city.\nThe contiguous network of 5 cities and more than 40 boroughs all built in a straight line in Northeastern Pennsylvania's urban area act culturally and logistically as one continuous city, so while the city of Wilkes-Barre itself is a smaller town, the larger unofficial city of Scranton/Wilkes-Barre contains nearly half a million residents in roughly 200 square miles.\nWilkes-Barre is located approximately northwest of Allentown, and northwest of Philadelphia. Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding Wyoming Valley are framed by the Pocono Mountains to the east, the Endless Mountains to the north and west, and the Lehigh Valley to the south. The Susquehanna River flows through the center of the valley and defines the northwestern border of the city.\nNeighborhoods.\nWilkes-Barre houses over one dozen neighborhoods:\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Wilkes-Barre falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\") if the isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") if the isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Winters are cold with a January average of . The surrounding mountains have an influence on the climate (including both precipitation and temperatures), leading to wide variations within a short distance. On average, temperatures below are infrequent, occurring 2.5 days per year, and there are 34.9 days where the maximum temperature remains below . The average annual snowfall is during the winter (in which severe snowstorms are rare). However, when snowstorms do occur, they can disrupt normal routines for several days.\nSummers are warm with a July average of . In an average summer, temperatures exceeding occur on 11.7 days and but rarely exceed . Spring and fall are unpredictable with temperatures ranging from cold to warm (although they are usually mild). On average, Wilkes-Barre receives of precipitation each year, which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year (though the summer months receive more precipitation). Extreme temperatures range from on January 21, 1994, to on July 9, 1936. Wilkes-Barre averages 2,303 hours of sunshine per year, ranging from a low of 96 hours in December (or 33% of possible sunshine) to 286 hours in July (or 62% of possible sunshine).\nThe hardiness zone is 6b except in downtown and other areas near the river which are 7a. The city is significantly warmer than the W-B/Scranton Airport due to the airport's higher latitude and elevation.\nParks and recreation.\nWilkes-Barre has a Downtown Riverfront Park system that contains 91 acres of open space.\nKirby Park is a public park located along the western bank of the Susquehanna River. Kirby Park is one of the region's most valued recreational resources. Given to the city of Wilkes-Barre by the Kirby Family, the park welcomes hundreds of thousands each year. The park is the setting for the city's annual Cherry Blossom Festival (held during the last weekend of April) and the city's July 4 Celebration. Its amenities include tennis courts, a fitness trail, pond, walking paths, running track, softball fields, parking area, volleyball courts, pavilions, and more.\nNesbitt Park is also located on the west side of the Susquehanna River. It is located across from Kirby Park. Nesbitt is open to the public. It has walking paths and areas for picnicking.\nThe River Common is located along the eastern bank of the Susquehanna River. The Market Street Bridge bisects the park. The River Common joins with the Luzerne County Courthouse grounds. Its features include a 750-person amphitheater, paved walk-ways, gardens, ornamental trees, seating areas, a fishing pier, and two grand gateways connecting the city to the river.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe city's population was in constant decline from the 1930s through 2010, but losses stopped that decade, and it saw growth as of 2020. As of the 2020 census, there were 44,328 people and 15,581 households residing in the city. The population density was 5,945 per square mile. The racial makeup of the city was 69.80% White, 14.90% African American, 0.40% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.20% Pacific Islander, and 4.60% from two or more races.

The current mayor is George Brown (Democrat). He has been in office since 2019. Before becoming mayor he was a business man and a former city councilman.\nLegislative.\nThe legislative branch consists of a five-member City Council. They are elected by a single-member district to four-year terms. The following are current members of the council: Bill Barrett, Mike Belusko, Tony Brooks, Stan Mirin, and Jessica McClay.\nAudit and Control.\nThe office of Audit and Control is the third branch of Wilkes-Barre City government. It is headed by the City Controller, elected to a four-year term. Tony C. Thomas, the current City Controller, is a Democrat and has been in office since 2024.\nJudicial.\nThe city of Wilkes-Barre is served by two City Attorneys (Timothy Henry and Maureen Collins). They advise both the mayor and city council.\nCounty government.\nThe Luzerne County government operates out of Wilkes-Barre. The city is the administrative center of Luzerne County. The county government is responsible for imposing taxes, providing services to the public, and administering laws and regulations. They govern over a population of nearly 320,000 people. Many government offices are situated within the county courthouse (located at 200 North River Street in Downtown Wilkes-Barre). The Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas also operates out of the same building.\nOn November 2, 2010, the voters of Luzerne County held a referendum on the question of home rule. A total of 51,413 (55.25%) voted in favor of home rule, while another 41,639 (44.75%) voted against the move. This vote was the direct result of the corruption, wasteful spending, higher property taxes, and out-of-control debt facing the county. The home rule charter took effect on January 2, 2012; the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners was abolished and replaced with the new form of government (council\u2013manager government). This government consists of a county council. The council chair, who is appointed by his or her fellow council members, is both the highest-ranking officer on the assembly and the head of county government for ceremonial purposes. The council also appoints and works alongside a full-time manager (who supervises the county's day-to-day operations).\nThe county government is also made up of many other officials (e.g., the county controller, district attorney, and sheriff).\nEducation.\nHigh schools.\nWilkes-Barre City is part of the Wilkes-Barre Area School District. The district operates one high school, Wilkes-Barre Area High School. It opened in 2020 and replaced James M. Coughlin High School, G. A. R. Memorial Junior Senior High School, and Elmer L. Meyers High School.\nHoly Redeemer High School is a Catholic school in Wilkes-Barre managed by the Diocese of Scranton.\nColleges.\nThe area in and around Wilkes-Barre is home to several colleges and universities:\nLibraries.\nAlong with the libraries associated with the colleges, Wilkes-Barre has several libraries. These include three branches of the Osterhout Free Library, with the headquarters for the Luzerne County Library System in the main branch.\nTransportation.\nAirports.\nTwo international airlines fly from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in nearby Pittston Township. Smaller, private planes may also use the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport in Forty Fort.\nHighways.\nInterstate 81 passes north\u2013south near Wilkes-Barre, and the city is also located near the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It is also about north of Interstate 80. The North Cross Valley Expressway, starting at the junction of Interstate 81 and Pennsylvania Route 115, carries Pennsylvania Route 309 through northern Wilkes-Barre, connecting the city to Dallas in the north. Route 115 provides access from the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Northeast Extension, but it does not enter Wilkes-Barre city limits.\nBuses.\nPublic transportation is provided by the Luzerne County Transportation Authority. In addition to servicing the city, it provides transportation for the northern half of the county. It also has a connecting bus to Scranton via an interchange at Pittston with the Transit System of Lackawanna County (COLTS), the public transit authority of Lackawanna County.\nMartz Trailways provides intercity bus service from the Martz Trailways Bus Terminal in downtown Wilkes-Barre to Scranton, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, and Wind Creek Bethlehem.\nSeveral jitney companies operate from Wilkes-Barre through Stroudsburg to Paterson and New York City via I-80.\nRail.\nThe city was at one time served by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (later Erie Lackawanna Railway), Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad, and the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad (known as the Laurel Line). CNJ trains included the \"Interstate Express\" (ending in 1957) and local service to Allentown and Philadelphia. The last Lehigh Valley trains were the \"Black Diamond\" (ending in 1959), \"John Wilkes\" and \"Maple Leaf\" (the last two, ending in 1961).\nThe Wilkes-Barre Traction Company formed a streetcar line from Georgetown to Nanticoke and over the river into Plymouth (it ceased operations in the mid-1940s).\nThe Norfolk Southern Railway, which acquired the former Delaware and Hudson line from successor Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Luzerne and Susquehanna Railway, provide freight service within the city.\nArts and culture.\nMedia.\n\"Times Leader\" and \"The Citizens' Voice\" are the two largest daily newspapers in Wilkes-Barre. The Wyoming Valley's NBC affiliate, WBRE-TV 28, is the only television station licensed to Wilkes-Barre, but WNEP-TV 16 (ABC), WYOU 22 (CBS), WVIA-TV 44 (PBS), and WSWB 38 (CW), all in Scranton, WOLF-TV 56 (Fox) in Hazleton, and WQMY 53 (MyNetworkTV) in Williamsport also serve the city. Wilkes-Barre's radio market is ranked No. 69 by Arbitron's ranking system. There are news, adult alternative, and music radio stations which are receivable in the area.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Iceland maintains no standing army, the only NATO member for which this is the case.\nThe Coast Guard consists of three ships and four aircraft and armed with small arms, naval artillery, and air defence radar stations. The Coast Guard also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System, formerly part of the disestablished Defence Agency, which conducts surveillance from the ground of Iceland's air space.\nAdditionally, there is a Crisis Response Unit (ICRU), operated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which is a small peacekeeping force that has been deployed internationally, since 2008. This unit also has an unarmed component.\nThere is a treaty with the United States, which until 2006 maintained the Naval Air Station Keflavik, regarding the defence of Iceland. The base, now operated by the Icelandic Coast Guard, has been regularly visited by the US military and other allied NATO members. In 2017 the United States announced its interest in renovating a hangar, in order to accommodate a Boeing P-8 Poseidon ASW aircraft at the air base.\nThere are also agreements concerning military and other security operations with Norway, Denmark and other NATO countries.\nIceland holds the annual NATO exercises entitled Northern Viking. The most recent exercises were held in 2024, as well as the EOD exercise \"Northern Challenge\". In 1997 Iceland hosted its first Partnership for Peace (PfP) exercise, \"Cooperative Safeguard\", which is the only multilateral PfP exercise so far in which Russia has participated. Another major PfP exercise was hosted in 2000. Iceland has also contributed ICRU peacekeepers to SFOR, KFOR and ISAF.\nIceland has never participated in a full-scale war or invasion. Furthermore, the constitution of Iceland has no mechanism to declare war.\nHistory.\nIn the period from the settlement of Iceland, in the 870s, until it became part of the realm of the Norwegian King, military defences of Iceland consisted of multiple chieftains (\"Go\u00f0ar\") and their free followers (\"\u00feingmenn\", \"b\u00e6ndur\" or \"li\u00f0smenn\") organised according to the standard Nordic military doctrine of the time in expeditionary armies such as the \"lei\u00f0angr\". These armies were divided into units according to the quality of the warriors and by birth. At the end of this period, the number of chieftains had diminished and their power had grown, to the detriment of their followers. This resulted in a long and bloody civil war known as Age of the Sturlungs. A typical battle involved fewer than 1000 men.\nAmphibious operations were an important part of warfare in Iceland in this period, especially in the Westfjords, but large naval engagements were rare. The largest such engagement, known as Fl\u00f3abardagi, involved a few dozen ships in H\u00fanafl\u00f3i (bay).\nIn the decades before the Napoleonic Wars, the few hundred militiamen in the southwest of Iceland were mainly equipped with rusty and mostly obsolete medieval weaponry, including 16th-century halberds. When British privateers arrived in 1808, after most of the Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy had been captured or destroyed in the battle of Copenhagen in 1807, the amount of gunpowder in Iceland was so small that the governor of Iceland, Frederich Christopher Trampe, Count of Trampe, could not offer any resistance.\nIn 1855, Andreas August von Kohl, the sheriff in Vestmannaeyjar, wished to establish a citizen militia to protect the archipelago against foreign raiders and unruly fishermen. In 1856, the king provided 180 rixdollars to buy guns, and a further 200 rixdollars the following year. Kohl became the Captain of the new militia, which become known as \"Herfylkingin\", \"The Battalion\". In 1860 von Kohl died, and P\u00e9tur Bjarnasen took over command. Nine years later Bjarnasen died without appointing a successor, and the militia ceased to exist.\n \nIn 1918, Iceland regained sovereignty as a separate kingdom under the Danish king. Iceland established a Coast Guard shortly afterwards, but it was financially impossible to establish a standing army. The government hoped that a permanent neutrality would shield the country from invasion. But at the onset of Second World War, the government was concerned about a possible invasion, and decided to expand the Icelandic National Police (\"R\u00edkisl\u00f6greglan\") and its reserves into a military unit. Chief Commissioner of Police Agnar Kofoed Hansen had been trained in the Danish Army and he moved to train his officers. Weapons and uniforms were acquired, and they practised rifleshooting and military tactics near Laugarvatn. Hansen barely managed to train his 60 officers before the United Kingdom's invasion of Iceland on 10 May 1940. Agnar wanted to expand the forces, but the Icelandic Minister of Justice rejected his proposal.\nIn mid-1941 while still neutral the United States took over the occupation of Iceland from the British but not with Iceland's approval. The stationing of US forces in Iceland continued well after the war, eventually codified in the Agreed Minute. In 1949 Iceland was a founding member of NATO and was the sole member that did not have a standing army, joining NATO on the condition that it would not be expected to establish one. However, its strategic geographic position in the Atlantic made it an invaluable member. Expansion of forces by Iceland was therefore concentrated primarily in the Icelandic Coast Guard, which saw action in a series of confrontations with British fishing vessels and Royal Navy warships known as the Cod Wars. None of the Cod Wars meet any of the common thresholds for a conventional war and they may more accurately be described as militarised interstate disputes.\nThe Iceland Defense Force (IDF) was a military command of the United States Armed Forces from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created at the request of NATO, came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defense of Iceland. The IDF also consisted of civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations. The IDF was downsized after the end of the Cold War and the U.S. Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Naval Air Station Keflavik, until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic Air Policing mission.\nDuring the Icesave dispute with the British and Dutch governments, Iceland made it clear that UK patrols in its airspace were not appropriate given the state of affairs and subsequently on 14 November 2008 the UK had to cancel its patrols and defense of the Icelandic airspace, which before the dispute had been scheduled to start in December 2008.\nAfter withdrawal of US forces in 2006, Iceland reorganized some military infrastructure in the form of the Icelandic Defence Agency (\"Varnarm\u00e1lastofnun \u00cdslands\") founded in 2008. under the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Agency took over operations at Naval Air Station Keflavik, but was closed in 2011 in the wake of the economic crisis, with functions distributed to the existing organizations.\n The Icelandic Coast Guard now handles the military infrastructure in the country.\nCoast Guard.\nShortly after Iceland reclaimed its sovereignty in 1918, the Icelandic Coast Guard was founded. Its first vessel, a former Danish research vessel, was armed with a 57\u00a0mm cannon. The Coast Guard is responsible for protecting Iceland's sovereignty and vital interests including the most valuable natural resource\u2014its fishing areas\u2014as well as providing security, search, and rescue services to Iceland's fishing fleet. In 1952, 1958, 1972, and 1975, the government progressively expanded Iceland's exclusive economic zone to . This led to a conflict with the United Kingdom, among other states, known as the \"Cod Wars\". The Icelandic Coast Guard and the Royal Navy confronted each other on several occasions during these years. Although few rounds were fired, there were many intense moments. Today the Coast Guard remains Iceland's premier fighting force equipped with armed patrol vessels and aircraft and partaking in peacekeeping operations in foreign lands.\nThe Coast Guard has four vessels and four aircraft (one fixed wing and three helicopters) at their disposal.\nIceland Air Defence System.\nThe Iceland Air Defence System or \"\u00cdslenska Loftvarnarkerfi\u00f0\" was founded in 1987, and operates four radar complexes, a software and support facility and a command and report centre. It is a part of the Coast Guard.\nIceland's NATO allies also regularly deploy fighter aircraft to patrol the country's airspace as part of the Icelandic Air Policing mission.\nIcelandic Crisis Response Unit.\nThe Icelandic Crisis Response Unit (ICRU) (or \"\u00cdslenska fri\u00f0arg\u00e6slan\" or \"The Icelandic Peacekeeping Guard\") is an expeditionary peacekeeping force maintained by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It is composed of personnel from Iceland's other services, armed or not, including the National Police, Coast Guard, emergency services and healthcare system. Because of the military nature of most of the ICRU's assignments, all of its members receive basic infantry combat training. This training has often been conducted by the Norwegian Army, but the Coast Guard and the Special Forces are also assigned to train the ICRU.\nMost of the ICRU's camouflage and weaponry is procured from abroad, with some indigenous development. Some arms and uniforms are also borrowed from the Norwegian Defence Forces.\nThe formation and employment of the unit have met controversy in Iceland, especially by people on the left of the political scale. In October 2004, three ICRU personnel were wounded in a suicide bombing on Chicken Street in Kabul that killed a 13-year old Afghan girl and a 23-year old American woman. The incident resulted in severe criticism of the group's commander, Colonel Hallgr\u00edmur Sigur\u00f0sson, as despite orders not to leave Kabul Airport unless absolutely necessary, he took the group to Chicken Street to shop carpets. Few weeks later, his command was passed to Lt. Colonel Gar\u00f0ar Forberg, followed by Colonel L\u00e1rus Atlason.\nIn 2008, the uniformed ICRU deployed personnel still armed for self-defense returned their weapons and changed to civilian clothing. The policy since 2008 is that, unless under special circumstances, ICRU personnel do not wear uniforms or carry weapons.\nICRU missions.\nThe ICRU has been or is operating in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64588", "revid": "7447121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64588", "title": "Foreign relations of Iceland", "text": " \nIceland took control of its foreign affairs in 1918 when it became a sovereign country, the Kingdom of Iceland, in a personal union with the King of Denmark. As a fully independent state, Iceland could have joined the League of Nations in 1920, but chose not to do so for cost reasons. It negotiated with Denmark to initially carry out most of its foreign relations, while maintaining full control. Denmark appointed a diplomatic envoy (Ambassador) to Iceland in 1919 and Iceland reciprocated in 1920, opening an embassy in Copenhagen. Iceland established its own Foreign Service in April 1940 when Denmark became occupied by Nazi Germany and ties between the two countries were severed. The Republic of Iceland was founded in 1944. The Icelandic foreign service grew slowly in the post-WWII period, but increased rapidly after the mid-1990s. Iceland's closest relations are with the Nordic states, the European Union and the United States. Iceland has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. Iceland was a founding member of the World Bank in 1946 and NATO in 1949. In terms of European integration, Iceland was a founding member of the https:// (now OECD) in 1948 and the https:// in 1952, it joined EFTA in 1970, was a founding member of the CSCE (now OSCE) in 1973 and the EEA in 1992 and joined Schengen in 1996.\nFrom 1951 to 2006, there was an American military base and troop presence in Iceland. During the Cold War, Iceland had a close but contentious relationship with the United States, leading some scholars to describe Iceland as a \"rebellious ally\" and \"reluctant ally.\" Iceland repeatedly threatened to leave NATO or cancel the US defence agreement during the Cold War. As a consequence, the United States provided Iceland with extensive economic assistance and diplomatic support. Iceland hosted the historic 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjav\u00edk, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War.\nFishing rights.\nIceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights. Conflict with the United Kingdom led to the so-called Cod Wars in 1952\u201356 because of the extension of the fishing zone from 3 to 4\u00a0nautical miles (6 to 7\u00a0km), 1958\u201361 because of extending the fishing zone to 12\u00a0nautical miles (22\u00a0km) in 1972\u201373 because of its further extension to 50\u00a0nautical miles (93\u00a0km) and in 1975\u201376 because of its extension to 200\u00a0nautical miles (370\u00a0km). Disagreements with Norway and Russia over fishing rights in the Barents Sea were successfully resolved in 2000.\nWhaling.\nCertain environmentalists are concerned that Iceland left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in June 1992 in protest of an IWC decision to refuse to lift the ban on whaling, after the IWC Scientific Committee had determined that the taking of certain species could safely be resumed. That year, Iceland established a separate commission \u2013 along with Norway, Greenland and the Faroe Islands \u2013 for the conservation, management, and study of marine mammals. Since then, Iceland has resumed whaling for scientific purpose and has rejoined the IWC (in October 2002). The Icelandic Fisheries Ministry issued a permit to hunt 39\u00a0whales for commercial purposes on 17 October 2006. 25\u00a0states delivered a formal diplomatic protest to the Icelandic government on 1 November concerning resumed commercial whaling. The protest was led by the United Kingdom and supported by others such as Finland and Sweden.\nRecognition of post-Soviet states.\nIceland was the first country to recognize the regained independence of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan from the USSR in 1990\u20131991. Similarly, it was the first country to recognize Montenegro's independence from its former union with Serbia. Iceland was also the first country to recognize Croatia, having done so on 19 December 1991. Significantly, Iceland was also the first Western state to recognise Palestine when it did so in 2011. Iceland also is the greatest Nordic contributor per capita to NATO-led troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, to the police in Bosnia and to Bosnian/Kosovan reconstruction, resettlement and relief efforts.\nMembership in international organizations.\nIceland is a member of the following organisations: North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; International Criminal Court; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; International Development Association; International Finance Corporation; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; European Economic Area; European Free Trade Association; Council of Europe; International Criminal Police Organization; and the United Nations, since 19 November 1946, and most of its specialized agencies, including the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Labour Organization, International Maritime Organization, International Telecommunication Union, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization and the International Whaling Commission.\nIceland was given the opportunity to join the League of Nations in 1920, but opted not to, primarily due to limited administrative resources. Iceland joined the UN in 1945 but took until 1965 to establish a permanent mission.\nIn the IMF, Iceland is in the Nordic-Baltic constituency of the 24-member executive board of the IMF, along with Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\nInternational disputes.\nRockall.\nIceland has an ongoing dispute with Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands) on the one hand and with the UK and Ireland on the other hand, concerning claims to the continental shelf in the Hatton\u2013Rockall area of the North Atlantic under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982). Iceland's claim covers virtually the entire area claimed by the other three countries, except for a small portion in the south-east corner of the Irish claim, while the Faroes claim most of the area claimed by the UK and Ireland. Negotiations continue between the four countries in the hope of making a joint proposal to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by May 2009.\nDeposit insurance.\nFollowing the collapse of Icesave sparking the 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis, the U.K. and the Netherlands offered to insure the deposits of the bank's customers. They then sought repayment from Iceland, which held a referendum on the issue in 2010 and 2011, both of which failed. The two governments then said they would take the issue to European courts to seek redress they alleged is owed to them. In January 2013 the EFTA court cleared Iceland of all charges.\nEuropean Union application.\nIceland has had a close relationship with the European Union (EU) throughout its development, but has remained outside (instead, joining the European Free Trade Area or EFTA). In 1972, the two sides signed a free trade agreement and in 1994 Iceland joined the European Economic Area which let itself and other non-EU states have access to the EU's internal market in exchange for Iceland contributing funds and applying EU law in relevant areas. The EU is Iceland's most important trading partner with a strong trade surplus in 2008/9 in terms of goods, services and foreign direct investment. Iceland also participates in the Schengen Area (as well as relevant police and judicial cooperation) and has non-voting representation in some EU agencies.\nHowever, after Iceland's financial crash in 2008, it has sought membership of the EU and the euro. Iceland applied on 16 July 2009 and negotiations formally began 17 June 2011. After an agreement is concluded, the accession treaty must be ratified by every EU state and be subject to a national referendum in Iceland. Since the application was submitted, popular support has declined and contentious issues around Icelandic fisheries may derail negotiations. However the Icelandic government is confident an agreement can be reached based on the flexibility shown by the EU in its previous negotiations with Norway.\nIn 2014, Iceland froze their application to join the European Union.\nAgreed Minute.\nThe Agreed Minute was a statute governing the nature of the U.S. military presence in Iceland. The Agreed Minute was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the U.S. Air Force committed itself to maintaining four to six interceptors at the Keflav\u00edk base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshuffles of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of a military presence.\nNATO allies since then conduct air policing after the U.S. Air Force withdrawal.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Iceland maintains diplomatic relations with:\nBilateral relations.\nIceland's first embassy was established in Copenhagen in 1920. The second and third embassies were opened in London and Sweden in 1940. That same year, a consulate-general was installed in New York (a year later, an embassy was opened in Washington D.C.). The Icelandic foreign service grew slowly (both in terms of missions and staff) in the post-WWII period, but increased rapidly after the mid-1990s. The Icelandic foreign service is vastly smaller than those of its Nordic neighbors.\nAfrica.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0No formal diplomatic relations\nAsia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0No formal diplomatic relations\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His daughter is Penelope \"Penny\" Vanderhof, a writer of adventure- and sex-filled melodrama plays. Penny is married to Paul Sycamore, a tinkerer who manufactures fireworks in the basement with the help of his assistant, Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna, who used to be the family's iceman. One of Paul and Penny's two daughters is Essie Sycamore Carmichael, a childlike candy maker who dreams of being a ballerina, even though she is a terrible dancer. Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a xylophone player who lives with the family and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur printer who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and Penny's other daughter Alice Sycamore is quite obviously the only \"normal\" family member. She has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them. In addition, the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan employs a maid, Rheba, who is dating Donald, a handyman who performs odd jobs for the family.\nEssie tells Grandpa Vanderhof that some letters have arrived for him from the \"United States Government\", but that she misplaced them. Shortly afterwards, Alice comes home and announces that she has fallen in love with her co-worker, Tony Kirby, the son of the company's executive. Before going upstairs to change clothes, Alice tells her family that Tony will be coming over shortly to take her on a date. The family members excitedly discuss Alice's new relationship.\nThe doorbell rings. Penny answers the door and greets the man standing there, thinking he must be Tony, but the man clarifies that he is a tax investigator named Wilbur C. Henderson, and he is investigating Grandpa for his evasion of income tax. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, and that the government wouldn't know what to do with the money if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's pet snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear \u2013 one way or another \u2013 from the United States government.\nThe real Tony Kirby arrives, and Alice is nervous that her eccentric family will scare him away. As they attempt to leave, Mr.\u00a0Boris Kolenkhov, Essie's extremely eccentric Russian ballet instructor, arrives and chats with the family, complaining about the Revolution. During this discussion, Alice and Tony make their escape. The rest of the family sit down for dinner.\nLater that night, Tony and Alice return. They are deeply in love, but their intimacy is interrupted by the various members of the Vanderhof-Sycamore family drifting through the house doing their usual things. Tony and Alice become engaged to marry, and, after Tony leaves, Alice, totally happy, admires the new red glow of her father Paul's latest fireworks creation.\nAct Two.\nThe second act takes place several days later. Alice has invited Tony and his father and mother over for dinner the next evening, and it is the only thing on the entire family's mind. Alice runs around the house telling her family to try to act as normal as possible. Penny has brought actress Gay Wellington over to read over Penny's latest play, but Gay becomes very drunk, and passes out onto the living room couch after looking at the snakes.\nEd returns from distributing Essie's candies, worried that he is being followed by someone. When Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna looks out the window, he sees no one other than a man walking away. Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started of him as a discus thrower. Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna leaves to put on his costume.\nAt the same time, Mr.\u00a0Kolenkhov arrives and begins Essie's ballet lesson. Ed provides accompanying music on the xylophone. Rheba runs in and out of the kitchen cleaning. Grandpa takes this time to practice darts and feed the snakes. In the midst of all this hullabaloo, Tony appears in the doorway with Mr.\u00a0Kirby and Mrs.\u00a0Kirby. Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice is incredibly embarrassed.\nPenny tells Alice not to worry, and that they can manage a nice dinner easily. She gives a list of things to Donald and tells him to run down to the store. Grandpa tries desperately to keep the party normal and under control for the sake of his granddaughter. Mr.\u00a0Kirby reveals himself to be a very straitlaced fat-cat, who raises orchids as a hobby. Mr.\u00a0Kirby investigates a child's model and finds it is Paul's \"hobby\". Mrs.\u00a0Kirby tells them that her true passion is spiritualism, which Penny derides as a \"fake\". During a discussion of hobbies, Mr.\u00a0Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was wrestling, and demonstrates on Mr.\u00a0Kirby by throwing him on the floor.\nTo pass the time after this awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a free association game. Alice imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs her off and instructs everyone to write down \"the first thing that pops into their heads\" after she says certain words.\nPenny offers the words \"potato\", \"bathroom\", \"lust\", \"honeymoon\", and \"sex\". Penny reads Mr.\u00a0Kirby's list first, with reactions of, respectively: \"steak\", \"toothpaste\", \"unlawful\", \"trip\", and \"male\". Mrs.\u00a0Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. \"Starch\" is her response to potatoes, which is not that bad, but her response for \"bathroom\" is \"Mr.\u00a0Kirby\", and she covers it up with the fact that Mr.\u00a0Kirby spends a lot of time in there \"bathing and shaving\". Her response to \"lust\" is \"human\", claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr.\u00a0Kirby disagrees, saying \"it is depraved\". \"Honeymoon\"'s reply is \"dull\", as Mrs.\u00a0Kirby explains that there was \"nothing to do at night\". The shocker comes when Mrs.\u00a0Kirby says her reply to \"sex\" was \"Wall Street\". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr.\u00a0Kirby \"You're always talking about Wall Street, even when\u00a0...\" and then stops.\nWholly embarrassed and humiliated, Mr.\u00a0Kirby and Mrs.\u00a0Kirby order Tony home with them immediately but Tony refuses to go. Alice finally decides that their marriage will never work and ends their engagement, and also decides to resign her job at Kirby's company. Before the Kirbys can leave, Department of Justice agents come through the door. The head agent tells them that Ed's pamphlets from the candy boxes, on which he has printed anything that \"sounds nice\", read \"DYNAMITE THE CAPITOL\", \"DYNAMITE THE WHITE HOUSE\", \"DYNAMITE THE SUPREME COURT\", and \"GOD IS THE STATE, THE STATE IS GOD\". Grandpa tries to explain to the head agent, but he informs them they are all under arrest.\nThe agents discover enormous amounts of gunpowder in the basement and think it is for dynamiting Washington, and one agent returns from the basement dragging Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna with him, who was in the basement the whole time. De\u00a0Pinna desperately tries to explain to the agent that he had left his lit pipe downstairs and must go and get it, but the agent disregards him. Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly. At that point, the fireworks in the basement go off, lit by De\u00a0Pinna's untended pipe, and everyone (aside from Grandpa and Wellington) panics, leaving the whole house in an uproar as Act\u00a0II ends.\nAct Three.\nThe next day, Donald and Rheba sit in the kitchen reading the paper, which focuses on the story of both families being arrested, with Mr.\u00a0Kirby's presence causing the story to make headlines. Also, Paul and Mr.\u00a0De\u00a0Pinna's fireworks have been completely destroyed. Meanwhile, Alice has decided to leave for a prolonged trip to the Adirondack Mountains to think things over. When the family forgets to call for a cab, she finally shows her exasperation, angered that her family can't be \"normal\" at all. Tony then arrives and tries to reason with Alice, but she refuses, heading upstairs with Tony following.\nSoon, Mr.\u00a0Kolenkhov appears with the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, in all of her former glory. After discussing the sad fate of former Russian royalty now working menial jobs in New York, the Grand Duchess soon insists upon going into the kitchen to cook the dinner for the family.\nMr. Kirby arrives to pick up Tony and to settle his score with Grandpa. Soon, Mr.\u00a0Kirby and Tony get into a heated argument, the pinnacle of which finds Tony admitting that he had purposely brought his family on the wrong night, the night before. He explains that he wanted each family to see each other as they really were, and that he sees the Sycamores as \"normal\", that they are a family that loves and understands one another, saying that Mr.\u00a0Kirby never had time to understand Tony. Grandpa tells Mr.\u00a0Kirby that he's happy with no longer working and getting to enjoy life every day, and that has made him happy ever since, though Mr.\u00a0Kirby is not convinced, especially as Grandpa suspects that Mr.\u00a0Kirby doesn't like his job. Tony affirms this by pointing out that he found letters that Mr.\u00a0Kirby had written to his father, expressing desires to be a trapeze artist and later a saxophone player, and that Mr.\u00a0Kirby still has a saxophone in his closet. Grandpa tells Mr.\u00a0Kirby that he should get to enjoy his life and riches now while he can, pointing out, \"you can't take it with you\". Tony agrees with this, deciding to leave the family business to do something he wants to do, and Mr.\u00a0Kirby finally gives in, giving his blessings to Alice and Tony getting back together, which they do.\nEssie then brings a letter to Grandpa that's from the government. Grandpa had lied to the government that he was actually Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is corroborated because the family had buried the deceased milkman (who had lived with them prior to De\u00a0Pinna) using Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now owe him a refund, instead of him owing them taxes.\nThe play comes to a conclusion as the family, along with Tony and Mr.\u00a0Kirby, sit down to dinner with the Grand Duchess. Grandpa says a touching prayer, and then they dive into the food.\nProductions.\nThe play premiered at the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia on November 30, 1936. The production transferred to Broadway at the Booth Theatre on December 14, 1936, and ran there until September 3, 1938; it transferred to the Imperial Theatre, running from September 5, 1938, to October 29, 1938, and finally transferred to the Ambassador Theatre from October 31, 1938, to December 3, 1938, for a total of 838 performances. George S. Kaufman was the director.\nThe play was revived on Broadway with a production opening at the \nPlymouth Theatre on April 4, 1983, to December 10, 1983, and transferring to the Royale Theatre from December 13, 1983, to January 1, 1984, for a total of 312 performances. Directed by Ellis Rabb, the cast starred Jason Robards as Martin Vanderhof, Colleen Dewhurst as Olga, James Coco as Boris Kolenkhov and Elizabeth Wilson as Penelope Sycamore.\nA 1985 revival starred Eddie Albert as Grandpa Vanderhof, Eva Gabor as Grand Duchess Olga Katrina and Jack Dodson as Paul Sycamore.\nA two-act version was staged at the Royal Exchange Theatre Manchester from December 2011 to January 2012. It received excellent reviews and played to packed houses throughout.\nA revival opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theater on August 26, 2014 (previews) and on September 28, 2014 (officially). Directed by Scott Ellis, the cast starred James Earl Jones as Martin Vanderhof, Rose Byrne as Alice Sycamore, Elizabeth Ashley as The Grand Duchess Olga, Annaleigh Ashford as Essie Carmichael (a role which earned her a Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Play), Johanna Day as Mrs. Kirby, Julie Halston as Gay Wellington, Byron Jennings as Mr. Kirby, Mark Linn-Baker as Paul Sycamore, Crystal Dickinson as Rheba, Patrick Kerr as Mr. De Pinna, Will Brill as Ed, Marc Damon Johnson as Donald Curry, Reg Rogers as Boris Kolenkhov, Fran Kranz as Tony Kirby, Kristine Nielsen as Penelope Sycamore, Karl Kenzler as Henderson, and the G-Men played by Nick Corley, Austin Durant, and Joe Tapper. Understudies include Corley, Barrett Doss, Durant, Ned Noyes, Pippa Pearthree, Tapper, and Charles Turner.\nFilm, radio and TV adaptations.\nThe play was the basis for the 1938 film directed by Frank Capra. The film cast included James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Dub Taylor, Charles Lane, Mischa Auer, Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson, and the uncredited Arthur Murray. It was awarded the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director of 1938. The film version has the same overall plot and themes as the play but includes new scenes, dialogue, and slightly different characterizations, such as a side plot about Kirby Sr.'s attempt to acquire the Vanderhof house for a real estate development, and removed the side plot of Grand Duchess Olga Katrina.\nTwo short-lived radio series based on the play aired in 1944 and 1951. The 1944 series, with Everett Sloane as Grandpa Vanderhof, ran on the Mutual network from August 27 to November 19 of that year. The 1951 series, with Walter Brennan as Grandpa, ran on the NBC network from May 13 to November 16 of that year.\nCBS produced a notable television adaptation of the original play in 1979. It featured Art Carney as Grandpa, along with Jean Stapleton, Beth Howland, Blythe Danner, Robert Mandan, Harry Morgan, Barry Bostwick, Kenneth Mars, Howard Hesseman and Polly Holliday. A second television adaptation was produced in 1984 by Public Broadcasting Service. This version, featuring Jason Robards as Grandpa, was based on the Broadway revival and filmed at Royale Theatre, New York City and was included in Great Performances (November 21, 1984).\nA syndicated situation comedy based on the play, produced by NBC, ran in the United States during the 1987\u20131988 season. Harry Morgan, who had played Mr. De Pinna in the 1979 telefilm, appeared in the series as Grandpa.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is an interdisciplinary practice that describes systems with interacting components, applicable to biology, cybernetics and other fields. Bertalanffy proposed that the classical laws of thermodynamics might be applied to closed systems, but not necessarily to \"open systems\" such as living things. His mathematical model of an organism's growth over time, published in 1934, is still in use today.\nBertalanffy grew up in Austria and subsequently worked in Vienna, London, Canada, and the United States.\nBiography.\nLudwig von Bertalanffy was born and grew up in the little village of Atzgersdorf (now Liesing) near Vienna. Ludwig's mother Caroline Agnes Vogel was seventeen when she married the thirty-four-year-old Gustav. Ludwig von Bertalanffy grew up as an only child educated at home by private tutors until he was ten and his parents divorced, both remarried outside the Catholic Church in civil ceremonies. When he arrived at his Gymnasium (a form of grammar school) he was already well habituated in learning by reading, and he continued to study on his own. His neighbour, the famous biologist Paul Kammerer, became a mentor and an example to the young Ludwig.\nThe Bertalanffy family had roots in the 16th century nobility of Hungary which included several scholars and court officials. His grandfather Charles Joseph von Bertalanffy (1833\u20131912) had settled in Austria and was a state theatre director in Klagenfurt, Graz and Vienna, which were important sites in imperial Austria. Ludwig's father Gustav von Bertalanffy (1861\u20131919) was a prominent railway administrator. On his mother's side Ludwig's grandfather Joseph Vogel was an imperial counsellor and a wealthy Vienna publisher. \nIn 1918, Bertalanffy started his studies at the university level in philosophy and art history, first at the University of Innsbruck and then at the University of Vienna. Ultimately, Bertalanffy had to make a choice between studying philosophy of science and biology; he chose the latter because, according to him, one could always become a philosopher later, but not a biologist. In 1926 he finished his PhD thesis (\"Fechner und das Problem der Integration h\u00f6herer Ordnung\", translated title: \"Fechner and the Problem of Higher-Order Integration\") on the psychologist and philosopher Gustav Theodor Fechner. For the next six years he concentrated on a project of \"theoretical biology\" which focused on the philosophy of biology. He received his habilitation in 1934 in \"theoretical biology\".\nBertalanffy was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Vienna in 1934. The post yielded little income, and Bertalanffy faced continuing financial difficulties. He applied for promotion to the status of associate professor, but funding from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to make a trip to Chicago in 1937 to work with Nicolas Rashevsky. He was also able to visit the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts.\nBertalanffy was still in the US when he heard of the Anschluss in March 1938. However, his attempts to remain in the US failed, and he returned to Vienna in October of that year. Within a month of his return, he joined the Nazi Party, which facilitated his promotion to professor at the University of Vienna in 1940. During the Second World War, he linked his \"organismic\" philosophy of biology to the dominant Nazi ideology, principally that of the F\u00fchrerprinzip.\nFollowing the defeat of Nazism, Bertalanffy found denazification problematic and left Vienna in 1948. He moved to the University of London (1948\u201349); the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1949); the University of Ottawa (1950\u201354); the University of Southern California (1955\u201358); the Menninger Foundation (1958\u201360); the University of Alberta (1961\u201368); and the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) (1969\u201372).\nIn 1972, he died from a heart attack.\nFamily life.\nBertalanffy met his wife, Maria, in April 1924 in the Austrian Alps. They were hardly ever apart for the next forty-eight years. She wanted to finish studying but never did, instead devoting her life to Bertalanffy's career. Later, in Canada, she would work both for him and with him in his career, and after his death she compiled two of Bertalanffy's last works. They had a son, Felix D. Bertalanffy (1926-1999), who was a professor at the University of Manitoba and followed in his father's footsteps by making his profession in the field of cancer research.\nWork.\nToday, Bertalanffy is considered to be a founder and one of the principal authors of the interdisciplinary school of thought known as general systems theory, which was pioneered by Alexander Bogdanov. According to Weckowicz (1989), he \"occupies an important position in the intellectual history of the twentieth century. His contributions went beyond biology, and extended into cybernetics, education, history, philosophy, psychiatry, psychology and sociology. Some of his admirers even believe that this theory will one day provide a conceptual framework for all these disciplines\".\nIndividual growth model.\nThe individual growth model published by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in 1934 is widely used in biological models and exists in a number of permutations.\nIn its simplest version the so-called Bertalanffy growth equation is expressed as a differential equation of length (\"L\") over time (\"t\"):\nformula_1\nwhen formula_2 is the Bertalanffy growth rate and formula_3 the ultimate length of the individual. This model was proposed earlier by August Friedrich Robert P\u016btter (1879-1929), writing in 1920.\nThe dynamic energy budget theory provides a mechanistic explanation of this model in the case of isomorphs that experience a constant food availability. The inverse of the Bertalanffy growth rate appears to depend linearly on the ultimate length, when different food levels are compared. The intercept relates to the maintenance costs, the slope to the rate at which reserve is mobilized for use by metabolism. The ultimate length equals the maximum length at high food availabilities.\nBertalanffy equation.\nThe Bertalanffy equation describes the growth of a biological organism. It was presented by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in 1969.\nformula_4\nHere W is organism weight, t is the time, S is the area of organism surface, and V is a physical volume of the organism.\nThe coefficients formula_5 and formula_6 are (by Bertalanffy's definition) the \"coefficient of anabolism\" and \"coefficient of catabolism\" respectively.\nThe solution of the Bertalanffy equation is the function:\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 and formula_9 are constants.\nBertalanffy couldn't explain the meaning of the parameters formula_10 (the coefficient of anabolism) and formula_6 (coefficient of catabolism) in his works, which prompted criticism from biologists. However, the Bertalanffy equation is a special case of the Tetearing equation, that is a more general equation of the growth of a biological organism. The Tetearing equation does provide a physical meaning of the coefficients formula_10 and formula_6.\nBertalanffy module.\nTo honour Bertalanffy, ecological systems engineer and scientist Howard T. Odum named the storage symbol of his General Systems Language as the Bertalanffy module (see image right).\nGeneral system theory.\nIn the late 1920s, the Soviet philosopher Alexander Bogdanov pioneered \"Tektology\", whom Johann Plenge referred to as the theory of \"general systems\". However, in the West, Bertalanffy is widely recognized for the development of a theory known as general system theory (GST). The theory attempted to provide alternatives to conventional models of organization. GST defined new foundations and developments as a generalized theory of systems with applications to numerous areas of study, emphasizing holism over reductionism, organism over mechanism.\nFoundational to GST are the inter-relationships between elements which all together form the whole.\nSystems thinking.\nSystems thinking, a transformative paradigm, owes its genesis to the profound intellect of theoretical biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, whose pioneering collaboration with computer scientist Jay Forrester and other luminaries laid its foundational bedrock. This revolutionary framework, born from their collective genius, flourished in the 1990s with the publication of Peter Senge\u2019s enduring masterpiece, The Fifth Discipline, which illuminated its principles for a global audience.\nPublications.\nThe first \"articles\" from Bertalanffy on general systems theory:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64598", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64598", "title": "Alan Bush", "text": "British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist (1900\u20131995)\nAlan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 \u2013 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works.\nFrom a prosperous middle-class background, Bush enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s and spent much of the decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin from 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain, which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s and was heavily involved with workers' choirs, for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to the BBC temporarily banning his music in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany.\nIn his prewar works, Bush's style was influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. He began to simplify his style during and after the war, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the masses. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West, he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and later vice-president of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain. His contribution to musical life began to be recognised towards the end of his life, in the form of doctorates from two universities and numerous tribute concerts. Since his death in 1995, aged 94, his musical legacy has been nurtured by the Alan Bush Music Trust, established in 1997.\nLife and career.\nFamily background and early life.\nBush was born in Dulwich, South London, on 22\u00a0December 1900, the third and youngest son of Alfred Walter Bush and Alice Maud, n\u00e9e Brinsley. The Bushes were a prosperous middle-class family, their wealth deriving from the firm of industrial chemists founded by the composer's great-grandfather, W. J. Bush. As a child Alan's health was delicate, and he was initially educated at home. When he was eleven he began at Highgate School as a day pupil, and remained there until 1918. Both of his elder brothers served as officers in the First World War; one of them, Alfred junior, was killed on the Western Front in 1917. The other, Hamilton Brinsley Bush, went into the family business and ran twice as Liberal candidate for Watford in the 1950s. The end of the war in November 1918 meant that Alan narrowly avoided being called up for military service; meantime, having determined on a musical career, he had applied to and been accepted by the RAM, where he began his studies in the spring of 1918.\nRoyal Academy and after.\nAt the RAM, Bush studied composition under Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. He made rapid progress, and won various scholarships and awards, including the Thalberg Scholarship, the Phillimore piano prize, and a Carnegie award for composition. He produced the first compositions of his formal canon: Three Pieces for Two Pianos, Op.\u00a01, and Piano Sonata in B minor, Op.\u00a02, and also made his first attempt to write opera \u2013 a scene from Bulwer Lytton's novel \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", with a libretto by his brother Brinsley. The work, with Bush at the piano, received a single private performance with family members and friends forming the cast. The manuscript was later destroyed by Bush.\nAmong Bush's fellow students was Michael Head. The two became friends, as a result of which Bush met Head's 14-year-old sister Nancy. In 1931, ten years after their first meeting, Bush and Nancy would marry and begin a lifelong artistic partnership in which she became Bush's principal librettist, as well as providing the texts for many of his other vocal works. \nIn 1922 Bush graduated from the RAM, but continued to study composition privately under John Ireland, with whom he formed an enduring friendship. In 1925 Bush was appointed to a teaching post at the RAM, as a professor of harmony and composition, under terms that gave him scope to continue with his studies and to travel. He took further piano study from two pupils of Theodor Leschetizky, Benno Moiseiwitsch and Mabel Lander, from whom he learned the Leschetizky method. In 1926 he made his first of numerous visits to Berlin, where with the violinist Florence Lockwood he gave two concerts of contemporary, mainly British, music which included his own \"Phantasy\" in C minor, Op.\u00a03. The skill of the performers was admired by the critics more than the quality of the music. In 1928 Bush returned to Berlin, to perform with the Brosa Quartet at the Bechstein Hall, in a concert of his own music which included the premieres of the chamber work \"Five Pieces\", Op.\u00a06 and the piano solo \"Relinquishment\", Op.\u00a011. Critical opinion was broadly favourable, the \"Berliner Zeitung am Mittag\" correspondent noting \"nothing extravagant but much of promise\".\nAmong the works composed by Bush during this period were the Quartet for piano, violin, viola and cello, Op.\u00a05; Prelude and Fugue for piano, Op.\u00a09; settings of poems by Walter de\u00a0la\u00a0Mare, Harold Monro and W.\u00a0B.\u00a0Yeats; and his first venture into orchestral music, the Symphonic Impressions of 1926\u200d\u2013\u200d27, Op.\u00a08. In early 1929 he completed one of his best-known early chamber works, the string quartet \"Dialectic\", Op.\u00a015, which helped to establish Bush's reputation abroad when it was performed at a Prague festival in the 1930s.\nMusic and politics.\nBush had begun to develop an interest in politics during the war years. In 1924, rejecting his parents' conservatism, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). The following year he joined the London Labour Choral Union (LLCU), a group of largely London-based choirs that had been organised by the socialist composer Rutland Boughton, with Labour Party support, to \"develop the musical instincts of the people and to render service to the Labour movement\". Bush was soon appointed as Boughton's assistant, and two years later, he succeeded Boughton as the LLCU's chief musical adviser, remaining in this post until the body disbanded in 1940. \nThrough his LLCU work, Bush met Michael Tippett, five years his junior, who shared Bush's left-wing political perspective. In his memoirs Tippett records his first impressions of Bush: \"I learned much from him. His music at the time seemed so adventurous and vigorous\". Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp writes: \"Apart from Sibelius, the contemporary composer who taught Tippett as much as anyone else was his own contemporary Alan Bush\".\nAfter his 1928 concert tour in Berlin, Bush returned to the city to study piano under Artur Schnabel. He left the ILP in 1929, and joined the Labour Party proper, before taking extended leave from the RAM to begin a two-year course in philosophy and musicology at Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelm University. Here, his tutors included Max Dessoir and Friedrich Blume. Bush's years in Berlin profoundly affected his political beliefs, and had direct influence on the subsequent character of his music. Michael Jones, writing in \"British Music\" after Bush's death, records Bush's concern at the rise of fascism and antisemitism in Germany. His association with like-minded musicians such as Hanns Eisler and Ernst Hermann Meyer, and writers such as Bertold Brecht, helped to develop his growing political awareness into a lifelong commitment to Marxism and communism. Bush's conversion to full-blown communism was not immediate, but in 1935 he finally abandoned Labour and joined the British Communist Party.\nNotwithstanding the uncompromising nature of his politics, Bush in his writings tended to express his views in restrained terms, \"much more like a reforming patrician Whig than a proletarian revolutionary\" according to Michael Oliver in a 1995 \"Gramophone\" article. Bush's Grove Music Online biographers also observe that in the politicisation of his music, his folk idioms have more in common with the English traditions of Ralph Vaughan Williams than with the continental radicalism of Kurt Weill.\n1930s: emergent composer.\nIn March 1931 Bush and Nancy were married in London, before returning to Germany where Bush continued his studies. In April a BBC broadcast performance of his Dance Overture for Military Band, Op.\u00a012a, received a mixed reception. Nancy Bush quotes two listeners' comments that appeared in the \"Radio Times\" on 8\u00a0May 1931. One thought that \"such a medley of fearful discords could never be called music\", while another opined that \"[we] should not cry for more Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven if modern composers would all give us sheer beauty like this\". \nAt the end of summer 1931 the couple returned permanently to England, and settled in the village of Radlett, in Hertfordshire. In the following years three daughters were born. Bush resumed his RAM and LLCU duties, and in 1932 accepted a new appointment, as an examiner for the Associated Board of London's Royal Schools of Music, a post which involved extensive overseas travel. These new domestic and professional responsibilities limited Bush's composing activity, but he provided the music for the 1934 Pageant of Labour, organised for the London Trades Council and held at the Crystal Palace during October. Tippett, who co-conducted the event, later described it as a \"high water mark\" in Bush's drive to provide workers' choirs with settings for left-wing texts. In 1936 Bush was one of the founders of the Workers' Musical Association (WMA), and became its first chairman.\nIn 1935 Bush began work on a piano concerto which, completed in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by Randall Swingler. Bush played the piano part when the work was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Adrian Boult on 4\u00a0March 1938. The largely left-wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically; Tippett observed that \"to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem\". A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 \"Festival of Music for the People\", drew caustic comments from Neville Cardus in the \"Manchester Guardian\". Cardus saw little direction and no humour in the music: \"Why don't these people laugh at themselves now and then? Just for fun.\"\nBush provided much of the music, and also acted as general director, for the London Co-operative Societies' pageant \"Towards Tomorrow\", held at Wembley Stadium on 2\u00a0July 1938. In the autumn of that year he visited both the Soviet Union and the United States. Back home in early 1939 he was closely involved in founding and conducting the London String Orchestra, which operated successfully until 1941 and again in the immediate postwar years. He also began to write a major orchestral work, his Symphony No. 1 in C. Amid this busy life Bush was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music.\nSecond World War.\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Bush registered for military service under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act of 1939. He was not called up immediately, and continued his musical life, helping to form the WMA Singers to replace the now-defunct LLCU, and founding the William Morris Music Society. In April 1940 he conducted a Queen's Hall concert of music by Soviet composers which included the British premieres of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, and Khatchaturian's Piano Concerto. William Glock in \"The Observer\" was disdainful, dismissing the Khatachurian concerto as \"sixth-rate\", and criticising the inordinate length, as he saw it, of the symphony.\nBush was among many musicians, artists and writers who in January 1941 signed up to the communist-led People's Convention, which promoted a six-point radical anti-war programme that included friendship with the Soviet Union and \"a people's peace\". The BBC advised him that because of his association with this movement, he and his music would no longer be broadcast. This action drew strong protests from, among others, E.\u00a0M.\u00a0Forster and Ralph Vaughan Williams. The ban was opposed by the prime minister, Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons, and proved short-lived; it was annulled following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.\nIn November 1941 Bush was conscripted into the army, and after initial training was assigned to the Royal Army Medical Corps. Based in London, he was given leave to perform in concerts, which enabled him to conduct the premiere of his First Symphony at a BBC Promenade Concert in the Royal Albert Hall on 24\u00a0July 1942. He also performed regularly with the London String Orchestra, and in 1944 was the piano soloist in the British premiere of Shostakovich's Piano Quintet. His wartime compositions were few; among them were the \"Festal Day\" Overture, Op.\u00a023, written for Vaughan Williams's 70th birthday in 1942, and several songs and choruses including \"Freedom on the March\", written for a British-Soviet Unity Demonstration at the Albert Hall on 27\u00a0June 1943.\nBush's relatively calm war was marred by the death, in 1944, of his seven-year-old daughter Alice in a road accident. As the war in Europe drew to its end, Bush was posted to the Far East despite being well over the normal age limit for overseas service. The matter was raised in Parliament by the Independent Labour member D.\u00a0N.\u00a0Pritt, who enquired whether political factors were behind the decision. The posting was withdrawn; and Bush remained in London until his discharge in December 1945.\nPost-war: struggle for recognition and performance.\nPersona non grata.\nBush's return to composing after the war led to what Richard Stoker, in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", calls \"his best period\". However, Bush's attempts to secure a place in the concert repertoire were frustrated. A contributory factor may have been what the critic Dominic Daula calls Bush's \"intriguingly unique compositional voice\" that challenged critics and audiences alike. But the composer's refusal to modify his pro-Soviet stance following the onset of the Cold War alienated both the public and the music establishment, a factor which Bush acknowledged 20 years later: \"People who were in a position to promote my works were afraid to do so. They were afraid of being labelled\". Stoker comments that \"in a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer\". Nancy Bush writes that the BBC considered him \"persona non grata\", and imposed an almost complete though unofficial broadcast ban that lasted for some 15 years after the war.\nAs well as resuming his teaching routines, Bush embarked on a busy schedule of travel, mainly in Eastern Europe with the WMA choir. While in Czechoslovakia in August 1947, he and the WMA performed his unaccompanied chorus \"Lidice\" at the site of the village of that name, which had been destroyed by the Nazis in 1942 in a reprisal for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.\nAmong Bush's earliest postwar works was the \"English Suite\", performed by the revived London String Orchestra at the Wigmore Hall on 9\u00a0February 1946. The orchestra had suspended its operations in 1941; after the war, Bush's failure to secure funding for it led to its closure, despite considerable artistic success. Critics noted in the work a change of idiom, away from the European avant-garde character of much of his prewar music and towards a simpler popular style. This change was acknowledged by Bush as he responded to the 1948 decree issued by Stalin's director of cultural policy, Andrei Zhdanov, against formalism and dissonance in modern music \u2013 although the process of simplification had probably begun during the war years.\nIn 1948 Bush accepted a commission from the Nottingham Co-operative Society to write a symphony as part of the city's quincentennial celebrations in 1949. According to Foreman, \"by any standards this is one of Bush's most approachable scores\", yet since its Nottingham premiere on 27\u00a0June 1949 and its London debut on 11\u00a0December 1952 under Boult and the London Philharmonic, the work has been rarely heard in Britain. His Violin Concerto, Op.\u00a032, received its premiere on 25\u00a0August 1949, with Max Rostal as soloist. In this work Bush explained that \"the soloist represents the individual, the orchestra world society, and the work [represents] the individual's struggles and of his final absorption into society\". \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s critic observed that \"it was the orchestra, i.e. society, that after a strenuous opening gave up the struggle\".\nIn 1947 Bush became chairman of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain for 1947\u201348. He also produced a full-length textbook, \"Strict Counterpoint in the Palestrina Style\" (Joseph Williams, London, 1948). On 15\u00a0December 1950 the WMA marked Bush's 50th birthday with a special concert of his music at the Conway Hall in London.\nOpera ventures.\nSince his youthful \"Last Days of Pompeii\", Bush had not attempted to write opera, but he took up the genre in 1946 with a short operetta for children, \"The Press Gang (or the Escap'd Apprentice)\", for which Nancy supplied the libretto. This was performed by pupils at St Christopher School, Letchworth, on 7\u00a0March 1947. The following year he began a more ambitious venture, a full-length grand opera recounting the story of Wat Tyler, who led the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. \"Wat Tyler\", again to Nancy's libretto, was submitted in 1950 to the Arts Council's Festival of Britain opera competition, and was one of four prizewinners \u2013 Bush received \u00a3400. The opera was not taken up by any of the British opera houses, and was first staged at Leipzig Opera at september 8th in 1953. It was well received, retained for the season and ran again in the following year; there was a further performance in Rostock in 1955. \"Wat Tyler\" did not receive its full British premiere until 19\u00a0June 1974, when it was produced at Sadler's Wells; as of 2017, this remains the only professional staging of a Bush opera in Britain.\nBush's second opera, \"Men of Blackmoor\", composed in 1954\u201355 to Nancy's libretto, is a story of Northumbrian miners in the early 19th century; Bush went down a mine as part of his research. It received its premiere at the German National Theatre, Weimar on 18\u00a0November 1956. Like \"Wat Tyler\" in Leipzig, the opera was successful; after the Weimar season there were further East German productions in Jena (1957), Leipzig (1959) and Zwickau (1960). In Britain there were student performances at Oxford in 1960, and Bristol in 1974. In December 1960 David Drew in the \"New Statesman\" wrote: \"The chief virtue of \"Men of Blackmoor\", and the reason why it particularly deserves a [professional] performance at this historical point, is its unfailing honesty ... it is never cheap, and at its best achieves a genuine dignity.\"\nFor his third opera, Bush chose a contemporary theme \u2013 the struggle against colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from British Guiana, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry. The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record a great deal of authentic music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was \"The Sugar Reapers\", premiered at Leipzig on 11\u00a0December 1966. \"The Times\" correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: \"One can only hope that London will soon see a production of its own\". With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: \"The Spell Unbound\" (1953) and \"The Ferryman's Daughter\" (1961). His final opera, written in 1965\u201367, was \"Joe Hill\", based on the life story of Joe Hill, an American union activist and songwriter who was controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915. The opera, to a libretto by Barrie Stavis, was premiered at the German Berlin State Opera on 29\u00a0September 1970, and in 1979 was broadcast by the BBC.\n1953\u20131975.\nDuring his involvement with opera, Bush continued to compose in other genres. His 1953 cantata \"Voice of the Prophets\", Op.\u00a041, was commissioned by the tenor Peter Pears and sung by Pears at its premiere on 22\u00a0May 1953. In 1959\u201360 he produced two major orchestral works: the \"Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue\", Op.\u00a052, and the Third Symphony, Op.\u00a053, known as the \"Byron\" since it depicts musically scenes from the life of the poet. The symphony, a commission from East German Radio, was first performed at Leipzig on 20\u00a0March 1962. Colin Mason, writing in \"The Guardian\", thought the work had a stronger socialist programme than the Nottingham symphony of 1949. The ending of the second movement, a long tune representing Byron's speech against the extension of the death penalty was, Mason wrote, \"a splendid piece\". The symphony was awarded that year's H\u00e4ndel Prize in the city of Halle.\nAt the end of the 1960s Bush wrote, among other works, \"Time Remembered\", Op.\u00a067, for chamber orchestra, and \"Scherzo for Wind Orchestra and Percussion\", Op.\u00a068, based on an original Guyanese theme. In 1969 he produced the first of three song cycles, \"The Freight of Harvest\", Op.\u00a069 \u2013 \"Life's Span\" and \"Woman's Life\" would follow in 1974 and 1977. In the 1970s, while maintaining his teaching commitment to the RAM, he continued to perform in the concert hall as conductor and pianist. Bush was slowly being recognised for his achievements, even by those who had long cold-shouldered him. In 1968 he was awarded a Doctor of Music degree by the University of London, and two years later received an honorary doctorate from the University of Durham. On 6\u00a0December 1970, just before Bush's 70th birthday, BBC Television broadcast a programme about his life and works, and on 16\u00a0February 1971 the RAM hosted a special (late) birthday concert, in which he and Pears performed songs from \"Voices of the Prophets\". Bush featured in a further television programme, broadcast on 25\u00a0October 1975, in a series entitled \"Born in 1900\".\nFinal years.\nIn old age, Bush continued to lead an active and productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations of his life and works. In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the \"Twenty-four Preludes\", Op.\u00a084, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30\u00a0October 1977. A later reviewer described this piece as \"music I'd like to have playing beside me as I sprawled on the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon\".\nIn 1978 Bush retired from the RAM after 52 years' service. His 80th birthday in December 1980 was celebrated at concerts in London, Birmingham and East Germany, and the BBC broadcast a special birthday musical tribute. In the same year he published \"In My Eighth Decade and Other Essays\", in which he stated his personal creed that \"as a musician and as a man, Marxism is a guide to action\", enabling him to express through music the \"struggle to create a condition of social organisation in which science and art will be the possession of all\". In 1982 Bush visited the Lascaux caves in south-western France, and was inspired by the prehistoric cave paintings to write his fourth and final symphony, Op.\u00a094, subtitled the \"Lascaux\". This, his last major orchestral work, was premiered by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, under Edward Downes in Manchester, on 25\u00a0March 1986.\nIn the late 1980s Bush was increasingly hampered by failing eyesight. His last formal compositions appeared in 1988: \"Spring Woodland and Summer Garden\" for solo piano, Op.\u00a0124, and \"Summer Valley\" for cello and piano, Op.\u00a0125, although he continued to compose privately and play the piano. Nancy's health meanwhile deteriorated, and she died on 12\u00a0October 1991. Bush lived on quietly at Radlett for another four years, able to recall the events of his youth but with no memory of the last fifty years and unaware of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He died in Watford General hospital on 31\u00a0October 1995, after a short illness, at the age of 94.\nMusic.\nGeneral character.\nDespite undergoing various changes of emphasis, Bush's music retained a voice distinct from that of any of his contemporaries. One critic describes the typical Bush sound as \"Mild dominant discords, of consonant effect, used with great originality in uncommon progressions alive with swift, purposeful harmonic movement ... except in [Benjamin] Britten they are nowhere used with more telling expression, colour and sense of movement than in Bush\".\nJohn Ireland, Bush's early mentor, instilled \"the sophisticated and restrained craftsmanship which marked Bush's music from the beginning\", introducing him to folksong and Palestrina, both important building blocks in the development of Bush's mature style. Daula comments that \"Bush's music does not [merely] imitate the sound-world of his Renaissance predecessors\", but creates his unique fingerprint by \"[juxtaposing] 16th century modal counterpoint with late- and post-romantic harmony\".\nBush's music, at least from the mid-1930s, often carried political overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush \"put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat at the head of the composer's responsibilities\", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, \"when the inspiration comes over him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'.\"\nTo 1945.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBush's First Symphony:\n\"In this Symphony, the composer's intention is to evoke the feelings of the men and women of Britain during the 1930s. There is no programme of events depicted; the three main movements are more in the nature of mood pictures, each an expression of the prevailing mental and emotional atmosphere of the social movement of the time.\"\nBush, Alan: \"Programme notes for first performance\" 24 July 1942.\nAccording to Duncan Hall's account of the music culture of the Labour Movement in the inter-war years, Bush's youthful music, composed before his Berlin sojourn, already demonstrated its essential character. His \"Dialectic for String Quartet\" (1929), Op.\u00a015, created a strong impression when first heard in 1935, as \"a musical discourse of driving intensity and virile incident\". Christiansen highlights its \"tightness and austerity\" in contrast to the more fashionable lyricism then prevalent in English music.\nBush's years in Berlin brought into his music the advanced Central European idioms that characterise his major orchestral compositions of the period: the Piano Concerto (1935\u201337), and the First Symphony (1939\u201340). Nancy Bush describes the Piano Concerto as Bush's first attempt to fuse his musical and political ideas. The symphony was even more overtly political, representing in its three movements greed (of the bourgeoisie), frustration (of the proletariat) and the final liberation of the latter, but not, according to Christiansen, \"in an idiom calculated to appeal to the masses\".\nAside from these large-scale works, much of Bush's compositional activity in the 1930s was devoted to pageants, songs and choruses written for his choirs, work undertaken with the utmost seriousness. In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that \"socialists must sing what we mean and sing it like we mean it\". Under Bush's influence the \"music of the workers\" moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, Arthur Bourchier's mid-1920s pamphlet \"Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism\", towards an expression with broader popular appeal.\nPostwar and beyond.\nAlthough Bush accepted Zhdanov's 1948 diktat without demur and acted accordingly, his postwar simplifications had begun earlier and would continue as part of a gradual process. Bush first outlined the basis of his new method of composition in an article, \"The Crisis of Modern Music\", which appeared in WMA's \"Keynote\" magazine in spring 1946. The method, in which every note has thematic significance, has drawn comparison by critics with Schoenberg's twelve-note system, although Bush rejected this equation.\nMany of Bush's best-known works were written in the immediate postwar years. Anthony Payne described the \"Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio\" (Op.\u00a031) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, \"a high-water mark in Bush's mature art\". The Violin Concerto (Op.\u00a032, 1948) has been cited as \"a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's\". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences. The \"Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue\" for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op.\u00a052, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts. \"Musical Opinion\"'s critic praised the composer's \"wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship\" in this piece, and predicted that it could become the most popular of all Bush's orchestral works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"All [Bush's] operas deal with things that actually happened, the message being contained in a judicious selection of fact, the music aimed at the heart before brain.\"\nChristopher Ford: \"Burning Bush\" (1974)\nThe postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, \"Wat Tyler\", was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in \"The Guardian\" thought the ending degenerated into \"a choral union cantata\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \"local\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of \"Men of Blackmoor\", Guyanese songs and dances in \"The Sugar Reapers\", and American folk music in \"Joe Hill\" \u2013 the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.\nThe extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.\nAssessment.\nIn the 1920s it appeared that Bush might emerge as Britain's foremost pianist, after his studies under the leading teachers of the day, but he turned to composition as his principal musical activity. In Foreman's summary he is \"a major figure who really straddles the century as almost no other composer does\". He remained a pianist of consequence, with a strong and reliable, if heavy, touch.\nJoanna Bullivant, writing in \"Music and Letters\", maintains that in his music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, Bush came close to Paul Hindemith's ideal: \"one for whom music is felt as a moral and social force, and only incidentally as a means of personal expression\". The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he \"attempt[ed] to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future\". Hall describes Bush as \"a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics.\"\nThe music critic Colin Mason described Bush's music thus:His range is wide, the quality of his music consistently excellent. He has the intellectual concentration of Tippett, the easy command and expansiveness of Walton, the nervous intensity of Rawsthorne, the serene leisureliness of Rubbra ... He is surpassed only in melody, as are the others, by Walton, but not even by him in harmonic richness, nor by Tippett in contrapuntal originality and the expressive power of rather austere musical thought, nor by Rawsthorne in concise, compelling utterance and telling invention, nor by Rubbra in handling large forms well.\nLegacy.\nBush's long career as a teacher influenced generations of English composers and performers. Tippett was never a formal pupil, but he acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. Herbert Murrill, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, wrote in 1950 of his tutor: \"[T]here is humility in his makeup, and I believe that no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him\". Among postwar Bush students are the composers Timothy Bowers, Edward Gregson, David Gow, Roger Steptoe, E.\u00a0Florence Whitlock, and Michael Nyman, and the pianists John Bingham and Graham Johnson. Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as Norbert Brainin and Emanuel Hurwitz, both of whom later achieved international recognition.\nBush's music was under-represented in the concert repertoire in his lifetime, and virtually disappeared after his death. The 2000 centenary of his birth was markedly low key; the Prom season ignored him, although there was a memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 1\u00a0November, and a BBC broadcast of the Piano Concerto on 19\u00a0December. The centenary, albeit quietly observed, helped to introduce the name and music of Bush to a new generation of music lovers, and generated an increase in both performance and recordings. The centenary also heralded an awakening of scholarly interest in Bush, whose life and works were the subject of numerous PhD theses in the early 20th century. Scholars such as Paul Harper-Scott and Joanna Bullivant have obtained access to new material, including documents released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Bush's MI5 file. This, says Bullivant, enables a more informed assessment of the interrelationships within Bush's music and his communism, and of the inherent conflicting priorities.\nIn October 1997 family members and friends founded The Alan Bush Music Trust \"to promote the education and appreciation by the public in and of music and, in particular, the works of the British composer Alan Bush\". The trust provides a newsletter, features news stories, promotes performances and recordings of Bush's works, and through its website reproduces wide-ranging critical and biographical material.\nIt continues to monitor concert performances of Bush's works, and other Bush-related events, at home and abroad.\nAt the time of Bush's centenary, Martin Anderson, writing in the British Music Information Centre's newsletter, summarised Bush's compositional career:\nBush was not a natural melodist \u00e0 la Dvor\u00e1k, though he could produce an appealing tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It would be foolish to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece \u2013 and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.\nRecordings.\nBefore Bush's centenary year, 2000, the few available recordings of his music included none of the major works. In the 21st century much has been added, including recordings of Symphonies 1, 2 and 4, the Piano and Violin Concertos, many of the main vocal works, the Twenty-Four Preludes, and the complete organ works.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64599", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64599", "title": "Soil salinity", "text": "Salt content in the soil\nSoil salinity is the salt content in the soil; the process of increasing the salt content is known as salinization (also called salination in American English). Salts occur naturally within soils and water. Salinization can be caused by natural processes such as mineral weathering or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as irrigation and road salt.\nNatural occurrence.\nSalts are a natural component in soils and water.\nThe ions responsible for salinization are: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl\u2212.\nOver long periods of time, as soil minerals weather and release salts, these salts are flushed or leached out of the soil by drainage water in areas with sufficient precipitation. In addition to mineral weathering, salts are also deposited via dust and precipitation. Salts may accumulate in dry regions, leading to naturally saline soils. This is the case, for example, in large parts of Australia. \nHuman practices can increase the salinity of soils by the addition of salts in irrigation water. Proper irrigation management can prevent salt accumulation by providing adequate drainage water to leach added salts from the soil. Disrupting drainage patterns that provide leaching can also result in salt accumulations. An example of this occurred in Egypt in 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was built. The change in the level of ground water before the construction had enabled soil erosion, which led to high concentration of salts in the water table. After the construction, the continuous high level of the water table led to the salinization of arable land.\nSodic soils.\nWhen the Na+ (sodium) predominates, soils can become sodic. The pH of sodic soils may be acidic, neutral, or alkaline. \nSodic soils present particular challenges because they tend to have very poor structure which limits or prevents water infiltration and drainage. They tend to accumulate certain elements like boron and molybdenum in the root zone at levels that may be toxic for plants. The most common compound used for reclamation of sodic soil is gypsum, and some plants that are tolerant to salt and ion toxicity may present strategies for improvement.\nThe term \"sodic soil\" is sometimes used imprecisely in scholarship. It's been used interchangeably with the term alkali soil, which is used in two meanings: 1) a soil with a pH greater than 8.2, 2) soil with an exchangeable sodium content above 15% of exchange capacity. The term \"alkali soil\" is often, but not always, used for soils that meet both of these characteristics.\nDry land salinity.\nSalinity in drylands can occur when the water table is between two and three metres from the surface of the soil. The salts from the groundwater are raised by capillary action to the surface of the soil. This occurs when groundwater is saline (which is true in many areas), and is favored by land use practices allowing more rainwater to enter the aquifer than it could accommodate. For example, the clearing of trees for agriculture is a major reason for dryland salinity in some areas, since deep rooting of trees has been replaced by shallow rooting of annual crops.\nSalinity due to irrigation.\nSalinity from irrigation can occur over time wherever irrigation occurs, since almost all water (even natural rainfall) contains some dissolved salts. When the plants use the water, the salts are left behind in the soil and eventually begin to accumulate. This water in excess of plant needs is called the leaching fraction. Salinization from irrigation water is also greatly increased by poor drainage and use of saline water for irrigating agricultural crops.\nSalinity in urban areas often results from the combination of irrigation and groundwater processes. Irrigation is also now common in cities (gardens and recreation areas).\nConsequences of soil salinity.\nThe consequences of salinity are\nSalinity is an important land degradation problem. Soil salinity can be reduced by leaching soluble salts out of soil with excess irrigation water. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. A comprehensive treatment of soil salinity is available from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\nSalt tolerance of crops.\nHigh levels of soil salinity can be tolerated if salt-tolerant plants are grown. Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity-resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils. The University of Wyoming and the Government of Alberta report data on the salt tolerance of plants.\nField data in irrigated lands, under farmers' conditions, are scarce, especially in developing countries. However, some on-farm surveys have been made in Egypt, India, and Pakistan. Some examples are shown in the following gallery, with crops arranged from sensitive to very tolerant.\nCalcium has been found to have a positive effect in combating salinity in soils. It has been shown to ameliorate the negative effects that salinity has such as reduced water usage of plants.\nSoil salinity activates genes associated with stress conditions for plants. These genes initiate the production of plant stress enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase. Limiting this process can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration.\nRegions affected.\nFrom the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World the following salinised areas can be derived.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This led him into conflict with both Christian and Jewish institutions: his books were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum and several Jewish authorities excommunicated him. His iconoclastic life culminated in suicide in c. 1640.\nLife.\nHis short autobiography contains many details about his life, but over the past two centuries, documents uncovered in Portugal, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and elsewhere have added much to the picture.\nDa Costa was born Gabriel Fiuza da Costa in Porto. His ancestors were \"Crist\u00e3os-novos\" (New Christians)\u2014Jews forcibly converted to Catholicism by state edict in 1497. His father, Bento da Costa, was a well-off international merchant and tax-farmer. His mother, Branca, \"seems to have been a Judaizer\" (i.e., a false convert to Christianity), according to Nadler.\nStudying Catholic canon law at the University of Coimbra intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the Hebrew Bible and contemplate it seriously. Da Costa also held a benefice, an ecclesiastical office, in the Catholic Church. In his autobiography, da Costa depicted his family as devout Catholics. However, they had been subject to several investigations by the Portuguese Inquisition, suggesting they were \"Conversos\", more or less observing Jewish customs. Da Costa explicitly supported adherence to Mosaic law.\nAfter his father died, the da Costa family fell into financial difficulty due to unpaid debts. In 1614, they escaped their predicament by leaving Portugal with a significant sum previously collected as tax farmers for . The family branched off, settling among two major Sephardic diaspora communities. Newly circumcised and with new Jewish names, two brothers migrated to Amsterdam, while two others went with their mother to Hamburg. Da Costa was among the Hamburg group, going by Uriel among his Jewish neighbours and using the alias Adam Romez for outside relations, presumably because he was wanted in Portugal. All resumed their international trade business. Upon arriving in Hamburg, da Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the rabbinic leadership was obsessed with ritualism and legal posturing. At this time, he composed his earliest known written work, \"Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Propositions against the Tradition). In eleven short theses he called into question the disparity between Jewish customs and a literal reading of the Torah, and more generally tried to prove from reason and scripture that this system of law is sufficient.\nIn 1616, the text was dispatched to the leaders of the prominent Jewish community in Venice. The Venetian rabbinic council ruled against it, prompting the Hamburg community to sanction da Costa with a \"herem\", or excommunication. The \"Propositions\" are extant only as quotes and paraphrases in \"Shield and Buckler\" (), a lengthy rebuttal by Leon of Modena, written in response to religious queries about da Costa posed by the Hamburg Jewish authorities.\nDa Costa's early work thus resulted in official excommunication in Venice and Hamburg; it is not known what effect this had on his life. He barely mentioned it in his autobiography and continued his international business. In 1623, he moved to Amsterdam for unknown reasons. The leaders of the Amsterdam Sephardic community, troubled by the arrival of a known heretic, staged a hearing and sanctioned the excommunication previously set in place against da Costa.\nAt about the same time (in Hamburg or Amsterdam), da Costa was working on a second treatise. Three chapters of this unpublished manuscript were stolen and formed the target for a traditionalist rebuttal published by Semuel da Silva of Hamburg. Da Costa enlarged his book further, with the printed version containing responses to da Silva and revisions to the crux of his argument.\nIn 1623, da Costa published this book under the title of (Examination of Pharisaic Traditions) in Portuguese. The complete printed book was discovered in 1990 at the Danish Royal Library by H. P. Salomon; previously, only three chapters had been known. The work runs to over 200 pages and is divided into two parts. In the first part, da Costa develops his earlier \"Propositions\", considering Modena's responses and corrections. In the second part, he adds novel views that the Hebrew Bible, especially the Torah, does not support the idea of immortality of the soul. Da Costa believed that this was not an idea deeply rooted in biblical Judaism but rather had been formulated primarily by the Pharisees and was a late addition to the Jewish principles of faith. The work also pointed to supposed discrepancies between biblical Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism. He declared the latter an accumulation of mechanical ceremonies and ritual practices. He believed it was thoroughly devoid of spiritual and philosophical concepts. Da Costa was relatively early in arguing before a Jewish readership in favour of the mortality of the soul, and in appealing exclusively to direct reading of the bible. He cites neither rabbinic authorities nor philosophers of the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.\nThe book sparked a controversy among Jews in Amsterdam, whose leaders reported to the (Christian) city authorities that this was an attack on Christianity as well as on Judaism. The work was burned publicly, and da Costa was fined a significant sum. By 1627, da Costa was a denizen of Utrecht, though the Amsterdam community still had an acrimonious relationship with him. For example, they asked a Venetian rabbi, Yaakov Ha-Levi, whether da Costa's elderly mother was eligible for a burial plot in the Jewish cemetery. The following year, da Costa's mother died, and he went back to Amsterdam. Ultimately, the loneliness was too much for him to handle. Around 1633, he accepted the terms of reconciliation with the Jewish authorities, which he does not detail in his autobiography. He was thus reaccepted into the Jewish community.\nShortly after, da Costa was tried again; he encountered two Christians who expressed to him their desire to convert to Judaism; he dissuaded them from doing so. Based on this and earlier accusations regarding \"kashrut\" violations, he was excommunicated again. As he describes it, for seven years, he lived in virtual isolation, shunned by his family and embroiled in civil-financial disputes with them. In search of legal help, he returned to being \"an ape amongst the apes\"; he would follow established Jewish traditions and practices but with little real conviction. Seeking reconciliation, he first suffered punishment for his heretical views: he was publicly given 39 lashes at the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam, then forced to lie on the floor while the congregation trampled over him. This ordeal left him both demoralized and thirsty for revenge against the man (a cousin or nephew) who initiated his trial seven years previously and marked the final dramatic point of his autobiography.\nIn a document entitled \"Exemplar Humanae Vitae\" (Example of a Human Life), da Costa tells the story of his life, intellectual development, and experiences as a victim of intolerance. Transmitted to print in Latin some decades after his death and only a few pages long, it also expresses rationalistic and sceptical views, including doubts about whether biblical law was divinely sanctioned or whether Moses simply wrote it down. Da Costa suggests that all religion is a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. He further sketches an idealized religion to be based only on natural law, as God has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife.\nSuicide.\nTwo reports agree that da Costa committed suicide in Amsterdam in 1640: Johannes M\u00fcller, a Protestant theologian of Hamburg gives the time as April, and Amsterdam Remonstrant preacher Philipp van Limborch adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself. Seeing his relative approach one day, he grabbed a pistol and pulled the trigger, but it misfired. Then he reached for another, turned it on himself, and fired, dying a reportedly terrible death.\nInfluence.\n In his lifetime, \"Examination\" inspired not only da Silva's answer, but also Menasseh ben Israel's more lasting \"De Resurrectione Mortuorum\" (1636) directed against the \"Sadducees\", and a listing in the Index of Prohibited Books.\nAfter his death, da Costa's name became synonymous with the \"Exemplar Humanae Vitae\". M\u00fcller publicized da Costa's excommunication, to make an anachronistic point that some Sephardic Jews of his days were Sadducees. Johann Helwig Willemer made the same point, and implied that this extreme heresy leads to suicide. Pierre Bayle reported the contents of the \"Exemplar\" quite fully, to demonstrate among other things that questioning religion without turning to revelation would bring one to miserable faithlessness.\nThe later Enlightenment saw da Costa's rational religion more tolerantly. Herder eulogized him as a crusader of authentic belief. Voltaire noted that he left Judaism for philosophy. Reimarus embraced da Costa's appeal to have legal status based on the Seven Laws of Noah, when he made an analogous argument that Christian states should be at least as tolerant toward modern Deists as ancient Israelites had been.\nInternally to Judaism, da Costa has been regarded variously as a heretic or as a martyr against the intolerance of the Rabbinic establishment. He has also been seen as a precursor to Baruch Spinoza and to modern biblical criticism. Da Costa had a connection to the Spinoza family through Baruch's mother, Hanna, with both families coming from Porto, in northern Portugal, and might have known each other there. The Spinozas would have known of da Costa in the Jewish community of Amsterdam, of his troubles with the authorities, and his suicide. There is a 1901 imagined portrait of da Costa and the young Spinoza, but a Spinoza biographer, Steven Nadler describes the painting as \"overwrought\" and its depiction of Spinoza being instructed by da Costa as \"pure fantasy.\" Spinoza was just eight years old when da Costa committed suicide, and he might not have known then about his family's connection to him. However, as an adolescent, he likely learned the details of the public and family scandal.\nDa Costa is also indicative of the difficulties faced by many New Christians seeking to return to their ancestral Jewish roots upon arriving in an organized Jewish community. As a Crypto-Jew in Iberia, he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the Oral Law. As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional Pharisee and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the Sadducees and the Karaites, respectively.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Western European tradition, the title of duke ranked among the highest nobility, generally just below the monarch and above counts or earls.\nHistorically, there was a significant distinction between sovereign dukes, who ruled independent states, and dukes who were simply noblemen within larger kingdoms. Some duchies functioned as sovereign states in regions that only later became unified nation\u2011states, such as Germany (once the Holy Roman Empire, a federal empire) and Italy (later a unified kingdom). By contrast, other duchies were subordinate territories within kingdoms that had already consolidated, either partially or fully, during the medieval era: examples include France, Spain, Sicily, Naples, and the Papal States.\nExamples.\nIn France, several duchies existed in the medieval period, including Normandy, Burgundy, Brittany, and Aquitaine.\nThe medieval German stem duchies (, literally \"tribal duchy,\" the official title of its ruler being \"Herzog\" or \"duke\") were associated with the Frankish Kingdom and corresponded with the areas of settlement of the major Germanic tribes. They formed the nuclei of the major feudal states that comprised the early era of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation (961\u20131806; in German: \"Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation\"). These were \"Schwaben\" (Swabia, mainly the present-day German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg), \"Bayern\" (Bavaria), and \"Sachsen\" (Saxony) in pre-Carolingian times, to which \"Franken\" (Franconia, at present the northern part of the German state of Bavaria) and \"Lothringen\" (Lorraine, nowadays mostly part of France) were added in post-Carolingian times. As mentioned above, such a duke was styled \"Herzog\" (literally \"the one who is leading [the troops]\").\nIn medieval England, duchies associated with the territories of Lancashire and Cornwall were created, with certain powers and estates of land accruing to their dukes. The Duchy of Lancaster was created in 1351 but became merged with the Crown when, in 1399, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, ascended the throne of England as Henry IV. Nowadays, the Duchy of Lancaster always belongs to the sovereign and its revenue is the Privy Purse. The Duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 and held successively by the Dukes of Cornwall, who were also heirs to the throne. Nowadays, the Duchy of Cornwall belongs to the sovereign's heir apparent, if there is one: it reverts to the Crown in the absence of an heir apparent and is automatically conferred to the heir apparent upon birth. These duchies today have mostly lost any non-ceremonial political role, but generate their holders' private income. During the Wars of the Roses, the Duke of York made a successful entry into the City of York, by merely claiming no harm and that it was his right to possess \"his duchy of York.\" Any feudal duchies that made up the patchwork of England have since been absorbed into the Royal Family. Other than Cornwall and Lancaster, British royal dukedoms are titular and do not include landholdings. Non-royal dukedoms are associated with ducal property, but this is meant as the duke's private property, with no other feudal privileges attached. At present, all independent (i.e., sovereign) duchies have disappeared.\nList of duchies.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nThe following duchies were part of the medieval Kingdom of Italy, which itself was part of the Holy Roman Empire:\nSweden.\nAll provinces of Sweden have the right to have a ducal coronet in their arms. The king gives princes and princesses ducal titles \"of\" them. The current such royal duchies are:"}

The title is used in some current and former independent monarchies in Europe, particularly:\nWestern and Central European.\nThe term \"grand duke\" as a monarch reigning over an independent state was a later invention (in Western Europe at first in 1569 for the ruler of Tuscany) to denote either a particularly mighty duke or a monarchy playing an important political, military and/or economic role. It arose because the title of duke had gradually lost status and precedence during the Middle Ages by having been granted to rulers of relatively small fiefs (feudal territories), instead of the large tribal regions or even national territories to which the title was once attached.\nOne of the first examples occurred when Count Gon\u00e7alo I Mendes of Portucale (in northwest Portugal and considered as that country's original nucleus) took, in 987, the personal title of (\"Grand Duke of the Portuguese\") and rebelled against his feudal lord, King Bermudo II of Le\u00f3n. He was defeated by the royal armies but nevertheless obtained a remarkable autonomy as a (Grand Duke), leading ultimately to Portuguese independence from the Spanish kingdom of Castille-Le\u00f3n.\nAnother example was the line of self-proclaimed grand dukes (legally dukes) of Burgundy in the 15th century, when they ruled most of present-day northeastern France as well as almost the entire Low Countries. They tried\u2014ultimately without success\u2014to create from these territories under their control a new unified country between the Kingdom of France in the west and the Holy Roman Empire (mainly present-day Germany) in the east. Philip III, Duke of Burgundy (reigned 1419\u201367) assumed the subsidiary, legally void style and title of \"Grand Duke of the West\" in 1435, having previously brought the duchies of Brabant and Limburg as well as the counties of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland, Hainaut and Namur into his possession. His son and successor Charles the Bold (reigned 1467\u201377) continued to use the same style and title.\nThe title or grand duke (, in Lithuanian) has been used by the rulers of Lithuania, who after Jogaila also became kings of Poland. From 1573, both the Latin version and its Polish equivalent (literally \"grand prince\"), the monarchic title of the rulers of Lithuania as well as of (western) Russia, Prussia, Mazovia, Samogithia, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlachia, Livonia, Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov (including hollow claims nurtured by ambition), were used as part of their full official monarchic titles by the Kings () of Poland during the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe first monarchs ever officially titled grand duke were the Medici sovereigns of Tuscany, starting from the late 16th century. This official title was granted by Pope Pius V in 1569 to Cosimo I de' Medici.\nNapoleon I awarded the title extensively: during his era, several of his allies (and \"de facto\" vassals) were allowed to assume the title of grand duke, usually at the same time as their inherited fiefs (or fiefs granted by Napoleon) were enlarged by annexed territories previously belonging to enemies defeated on the battlefield. After Napoleon's downfall, the victorious powers who met at the Congress of Vienna, which dealt with the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, agreed to abolish the Grand Duchies created by Bonaparte and to create a group of monarchies of intermediate importance with that title. Thus the 19th century saw a new group of monarchs titled grand duke in central Europe, especially in present-day Germany. The title was also used for the part of Poland granted to Prussia \u2013 the Grand Duchy of Posen \u2013 which was formally held in a personal union with Prussia (and so nominally separate) until its incorporation in 1848.\nIn the same century, the purely ceremonial version of the title grand duke in Russia (in fact the western translation of the Russian title \"grand prince\" granted to the siblings of the tsar) expanded massively because of the large number of progeny of the ruling House of Romanov during those decades.\nIn the German and Dutch languages, which have separate words for a prince as the issue (child) of a monarch (respectively , ) and for a sovereign prince (, ), there is also a clear linguistic difference between a sovereign grand duke reigning over a state of central and western Europe (, ) and a non-sovereign, purely ceremonial grand duke of either the Russian imperial family or other non-sovereign territories that are \"de facto\" dependencies of a major power (, ).\nIn 1582, King John III of Sweden added \"Grand Duke of Finland\" to the subsidiary titles of the Swedish kings, but without any political consequences, as Finland was already a part of the Swedish realm.\nAfter the Russian conquests, the title continued to be used by the Russian emperors in their role as rulers of both (\"de facto\" non-sovereign) Lithuania (1793\u20131917) and the (equally non-sovereign) autonomous Finland (1809\u20131917). The Habsburg monarchy also instituted the similarly non-sovereign (Grand Principality of Transylvania) in 1765, and the (purely nominal) (Grand Duchy of Krak\u00f3w) in 1846.\nBalkans.\nByzantine grand dukes.\nThe Latin title \"dux\" (the etymological root of duke), which was phonetically rendered \"doux\" (\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03be) in Greek, was a common title for imperial generals in the Late Roman Empires (west and east), but note it was \"lower\" in rank than \"comes\" (the etymological root of count).\nUnder the latter, exclusively Byzantine theme system, the commander of a theme was often styled a \"doux\" instead of the earlier \"strategos\" from the 10th century on. The title of \"Grand Duke\" (\"megas doux\") was created by Alexios I Komnenos and was conferred upon the commanding admiral of the Byzantine navy. As such, it was an actual office rather than a court rank (although it also became a grade in the court order of precedence under the Palaiologan emperors), and was always held by one individual.\nBosnian grand dukes.\nGrand Duke of Bosnia (; ) was a court title in the Kingdom of Bosnia, bestowed by the king to highest military commanders, usually reserved for most influential and most capable among highest Bosnian nobility. To interpret it as an office post rather than a court rank could be even more accurate. Unlike usage in Western Europe, Central Europe, or in various Slavic lands from Central to North-East Europe, where analogy between \"grand duke\" and \"grand prince\" was significant, with both titles corresponding to sovereign lower than king but higher than duke. In Bosnia, the title \"grand duke\" corresponded more to the Byzantine military title megas doux. It is possible to register some similarities with equivalent titles in neighboring Slavic lands, such as Serbia; however, in neighboring countries, the title \"duke\", in Slavic \"vojvoda\", also had military significance, but in that sense \"grand duke\" was specifically, even exclusively, Bosnian title.\nEastern European.\nRuthenian/Ukrainian grand dukes.\n\"Grand duke\" is the traditional translation of the title \"Velyky Knyaz\" (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c), which from the 11th century was at first the title of the leading prince (\"Kniaz\") of Kievan Rus', then of several other East Slavic princes. The title of Grand Duke of Kiev was usually given by a father to his eldest son, and with his death passed to the next oldest sibling. This system didn\u2019t last very long, and in 12th century multiple northern princes of the Rurikid Dynasty could compete for their dominance in Kiev. Some of them would prefer to establish themselves as grand dukes independently from Kiev.\nAnother translation of this title would be \"grand prince.\" While this term is a more precise translation, it is neither standard nor widely used in English. In German, however, grand duke was known as a \"Gro\u00dff\u00fcrst,\" and in Latin as \"magnus princeps\".\nWith the decline of Kiev under the Mongols in the 13th century, Danylo of Galicia would be crowned as king of Ruthenia to show succession between Kiev and Galicia, while keeping the title of Grand Duke of Kiev. With the expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into Ukrainian lands, Lithuanian princes would take the title of Grand Dukes of Ruthenia, until their unification with Poland.\nLithuanian grand dukes.\nThroughout the history of Lithuania from 1230s to 1795, most of its leaders were referred to as Grand Duke of Lithuania, even when they jointly held the title King of Poland and other titles.\nRussian grand dukes.\nFrom 1328 the \"Velikii Kniaz\" of Muscovy appeared as the grand duke for \"all of Russia\" until Ivan IV of Russia in 1547 was crowned as tsar. Thereafter the title was given to sons and grandsons (through male lines) of the Tsars and Emperors of Russia. The daughters and paternal granddaughters of Russian emperors, as well as the consorts of Russian grand dukes, were generally called \"grand duchesses\" in English.\nFrom 1809 to 1917 the Emperor of Russia was also the Grand Duke of Finland, which he held as an autonomous state. Before the Russian conquest Finland had been held by the Kings of Sweden, first as a royal duchy, since 1581 with the King assuming the secondary title Grand Duke of Finland (Finnish: \"Suomen suuriruhtinas\", Swedish: \"Storfurste av Finland\").\nGrand prince.\nGrand princes (or sometimes \"great princes\") were medieval monarchs who usually ruled over several tribes and/or were feudal overlords of other princes. At the time, the title was usually translated as \"king\", sometimes also as \"minor king\" or \"little king\" ().\nGrand princes reigned in Central and Eastern Europe, notably among Slavs and Lithuanians.\nThe title \"grand prince\" translates to () in Ukrainian and Russian. The Slavic word \"knjaz\" and the Lithuanian (today translated as \"priest\") are cognates of the word \"king\" in its original meaning of \"ruler\". Thus, the literal meaning of and \"Didysis kunigaik\u0161tis\" was more like \"great ruler\" than \"grand duke\".\nWith the growing importance and size of their countries, those monarchs claimed a higher title, such as king or tsar (also spelled \"czar\" in English) which was derived from the Latin \"caesar\" (\"emperor\") and based on the claim to be the legitimate successors of the Byzantine-East Roman Emperors. Grand Prince Ivan IV of Muscovy was the last monarch to reign without claiming any higher title, until he finally assumed the style Tsar of Russia in 1547.\nThe rulers of the Turkish vassal state of Transylvania () used the title of grand prince; this title was later assumed by the Habsburgs after their conquest of Hungary. The Polish kings of the Swedish House of Vasa also used the grand-princely title for their non-Polish territories.\nIn the late Middle Ages, the title \"grand prince/grand duke\" became increasingly a purely ceremonial courtesy title for close relatives of ruling monarchs, such as the Tsar of Russia, who granted his brothers the title Grand Duke of Russia ().\nStyles and forms of address.\nMost often, a sovereign grand duke was styled as \"Royal Highness\" (abbreviated \"HRH\"), possibly because of the connection of many grand-ducal houses to royal ones or as the highest style beneath that of a king (sometimes styled \"Royal Highness\"). The heir to the throne (a hereditary grand duke) was sometimes styled as \"Royal Highness\", otherwise as \"Grand Ducal Highness\" (HGDH). Junior members of the family also generally bore the lower title of prince or princess with the style of \"Grand Ducal Highness\". However, in other grand duchies (e.g., Oldenburg), junior members of the family bore the title of duke or duchess, with the style of \"Highness\" (HH).\nThe Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg styles all its members as \"Royal Highness\" since 1919, due to their being also cadet members of the Royal and Ducal House of Bourbon-Parma as male-line descendants of Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma.\nThe Habsburg grand dukes of Tuscany, being members of the imperial family of Austria, were styled as \"Imperial and Royal Highness\" (HI&amp;RH).\nGrand dukes and grand duchesses from Russia were styled as \"Imperial Highness\" (HIH), being members of the Russian Imperial Family.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The following tunes are also on that best-seller list: \"In the Mood\", \"Pennsylvania 6-5000\" (printed as \"Pennsylvania Six-Five Thousand\" on record labels), \"A String of Pearls\", \"Moonlight Cocktail\", \"At Last\", \"(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\", \"American Patrol\", \"Tuxedo Junction\", \"Elmer's Tune\", \"Little Brown Jug\", and \"Anvil Chorus\".\nIncluding \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\", five songs played by Miller and His Orchestra were number-one hits for most of 1942 and are on the list of \"Billboard\" number-one singles of 1942. In four years, Miller scored 16 number-one records and 69 top-10 hits, more than Elvis Presley (40) or the Beatles (35). His musical legacy includes multiple recordings in the Grammy Hall of Fame. His work has been performed by swing bands, jazz bands, and big bands worldwide for over 75 years.\nMiller is considered the father of the modern US military bands. In 1942, he volunteered to join the US military. He entertained troops during World War II, and ended up in the US Army Air Forces. Their workload was just as heavy as the civilian band's had been. With a full string section added to a big band, the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra was the forerunner of many US military big bands.\nMiller went missing in action (MIA) on December 15, 1944, on a flight over the English Channel from England to France. In keeping with standard operating procedure for the US military services, he was officially declared dead a year and a day later. An Army investigation led to an official finding of death (FOD) for Miller, Norman Baessell, and John Morgan, all of whom died on the same flight. All three officers are listed on the Tablets of the Missing at Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial in Cambridge, England. Since his body was not recoverable, Miller was allowed to have a memorial headstone placed at the US Army-operated Arlington National Cemetery. In February 1945, he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal.\nEarly life and career.\nThe son of Mattie Lou (n\u00e9e Cavender) Miller and Lewis Elmer Miller, Alton Glen Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. He added a second \"n\" to \"Glen\" during high school. Like his father (Lewis Elmer) and his siblings (Elmer Deane, John Herbert and Emma Irene), Miller went by his middle name. As Dennis Spragg of the Glenn Miller Archives confirms, \"Miller's use of his first name, Alton, was necessary for legal and military purposes, which is logically why it shows up in formal documents such as his military documents, driver\u2019s licenses, tax returns, etc.\" He is listed as Alton G. Miller in the Army Air Forces section of the Tablets of the Missing in Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial in Cambridge, England. His name is engraved as Major Alton Glenn Miller, US Army (Air Corps) on his Government-issued (G.I.) memorial headstone in Memorial Section H at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. His last military unit has a memorial tree in section 13 on Wilson Drive. The American Holly was dedicated on December 15, 1994, the 50th anniversary of Miller's death, for the veterans of the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra.\nHe attended grade school in North Platte in western Nebraska. In 1915, his family moved to Grant City, Missouri. Around this time, he had made enough money from milking cows to buy his first trombone and played in the town orchestra. He played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916.\nIn 1918, Miller and his family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where he went to Fort Morgan High School. In the fall of 1919, he joined the F.M.H.S. Maroons, the high school football team that won the Northern Colorado American Football Conference in 1920. He was named Best Left End in Colorado in 1921. For two years, Miller was one of the editors of his own high school yearbook, \"Memories\". In each of the yearbooks he edited, his name was spelled both Glen with one n, and Glenn with a double \"n\".\nDuring his senior year of high school, he became so interested in dance band music that he formed a band with some classmates. The high school orchestra was an after school activity, but he played there too. For a time, classes in harmony, piano, violin, and music appreciation were full, but classes were discontinued. However, by the time he graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician. He missed his own graduation because he was performing out of town. His mother gladly received his diploma for him.\nIn 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he joined Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent most of his time away from school, attending auditions and playing any gigs he could get, including with Boyd Senter's band in Denver. After failing three out of five classes, he dropped out of school to pursue a career in music. He failed Harmony.\nIn New York City, he studied the Schillinger system with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed \"Miller's Tune\". Miller arranged that tune for big band and renamed it. It became his signature theme, \"Moonlight Serenade\".\nIn 1926, Miller toured with several groups, landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. He also played for Victor Young, which allowed him to be mentored by other professional musicians. In the beginning, he was the main trombone soloist of the band, but when Jack Teagarden joined Pollack's band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. He realized that his future was in arranging and composing.\nHe had a songbook published in Chicago in 1928 entitled \"125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone\" by the Melrose Brothers. During his time with Pollack, he wrote several arrangements. He wrote his first composition, \"Room 1411\", with Benny Goodman, and Brunswick Records released it as a 78 rpm record under the name \"Benny Goodman's Boys\".\nIn 1928, when the band arrived in New York City, he sent for and married his college sweetheart, Helen Burger. He was a member of Red Nichols' orchestra (Red Nichols and his Five Pennies) in 1930, and because of Nichols, he played in the pit bands of two Broadway shows, \"Strike Up the Band\" and \"Girl Crazy\". That band included Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa.\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, Miller worked as a freelance trombonist in several bands. On a March 21, 1928, Victor Records session, he played alongside Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nat Shilkret. He arranged and played trombone on several significant Dorsey brothers sessions for OKeh Records, including \"The Spell of the Blues\", \"Let's Do It\", and \"My Kinda Love\", all with Bing Crosby on vocals. On November 14, 1929, vocalist Red McKenzie hired Miller to play on two records: \"Hello, Lola\" and \"If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight\". Beside Miller were saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, guitarist Eddie Condon, and drummer Gene Krupa.\nIn the early to mid-1930s, Miller worked as a trombonist, arranger, and composer for the Dorsey Brothers, first, when they were a Brunswick studio group and later, when they formed an ill-fated orchestra. Miller composed the songs \"Annie's Cousin Fanny\", \"Dese Dem Dose\", \"Harlem Chapel Chimes\", and \"Tomorrow's Another Day\" for the Dorsey Brothers Band in 1934 and 1935.\nIn 1935, he assembled an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble, developing the arrangement of lead clarinet over four saxophones that became a characteristic of his big band. Members of the Noble band included Claude Thornhill, Bud Freeman, and Charlie Spivak.\nMiller made his first movie appearance in \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\" as a member of the Ray Noble Orchestra performing \"Why Stars Come Out at Night\". The film included performances by Dorothy Dandridge and the Nicholas Brothers, who would appear with Miller again in two movies for Twentieth Century Fox in 1941 and 1942.\nIn 1937, Miller compiled several arrangements and formed his first band. After failing to distinguish itself from the many bands of the time, it broke up after its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut on January 2, 1938.\nBenny Goodman said in 1976:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In late 1937, before his band became popular, we were both playing in Dallas. Glenn was pretty dejected and came to see me. He asked, \"What do you do? How do you make it?\" I said, \"I don't know, Glenn. You just stay with it.\"\nSuccess from 1938 to 1942.\nDiscouraged, Miller returned to New York. He realized that he needed to develop a unique sound and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonized within a single octave. George T. Simon discovered a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz. Miller hired Schwartz but had him play lead clarinet instead of the saxophone. According to Simon, \"Willie's tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound.\" With this new sound combination, Miller found a way to differentiate his band's style from that of many bands that existed in the late 1930s.\nMiller talked about his style in the May 1939 issue of \"Metronome\" magazine. \"You'll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal ... We're fortunate in that our style doesn't limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings, or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing the clarinet most of the time, lets you know whose band you're listening to. And that's about all there is to it.\"\nBluebird Records and Glen Island Casino.\nIn September 1938, the Miller band began recording for Bluebird, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. Cy Shribman, an East Coast businessman, financed the band. In the spring of 1939, the band's fortunes improved with a date at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and more dramatically at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. According to author Gunther Schuller, the Glen Island performance attracted \"a record-breaking opening-night crowd of 1800...\"\nThe band's popularity grew. In 1939, \"Time\" magazine noted: \"Of the 12 to 24 discs in each of today's 300,000 U.S. jukeboxes, from two to six are usually Glenn Miller's.\" In 1940, the band's version of \"Tuxedo Junction\" sold 115,000 copies in the first week. Miller's success in 1939 culminated with an appearance at Carnegie Hall on October 6, with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, and Fred Waring also on the schedule.\nFrom December 1939 to September 1942, Miller's band performed three times a week during a quarter-hour broadcast for Chesterfield cigarettes on CBS radio\u2014for the first 13 weeks with the Andrews Sisters and then on its own.\nOn February 10, 1942, RCA Victor presented Miller with the first gold record for \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\". The Miller orchestra performed \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" with his singers Gordon \"Tex\" Beneke, Paula Kelly and the Modernaires. Other singers with this orchestra included Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle and (to a smaller extent) Kay Starr, Ernie Caceres, Dorothy Claire and Jack Lathrop. Pat Friday dubbed for Lynn Bari by singing her part in the Glenn Miller Orchestra in their two films, \"Sun Valley Serenade\" and \"Orchestra Wives\", with Lynn Bari lip-synching.\nMotion pictures.\nMiller and his band appeared in two Twentieth Century Fox films. In 1941's \"Sun Valley Serenade\" they were major members of the cast, which also featured comedian Milton Berle, and Dorothy Dandridge with the Nicholas Brothers in the show-stopping song-and-dance number, \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\". The Miller band returned to Hollywood to film 1942's \"Orchestra Wives\", featuring Jackie Gleason playing a part as the group's bassist. Though contracted to do a third movie for Fox, \"Blind Date\", Miller entered the US Army and this film was never made.\nReaction.\nFrom critics.\nIn 2004, Miller orchestra bassist Trigger Alpert explained the band's success: \"Miller had America's music pulse... He knew what would please the listeners.\" Although Miller was popular, many jazz critics had misgivings. They believed that the band's endless rehearsals\u2014and, according to critic Amy Lee in \"Metronome\" magazine, \"letter-perfect playing\"\u2014removed feeling from their performances. They also felt that Miller's brand of swing shifted popular music from the hot jazz of Benny Goodman and Count Basie to commercial novelty instrumentals and vocal numbers. After Miller died, the Miller estate maintained an unfriendly stance toward critics who derided the band during his lifetime.\nMiller was often criticized for being too commercial. His answer was, \"I don't want a jazz band.\" Many modern jazz critics harbor similar antipathy. In 1997, on a website administered by \"JazzTimes\" magazine, Doug Ramsey considers him overrated. \"Miller discovered a popular formula from which he allowed little departure. A disproportionate ratio of nostalgia to substance keeps his music alive.\"\nJazz critics Gunther Schuller (1991) and Gary Giddins (2004) have defended Miller from criticism. In an article written for \"The New Yorker\" magazine in 2004, Giddins said these critics erred in denigrating Miller's music, and that the popular opinion of the time should hold greater sway. \"Miller exuded little warmth on or off the bandstand, but once the band struck up its theme, audiences were done for: throats clutched, eyes softened. Can any other record match 'Moonlight Serenade' for its ability to induce a Pavlovian slaver in so many for so long?\" Schuller notes, \"[The Miller sound] was nevertheless very special and able to penetrate our collective awareness that few other sounds have...\" He compares it to \"Japanese Gagaku [and] Hindu music\" in its purity. Schuller and Giddins do not take completely uncritical approaches to Miller. Schuller says that Ray Eberle's \"lumpy, sexless vocalizing dragged down many an otherwise passable performance.\" But Schuller notes, \"How much further [Miller's] musical and financial ambitions might have carried him must forever remain conjectural. That it would have been significant, whatever form(s) it might have taken, is not unlikely.\"\nFrom musical peers.\nLouis Armstrong thought enough of Miller to carry around his recordings, transferred to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour. \"[Armstrong] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky.\" Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: \"with Shearing's locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller's saxophone section) in the middle [of the quintet's harmonies]\".\nFrank Sinatra and Mel Torm\u00e9 held the orchestra in high regard. Torm\u00e9 credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and songwriting career in the 1940s. Torm\u00e9 met Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Torm\u00e9's father and Ben Pollack. Torm\u00e9 and Miller discussed \"That Old Black Magic\", which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Torm\u00e9 to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because \"all good lyric writers are great readers.\" In an interview with George T. Simon in 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late '40s, in comparison with \"those great Glenn Miller things\" from eight years earlier. Frank Sinatra's recording sessions from the late 1940s and early 1950s use some Miller musicians. Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Orchestra and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band back up Sinatra on many recordings.\nIt was a surprise that clarinetist Buddy DeFranco took on the job of leading the Glenn Miller Orchestra in the late 1960s and early 1970s. De Franco was already a veteran of bands like Gene Krupa and Tommy Dorsey in the 1940s. He was also a major exponent of modern jazz in the 1950s. He never saw Miller as leading a swinging jazz band, but DeFranco is extremely fond of certain aspects of the Glenn Miller style. \"I found that when I opened with 'Moonlight Serenade', I could see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by.\" De Franco says, \"the beauty of Glenn Miller's ballads ... caused people to dance together.\"\nMajor Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra: 1942\u20131946.\nAt the peak of his civilian career in 1942, Miller decided to join the armed forces, which meant forsaking a weekly income of about US$ () from his civilian band, Glenn Miller and his Orchestra. At 38, married and needing corrective eyeglasses, Miller was classified 3-A for the draft and unlikely to be called to service.\nHe first applied for a commission in the US Navy but was turned down. At the time, the Navy was dealing with a scandal concerning celebrity commissions in exchange for draft avoidance. This had nothing to do with Miller, but it prevented the Navy from acting on his application.\nMiller then applied to the US Army with whom he had privately explored the possibility of enlisting. During a March 1942 visit to Washington, Miller had met with officials of the Army Bureau of Public Relations and Army Air Forces. On August 12, 1942, Miller sent a three-page letter to General Charles Young of the Army Service Forces, outlining his interest in \"streamlining modern military music\" and to express his \"sincere desire to do a real job for the Army that is not actuated by any personal draft problem.\" General Young forwarded Miller's letter to Gen. Brehon Somervell, commander of Army Service Forces who approved Miller's application. The Army notified Miller of his commission on September 8, 1942. He received a one-month delay to settle his business affairs.\nMiller made his final commercial broadcast for Chesterfield Cigarettes on September 24, 1942.] At the end of the program, he introduced competitor Harry James as his successor on the series, a gesture that a grateful James never forgot. On September 26, Miller made his final civilian broadcast on the Blue Network Coca Cola Victory parade of Spotlight Bands. Glenn Miller and his Orchestra gave their final performance at Central Theater in Passaic, New Jersey on September 27, 1942.\nOn October 7, 1942, Miller reported to the Seventh Service Command at Omaha as a captain in the Army Specialist Corps. Following a one-month ASC training course at Fort Meade, Maryland, he transferred to the Army Air Forces (AAF) on November 25, 1942, by order of General Henry H. Arnold. Miller was initially assigned to the AAF Southeast Flying Training Command at Maxwell Field, Alabama for orientation as assistant special service officer, traveling to different AAF training bases in the region to learn the mission of the training command. There, he appeared on the nationwide NBC \"Army Hour\" broadcast, originated from WSFA, Montgomery. He also appeared over WAPI radio Birmingham, performing with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece base band.\nEffective January 1, 1943, Miller was assigned to the headquarters of the AAF Technical Training Command (TTC) at Knollwood Field, Southern Pines, North Carolina. Reporting to General Walter Reed Weaver, Miller became director of bands for the AAFTTC. Miller's recommendation for an AAFTTC bands program was approved. Detached to the AAF Training Center at Atlantic City, New Jersey, Miller screened personnel for assignment to various AAF base bands across the nation and recruited many for an elite unit that he would direct himself. The AAF had established its First Radio Production Unit and Orchestra to broadcast from Hollywood, commanded by Major Eddie Dunstedter with musical director Master Sergeant (M/Sgt.) Felix Slatkin. Miller would form and direct the Second AAF Radio Production Unit and Orchestra, broadcasting and recording from New York. Miller's unit was authorized on March 20, 1943, and billeted at the AAF Training School at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. Its personnel were a talented mix of jazz musicians from major big bands and musicians from leading symphony orchestras. Miller would successfully attempt to fuse jazz, popular music and light classics, including strings, which was an evolutionary step beyond his civilian band.\nBroadcasting and recording from New York, the Miller unit broadcast \"I Sustain the Wings\". This weekly series was first carried by CBS starting on June 5, 1943, and then by NBC from September 18, 1943, through June 10, 1944. Miller's unit was succeeded on the series by the AAFTC orchestra directed by M/Sgt. Harry Bluestone, when the Miller band deployed overseas. After Miller died in December 1944, the Miller unit resumed the \"I Sustain the Wings\" series when they returned from the European Theater in August 1945. The Miller unit also recorded V-Discs at RCA Victor studios, and recorded broadcasts for the Office of War Information and Armed Forces Radio Service, including \u201cMusic from America\u201d and \u201cUncle Sam Presents.\"\nIn addition to the full concert orchestra, Miller's AAF Training Command organization included a marching band for base activities and a jazz band led by T/Sgt. Ray McKinley, the popular civilian bandleader and drummer. Initially designated the 418th AAF Band, Miller's unit was redesignated the Second AAF Radio Production Unit on December 6, 1943. At that time, base band duties transferred to the 708th AAF Band, a unit of standby musicians separate from the radio orchestra. Miller's marching band became famous by using jeeps with drums and string bass aboard for public performances. Miller also famously got into a musical argument with Army purists by performing marching arrangements of jazz, including \"The Saint Louis Blues\" and \"Blues in the Night\", as opposed to traditional Sousa military marches. The staff of the Army Air Forces endorsed Miller's modern approach.\nOn May 24, 1944, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a cable to Washington requesting transfer of the Miller AAF unit for the purposes of radio broadcasting and morale. With the impending D-Day invasion of northwest Europe, the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) was establishing a combined allied radio broadcasting service. Eisenhower cited the Miller organization as the \"only organization capable of performing the mission required.\" The Army Air Forces approved the deployment under the condition that the unit remain under AAF control. Miller and radio producer Sergent (Sgt.) Paul Dudley flew to London on June 19 and the band followed aboard the RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\", which was serving as a troopship.\nAs band members recounted, by this time, the name of Miller's unit included his rank, the Captain Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra. The name of the unit would reflect his new rank when he was promoted in England. Upon arrival in London, the unit was initially billeted at Sloane Court, Chelsea. This was a temporary assignment because Miller had previously arranged for permanent quarters in Bedford. Because of the V-1 flying bomb assault that was underway, SHAEF determined it better to house the band where the BBC had moved operations during the Blitz of 1940\u201341. In Bedford, the Miller unit would use facilities developed for Sir Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony. Prior to the band's arrival, Miller met with SHAEF and BBC officials to coordinate broadcasting plans, including the BBC Director of the new Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme (AEFP), Maurice Gorham, SHAEF Director of Broadcasting, American Col. Edward Kirby, and deputy director of SHAEF Broadcasting, British Lt. Col. David Niven (the famous actor). They became Miller's chain of command.\nHis distinguished orchestra was attached to SHAEF in London, and was quartered at Milton Ernest near Bedford, England. When the band arrived in London, they were quartered in a BBC Radio office at 25 Sloane Court. Unfortunately, this was in the middle of \"Buzz Bomb Alley\", an area of sleepless nights because of the constant barrage of German flying V-1 bombs. Miller arranged for new quarters and transportation to move to Bedford on July 2, 1944. The next morning, a buzz bomb landed in front of their old quarters, destroyed the building, and killed more than 100 people, which included WACs among the seventy-five American personnel lost. None were Miller band members. Miller told Lieutenant Don Haynes, \"As long as [the Miller Luck] stays with us, we have nothing to worry about.\"\nOn July 9, 1944, Miller's 51-piece orchestra and production personnel started broadcasting a series of musical programs over the AEFP under BBC technical supervision. The programs included: \"The American Band of the AEF\" (full orchestra), \"Swing Shift\" (T/Sgt. Ray McKinley dance orchestra), \"Uptown Hall\" (Sgt. Mel Powell jazz quartet), \"Strings with Wings\" (Sgt. George Ockner, concertmaster and the string section), \"Song by Sgt. Johnny Desmond\" (vocalist with orchestra directed by M/Sgt. Norman Leyden) and \"Piano Parade\" (piano solos by Pvt. Jack Rusin and Sgt. Mel Powell). The orchestra also appeared for the Office of War Information's Voice of America European outlet. The American Broadcasting Station in Europe (ABSIE) broadcast daily to occupied Europe and Germany. One of its German language programs was \"Music for the Wehrmacht\", in which Miller made announcements in phonetic German scripts with a German-speaking announcer named \"Ilse\", who was actually ABSIE announcer Gloria Wagner. Sgt. Johnny Desmond sang vocals in German on this series.\nIn England, the band kept an extensive schedule of personal appearances at primarily American air bases. Visiting American celebrities Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore appeared on their radio programs. Shore joined Miller for a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, where the orchestra recorded their ABSIE German language programs.\nMilitary service personnel of all ranks enjoyed the band. Their concert at Eighth Air Force Headquarters at Wycombe Abbey, England, was filmed by American Forces Network on July 29, 1944. General James H. Doolittle, Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force, showed his appreciation as he famously announced, \"Captain Miller, next to a letter from home, your band is the greatest morale booster in the European Theater.\" This film is now in the care of the National Archives. (RG 342-USAF-49520 (film), NARA; Eighth Air Force, 520.071, A5835, AFHRA).\nOn Tuesday, October 3, 1944 Miller played his last Hangar Concert for American Servicemen at RAF Kings Cliffe. This airfield was home to the 20th Fighter Group whose pilots had flown a mission that morning just making it back in time to take in Miller's performance in the afternoon. There is a memorial to this event on the hangar base close to the actual location where Miller would have stood during the performance.\nDuring the month of November 1944, Miller and Niven sought and received approval to move the unit from England to France. By this time, SHAEF had relocated to Versailles. It was determined that reliable radio broadcasting could be accomplished from Paris and that the Miller orchestra could be seen in person at Paris-area hospitals and by ground troops on leave from the front lines. The move was set for mid-December. As a precaution, the Miller organization had to prerecord eighty hours of broadcasts prior to moving, in addition to their normal schedule. Meanwhile, preparations in France were behind schedule. On December 11, 1944, Niven ordered Miller to replace his executive officer, Lieutenant (Lt.) Donald Haynes, to fly ahead and complete arrangements before the entire group came across.\nDeath.\nBy Tuesday, December 12, 1944, the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra completed making their prerecorded and regular broadcasts in England, and prepared for the move to France. On Niven's order, Miller was booked on a scheduled Air Transport Command passenger flight from London-Bovingdon to Paris-Orly on Thursday, December 14.\nMiller was on standby for an earlier flight on December 13, but it was canceled due to bad weather in France. His reservation on December 14 was also canceled. Miller grew frustrated and impatient, fearing that arrangements would not be made in time to accommodate the movement of his unit to France. On a telephone call to Haynes, he learned that a mutual acquaintance, Lieutenant Colonel Norman F. Baessell of the Eighth Air Force Service Command at Milton Ernest, was flying to France on Friday, December 15. It was to be aboard a Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman assigned to him and piloted by Flight Officer John R. Stuart Morgan. Baessell invited Miller to join them.\nMiller's travel orders did not authorize him to board a \"casual\" flight and he did not report his intentions to his chain of command, so SHAEF was in the dark concerning Miller's whereabouts. Although AAF and RAF combat missions flew that day, as well as numerous transport planes, the RAF Training Unit at RAF Twinwood Farm, near Bedford, had stood down, but the aerodrome was open. At 13:45 hours (1:45 PM), Morgan landed at Twinwood, boarded Baessell and Miller, and took off at 13:55 hours (1:55 p.m.). The UC-64 and its occupants were never seen again. The next morning, the Battle of the Bulge began. The Eighth Air Force and SHAEF did not realize that the UC-64 with Miller aboard was missing until three days later, on Monday, December 18, 1944.\nUpon realizing the airplane and Miller were missing, Major General Orvil Anderson, Deputy Commander for Operations of the Eighth Air Force, who was married to Miller's cousin Maude Miller Anderson, ordered a search and investigation. Meanwhile, Miller's unit had flown safely from England to France aboard three C-47 transports and prepared to begin their broadcasting and concert duties. Since they were scheduled for a Christmas Day broadcast from Paris to England and via shortwave to the United States, news of Miller's whereabouts would have to be released. AAF Headquarters in Washington, D.C. notified Miller's wife, Helen, of his disappearance on December 23, 1944, with an in-person visit to their home by two senior officers and a telephone call from Gen. H. H. Arnold. On December 24, 1944, at 18:00 BST, SHAEF announced Miller's disappearance to the press, stressing that no members of his unit were with him aboard the missing airplane.\nThe Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra appeared as scheduled on December 25, 1944, conducted by Jerry Gray. The unit continued to broadcast and appear throughout Europe through V-E Day and until August 1945. It received a Unit Citation from Gen. Eisenhower. Returning home, the unit resumed its \"I Sustain the Wings\" series over NBC.\nOn November 13, 1945, the AAF Band appeared at the National Press Club for its final concert, which was attended by President Harry Truman and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. When the band appeared to the strains of Miller's theme \"Moonlight Serenade\", the president stood and led the audience in a spontaneous round of applause. The band was congratulated for a job \"well done\" in person by General Eisenhower and General Arnold.\nTheir last performance was the \"I Sustain the Wings\" broadcast at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., on NBC radio on November 17, 1945. Its personnel were gradually discharged, and the unit was disestablished in January 1946.\nCondolences.\nHelen Miller accepted her husband's Bronze Star Medal at a ceremony at Miller's New York business office on March 23, 1945. When Miller was officially declared dead in December 1945, Helen received a formal letter of condolence and appreciation from Gen. H. H. Arnold. When Major General Anderson returned from Europe, he visited Helen Miller and informed her of the inquiry findings.\nOn January 20, 1945, an Eighth Air Force Board of Inquiry in England determined that the UC-64 airplane went down over the English Channel due to a combination of human error, mechanical failure and weather. Remains of the UC-64 and its passengers have never been found. The three officers were officially declared dead on the standard year and a day after they disappeared. This was published in a 1946 Army publication showing that Miller has a Finding of Death (FOD). He was missing in action (MIA) on December 15, 1944, and his remains were not recoverable.\nNames on tablets of the missing.\nMiller's name is engraved as Alton G. Miller on the \"Tablets of the Missing\" at the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial run by the American Battle Monuments Commission in Cambridge, England. The names of Flight Officer John R. S. Morgan and Lieutenant Colonel Norman Baessell are also carved there. Many Americans who died in the Second World War in Europe are buried there. On behalf of Miller's family and the Glenn Miller Birthplace Society, an Air Force wreath ceremony was conducted there on the 50th anniversary of their deaths, December 15, 1994. A moment of silence was held there and at Arlington National Cemetery.\nMemorial headstone.\nAt his daughter's request nearly 50 years later, an official, government-issued memorial headstone was placed for Major Alton Glenn Miller, US Army (Air Corps), in memorial section H at the Army-run Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia in 1992. A trombone, 464-A, and the words \"Bronze Star Medal\" are carved on the back of the white marble marker.\nMemorial Tree \u2013 An American Holly.\nA living memorial to the entire unit can be seen from Miller's marble memorial. Using military date style, the \"Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra in service from 20 March 1943 \u2013 15 January 1946\" is carved in the black granite marker in front of an American Holly tree. The marker has etchings of a trombone and the patches of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and the Army Air Forces (AAF) on it. Before it was carved in stone, the military band's title was verified by Norman Leyden who was an arranger and clarinetist in the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra. The name was also confirmed by Kathy Shenkle (Air Force, Army, and Arlington National Cemetery historian), C.F. Alan Cass, curator of the Glenn Miller Archives at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Glenn Miller Birthplace Society president, and other historians and band members for the US Army and US Air Force.\nLocated in Section 13 along Wilson Drive, the tree was dedicated on the 50th anniversary of Miller's death, December 15, 1994. The American Holly is meant to remind visitors of the tune \"American Patrol\". \"Taps\" was sounded at the wreath ceremony, memorial service and tree dedication. A moment of silence took place both at Arlington, Virginia, and in Cambridge, England. The Secretary of the Air Force was the main speaker. Attendees included Sergeant Emanuel Wishnow (viola), other unit veterans, Miller's family, military service members, US senators, Glenn Miller Archives founder and curator C.F. Alan Cass, and members of the Glenn Miller Birthplace Society. The Jazz Ambassadors of the US Army Field Band performed at the luncheon at Fort Myer that followed the ceremony. One of Miller's trombones was displayed on stage. The Airmen of Note and the Army Blues had performances elsewhere during the day. The US Air Force Band (with their orchestra) played a 50th anniversary memorial concert that night and on tour for the next year. The Coast Guard Band and Marine Corps Band commanders joined the other bands in sending written greetings. On the 75th anniversary on December 15, 2019, Ms. Kathy Shenkle represented them all at a wreath ceremony there with wreaths provided by Wreaths Across America.\nInvestigation into disappearance.\nA document concerning the military career and disappearance of Miller appeared during 2017 in the book \"Glenn Miller Declassified\" by Dennis M. Spragg, director of the Glenn Miller Archives. On behalf of the Glenn Miller Estate and with the full cooperation of American and British authorities, all relevant and many new documents concerning the circumstances of the accident were discovered and published, including the inquiry findings of January 20, 1945. According to the book, Miller had no other duties than as a musical and broadcasting officer, and his high profile and schedule ruled out any clandestine role as later speculated by sensationalists. The book concludes that he was not the victim of foul play or friendly fire.\nIn 2019, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) was reported to be investigating a report that Miller's airplane was possibly discovered many miles west of its required flight path but nothing further has been reported or found. Given modern technology, a well-funded and patient exploration could possibly find and identify the debris of the airplane along the required air transport corridor between Langney Point (Beachy Head) and St. Valery, France.\nPersonal life.\nAfter college, Miller maintained a long-distance friendship with Helen Burger, and they married in 1928. Helen is credited with being a great help in her husband\u2019s career. The Millers adopted a baby boy, Steven Davis Miller, and a baby girl, Jonnie Dee Miller.\nCivilian band legacy.\nMiller and his music became an institution as Miller wished. His music is still played worldwide by professional and amateur musicians every day, including BBC radio.\nThe Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller legacy or ghost band in 1946, the Glenn Miller Orchestra. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It had a makeup similar to the Army Air Forces Band: It included a large string section, and at least initially, about two-thirds of the musicians were alumni of either the civilian or AAF orchestras. The orchestra's official public d\u00e9but was at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway, where it opened for a three-week engagement on January 24, 1946. Future television and film composer Henry Mancini was the band's pianist and one of the arrangers. This ghost band played to very large audiences all across the United States, including a few dates at the Hollywood Palladium in 1947, where the original Miller band played in 1941. A website concerning the history of the Hollywood Palladium noted \"[even] as the big band era faded, the Tex Beneke and Glenn Miller Orchestra concert at the Palladium resulted in a record-breaking crowd of 6,750 dancers.\" By 1949, economics dictated that the string section be dropped. This band recorded for RCA Victor, just as the original Miller band did. Beneke was struggling with how to expand the Miller sound and also how to achieve success under his own name. What began as the \"Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke\" finally became \"The Tex Beneke Orchestra\". By 1950, Beneke and the Miller estate parted ways. The break was acrimonious, although Beneke is now listed by the Miller estate as a former leader of the Glenn Miller Orchestra, and his role is now acknowledged on the orchestra's website.\nWhen Miller was alive, many bandleaders such as Bob Chester imitated his style. By the early 1950s, various bands were again copying the Miller style of clarinet-led reeds and muted trumpets, notably Ralph Flanagan, Jerry Gray, and Ray Anthony. This, coupled with the success of \"The Glenn Miller Story\" (1954), inspired Helen Miller to invite Ray McKinley, who had assumed leadership of the Miller band in 1945, to form a new band called the Glenn Miller Orchestra. McKinley recruited Will Bradley as featured trombonist, and they remained with the Miller band until 1966.\nAround the world, the Glenn Miller Orchestra continues to tour today. In the United States, the leader since 2021 has been saxophonist Erik Stabnau. In the United Kingdom, the director is Ray McVay. In Europe, the leader has been Wil Salden since 1990. In Scandinavia, the director has been Jan Slotten\u00e4s since 2010.\nMajor Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra legacy.\nThe Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra's long-term legacy has carried on with the Airmen of Note, a band within the United States Air Force Band. \"The Airmen of Note is the premier jazz ensemble of the United States Air Force. Stationed at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., it is one of six musical ensembles that form The US Air Force Band.\" Created in 1950 to continue the tradition of Major Glenn Miller's Army Air Forces dance band, the current band consists of 18 active-duty musicians, including one vocalist. This band was created in 1950 from smaller groups within the Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, DC, and continues to play jazz music for the Air Force community and the general public. The legacy also continues through The United States Air Forces in Europe Band, stationed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Today, every branch of the US armed forces has a big band component. This includes: The Ambassadors in US Army Air Forces Europe, The US Army Band's Army Blues, the US Army Field Band's Jazz Ambassadors, and the US Navy Commodores. The US Coast Guard has one musical organization to perform all types of music. That includes a Coast Guard musical unit called the Guardians. The Coast Guard Band and Yale University bands performed a joint concert for the 75th anniversary of Miller's death. The military bands consist of units such as concert bands, marching bands, jazz orchestras, small combos, and elements that play swing, rock, country, and bluegrass. Miller is considered to be the father of all modern United States military bands.\nMiller \"was a stickler for details and accuracy and always the truth. How delighted he would have been with Ed Polic's superbly documented report\" wrote George Simon as he recommended, \"The Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band: Sustineo Alas / I Sustain the Wings\" to readers of the \"American Reference Books Annual\". In 1314 pages, Polic covers a \"small but significant period of Glenn Miller's life and music, from his enlistment in 1942 and the beginning of his [Army Air Forces Orchestra (band for short)] in 1943, through its end in late 1945, giving an overall history of the band and a detailed recounting of the day-by-day activities of the band.\"\nPosthumous events.\nNumerous archives, museums and memorials in the United States and England are devoted to Miller. Herb Miller, Miller's brother, led his own band in the United States and England until the late 1980s.\nIn 1953, Universal-International pictures released \"The Glenn Miller Story\", starring James Stewart; Ray Eberle, Marion Hutton, and Tex Beneke neither appear in nor are referred to in it.\nAnnual festivals celebrating Miller's legacy are held in two of the towns most associated with his youth, Clarinda, Iowa, and Fort Morgan, Colorado.\nSince 1975, the Glenn Miller Birthplace Society has held its annual Glenn Miller Festival in Clarinda, Iowa. The festival's highlights include performances by the official Glenn Miller Orchestra under the direction of Nick Hilscher, and many other civilian and military jazz bands. It also includes visits to the restored Miller home, the Glenn Miller Birthplace Museum, historical displays from the Glenn Miller Archives at the University of Colorado, lectures and presentations about Miller's life, and a scholarship competition for young classical and jazz musicians.\nIn 1989, Miller's daughter bought the house where Miller was born in Clarinda. The Glenn Miller Foundation was created to oversee its restoration. It is now part of the Glenn Miller Birthplace Museum. The Glenn Miller Birthplace Society celebrated when the US Postal Service issued a Glenn Miller postage stamp in 1996.\nEvery summer since 1996, the city of Fort Morgan, Colorado, has hosted a public event called the Glenn Miller SwingFest. Miller graduated from Fort Morgan High School, where he played football and other sports, was on the yearbook staff, was in the orchestra, and formed his own band with classmates. Events include musical performances and swing dancing, community picnics, lectures, and fundraising for scholarships to attend the School for the Performing Arts, a nonprofit dance, voice, piano, percussion, guitar, violin, and drama studio program in Fort Morgan. Each year, about 2,000 people attend this summer festival, which serves to introduce younger generations to the music Miller made famous, as well as the style of dance and dress popular in the big-band era.\nThe Glenn Miller Archives at the University of Colorado at Boulder houses many of Miller's recordings, gold records and other memorabilia. It is also open to scholarly research and the general public. Formed by C.F. Alan Cass, the Glenn Miller Archives includes the original manuscript of Miller's theme song, \"Moonlight Serenade\".\nIn 1957, a Student Union Building was completed at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus and the ballroom was named the Glenn Miller Ballroom.\nIn 2002, the Glenn Miller Museum opened to the public at the former RAF Twinwood Farm, in Clapham, Bedfordshire, England.\nMiller's name is engraved as Alton G. Miller on the \"Tablets of the Missing\" at the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial run by the American Battle Monuments Commission in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom. The names of Flight Officer John R. S. Morgan and Lieutenant Colonel Norman Baessell are also carved there.\nMiller's government-issued, white marble, memorial headstone is located in Memorial Section H (# 464-A) by Wilson Drive at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia. The Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra Memorial American Holly can be seen from there.\nA Miller fan, Peter Cofrancesco, bought a gravesite at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut, and placed a black granite cenotaph there.\u00a0 He has no relationship to Major Miller's family.\u00a0 Here is the inscription along with corrections that could be made if it is ever replaced or moved to a non-grave location. \u00a0An etching of Major Miller in uniform / IN MEMORY / Major\u00a0A.

The headquarters of the United States Air Forces in Europe Band at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, is named Glenn Miller Hall.\nOn June 25, 1999, the Nebraska State Highway Commission unanimously agreed to name Nebraska Highway 97 between North Platte, where Miller attended elementary school, and Tryon, where the Miller family briefly lived, as Glenn Miller Memorial Highway.\nArranging staff and compositions.\nMiller had a staff of arrangers who wrote originals such as \"String of Pearls\" (written and arranged by Jerry Gray) or took originals such as \"In The Mood\" (writing credit given to Joe Garland and arranged by Eddie Durham) and \"Tuxedo Junction\" (written by bandleader Erskine Hawkins and arranged by Jerry Gray) and arranged them for the Miller band to either record or broadcast. Miller's staff of arrangers in his civilian band, who handled the bulk of the work, were Jerry Gray (a former arranger for Artie Shaw), Bill Finegan (a former arranger for Tommy Dorsey), Billy May and to a much smaller extent, George Williams, who worked very briefly with the band as well as Andrews Sisters arranger Vic Schoen\nAccording to arranger and conductor Norman Leyden, he and others did arrangements \"for Miller in the service, including Jerry Gray, Ralph Wilkinson, Mel Powell, and Steve Steck.\" In 1943, Miller wrote \"Glenn Miller's Method for Orchestral Arranging\", published by his own company the Mutual Music Society in New York, a 116-page book with illustrations and scores that explains how he wrote his musical arrangements.\nAwards, decorations and honors.\nMilitary awards and decorations.\nMiller, US Army (Air Corps) earned a Bronze Star Medal, World War II Victory Medal; American Campaign Medal; European, African and Middle Eastern Campaign Medal; and Marksman Badge with Carbine and Pistol Bars.\nBronze Star Medal Citation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGrammy Hall of Fame.\nMiller had three recordings that were posthumously inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nTrue fact section - Glenn Miller was a massive fan of eating snacks and drinking beer whilst writing music.

She won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her starring role in \"Kitty Foyle\" (1940), and performed during the 1930s in RKO's musical films with Fred Astaire. Her career continued on stage, radio and television throughout much of the 20th century.\nRogers was born in Independence, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City. She and her family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, when she was nine years old. In 1925, she won a Charleston dance contest that helped her launch a successful vaudeville career. After that, she gained recognition as a Broadway actress for her stage debut in \"Girl Crazy\". This led to a contract with Paramount Pictures, which ended after five films. Rogers had her first successful film roles as a supporting actress in \"42nd Street\" (1933) and \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" (1933).\nIn the 1930s, Rogers's nine films with Fred Astaire are credited with revolutionizing the genre and gave RKO Pictures some of its biggest successes: \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), \"Top Hat\" (1935) and \"Swing Time\" (1936). But after two commercial failures with Astaire, she turned her focus to dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences in films such as \"Stage Door\" (1937), \"Vivacious Lady\" (1938), \"Bachelor Mother\" (1939), \"Primrose Path\" (1940), \"Kitty Foyle\" (1940), \"The Major and the Minor\" (1942) and \"I'll Be Seeing You\" (1944). After winning the Oscar, Rogers became one of the biggest box-office draws and highest-paid actresses of the 1940s.\nRogers's popularity was peaking by the end of the decade. She reunited with Astaire in 1949 in the commercially successful \"The Barkleys of Broadway.\" She starred in the successful comedy \"Monkey Business\" (1952) and was critically lauded for her performance in \"Tight Spot\" (1955) before entering an unsuccessful period of filmmaking in the mid-1950s, and returned to Broadway in 1965, playing the lead role in \"Hello, Dolly!\" More Broadway roles followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 of an off-Broadway production of \"Babes in Arms\". She continued to act, making television appearances until 1987, and wrote an autobiography \"Ginger: My Story\" which was published in 1991. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors. She died of natural causes in 1995, at age 83.\nDuring her long career, Rogers made 73 films. In 1999, she ranks number 14 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of female stars of classic American cinema.\nEarly life.\nVirginia Katherine McMath was born on July 16, 1911, in Independence, Missouri, the only child of Lela Emogene Owens, a newspaper reporter, and William Eddins McMath, an electrical engineer. Her maternal grandparents were Wilma Saphrona (\"n\u00e9e\" Ball) and Walter Winfield Owens. She was of Scottish, Welsh, and English ancestry. Her mother gave birth to Ginger at home, having lost a previous child in a hospital. \nRogers was raised a Christian Scientist and remained a lifelong adherent.\nHer parents separated shortly after she was born.After unsuccessfully trying to reunite with his family, McMath kidnapped his daughter twice, and her mother divorced him soon thereafter. Rogers said that she never saw her natural father again.\nIn 1915, she was left with her grandparents, who lived in nearby Kansas City, while her mother made a trip to Hollywood in an effort to get an essay she had written made into a film. Lela succeeded and continued to write scripts for Fox Studios.\nOne of Rogers's young cousins had a hard time pronouncing \"Virginia\", giving her the nickname \"Ginger\".\nWhen Rogers was nine years old, her mother married John Logan Rogers. Ginger took the surname Rogers, although she was never legally adopted. They lived in Fort Worth. Her mother became a theater critic for a local newspaper, the \"Fort Worth Record\". She attended, but did not graduate from, Fort Worth's Central High School (later renamed R. L. Paschal High School.)\nAs a teenager, Rogers thought of becoming a school teacher, but with her mother's interest in Hollywood and the theater, her early exposure to the theater increased. Waiting for her mother in the wings of Ft. Worth's Majestic Theatre, she began to sing and dance along with the performers on stage.\nCareer.\n1925\u20131929: Vaudeville and Broadway.\nRogers's entertainment career began when the traveling vaudeville act of Eddie Foy came to Fort Worth and needed a quick stand-in. In 1925 the 14-year-old entered and won a Charleston dance contest; the prize allowed her to tour as Ginger Rogers and the Redheads for six months on the Orpheum Circuit. In 1926, the group performed at an 18-month-old theater called The Craterian in Medford, Oregon. This theater honored her years later by changing its name to the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater. When the M.G.M film \"The Barrier\" premiered in San Bernardino, California, in February 1926, Rogers's vaudeville act was featured. The local newspaper commented, \"Clever little Ginger Rogers showed why she won the Texas state championship as a Charleston dancer.\"\nAt 17, Rogers married Jack Culpepper, a singer/dancer/comedian/recording artist of the day who worked under the name Jack Pepper (according to Ginger's autobiography and \"Life\" magazine, she knew Culpepper when she was a child, as her cousin's boyfriend). They formed a short-lived vaudeville double act known as \"Ginger and Pepper\". The marriage was over within a year, and she went back to touring with her mother. When the tour got to New York City, she stayed, getting radio singing jobs. She made her Broadway debut in the musical \"Top Speed\", which opened at Chanin's 46th Street Theatre on Christmas Day, 1929 following the musical's premiere in Philadelphia at the Chestnut Street Opera House on November 13, 1929.\nWithin two weeks of the New York opening of \"Top Speed\", Rogers was chosen to star on Broadway in \"Girl Crazy\" by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Fred Astaire was hired to help the dancers with their choreography. Her appearance in \"Girl Crazy\" made her an overnight star at the age of 19.\n1929\u20131933: Early film roles.\nRogers's first movie roles were in a trio of short films made in 1929: \"Night in the Dormitory\", \"A Day of a Man of Affairs\", and \"Campus Sweethearts\". In 1930, Paramount Pictures signed her to a seven-year contract.\nRogers soon got herself out of the Paramount contract\u2014under which she had made five feature films at Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens\u2014and moved with her mother to Hollywood. When she got to California, she signed a three-picture deal with Path\u00e9 Exchange. Two of her pictures at Path\u00e9 were \"Suicide Fleet\" (1931) and \"Carnival Boat\" (1932) in which she played opposite future Hopalong Cassidy star William Boyd. Rogers also made feature films for Warner Bros., Monogram, and Fox in 1932, and was named one of 15 WAMPAS Baby Stars. She then made a significant breakthrough as Anytime Annie in the Warner Bros. film \"42nd Street\" (1933). She went on to make a series of films at Warner Bros., most notably in \"Gold Diggers of 1933,\" in which her solo, \"We're in the Money\", included a memorable verse in Pig Latin. She then moved to RKO Studios, was put under contract and with Astaire started work on \"Flying Down to Rio\", a picture starring Dolores del R\u00edo and Gene Raymond. Rogers and Astaire \"stole the show\", an industry term for outshining the billed stars.\n1933\u20131939: Partnership with Astaire.\nRogers was known for her partnership with Fred Astaire. Together, from 1933 to 1939, they made nine musical films at RKO: \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933), \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), \"Roberta\" (1935), \"Top Hat\" (1935), \"Follow the Fleet\" (1936), \"Swing Time\" (1936), \"Shall We Dance\" (1937), \"Carefree\" (1938), and \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\" (1939). \"The Barkleys of Broadway\" (1949) was produced later at MGM. They revolutionized the Hollywood musical by introducing dance routines of unprecedented elegance and virtuosity with sweeping long shots set to songs specially composed for them by the greatest popular song composers of the day. One such composer was Cole Porter with \"Night and Day\", a song Astaire sang to Rogers with the line \"... you are the one\" in two of their movies, being particularly poignant in their last pairing of \"The Barkleys of Broadway.\"\nArlene Croce, Hermes Pan, Hannah Hyam, and John Mueller all consider Rogers to have been Astaire's finest dance partner, principally because of her ability to combine dancing skills, natural beauty, and exceptional abilities as a dramatic actress and comedian, thus truly complementing Astaire, a peerless dancer. The resulting song and dance partnership enjoyed a unique credibility in the eyes of audiences.\nOf the 33 partnered dances Rogers performed with Astaire, Croce and Mueller have highlighted the infectious spontaneity of her performances in the comic numbers \"I'll Be Hard to Handle\" from \"Roberta\", \"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket\" from \"Follow the Fleet\", and \"Pick Yourself Up\" from \"Swing Time\". They also point to the use Astaire made of her remarkably flexible back in classic romantic dances such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" from \"Roberta\", \"Cheek to Cheek\" from \"Top Hat\", and \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\" from \"Follow the Fleet\".\nAlthough the dance routines were choreographed by Astaire and his collaborator Hermes Pan, both have testified to her consummate professionalism, even during periods of intense strain, as she tried to juggle her many other contractual film commitments with the punishing rehearsal schedules of Astaire, who made at most two films in any one year. In 1986, shortly before his death, Astaire remarked, \"All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn't do it, but of course they could. So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried\".\nJohn Mueller summed up Rogers's abilities as: \"Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners, not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but, because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began\u00a0... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable\".\nAccording to Raymond Rohauer, curator at the New York Gallery of Modern Art, Astaire gave Rogers this salute: \"Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.\"\nIn a 1976 episode of the popular British talk-show \"Parkinson\" (Season 5, Episode 24), host Michael Parkinson asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was. Astaire answered, \"Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.\"\nAfter 15 months apart and with RKO facing bankruptcy, the studio paired Fred and Ginger for another movie titled \"Carefree\", but it lost money. Next came \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle,\" based on a true story, but the serious plot and tragic ending resulted in the worst box-office receipts of any of their films. This was driven not by diminished popularity, but by the hard 1930s economic reality. The production costs of musicals, always significantly greater than regular features, continued to increase at a much faster rate than admissions.\n1933\u20131939: Success in non-musicals.\nBoth before and immediately after her dancing and acting partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Rogers starred in a number of successful nonmusical films. \"Stage Door\" (1937) demonstrated her dramatic capacity, as the loquacious yet vulnerable girl next door and tough-minded theatrical hopeful, opposite Katharine Hepburn. Successful comedies included \"Vivacious Lady\" (1938) with James Stewart, \"Fifth Avenue Girl\" (1939), where she played an out-of-work girl sucked into the lives of a wealthy family, and \"Bachelor Mother\" (1939), with David Niven, in which she played a shop girl who is falsely thought to have abandoned her baby.\nIn 1934, Rogers sued Sylvia of Hollywood for $100K for defamation. The fitness guru and radio personality had claimed that Rogers was on her radio show when, in fact, she was not.\nOn March 5, 1939, Rogers starred in \"Single Party Going East\", an episode of \"Silver Theater\" on CBS radio.\n1940\u20131949: Career peak and reuniting with Astaire.\nIn 1941 Rogers won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in 1940's \"Kitty Foyle\". She enjoyed considerable success during the early 1940s, and was RKO's hottest property during this period. In \"Roxie Hart\" (1942), based on the same play which later served as the template for the musical \"Chicago\", Rogers played a wisecracking flapper in a love triangle on trial for the murder of her lover; set in the era of prohibition. Most of the film takes place in a women's jail.\nIn the melodrama \"Primrose Path\" (1940), directed by Gregory La Cava, she plays a character attempting to conceal being a prostitute's daughter being pressured into following the fate of her mother and grandmother. Further highlights of this period included \"Tom, Dick, and Harry\", a 1941 comedy in which she dreams of marrying three different men; \"I'll Be Seeing You\" (1944), with Joseph Cotten; and Billy Wilder's first Hollywood feature film: \"The Major and the Minor\" (1942), in which she played a down-on-her-luck woman who masquerades as a 12-year-old to get a cheap train ticket home and finds herself obliged to continue the ruse at a military academy. Rogers' mother, Lela, played her mother in the film.\nAfter becoming a free agent, Rogers made hugely successful films with other studios in the mid-'40s, including \"Tender Comrade\" (1943), \"Lady in the Dark\" (1944), and \"Week-End at the Waldorf\" (1945), and became the highest-paid performer in Hollywood. However, by the end of the decade, her film career had peaked. Arthur Freed reunited her with Fred Astaire in \"The Barkleys of Broadway\" in 1949, when Judy Garland was unable to appear in the role that was to have reunited her with her \"Easter Parade\" co-star.\n1950\u20131987: Later career.\nRogers's film career entered a period of gradual decline in the 1950s, as parts for older actresses became more difficult to obtain, but she still scored with some solid movies. She starred in \"Storm Warning\" (1950) with Ronald Reagan and Doris Day, a noir, anti-Ku Klux Klan film by Warner Bros. In 1952 Rogers starred in two comedies featuring Marilyn Monroe, \"Monkey Business\" with Cary Grant, directed by Howard Hawks, and \"We're Not Married!.\" She followed those with a role in \"Dreamboat\" alongside Clifton Webb, as his former onscreen partner in silent films who wanted to renew their association on television. She played the female lead in \"Tight Spot\" (1955), a mystery thriller, with Edward G. Robinson. After a series of unremarkable films, she scored a great popular success on Broadway in 1965, playing Dolly Levi in the long-running \"Hello, Dolly!\"\nIn later life, Rogers remained on good terms with Astaire; she presented him with a special Academy Award in 1950, and they were copresenters of individual Academy Awards in 1967, during which they elicited a standing ovation when they came on stage in an impromptu dance. In 1969, she had the lead role in another long-running popular production, \"Mame\", from the book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman, at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in the West End of London, arriving for the role on the liner \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" from New York City. Her docking there occasioned the maximum of pomp and ceremony at Southampton. She became the highest-paid performer in the history of the West End up to that time. The production ran for 14 months and featured a royal command performance for Queen Elizabeth II.\nFrom the 1950s onward, Rogers made occasional appearances on television, even substituting for a vacationing Hal March on \"The $64,000 Question\". In the later years of her career, she made guest appearances in three different series by Aaron Spelling: \"The Love Boat\" (1979), \"Glitter\" (1984), and \"Hotel\" (1987), which was her final screen appearance as an actress. In 1985, Rogers fulfilled a long-standing wish to direct when she directed the musical \"Babes in Arms\" off-Broadway in Tarrytown, New York, at 74 years old. It was produced by Michael Lipton and Robert Kennedy of Kennedy Lipton Productions. The production starred Broadway talents Donna Theodore, Carleton Carpenter, James Brennan, Randy Skinner, Karen Ziemba, Dwight Edwards, and Kim Morgan. It is also noted in her autobiography \"Ginger, My Story\".\nPersonal life.\nRogers, an only child, maintained a close relationship with her mother, Lela Rogers, throughout her life. Lela, a newspaper reporter, scriptwriter, and movie producer, was one of the first women to enlist in the Marine Corps, was a founder of the successful \"Hollywood Playhouse\" for aspiring actors and actresses on the RKO set, and a founder of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. Rogers was a lifelong member of the Republican Party and campaigned for Thomas Dewey in the 1944 presidential election, Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election and Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election. She was a strong opponent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, speaking out against both him and his New Deal proposals. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\nRogers and her mother had a very close professional relationship. Lela Rogers was credited with pivotal contributions to her daughter's early successes in New York City and in Hollywood, and gave her much assistance in contract negotiations with RKO. She also wrote a children's mystery book with her daughter as the central character.\nMarriages.\nRogers married and divorced five times. She did not have children.\nOn March 29, 1929, Rogers married for the first time at age 17 to her dancing partner Jack Pepper (real name Edward Jackson Culpepper). They divorced in 1931, having separated soon after the wedding. Rogers dated Mervyn LeRoy in 1932, but they ended the relationship and remained friends until his death in 1987. In 1934, she married actor Lew Ayres (1908\u201396). They divorced six years later in 1940. In 1943, Rogers married her third husband, Jack Briggs, who was a U.S. Marine, before divorcing in 1950. In 1953, she married Jacques Bergerac, a French actor 16 years her junior, whom she met on a trip to Paris. A lawyer in France, he came to Hollywood with her and became an actor. They divorced in 1957. Her fifth and final husband was director and producer William Marshall. They married in 1961 and divorced in 1970, after his bouts with alcohol and the financial collapse of their joint film production company in Jamaica.\nFriendships.\nRogers was lifelong friends with actresses Lucille Ball and Bette Davis. She appeared with Ball in an episode of \"Here's Lucy\" on November 22, 1971, in which Rogers danced the Charleston for the first time in many years. Rogers starred in one of the earliest films co-directed and co-scripted by a woman, Wanda Tuchock's \"Finishing School\" (1934). Rogers maintained a close friendship with her cousin, writer/socialite Phyllis Fraser, the wife of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf. Rita Hayworth's maternal uncle, Vinton Hayworth, was married to Rogers's maternal aunt, Jean Owens.\nReligion.\nRogers was raised a Christian Scientist and remained a lifelong adherent. Christian Science was a topic she discussed at length in her autobiography. Rogers's mother died in 1977. She remained at the 4-Rs (Rogers' Rogue River Ranch) until 1990. When the property was sold, Rogers moved to nearby Medford, Oregon.\nInterests.\nRogers was a talented tennis player, and entered the 1950 US Open. However, she and Frank Shields were knocked out of the mixed doubles competition in the first round.\nNotable final appearances.\nThe city of Independence, Missouri designated the birthplace of Ginger Rogers a Historic Landmark property in 1994. That July 16, Ginger and her secretary, Roberta Olden, appeared at there a Ginger Rogers' Day celebration presented by the city, where plaque was affixed and Rogers signed over 2,000 autographs, one of her last public appearances.\nThe home was purchased in 2016 by Three Trails Cottages, which restored, then transformed it into a museum dedicated to Ginger Rogers and her mother Lela. Open seasonally until 2019, it contained memorabilia, magazines, movie posters, and many items from the ranch the pair owned, and hosted numerous events.\nRogers made her last public appearance on March 18, 1995, when she received the Women's International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award. For many years, Rogers regularly supported, and held in-person presentations, at the Craterian Theater, in Medford, where she had performed in 1926 as a vaudevillian. The theater was comprehensively restored in 1997 and posthumously renamed in her honor as the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater.\nDeath.\nRogers spent winters in Rancho Mirage and summers in Medford, Oregon. She died at her Rancho Mirage home on April 25, 1995, from a heart attack at the age of 83. She was cremated and her ashes interred with her mother Lela Emogene in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64636", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64636", "title": "Gigabit Ethernet", "text": "Standard for Ethernet networking at a data rate of 1 gigabit per second\nIn computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is the term applied to transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second. The most popular variant, 1000BASE-T, is defined by the IEEE 802.3ab standard. It came into use in 1999, and has replaced Fast Ethernet in wired local networks due to its considerable speed improvement over Fast Ethernet, as well as its use of cables and equipment that are widely available, economical, and similar to previous standards. The first standard for faster 10 Gigabit Ethernet was approved in 2002.\nHistory.\nEthernet was the result of research conducted at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s, and later evolved into a widely implemented physical and link layer protocol. Fast Ethernet increased the speed from 10 to 100 megabits per second (Mbit/s). Gigabit Ethernet was the next iteration, increasing the speed to 1000 Mbit/s.\nThe initial standard for Gigabit Ethernet was produced by the IEEE in June 1998 as IEEE 802.3z, and required optical fiber. 802.3z is commonly referred to as 1000BASE-X, where -X refers to either -CX, -SX, -LX, or (non-standard) -ZX. IEEE 802.3ab, ratified in 1999, defines Gigabit Ethernet transmission over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) category 5, 5e or 6 cabling, and became known as 1000BASE-T. With the ratification of 802.3ab, Gigabit Ethernet became a desktop technology as organizations could use their existing copper cabling infrastructure. IEEE 802.3ah, ratified in 2004, added two more GbE fiber standards: 1000BASE-LX10 (which was already widely implemented as vendor-specific extension) and 1000BASE-BX10. This was part of a larger group of protocols known as Ethernet in the first mile.\nInitially, Gigabit Ethernet was deployed in high-capacity backbone network links (for instance, on a high-capacity campus network). In 2000 and 2001, Apple's Power Mac G4 and PowerBook G4 respectively were the first mass-produced personal computers to feature the 1000BASE-T connection. It quickly became a built-in feature in many other computers.\nHalf-duplex GbE links connected through repeater hubs were part of the IEEE specification, but the specification has not been maintained and full-duplex operation with switches is, in practice, used exclusively.\nVarieties.\nThere are five physical layer standards for Gigabit Ethernet using optical fiber (1000BASE-X), twisted pair cable (1000BASE-T), or shielded balanced copper cable (1000BASE-CX).\nThe IEEE 802.3z standard includes 1000BASE-SX for transmission over multi-mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX for transmission over single-mode fiber, and the nearly obsolete 1000BASE-CX for transmission over shielded balanced copper cabling. These standards use 8b/10b encoding, which adds a 25% overhead, to ensure a DC balanced signal, and allow for clock recovery. The symbols are then sent using NRZ line code.\nOptical fiber transceivers are most often implemented as user-swappable modules in SFP form or GBIC on older devices.\nIEEE 802.3ab, which defines the widely used 1000BASE-T interface type, uses a different encoding scheme in order to keep the symbol rate as low as possible, allowing transmission over twisted pair.\nIEEE 802.3ap defines Ethernet operation over electrical backplanes at different speeds.\nEthernet in the first mile later added 1000BASE-LX10 and -BX10 extended-distance fiber-optic variants.\nCopper.\n1000BASE-T.\nIEEE 802.3ab is the original standard for Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair wiring, known as 1000BASE-T.\nEach 1000BASE-T network segment is recommended to be a maximum length of , and must use Category 5 cable or better.\nAutonegotiation is a requirement for 1000BASE-T implementations as minimally the clock source for the link has to be negotiated, as one endpoint must be master and the other endpoint must be slave.\nIn a departure from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, which use a cable pair in each direction, 1000BASE-T uses four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions through the use of echo cancellation with adaptive equalization, the resulting circuits being called \"hybrid circuits\" as used in telephone hybrids. Line coding is five-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-5). The symbol rate is identical to that of 100BASE-TX (125\u00a0megabaud) and the noise immunity of the five-level signaling is also identical to that of the three-level signaling in 100BASE-TX, since 1000BASE-T uses four-dimensional trellis coded modulation (TCM) to achieve a 6\u00a0dB coding gain across the four pairs.\nSince autonegotiation takes place on only two pairs, if two 1000BASE-T interfaces are connected through a cable with only two pairs, the interfaces will complete negotiation and choose gigabit as the best common operating mode, but the link will never come up because, in most cases, all four pairs are required for data communications. Most 1000BASE-T implementations have a specific register to diagnose this behavior. \nThe data is transmitted over four pairs, eight bits at a time. First, eight bits of data are expanded into four three-bit symbols through a scrambling procedure based on a linear-feedback shift register; this is similar to what is done in 100BASE-T2, but uses different parameters. The three-bit symbols are then mapped to voltage levels that vary continuously during transmission. An example mapping is as follows:\n\"Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration\" is specified as an optional feature in the 1000BASE-T standard, meaning that straight-through cables will often work between two GbE-capable network node interfaces (both MDI) and between two switch or hub interfaces (both MDI-X). This feature eliminates the need for crossover cables, making obsolete the uplink vs normal port choices and manual selector switches found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.\nIn order to extend and maximize the use of existing Cat-5e and Cat-6 cabling, the newer standards 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T operate at 2.5 and 5.0 Gbit/s, respectively, on existing copper infrastructure designed for use with 1000BASE-T. They are based on 10GBASE-T but use lower signaling frequencies.\n1000BASE-T1.\nIEEE 802.3 standardized 1000BASE-T1 in IEEE Std 802.3bp-2016. It defines Gigabit Ethernet over a single twisted pair for automotive and industrial applications. It includes cable specifications for 15\u00a0meters (type\u00a0A) or 40\u00a0meters (type\u00a0B) reach. The transmission is done using PAM-3 at 750 MBd.\n1000BASE-TX.\nIn 2001, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) created and promoted a standard similar to 1000BASE-T that was simpler to implement, calling it 1000BASE-TX (TIA/EIA-854). The simplified design would have, in theory, reduced the cost of the required electronics by only using four unidirectional pairs (two pairs TX and two pairs RX) instead of four bidirectional pairs.\n1000BASE-CX.\n802.3z-1998 CL39 standardized 1000BASE-CX is an initial standard for Gigabit Ethernet connections with maximum distances of 25 meters using balanced shielded twisted pair and either DE-9 or 8P8C connector (with a pinout different from 1000BASE-T). The short segment length is due to a very high signal transmission rate. Although it is still used for specific applications where cabling is done by IT professionals, for instance, the IBM BladeCenter uses 1000BASE-CX for the Ethernet connections between the blade servers and the switch modules, 1000BASE-T has succeeded it for general copper wiring use.\n1000BASE-KX.\n802.3ap-2007 CL70 standardized 1000BASE-KX is part of the IEEE 802.3ap standard for Ethernet Operation over Electrical Backplanes. This standard defines one to four lanes of backplane links, one RX and one TX differential pair per lane, at link bandwidth ranging from 100\u00a0Mbit to 10\u00a0Gbit per second (from 100BASE-KX to 10GBASE-KX4). The 1000BASE-KX variant uses 1.25 GBd electrical (not optical) signaling speed.\nFiber optics.\n1000BASE-X is used in industry to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission over fiber, where options include 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, 1000BASE-LX10, 1000BASE-BX10 or the non-standard -EX and -ZX implementations. Included are copper variants using the same 8b/10b line code. 1000BASE-X is based on the physical-layer standards developed for Fibre Channel.\n1000BASE-SX.\n1000BASE-SX is an optical fiber Gigabit Ethernet standard for operation over multi-mode fiber using a 770 to 860 nanometer, near infrared (NIR) light wavelength.\nThe standard specifies a maximum length of 220 meters for 62.5\u00a0\u03bcm/160\u00a0MHz\u00d7km multi-mode fiber, 275\u00a0m for 62.5\u00a0\u03bcm/200\u00a0MHz\u00d7km, 500\u00a0m for 50\u00a0\u03bcm/400\u00a0MHz\u00d7km, and 550\u00a0m for 50\u00a0\u03bcm/500\u00a0MHz\u00d7km multi-mode fiber. Fiber optic cable manufacturers have extended the reach of 1000BASE-SX to at least 1km when used with more modern fiber optic grades such as OM3 and OM4.\nThis standard is highly popular for intra-building links in large office buildings, co-location facilities and carrier-neutral Internet exchanges.\nOptical power specifications of SX interface: Minimum output power = \u22129.5\u00a0dBm. Minimum receive sensitivity = \u221217\u00a0dBm.\n1000BASE-LSX.\n1000BASE-LSX is a non-standard but industry accepted\nterm to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 1000BASE-SX but achieves longer distances up to 2\u00a0km over a pair of multi-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a SX, running on 1310\u00a0nm wavelength lasers. It is easily confused with 1000BASE-SX or 1000BASE-LX because the use of -LX, -LX10 and -SX is ambiguous between vendors. \nThe range is achieved with use of Fabry Perot laser transmitter.\n1000BASE-LX.\n1000BASE-LX is an optical fiber Gigabit Ethernet standard specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 38 which uses a long wavelength laser (1,270\u20131,355\u00a0nm), and a maximum RMS spectral width of 4\u00a0nm.\n1000BASE-LX is specified to work over a distance of up to 5\u00a0km over 10\u00a0\u03bcm single-mode fiber.\n1000BASE-LX can also run over all common types of multi-mode fiber with a maximum segment length of 550 m. For link distances greater than 300\u00a0m, the use of a special launch conditioning patch cord may be required. This launches the laser at a precise offset from the center of the fiber which causes it to spread across the diameter of the fiber core, reducing the effect known as differential mode delay which occurs when the laser couples onto only a small number of available modes in multi-mode fiber.\n1000BASE-LX10.\n1000BASE-LX10 was standardized six years after the initial gigabit fiber versions as part of the Ethernet in the first mile task group. It is practically identical to 1000BASE-LX, but achieves longer distances up to 10\u00a0km over a pair of single-mode fiber due to higher quality optics. Before it was standardized, 1000BASE-LX10 was essentially already in widespread use by many vendors as a proprietary extension called either 1000BASE-LX/LH or 1000BASE-LH.\n1000BASE-EX.\n1000BASE-EX is a non-standard but industry accepted term to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 1000BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up to 40\u00a0km over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a LX10, running on 1310\u00a0nm wavelength lasers. It is sometimes referred to as LH (Long Haul), and is easily confused with 1000BASE-LX10 or 1000BASE-ZX because the use of -LX(10), -LH, -EX, and -ZX is ambiguous between vendors. 1000BASE-ZX is a very similar non-standard longer-reach variant that uses 1550\u00a0nm wavelength optics.\n1000BASE-BX10.\n1000BASE-BX10 is capable of up to 10\u00a0km over a single strand of single-mode fiber, with a different wavelength going in each direction. The terminals on each side of the fiber are not equal, as the one transmitting downstream (from the center of the network to the outside) uses the 1490\u00a0nm wavelength, and the one transmitting upstream uses the 1310\u00a0nm wavelength. This is accomplished using a passive splitter prism inside each transceiver.\nOther, non-standard higher-powered single-strand optics commonly known as \"BiDi\" (bi-directional) utilize wavelength pairs in the 1490/1550\u00a0nm range, and are capable of reaching distances of 20, 40 and 80\u00a0km, or greater depending on module cost, fiber path loss, splices, connectors and patch panels. Very long reach BiDi optics may use 1510/1590\u00a0nm wavelength pairs.\n1000BASE-ZX.\n1000BASE-ZX is a non-standard but multi-vendor term to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission using 1,550\u00a0nm wavelength to achieve distances of at least over single-mode fiber. Some vendors specify distances up to over single-mode fiber, sometimes called 1000BASE-EZX. Ranges beyond 80\u00a0km are highly dependent upon the path loss of the fiber in use, specifically the attenuation figure in dB per km, the number and quality of connectors/patch panels and splices located between transceivers.\n1000BASE\u2011CWDM.\n1000BASE-CWDM is a non-standard but industry accepted term to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 1000BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up 40\u2013120\u00a0km, and up to 18 parallel channels over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than LX10 and use of CWDM, running on 1270-1610\u00a0nm wavelength lasers.\nUse of CWDM requires a Mux/Demux unit at both ends of the fiber link, a CWDM MUX/DEMUX with corresponding wavelengths, and SFP with corresponding wavelengths. is it also possible to DWDM in serie to increase number of channels.\nMost uses Wavelengths: 1270\u00a0nm, 1290\u00a0nm, 1310\u00a0nm, 1330\u00a0nm, 1350\u00a0nm, 1370\u00a0nm, 1390\u00a0nm, 1410\u00a0nm, 1430\u00a0nm, 1450\u00a0nm, 1470\u00a0nm, 1490\u00a0nm, 1510\u00a0nm, 1530\u00a0nm, 1550\u00a0nm, 1570\u00a0nm, 1590\u00a0nm and 1610\u00a0nm\nCWDM is cheaper to use than DWDM, about 1/5-1/3 of the cost. CWDM is about 5-10 times more expensive the if you have the fiber available, then traditional -LX/-LZ transceivers.\n1000BASE\u2011DWDM.\n1000BASE-DWDM is a non-standard but industry accepted term to refer to Gigabit Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 1000BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up 40\u2013120\u00a0km, and up to 64 to 160 parallel channels over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than LX10 and use of DWDM, running on 1528-1565\u00a0nm wavelength lasers.\nThe most used channels are CH17-61 on Wavelength 1528.77-1563-86\u00a0nm.\nTo use DWDM it is necessary to use a Mux/Demux unit on both ends of the fiber link, a DWDM MUX/DEMUX with corresponding wavelengths, and SFP with corresponding wavelengths. is it also possible to use CWDM in series to increase the number of channels.\n1000BASE-RH\"x\".\nIEEE 802.3bv-2017 defines standardizes Gigabit Ethernet over step-index plastic optical fiber (POF) using -R 64b/65b large block encoding with red light (600\u2013700\u00a0nm). 1000BASE-RHA is intended for home and consumer use (just clamping the bare POF), 1000BASE-RHB for industrial, and 1000BASE-RHC for automotive applications.\nOptical interoperability.\nThere may be optical interoperability with respective 1000BASE-X Ethernet interfaces on the same link. It is also possible with certain types of optics to have a mismatch in wavelength.\nTo achieve interoperability some criteria have to be met:\n1000BASE-X Ethernet is not backward compatible with 100BASE-X and is not forward compatible with 10GBASE-X.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All three had left Intel after working on the 4004 and 8080 microprocessors. The company's most famous product is the Z80 microprocessor, which played an important role in the evolution of early computing. Software-compatible with the Intel 8080, it offered a compelling alternative due to its lower cost and increased performance, propelling it to widespread adoption in video game systems and home computers during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nThe name, pronounced with a long \"i\" (), is an acronym of \"Z integrated logic\", also thought of as \"Z for the last word of Integrated Logic\".\nHistory.\nZilog was started in California in 1974 by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann with support and encouragement from Exxon's computing division. Both left Intel after working on the 4004 and 8080 microprocessors and custom chips. Masatoshi Shima, who also worked with Faggin on the 4004 and 8080, joined Zilog in 1975. Ungermann did not want the company to become an Exxon subsidiary and left Zilog in 1978.\nOn January 1, 1979, Zilog released the first issue of their comic book \"Captain Zilog\", which featured the Z8000 computer. The Z8000, introduced that year, was the company's first 16-bit microprocessor.\nThe company became a subsidiary of Exxon in 1980. Exxon initially acquired 51 percent of the company before buying it outright; however, the management and employees bought it back in 1989, led by Edgar Sack.\nZilog went public in 1991, but was acquired in 1998 by Texas Pacific Group for $527 million. Curtis Crawford replaced Sack and changed the company's direction towards 32-bit data communications processors.\nIn 1999, Zilog acquired Production Languages Corporation for an unspecified amount less than $10 million.\nBonds were sold against the company to fund the new developments, but after the Internet bubble burst in 2000 and the resultant reduction in customer demand for such products, Curtis Crawford was replaced by James (Jim) Thorburn, who reorganized the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2001 and refocused it on the 8- and 16-bit microcontroller market.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nEarliest logo of Zilog \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nLogo of Zilog introduced in the 1990s \nJim Thorburn led Zilog back into profitability, and by FY 2007, Zilog had $82 million in sales. During this time, the company developed the Z8 Encore! 8-bit Flash MCU and ZNEO 16-bit Flash MCU product families. In February 2007, Zilog hired Darin Billerbeck to replace Jim Thorburn as president and CEO.\nThe last year Zilog introduced any new 8-bit microcontroller products was 2007. With no new product road map, FY2008 sales fell 20% to $67.2 million. Sales fell 46% in FY2009 to $36.2 million.\nIn January 2008, Zilog declined an unsolicited proposal made by Universal Electronics Inc. to acquire the company.\nOn February 19, 2009, Zilog announced that it had sold off its 8-bit Crimzon Universal Remote Control infrared microcontroller product line, as well as its ARM9 32-bit microcontrollers, including the Zatara security microcontrollers and 15 patents, to Maxim Integrated Products. Remote control manufacturer Universal Electronics Inc. purchased all of Zilog's software and intellectual property assets related to Zilog's universal remote control business, including all ROM code, software, and database of infrared codes. Zilog sold these assets for $31 million cash.\nIn December 2009, IXYS Corporation bought the company for $62.4 million in cash, which was significantly below the market valuation of Zilog's stock at the time. Details of the acquisition have been under investigation.\nSince early 2010, Zilog has refocused on the industrial and consumer markets for motion detection, motor control, RF wireless and embedded security applications, and is currently producing a number of reference designs that integrate its 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers with IXYS power management products.\nIn February 2012, Zilog announced the release of its Z8051 family of microcontrollers and tool sets to fill a vacancy in the developer market for 8051 cores that was created when chip-maker NXP Semiconductors exited the 8051 market. Later that year, Zilog announced its ZGATE Embedded Security solution, which incorporates its eZ80F91 MCU and TCP/IP stack with an embedded firewall to offer protection against cyber threats and attacks at the chip level.\nIn August 2017, Zilog and its parent IXYS Corporation were acquired by Littelfuse Inc in exchange for $750 million in cash and stocks.\nMicroprocessors.\nZ80.\nThe Z80(i) is an improved implementation of the Intel 8080 architecture, with substantial extensions to the register model and instruction set and with added hardware interface features.\nAt introduction, the Z80 was faster, more capable, and much cheaper than the 8080. Alongside the 6502, the Z80 was one of the most popular 8-bit processors for general purpose microcomputers and other applications from the late 1970s well into the 1980s, and while modern CMOS versions of the 6502 are still in production and use today, the Z80 was discontinued in 2024. The Z80 CPU was used in the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC home computers as well as the MSX architecture and the Microbee and Tandy TRS-80 (models I, II, III, 4, and others). The CP/M-80 operating system (and its huge software library featuring hits like WordStar and dBase) was known to be \"the\" Z80 disk operating system, and its success is partly due to the popularity of the Z80. The 1985 Commodore 128 added a Z80 to the Commodore 64 hardware allowing it to run CP/M software; the Digital Equipment Corporation Rainbow 100 similarly added a Z80 to an Intel 8088-based MS-DOS computer to enable the machine to run both MS-DOS and CP/M software natively.\nThe Z80 was a common choice for creators of video games during the Golden age of arcade video games, with a Z80 powering \"Pac-Man\", dual Z80s in \"Scramble\", and three in each \"Galaga\" machine. It was the central processor for the ColecoVision game console (1982) and Sega's Master System (1986) and Game Gear (1990).\nIn the 1990s, the Z80 was the CPU of the Texas Instruments graphing calculator series, as well as being used as the secondary/support CPU in the Sega Genesis (most typically used for sound).\nOther chips.\nAfter the Z80 Zilog introduced the 16-bit Z8000 and 32-bit Z80000 processors, but these were not particularly successful, and the company refocused on the microcontroller market, producing both basic CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits/standard products (ASICs/ASSPs) built around a CPU core. As well as producing processors, Zilog has produced several other components. One of the most famous was the Zilog SCC serial communications controller as found on early Apple Macintosh, Sun SPARCstations and SPARCservers up to the SPARCstation 20.\nZilog also formed a Systems Division, which designed the Zilog System 8000, a Z8000- or Z80000-based multiuser computer system running a Unix derivative called ZEUS (Zilog Enhanced UNIX System).\nZilog attempted to enter the 32-bit microcontroller market in February 2006 with the demonstration of ARM9-based Point-Of-Sale (POS) microcontroller product line. The final product was released in 2007 called Zatara. Sales were disappointing and the entire ARM9 series was sold to Maxim Integrated Products in 2009.\nZilog also produced Zdots single board computers. It includes Zilog eZ80AcclaimPlus controller, 1MB flash memory, 512KB SRAM, 10BaseT Ethernet Controller, IrDA transceiver, 2 x 60-pin system expansion interface with full MPU bus/control signals, RJ-45 Ethernet connector. Motion detection version includes Z8 Encore! XP MCU.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is well known for his authorship of a trilogy of works, entitled \"\". He is a scholar of the information society, communication and globalization.\nCastells is a full professor of sociology at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), in Barcelona. He is also a university professor and the Wallis Annenberg Chair Professor of Communication Technology and Society at the Annenberg School of Communication, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Additionally, he is a professor emeritus of sociology and professor emeritus of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught for 24 years. He is also a fellow of St. John's College at the University of Cambridge and holds the chair of network society at Coll\u00e8ge d\u2019\u00c9tudes Mondiales, Paris.\nThe 2000\u20132014 research survey of the Social Sciences Citation Index ranks him as the world's fifth most-cited social science scholar, and the foremost-cited communication scholar.\nIn 2012, Castells was awarded the Holberg Prize, for having \"shaped our understanding of the political dynamics of urban and global economies in the network society.\" In 2013, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Sociology for \"his wide-ranging and imaginative thinking through of the implications of the great technological changes of our time.\"\nIn January 2020, he was appointed Minister of Universities in the S\u00e1nchez II Government of Spain, a position he held until his resignation in December 2021.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nManuel Castells was born on February 9, 1942, in the city of Hell\u00edn, in La Mancha region, Spain. His parents, Fernando Castells Adriaensens and Josefina Olivan Escartin were both civil servants. He also has a younger sister named Irene. The family's residence in La Mancha was short lived, as it was related to Castells' parents' work. In fact, due to the mobility of his father's career as a finance inspector, Castells' childhood was also mobile. He grew up in the cities of Madrid, Cartagena, and Valencia.\nPolitics were a part of Castells' life from an early age. He notes:\nMy parents were very good parents. It was a conservative family \u2014 very strongly conservative family. But I would say that the main thing that shaped my character besides my parents was the fact that I grew up in fascist Spain. It's difficult for people of the younger generation to realize what that means, even for the Spanish younger generation. You had actually to resist the whole environment, and to be yourself, you had to fight and to politicize yourself from the age of fifteen or sixteen.\nCastells' engagement is evident in his early opposition to Francisco Franco\u2019s semi-fascist regime. His father initially fought in its favor as a member of the Falange Party. Castells' father eventually abandoned this mentality, as he was no longer pleased with Franco's rule.\nEarly education and activism.\nCastells completed his secondary education in Barcelona. He was a strong student, and in 1958, he completed his course of study two years early, at the age of sixteen. The same year, He continued his education at the University of Barcelona, where he studied both Law and Economics.\nBeyond these subjects, Castells was also interested in literature and the theatre. However, the oppressive Franco government cracked down on students\u2019 self-expression. Theatre performances were censored and student journals were shut down. This motivated Castells to join the anti-Franco movement in 1960 at age 18. He was one of very few students to engage in this kind of activism, largely because it was highly illegal and dangerous. Secrecy was imperative. Castells joined an opposition group of diverse ideologies called the Workers Front of Catalonia. From there, he coupled his formal education with copious amounts of reading to supplement his activism. Among many other topics, Castells involved himself in the exploration of Marxist and anarchist theory. In May 1962, Castells' activism led him to participate in a strike. Its goal was to protest the iron-fisted government and stand in solidarity with exploited miners in the Asturias region of Spain. This resulted in many of Castells' friends being arrested and beaten. Fortunately, Castells was able to escape to France, but without the social support he had access to in Spain. As a result, he was not able to complete his degree at the University of Barcelona. Following his escape, a fellow resistance member assisted him in achieving political refugee status, and he travelled to Paris.\nIn Paris, at the age of 20, he completed his degree, and then progressed to the University of Paris, where he earned a doctorate in Sociology. Castells graduated from the Sorbonne in 1964 and received his PhD from the University of Paris in 1967.\nCatalan identity.\nCastells identifies as Catalan largely because of his connection to Barcelona, which is recognized as the center of the Catalan movement for independence. He spent a large portion of his adolescence there, completing his secondary and beginning his college education at the University of Barcelona. Castells also traces his paternal lineage to the city. This aspect of Castells' identity is related to his resistance to Franco's oppressive regime. The Catalan language was not taught at school under Franco, and Castells' family, being from a Spanish speaking region of Spain, therefore did not speak it. However, he took the initiative to teach the language to himself while at University, which he states has helped him feel more connected to his Catalan identity. Castells is a Catalan nationalist, but not a separatist. He has expressed support for the Catalan Socialist Party.\nAcademic career.\nAt the age of twenty-four, Castells became an instructor in several Parisian universities, and would teach from 1967 to 1979. First, he taught at the Paris X University Nanterre (where he taught Daniel Cohn-Bendit). He was terminated from this position as a result of the 1968 student protests. He then taught at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales from 1970 to 1979.\nIn 1979, the University of California, Berkeley appointed him as Professor of Sociology, and Professor of City and Regional Planning. In 2001, he was a research professor at the UOC-Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia), Barcelona. Then, in 2003, he joined the University of Southern California (USC) Annenberg School for Communication, as a professor of Communication and the first Wallis Annenberg-endowed Chair of Communication and Technology. Castells is a founding member of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, and a senior member of the diplomacy center's Faculty Advisory Council and is a member of the http://.\nCastells divides his residence between Spain and the US. Since 2008, he has been a member of the governing board of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. He has been the minister of universities in Spain since January 2020 until December 2021.\nTheoretical contributions.\nThe sociological work of Manuel Castells synthesizes empirical research literature with combinations of urban sociology, organization studies, internet studies, social movements, sociology of culture, and political economy. About the origins of the network society, he posits that changes to the network form of enterprise predate the electronic internet technologies (usually) associated with network organization forms (cf. Organization theory (Castells)).\nInformation Age.\nCastells' most well-known work is a trilogy of books, entitled \"\". Overall, it comprehends three sociological dimensions\u2014production, power, and experience\u2014stressing that the organization of the economy, of the state and its institutions, and the ways that people create meaning in their lives through collective action, are irreducible sources of social dynamics\u2014that must be understood as both discrete and inter-related entities.\nThe \"Information Age\" trilogy is his pr\u00e9cis: \"Our societies are increasingly structured around the bipolar opposition of the Net (social network) and the Self\"; the \"Social network\" denotes the network organizations replacing vertically integrated hierarchies as the dominant form of social organization, the Self denotes the practices a person uses in reaffirming social identity and meaning in a continually changing cultural landscape. In other words, Castells' theory of the Information Age explores the dissonance between \u201cuniversal, digital language,\u201d and individual, even local identities. Our physical selves exist in different places and experience different cultures, but the mind has essentially migrated into the world of the internet and the television. They exist in a \u201cglobal space of instant information\".\nCastells maintains that the Information Age can \"unleash the power of the mind\", which would dramatically increase the productivity of individuals and lead to greater leisure, allowing individuals to achieve \"greater spiritual depth and more environmental consciousness\". Such change would be positive, he argues, in that it would cause resource consumption to decrease.\nCastells also became an established cybernetic culture theoretician with his Internet development analysis stressing the roles of the state (military and academic), social movements (computer hackers and social activists), and business, in shaping the economic infrastructure according to their (conflicting) interests.\nInformationalism.\nCastells' concepts of The Information Age, The Age of Consumption, and The Network Society are all perspectives attempting to describe modern life as it is known in the present and to depict the future of society. As Castells suggests, contemporary society may be described as \"replacing the antiquated metaphor of the \"machine\" with that of the \"network\"\". Put simply, this quote exemplifies Castells' concept of \u201cInformationalism.\u201d He asserts that from the 1970s to the present day, informational technology has allowed large businesses, organizations, and social structures in general to form global networks. The world is growing away from industrialism, which is focused on economic growth. Informationalism strives to develop knowledge and create massive networks. This theory is, of course, related to the growth of capitalism. As networks grow larger, the state gradually plays a smaller role in the capitalist system. Common systems of information have begun to replace it. They act as a connector between networks that may very likely be on opposite sides of the globe.\nIt is important to note, however, that this development does not come without some level of exclusion. For certain areas of the globe that are not as connected with mainstream society and massive international networks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep pace with the expansion of capitalism. Excluded communities respond by developing their own systems, which are often based in illicit economic activity. These illicit economic activities illustrate another of Castells' points, that resistance to globalization is a result of the development of the information age. He explains this using an example:\nWell, if I have no value for these global networks of power, finance, technology, then I build my own value, my own system. I build my family. I build my nation. I build my God. And, if I am not listened to, then I will become more and more enraged.\nMarxism.\nIn the 1970s, as a still-growing intellectual, Castells centered his research and intellectual processes around the works of Karl Marx because he, \u201cfelt the need to communicate to the world of political change through its language \u2013 Marxism.\" Castells developed his ideas by studying the works of several Marxists, including Louis Althusser. Althusser utilized a structuralist perspective in his works, which may also be seen in some of Castells' earliest publications. For example, \"The Urban Question: A Marxist Approach\" was originally published (in French) in 1972, and is a major development in the field of urban sociology. This work emphasizes the role of social movements in the conflictive transformation of the city (cf. post-industrial society). Castells emphasizes that problems within cities do not exist in a social vacuum, and that they must be contextualized to be appropriately analyzed.\nCastells also introduced the concept of \"collective consumption\" (public transport, public housing, etc.) comprehending a wide range of social struggles\u2014displaced from the economic stratum to the political stratum via state intervention.\nCastells no longer identifies as a Marxist. This shift in ideology occurred when he realized that the concepts he was interested in exploring could not be appropriately evaluated by Marxism. Marxism uses class as its major lens for examining social life, and Castells had become interested in ideas that could not be understood by considering class alone. By moving away from Marxism, Castells could explore the concepts of gender, urban social movements, and nationality in a more thoughtful way. He is still interested in ideas that are related to Marxism, such as social change, power relations, and technology, but has broadened his scope of how he approaches them as topics. Castells has said that he prefers to think of theory as a tool, and Marxism is simply a tool that he uses less now. He has not renounced Marx, but has chosen different tools to analyze the social world with. The following quote exemplifies the expansion of Castells' theoretical paradigm.\nWhen I left Spain again to go to Berkeley, I was no longer interested in correct answers but in relevant questions. I became more political when I left Marxism. I left the Parisian salons with wonderful categories that had nothing to do with reality and started relying more on my own observations.\nTranscending Marxist structures in the early 1980s, he concentrated upon the role of new technologies in the restructuring of an economy. In 1989, he introduced the concept of the \"space of flows\", the material and immaterial components of global information networks used for the real-time, long-distance co-ordination of the economy.\nIn the 1990s, he combined his two research strands in ', published as a trilogy, ' (1996), \"The Power of Identity\" (1997), and \"End of Millennium\" (1998); two years later, its worldwide, favourable critical acceptance in university seminars, prompted publication of a second (2000) edition that is 40 per cent different from the first (1996) edition.\nCritical responses to Castells.\nOver the years, Castells' work has been met with several noteworthy critiques. Some criticisms of Castells' work compare his ideas to functionalism, in that they include some \u201cabstract system-building.\u201d In other words, there is a certain level of inattention to individuals, while sweeping generalizations are made about society. Additionally, Castells' work includes observations about the intense global influence of informationalism. There is some discrepancy about how much of the globe is truly \u201cdominated\u201d by expansive informational networks. The global population is so diverse that there are many exceptions to the idea of complete global domination. These information networks have the potential to be useful \u201cideal types\u201d for studying global relations, but one should exercise caution when using them to model the real world. Castells has also been criticized for the conservatism that appears within his theories. He has noted that there is \u201clittle chance of social change\u201d within the network society. This reveals a thought process that supports the status quo, which can be a problem for social change and justice movements. Related to this criticism, some scholars have found it peculiar that while Castells' theorizes quite a bit about global connection, he does not explore the potential of those global connections to establish an international system for the protection of human rights and cultural difference.\nPublications.\nManuel Castells is one of the world's most often-cited social science and communications scholars. Castells is a sole author of 23 books and editor or co-editor of fifteen more, as well as over one hundred articles in academic journals. The trilogy, The Information Age, has been compared to the work of Karl Marx and Max Weber. It took him fifteen years to conduct research for the trilogy.\nBooks\nJournal \u03b1rticles\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A scholarly estimate of 's age dates the poem to between 900 and 1000 A.D. The poem, itself a combination of numerous shorter poems, is largely gnomic, presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom. It is considered an important source of Old Norse philosophy.\nThe verses are attributed to Odin; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.\nFor the most part composed in the metre , a metre associated with wisdom verse, is both practical and philosophical in content.\nFollowing the gnomic \" proper\" comes the , an account of how Odin won the runes, and the , a list of magic chants or spells.\nName.\nThe Old Norse name is a compound of the genitive form of , which is the inflexionally weak form of Odin's name ('High One'), and the plural noun (from older ), and means 'Song (or Words) of the High One'.\nTextual history.\nThe only surviving source for is the 13th century Codex Regius, with the exception of two short parts. The part dealing with ethical conduct (the ) was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century.\nBellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a \"collection of proverbs and wise counsels\" which dates to \"a very early time\", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent.\nTo the gnomic core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century.\nIndividual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the line ('cattle die, kinsmen die') found in verses 76 and 77 of the can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the by .

In the following, Bellow's numeration is used.\nThe poems in is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts,\nStanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of \"commentary\".

Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on manners and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred lore of reciprocity and hospitality to the Norse pagans.\nThe first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nNumber 77 is possibly the most known section of :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nOn women.\nStanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of romantic love and the character of women.\nIt is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84\u201395, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as \"Odin's Examples\" or \"Odin's Love Quests\". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of Billing (stanzas 96\u2013102), followed by the story of the mead of poetry which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden Gunnl\u00f6\u00f0 (stanzas 103\u2013110).\nThe (stanzas 111\u2013138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct.

The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the crucifixion of Christ as narrated in the gospels.\nThe parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co-existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) also appears in other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of human sacrifice offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, has been discussed by scholars such as Sophus Bugge.\nThe persistence of Odin's self-sacrifice in Scandinavian folk tradition was documented by Bugge (1889) in a poem from Unst on the Shetland Islands:\n\"Nine days he hang' pa de r\u00fctless tree;\"\n\"For ill wis da folk, in' g\u00fcd wis he.\"\n\"A bl\u00fcdy mael wis in his side \u2014\"\n\"Made wi' a lance \u2014 'at wid na hide.\"\n\"Nine lang nichts, i' de nippin rime,\"\n\"Hang he dare wi' his naeked limb.\"\n\"Some dey leuch;\"\n\"Bid idders gret\".\nThe last section, the enumerates 18 songs (), sometimes called \"charms\", prefaced with (stanza 147):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThe songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described.\nThey are explicitly counted from \"the first\" in stanza 147, and \"a second\" to \"an eighteenth\" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.\nThere is no explicit mention of runes or runic magic in the excepting in\nthe twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nNevertheless, because of the preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the as referring to runes, specifically with the 16 letters of the Younger Futhark.\nM\u00fcllenhoff takes the original to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions.\nInfluence.\nSveinbj\u00f6rn Beinteinsson, leader of the Icelandic , published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the , chanted in r\u00edmur style. \nThe opera \"Gunl\u00f6d\" by Peter Cornelius takes its plot from the ; detailing Odin's theft of the mead of poetry.\nThe German viking-pagan metal band Falkenbach formed in 1989 and recorded their first demo, titled , and incorporate lines from the poem into lyrics.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The city is governed by Toronto City Council, a unicameral body whose members are elected every four years. City council is composed of 25 councillors, who each represent a geographical ward, and the mayor of Toronto who serves as head of council and the chief executive officer of the municipal government.\nToronto is Canada's largest financial centre, and is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism. In 2022, a \"New York Times\" columnist listed Toronto as the third largest tech hub in North America, after the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City. Toronto is also a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 26\u00a0million visitors each year.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Toronto\" has been recorded with various spellings in French and English, including \"Tarento\", \"Tarontha\", \"Taronto\", \"Toranto\", \"Torento\", \"Toronto\", and \"Toronton\". The most frequent early spelling, \"Taronto\", referred to 'The Narrows', a channel of water through which Lake Simcoe discharges into Lake Couchiching where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish at what is now the Mnjikaning Fish Weirs site in Orillia. This narrows was called by the Mohawk, meaning 'where there are trees standing in the water', and was recorded as early as 1615 by Samuel de Champlain. The word \"Toronto\", meaning 'plenty', also appears in a 1632 French lexicon of the Huron language, which is also an Iroquoian language. It also appears on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, known as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological sites show evidence of human occupation in the site that will later become Toronto dating back thousands of years. The Wendat, an Iroquoian speaking people, occupied the territory that will become Toronto for centuries from pre-European contact until the invasion and massacre by the Haudenosaunee from the south side of Lake Ontario between 1648 and 1650. By the 1660s, the Haudenosaunee established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon (Bead Hill) on the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the Mississaugas, an Anishinaabe speaking people from Northern Ontario, had displaced the Haudenosaunee, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars, with most returning to their homeland in present-day New York state.\nFrench traders founded Fort Rouill\u00e9 in 1750 (the current Exhibition grounds were later developed there), but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The British defeated the French and their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in 1763.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, an influx of British settlers arrived there as United Empire Loyalists fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them land to compensate for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies. The new province of Upper Canada was being created and needed a capital. In 1787, the British Lord Dorchester arranged for the Toronto Purchase with the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a million acres (1000\u00a0km2) of land in the Toronto area. Dorchester intended the location to be named Toronto. The first 25 years after the Toronto purchase were quiet, although \"there were occasional independent fur traders\" present in the area, with the usual complaints of debauchery and drunkenness.\nIn 1793, Governor John Graves Simcoe established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, naming it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York, believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the United States. The York garrison was built at the entrance of the town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula. The town's settlement formed at the harbour's eastern end behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of Parliament Street and Front Street (in the \"Old Town\" area).\n19th century.\nIn 1813, as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of York ended in the town's capture and plunder by United States forces. John Strachan negotiated the town's surrender. American soldiers destroyed much of the garrison and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation. Because of the sacking of York, British troops retaliated later in the war with the burning of Washington, D.C.\nThe University of Toronto, then known as King's College, was established in 1827 as the first institution of higher education in Upper Canada.\nYork was incorporated as the City of Toronto on March 6, 1834, adopting the Indigenous name. Reformist politician William Lyon Mackenzie became the first mayor of Toronto. Mackenzie would later lead the unsuccessful Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 against the British colonial government.\nToronto's population of 9,000 included some African-American slaves, some of whom had been brought by the Loyalists, and Black Loyalists, whom the Crown had freed (most of the latter were resettled in Nova Scotia). By 1834, refugee slaves from America's South were also immigrating to Toronto to gain freedom. Slavery was banned outright in Upper Canada (and throughout the British Empire) in 1834. Torontonians integrated people of colour into their society. In the 1840s, an eating house at Frederick and King Streets, a place of mercantile prosperity in the early city, was operated by a black man named Bloxom.\nAs a major destination for immigrants to Canada, the city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century. The first significant wave of immigrants were Irish, fleeing the Great Irish Famine; most of them were Catholic. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. The Scottish and English population welcomed smaller numbers of Protestant Irish immigrants, some from what is now Northern Ireland, which gave the Orange Order significant and long-lasting influence over Toronto society. Almost every mayor of Toronto was a member of the Orange Order between 1850 and 1950, and the city was sometimes referred to as the \"Belfast of Canada\" because of Orange influence in municipal politics and administration.\nFor brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united Province of Canada: first from 1849 to 1851, following unrest in Montreal, and later from 1855 to 1859. After this date, Quebec was designated as the capital until 1865 (two years before Canadian Confederation). Since then, the capital of Canada has remained Ottawa, Ontario.\nToronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867. The seat of government of the Ontario briefly returned to the same building that hosted the Third Parliament Building of Upper Canada, before moving to the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen's Park in 1893. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of Government House, the residence of the viceregal representative of the Crown in right of Ontario.\nLong before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a three-month-long military course at the School of Military Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in 1864, the school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company, and the duties of a company's officer. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, schools of cavalry and artillery instruction were formed in Toronto.\nIn the 19th century, the city built an extensive sewage system to improve sanitation, and streets were illuminated with gas lighting as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The Grand Trunk Railway and the Northern Railway of Canada joined in the building of the first Union Station in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before. These enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in northern timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal. Industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years.\nDuring the late 19th century, Toronto became the largest alcohol distillation (in particular, spirits) centre in North America. A distillery built by Gooderham and Worts from 1959 to 1961 became the country's largest whisky factory. While the factory has since closed, its buildings have been designated a National Historic Site and have been converted into the Distillery District. The harbour allowed access to grain and sugar imports used in processing.\nHorse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891 when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the Toronto Railway Company. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the Toronto Transportation Commission, later renamed the Toronto Transit Commission. The system now has the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.\n20th century.\nThe Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto. The fire destroyed more than 100 buildings. The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from the fire. It caused CA$ in damage (roughly CA$ in 2020 terms).\nThe city received new European immigrant groups from the late 19th century into the early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews. They were soon followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to the Chinese entering from the West. Like the Irish before them, many of these migrants lived in overcrowded shanty-type slums, such as \"the Ward\", which was centred on Bay Street, now the heart of the country's Financial District.\nAs new migrants began to prosper, they moved to better housing in other areas, in what is now understood to be succession waves of settlement. Despite its fast-paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established Montreal, Quebec. However, by 1934, the Toronto Stock Exchange had become the largest in the country.\nIn 1954, the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a regional government known as Metropolitan Toronto. The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development. It was believed a coordinated land-use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including highways, police services, water and public transit. In that year, a half-century after the Great Fire of 1904, disaster struck the city again when Hurricane Hazel brought intense winds and flash flooding. In the Toronto area, 81 people were killed, nearly 1,900 families were left homeless, and the hurricane caused more than CA$ in damage.\nIn 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged with larger neighbours, resulting in a six-municipality configuration that included the former city of Toronto and the surrounding municipalities of East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, and York.\nIn the decades after World War II, refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began and doubled to two million by 1971. Following the elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, Toronto became a destination for immigrants from all over the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and Western Canadian cities.\nOn January 1, 1998, Toronto was greatly enlarged, not through traditional annexations, but as an amalgamation of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier constituent municipalities: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the original city itself. They were dissolved by an act of the Government of Ontario and formed into a single-tier City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the \"megacity\"), replacing all six governments.\nThe merger was proposed as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under premier Mike Harris. The announcement touched off vociferous public objections. In March 1997, a referendum in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3:1 against amalgamation. However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments, and referendums have little to no legal effect. The Harris government could thus legally ignore the referendum results and did so in April when it tabled the \"City of Toronto Act\". Both opposition parties held a filibuster in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity to take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets. This only delayed the bill's inevitable passage, given the Progressive Conservatives' majority.\nNorth York mayor Mel Lastman became the first \"megacity\" mayor, and the 62nd mayor of Toronto, with his electoral victory. Lastman gained national attention after multiple snowstorms, including the January Blizzard of 1999, dumped of snow and effectively immobilized the city. He called in the Canadian Army to aid snow removal by use of their equipment to augment police and emergency services. The move was ridiculed by some in other parts of the country, fuelled in part by what was perceived as a frivolous use of resources.\n21st century.\nThe city attracted international attention in 2003 when it became the centre of a major SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. Public health attempts to prevent the disease from spreading elsewhere temporarily dampened the local economy. From August 14 to 17, 2003, the city was hit by a massive blackout which affected millions of Torontonians (it also affected most of Southern Ontario and parts of the United States), stranding some hundreds of people in tall buildings, knocking out traffic lights and suspending subway and streetcar service across the city during those aforementioned days.\nOn March 6, 2009, the city celebrated the 175th anniversary of its inception as the City of Toronto in 1834. Toronto hosted the 4th G20 summit during June 26\u201327, 2010. This included the largest security operation in Canadian history. Following large-scale protests and rioting, law enforcement arrested more than 1,000 people, the largest mass arrest in Canadian history.\nOn July 8, 2013, severe flash flooding hit Toronto after an afternoon of slow-moving, intense thunderstorms. Toronto Hydro estimated 450,000 people were without power after the storm and Toronto Pearson International Airport reported of rain had fallen over five hours, more than during Hurricane Hazel. Within six months, from December 20 to 22, 2013, Toronto was brought to a near halt by the worst ice storm in the city's history, rivalling the severity of the 1998 Ice Storm (which mainly affected southeastern Ontario, and Quebec). At the height of the storm, over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating. Toronto hosted WorldPride in June 2014, and the Pan and Parapan American Games in 2015.\nThe city continues to grow and attract immigrants. A 2019 study by Toronto Metropolitan University (then known as Ryerson University) showed that Toronto was the fastest-growing city in North America. The city added 77,435 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The Toronto metropolitan area was the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons, compared with 131,767 in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington metroplex in Texas. The large growth in the Toronto metropolitan area is attributed to international migration to Toronto.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Canada first occurred in Toronto and was among the hotspots in the country.\nToronto was named as one of 16 cities in North America (and one of two Canadian cities) to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nGeography.\nToronto covers an area of , with a maximum north\u2013south distance of . It has a maximum east\u2013west distance of , and it has a long waterfront shoreline, on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The Toronto Islands and Port Lands extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered Toronto Harbour south of the downtown core. An Outer Harbour was constructed southeast of downtown during the 1950s and 1960s, and it is now used for recreation. The city's limits are formed by Lake Ontario to the south, the western boundary of Marie Curtis Park, Etobicoke Creek, Eglinton Avenue and Highway 427 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the north and the Rouge River and the Scarborough\u2013Pickering Townline to the east.\nTopography.\nThe city is mostly flat or gentle hills, and the land gently slopes upward away from the lake. The flat land is interrupted by the Toronto ravine system, which is cut by numerous creeks and rivers of the Toronto waterway system, most notably the Humber River in the west end, the Don River east of downtown (these two rivers flanking and defining the Toronto Harbour), and the Rouge River at the city's eastern limits. Most of the ravines and valley lands in Toronto today are parklands and recreational trails are laid out along the ravines and valleys. The original town was laid out in a grid plan on the flat plain north of the harbour, and this plan was extended outwards as the city grew. The width and depth of several of the ravines and valleys are such that several grid streets, such as Finch Avenue, Leslie Street, Lawrence Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue, terminate on one side of a ravine or valley and continue on the other side. Toronto has many bridges spanning the ravines. Large bridges such as the Prince Edward Viaduct were built to span broad river valleys.\nDespite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but its elevation does increase steadily away from the lake. Elevation differences range from above sea level at the Lake Ontario shore to above sea level near the York University grounds in the city's north end at the intersection of Keele Street and Steeles Avenue. There are occasional hilly areas; in particular, midtown Toronto, as well as the Silverthorn and Fairbank neighbourhoods, have several sharply sloping hills. Lake Ontario remains occasionally visible from the peaks of these ridges as far north as Eglinton Avenue, inland.\nThe other major geographical feature of Toronto is its escarpments. During the last ice age, the lower part of Toronto was beneath Glacial Lake Iroquois. Today, a series of escarpments mark the lake's former boundary, known as the \"Iroquois Shoreline\". The escarpments are most prominent from Victoria Park Avenue to the mouth of Highland Creek, where they form the Scarborough Bluffs. Other observable sections include the area near St. Clair Avenue West between Bathurst Street and the Don River, and north of Davenport Road from Caledonia to Spadina Road; the Casa Loma grounds sit above this escarpment.\nThe geography of the lakeshore has dramatically changed since the first settlement of Toronto. Much of the land on the harbour's north shore is landfill, filled in during the late 19th century. Until then, the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back farther inland than today. Much of the adjacent Port Lands on the harbour's east side was a wetland filled in early in the 20th century. The shoreline from the harbour west to the Humber River has been extended into the lake. Further west, landfill has been used to create extensions of land such as Humber Bay Park.\nThe Toronto Islands were a natural peninsula until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland, creating a channel to the harbour. The peninsula was formed by longshore drift taking the sediments deposited along the Scarborough Bluffs shore and transporting them to the Islands area.\nThe other source of sediment for the Port Lands wetland and the peninsula was the deposition of the Don River, which carved a wide valley through the sedimentary land of Toronto and deposited it in the shallow harbour. The harbour and the channel of the Don River have been dredged numerous times for shipping. The lower section of the Don River was straightened and channelled in the 19th century. The former mouth drained into a wetland; today, the Don River drains into the harbour through a concrete waterway, the Keating Channel. To mitigate flooding in the area, as well as to create parkland, a second more natural mouth was built to the south during the first half of the 2020s, thereby creating a new island, Ookwemin Minising.\nNeighbourhoods and former municipalities.\nToronto encompasses an area formerly administered by several separate municipalities that were amalgamated over the years. Each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city, there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\nThe many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from the skyscrapers in the commercial core. Victorian and Edwardian-era residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as Rosedale, Cabbagetown, The Annex, and Yorkville. The Wychwood Park neighbourhood, historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities, was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985. The Casa Loma neighbourhood is named after \"Casa Loma\", a castle built in 1911 by Sir Henry Pellat, complete with gardens, turrets, stables, an elevator, secret passages, and a bowling alley. Spadina House is a 19th-century manor that is now a museum.\nOld Toronto.\nThe pre-amalgamation City of Toronto covers the downtown core and older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and north. It is the most densely populated part of the city. The Financial District contains the First Canadian Place, Toronto-Dominion Centre, Scotia Plaza, Royal Bank Plaza, Commerce Court and Brookfield Place. This area includes, among others, the neighbourhoods of St. James Town, Garden District, St. Lawrence, Corktown, and Church and Wellesley. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street.\nOld Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as Yorkville, Rosedale, The Annex, Forest Hill, Lawrence Park, Lytton Park, Deer Park, Moore Park, and Casa Loma, most stretching away from downtown to the north.\nEast and west of downtown, neighbourhoods such as Kensington Market, Chinatown, Leslieville, Cabbagetown and Riverdale are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as communities of artists with studio lofts, with many middle- and upper-class professionals.\nOther neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two smaller Chinatowns, the Greektown area, Little Italy, Portugal Village, and Little India, among others.\nSuburbs.\nThe inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of York and East York. These are mature and traditionally working-class areas, consisting primarily of post\u2013World War I small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks. Neighbourhoods such as Crescent Town, Thorncliffe Park, Flemingdon Park, Weston, and Oakwood Village consist mainly of high-rise apartments, which are home to many new immigrant families. During the 2000s, many neighbourhoods became ethnically diverse and underwent gentrification due to increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and the early 21st century. The first neighbourhoods affected were Leaside and North Toronto, gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York.\nThe outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of Etobicoke (west), Scarborough (east) and North York (north) largely retain the grid plan laid before post-war development. Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the emergence of metropolitan government, existing towns or villages such as Mimico, Islington and New Toronto in Etobicoke; Willowdale, Newtonbrook and Downsview in North York; Agincourt, Wexford and West Hill in Scarborough where suburban development boomed around or between these and other towns beginning in the late 1940s. Upscale neighbourhoods were built, such as the Bridle Path in North York, the area surrounding the Scarborough Bluffs in Guildwood, and most of central Etobicoke, such as Humber Valley Village, and The Kingsway. One of the largest and earliest \"planned communities\" was Don Mills, parts of which were first built in the 1950s. Phased development, mixing single-detached housing with higher-density apartment blocks, became more popular as a suburban model of development. During the late 20th century, North York City Centre and Scarborough City Centre developed separate downtown districts outside Downtown Toronto after the former boroughs were promoted to cities. High-rise development in these areas has given these former municipalities distinguishable skylines of their own, with high-density transit corridors serving them; some of these developments are also transit-oriented.\nIndustrial.\nIn the 1800s, a thriving industrial area developed around Toronto Harbour and the lower Don River mouth, linked by rail and water to Canada and the United States. Examples included the Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Canadian Malting Company, the Toronto Rolling Mills, the Union Stockyards and the Davies pork processing facility (the inspiration for the \"Hogtown\" nickname). This industrial area expanded west along the harbour and rail lines and was supplemented by the infilling of the marshlands on the east side of the harbour to create the Port Lands. A garment industry developed along lower Spadina Avenue, the \"Fashion District\". Beginning in the late 19th century, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts, such as West Toronto / The Junction, where the Stockyards relocated in 1903. The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed a large amount of industry in the downtown. Some companies moved west along King Street, and some moved as far west as Dufferin Street, where the large Massey-Harris farm equipment manufacturing complex was located. Over time, pockets of industrial land mostly followed rail lines and later highway corridors as the city grew outwards. This trend continues to this day; the largest factories and distribution warehouses are in the suburban environs of Peel and York Regions, but also within the current city: Etobicoke (concentrated around Pearson Airport), North York, and Scarborough.\nMany of Toronto's former industrial sites close to (or in) downtown have been redeveloped, including parts of the Toronto waterfront, the rail yards west of downtown, and Liberty Village, the Massey-Harris district and large-scale development is underway in the West Don Lands.\nThe Gooderham &amp; Worts Distillery produced spirits until 1990 and is preserved today as the \"Distillery District\", the largest and best-preserved collection of Victorian industrial architecture in North America. Some industry remains in the area, including the Redpath Sugar Refinery. Similar areas that retain their industrial character but are now largely residential are the Fashion District, Corktown, and parts of South Riverdale and Leslieville. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as Brockton Village, Mimico and New Toronto. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the Weston/Mount Dennis and The Junction areas still contain factories, meat-packing facilities and rail yards close to medium-density residential. However, the Junction's Union Stockyards moved out of Toronto in 1994.\nThe brownfield industrial area of the Port Lands, on the east side of the harbour, is one area planned for redevelopment. Formerly a marsh that was filled in to create industrial space, it was never intensely developed\u2014its land unsuitable for large-scale development\u2014because of flooding and unstable soil.\nIt still contains numerous industrial uses, such as the Portlands Energy Centre power plant, port facilities, movie and television production studios, concrete processing facilities, and low-density industrial facilities. The Waterfront Toronto agency has developed plans for a naturalized mouth to the Don River and to create a flood barrier around the Don, making more of the land on the harbour suitable for higher-value residential and commercial development.\nA former chemicals plant site along the Don River is slated to become a large commercial complex and transportation hub.\nArchitecture.\nToronto's buildings vary in design and age, with many structures dating back to the early 19th century, while other prominent buildings were just newly built in the first decade of the 21st century. Lawrence Richards, a member of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Toronto, has said, \"Toronto is a new, brash, rag-tag place\u2014a big mix of periods and styles.\" Bay-and-gable houses, mainly found in Old Toronto, are a distinct architectural feature of the city.\nToronto is a city with a substantial amount of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. The city has 106 skyscrapers taller than , the 16th-most in the world and the most in Canada by far. There are currently three \"supertall\" skyscrapers (taller than ) under construction in the city, and more have been approved. Defining the Toronto skyline is the CN Tower, a telecommunications and tourism hub. Completed in 1976 at a height of , it was the world's tallest freestanding structure until 2007 when it was surpassed by Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, significant pieces of Toronto's architectural heritage were demolished to make way for redevelopment or parking. In contrast, since 2000, amid the Canadian property bubble, Toronto has experienced a condo construction boom and architectural revival, with several buildings opened by world-renowned architects. Daniel Libeskind's Royal Ontario Museum addition, Frank Gehry's remake of the Art Gallery of Ontario, and Will Alsop's distinctive OCAD University expansion are among the city's new showpieces. The mid-1800s Distillery District, on the eastern edge of downtown, has been redeveloped into a pedestrian-oriented arts, culture and entertainment neighbourhood. This construction boom has some observers call the phenomenon the Manhattanization of Toronto after the densely built island borough of New York City.\nClimate.\nThe city of Toronto has a hot summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfa\"), though was on the threshold of a warm summer humid continental climate (\"Dfb\") until the 20th century due to the urban heat island but still found in the metropolitan region, with warm, humid summers and cold winters. According to the classification applied by Natural Resources Canada, the city of Toronto is in plant hardiness zone 7a. Some suburbs and nearby towns have lower zone ratings.\nThe city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons. Owing to urbanization and its proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range. The denser urbanscape makes for warmer nights year-round; the average nighttime temperature is about warmer in the city than in rural areas in all months. However, it can be noticeably cooler on many spring and early summer afternoons under the influence of a lake breeze, since Lake Ontario is cool relative to the air during these seasons. These lake breezes mostly occur in summer, bringing relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include lake-effect snow, fog, and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as seasonal lag.\nWinters are cold, with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below . Toronto winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below , often made to feel colder by wind chill. Occasionally, they can drop below . Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules while accumulating snow can fall anytime from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches also occur in most winters, melting accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures. Daytime temperatures are usually above , and often rise above . However, they can occasionally surpass accompanied by high humidity. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods. Daytime temperatures average around during these seasons.\nPrecipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. The average yearly precipitation is , with an average annual snowfall of . Toronto experiences an average of 2,066 sunshine hours or 45 per cent of daylight hours, varying between a low of 28 per cent in December to 60 per cent in July.\nClimate change has affected Toronto, and as a consequence, the Toronto City Council declared a climate emergency, setting a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2040 through the TransformTO climate action plan.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Toronto was on July 8, 9 and 10, 1936, during the 1936 North American heat wave. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on January 10, 1859.\nParks.\nToronto has diverse public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking ravines. Nathan Phillips Square is the city's main square in downtown, contains the Toronto Sign, and forms the entrance to City Hall. Sankofa Square, near City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include Maple Leaf Square, next to Scotiabank Arena, and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably Mel Lastman Square in North York.\nThere are many large downtown parks, which include Allan Gardens, Christie Pits, Grange Park, Little Norway Park, Moss Park, Queen's Park, Riverdale Park and Trinity Bellwoods Park. An almost-hidden park is the compact Cloud Gardens, which has both open areas and a glassed-in greenhouse, near Queen Street and Yonge Street.

The total number of homicides dropped to 70 in 2006; that year, nearly 2,000 people in Toronto were victims of a violent gun-related crime, about one-quarter of the national total. 86 homicides were committed in 2007, roughly half of which involved guns. Gang-related incidents have also been on the rise; between 1997 and 2005, over 300 gang-related homicides have occurred. As a result, the Ontario government developed an anti-gun strategy. In 2011, Toronto's murder rate plummeted to 51 murders\u2014nearly a 26% drop from the previous year. The 51 homicides were the lowest number the city has recorded since 1999 when there were 47. While subsequent years did see a return to higher rates, it remained nearly flat line of 57\u201359 homicides in from 2012 to 2015. 2016 went to 75 for the first time in over eight years. 2017 had a drop off of 10 murders to close the year at 65, with a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 population.\nThe total number of homicides in Toronto reached a record 98 in 2018; the number included fatalities from the Toronto van attack and the Danforth shooting, which gave the city a homicide rate of around 3.6 per 100,000 people. The record year for murders was previously 1991, with 89, at a rate of 3.9 murders per 100,000 people. The 2018 homicide rate was higher than in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, Hamilton, New York City, San Diego, and Austin. Homicides in 2019 dropped to 80 (a rate of 2.9 per 100,000 people) below the rate of most US cities, but still higher than the Canadian average of 1.8. Shooting incidents also increased to an all-time high of 492 in 2019, even outpacing gun incidents that occurred in 2018. 2020 saw another decrease in homicides with the city having a total of 71 murders for the year (a rate of around 2.6 per 100,000 people). However, in 2021, the city saw an increase in homicides, with the city murders increasing to 85, giving Toronto a homicide rate of 3.04 per 100,000 people. A decrease in murders happened the following year with 71 being reported in 2022 (a murder rate of 2.5 per 100,000), which was then followed by a slight increase in homicides with 73 being reported in 2023, giving the city a murder rate of 2.6 per 100,000 people, along with a record 12,143 reports of auto theft in the year. 2024 saw another increase in homicides with 85 being reported in the year, giving the city a homicide rate of around 3.04 per 100,000 people.\nTransportation.\nToronto is a central transportation hub for road, rail, and air networks in Southern Ontario. The city has many forms of transport, including highways and public transit. Toronto also has an extensive network of bicycle lanes and multi-use trails and paths.\nPublic transportation.\nToronto's primary public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The backbone of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system, which includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1, east\u2013west Line 2, and the short east\u2013west Line 4 with Line 1 extending as far beyond city limits as Vaughan Metropolitan Centre.\nThe TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars, with the latter serving the downtown core and buses serving many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network. TTC buses and streetcars use the same fare system as the subway, and many subway stations offer a fare-paid area for transfers between rail and surface vehicles.\nThere have been numerous plans to extend the subway and implement light-rail lines, but budgetary concerns have thwarted many efforts. By November 2011, construction on Line 5 Eglinton began. Line 5 was scheduled to finish construction by 2024. In 2015, the Ontario government promised to fund Line 6 Finch West, which was to be completed by 2024. In 2019, the Government of Ontario released a transit plan for the Greater Toronto Area which includes a new Ontario Line, Line 1 extension to Richmond Hill Centre, a Line 2 extension to Sheppard Avenue / McCowan Road to replace Line 3, and an extension for Line 5 Eglinton to Toronto Pearson Airport.\nToronto's century-old Union Station is also getting a major renovation and upgrade which would be able to accommodate more rail traffic from GO Transit, Via Rail, UP Express and Amtrak. Construction on a new Union Station Bus Terminal is also in the works with an expected completion in 2020. Toronto's public transit network also connects to other municipal networks such as York Region Transit, Viva, Durham Region Transit, Brampton Transit, and MiWay.\nThe Government of Ontario operates a regional rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57\u00a0million annually, with a majority of them travelling to or from Union Station. Metrolinx is currently implementing Regional Express Rail into its GO Transit network and plans to electrify many of its rail lines by 2030.\nIntercity transportation.\nToronto Union Station serves as a hub for VIA Rail's intercity services in Central Canada and includes services to various parts of Ontario, \"Corridor\" services to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long-distance services to Vancouver and New York City.\nGO Transit provides intercity bus services from the Union Station Bus Terminal and other bus terminals in the city to destinations within the Golden Horseshoe. Long-distance intercity coach services by multiple companies also operated from the Union Station Bus Terminal and provide a network of services to further cities in Ontario, neighbouring provinces, and the United States. The Toronto Coach Terminal formerly served as the city's intercity coach hub from 1931 to 2021, when the terminal was decommissioned.\nAirports.\nCanada's busiest airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport (IATA: YYZ), straddles the city's western boundary with the suburban city of Mississauga. The Union Pearson Express (UP Express) train service provides a direct link between Pearson International and Union Station. It began carrying passengers in June 2015.\nLimited commercial and passenger service to nearby destinations in Canada and the United States is offered from the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (IATA: YTZ) on the Toronto Islands, southwest of downtown. Downsview Airport (IATA: YZD), was located near the city's north end, and was owned by de Havilland Canada serving as the Bombardier Aviation aircraft factory. The airport permanently ceased operations in April 2024.\nWithin a few hours' drive, Hamilton's John C. Munro International Airport (IATA: YHM) and Buffalo's Buffalo Niagara International Airport (IATA: BUF) serve as alternate airports for the Toronto area in addition to serving their respective cities. A secondary international airport, to be located northeast of Toronto in Pickering, has been planned by the Government of Canada.\nThe city is also serviced by a number of private heliports, most of which are attached to local hospitals and exclusively used for medevac flights.\nStreets and highways.\nThe grid of major city streets was laid out by a concession road system, in which major arterial roads are apart (with some exceptions, particularly in Scarborough and Etobicoke, as they used a different survey). Major east-west arterial roads are generally parallel with the Lake Ontario shoreline, and major north\u2013south arterial roads are roughly perpendicular to the shoreline, though slightly angled north of Eglinton Avenue. This arrangement is sometimes broken by geographical accidents, most notably the Don River ravines. Toronto's grid north is approximately 18.5\u00b0 to the west of true north. Many arterials, particularly north\u2013south ones, due to the city originally being within the former York County, continue beyond the city into the 905 suburbs and further into the rural countryside.\nThere are several municipal expressways and provincial highways that serve Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. In particular, Highway 401 bisects the city from west to east, bypassing the downtown core. It is the busiest road in North America,\nand one of the busiest highways in the world. Other provincial highways include Highway 400, which connects the city with Northern Ontario and beyond and Highway 404, an extension of the Don Valley Parkway into the northern suburbs. The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), North America's first divided intercity highway, terminates at Toronto's western boundary and connects Toronto to Niagara Falls and Buffalo. The main municipal expressways in Toronto include the Gardiner Expressway, the Don Valley Parkway, and, to some extent, Allen Road. Toronto's traffic congestion is one of the highest in North America, and is the second highest in Canada after Vancouver.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64647", "revid": "50252093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64647", "title": "Sultan", "text": "Noble title with several historical meanings\nSultan (; ', ) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty (i.e., not having dependence on any higher ruler) without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjectival form of the word is \"sultanic\", and the state and territories ruled by a sultan, as well as his office, are referred to as a sultanate ( \"\").\nThe term is distinct from king ( \"\"), though both refer to a sovereign ruler. The use of \"sultan\" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting with the more secular \"king\", which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries.\nBrunei, Malaysia and Oman are the only sovereign states which retain the title \"sultan\" for their monarchs. In some places the title has been replaced by \"king\" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957.\nHistory of the term.\nThe word derives from the Arabic and Semitic root \"sala\u1e6da\" \"to be hard, strong\". The noun \"sul\u1e6d\u0101n\" initially designated a kind of moral authority or spiritual power (as opposed to political power), and it is used in this sense several times in the Qur'an.\nIn the early Muslim world, ultimate power and authority was theoretically held by the caliph, who was considered the leader of the caliphate. The increasing political fragmentation of the Muslim world after the 8th century, however, challenged this consensus. Local governors with administrative authority held the title of \"am\u012br\" (, traditionally \"commander\" or \"emir\", later also \"prince\") and were appointed by the caliph, but in the 9th century some of these became \"de facto\" independent rulers who founded their own dynasties, such as the Aghlabids and Tulunids. Towards the late 10th century, the term \"sultan\" begins to be used to denote an individual ruler with practically sovereign authority, although the early evolution of the term is complicated and difficult to establish.\nThe first major figure to clearly grant himself this title was the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud (r. 998\u20131030 CE) who controlled an empire over present-day Afghanistan and the surrounding region. Soon after, the Great Seljuks adopted this title after defeating the Ghaznavid Empire and taking control of an even larger territory which included Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid caliphs. The early Seljuk leader Tughril Bey was the first leader to adopt the epithet \"sultan\" on his coinage. While the Seljuks acknowledged the caliphs in Baghdad formally as the universal leader of the Muslim community, their own political power clearly overshadowed the latter. This led to various Muslim scholars \u2013 notably Al-Juwayni and Al-Ghazali \u2013 attempting to develop theoretical justifications for the political authority of the Seljuk sultans within the framework of the formal supreme authority of the recognized caliphs. In general, the theories maintained that all legitimate authority derived from the caliph, but that it was delegated to sovereign rulers whom the caliph recognized. Al-Ghazali, for example, argued that while the caliph was the guarantor of Islamic law (\"shari'a\"), coercive power was required to enforce the law in practice and the leader who exercised that power directly was the sultan.\nThe position of sultan continued to grow in importance during the period of the crusades, when leaders who held the title of \"sultan\" (such as Salah ad-Din and the Ayyubid dynasty) led the confrontation against the crusader states in the Levant. Views about the office of the sultan further developed during the crisis that followed the destruction of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, which eliminated the remnants of Abbasid political power. Henceforth, the surviving descendants of the Abbasid caliphs lived in Cairo under the protection of the Mamluks and were still nominally recognized by the latter. However, from this time on they effectively had no authority and were not universally recognized across the Sunni Muslim world. As protectors of the line of the Abbasid caliphs, the Mamluks recognized themselves as sultans and the Muslim scholar Khalil al-Zahiri argued that only they could hold that title. Nonetheless, in practice, many Muslim rulers of this period were now using the title as well. Mongol rulers (who had since converted to Islam) and other Turkish rulers were among those who did so.\nThe position of sultan and caliph began to blend together in the 16th century when the Ottoman Empire conquered the Mamluk Empire and became the indisputable leading Sunni Muslim power across most of the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. The 16th-century Ottoman scholar and jurist, Eb\u00fcssu\u00fbd Mehmet Efendi, recognized the Ottoman sultan (Suleiman the Magnificent at the time) as the caliph and universal leader of all Muslims. This conflation of sultan and caliph became more clearly emphasized in the 19th century during the Ottoman Empire's territorial decline, when Ottoman authorities sought to cast the sultan as the leader of the entire Muslim community in the face of European (Christian) colonial expansion. As part of this narrative, it was claimed that when Sultan Selim I captured Cairo in 1517, the last descendant of the Abbasids in Cairo formally passed on the position of caliph to him. This combination thus elevated the sultan's religious or spiritual authority, in addition to his formal political authority.\nDuring this later period, the title of sultan was still used outside the Ottoman Empire as well, as with the examples of the Somali aristocrats, Malay nobles and the sultans of Morocco (such as the Alaouite dynasty founded in the 17th century). It was, however, not used as a sovereign title by Shi'a Muslim rulers. The Safavid dynasty of Iran, who controlled the largest Shi'a Muslim state of this era, mainly used the Persian title \"shah\", a tradition which continued under subsequent dynasties. The term \"sultan\", by contrast, was mainly given to provincial governors within their realm.\nFeminine forms.\nA feminine form of \"sultan\", used by Westerners, is sultana or sultanah and this title has been used legally for some (not all) Muslim women monarchs and sultan's mothers and chief consorts. However, Turkish and Ottoman Turkish also uses \"sultan\" for imperial lady, as Turkish grammar uses the same words for both women and men (such as Hurrem Sultan and Sultan Suleiman Han (Suleiman the Magnificent)). The female leaders in Muslim history are correctly known as \"sultanas\". However, the wife of the sultan in the Sultanate of Sulu is styled as the \"panguian\" while the sultan's chief wife in many sultanates of Indonesia and Malaysia are known as \"permaisuri\", \"Tunku Ampuan\", \"Raja Perempuan\", or \"Tengku Ampuan\". The queen consort in Brunei especially is known as \"Raja Isteri\" with the title of \"Pengiran Anak\" suffixed, should the queen consort also be a royal princess.\nCompound ruler titles.\nThese are generally secondary titles, either lofty 'poetry' or with a message, e.g.:\nPrincely and aristocratic titles.\nBy the beginning of the 16th century, the title sultan was carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty and was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably \"khatun\" for women and \"bey\" for men). This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.\nWestern tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as \"sultan\", but Ottomans themselves used \"padi\u015fah\" (emperor) or \"h\u00fcnkar\" to refer to their ruler. The emperor's formal title consisted of \"sultan\" together with \"khan\" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled \"sultan\", with imperial princes (\u015eehzade) carrying the title before their given name, and imperial princesses carrying it after. For example: \u015eehzade Sultan Mehmed and Mihrimah Sultan, son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, the living mother and main consort of the reigning sultan also carried the title after their given names, for example: Hafsa Sultan, Suleiman's mother and first valide sultan, and H\u00fcrrem Sultan, Suleiman's chief consort and first haseki sultan. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between the Sultanate of Women, as the position of main consort eroded over the course of the 17th century, with the main consort losing the title of \"sultan\", which was replaced by \"kadin\", a title related to the earlier \"khatun\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title \"sultan\".\nIn Kazakh Khanate a Sultan was a lord from the ruling dynasty (a direct descendants of Genghis Khan) elected by clans, i.e. a kind of prince. The best of sultans was elected as khan by people at Kurultai.\nMilitary rank.\nIn a number of post-caliphal states under Mongol or Turkic rule, there was a feudal type of military hierarchy. These administrations were often decimal (mainly in larger empires), using originally princely titles such as khan, malik, amir as mere rank denominations.\nIn the Persian empire, the rank of sultan was roughly equivalent to that of a modern-day captain in the West; socially in the fifth-rank class, styled 'Ali Jah.\nSultanate.\nThe state and territories ruled by a sultan, as well as his office, are referred to as a sultanate.\nFormer sultans and sultanates.\nSoutheast Africa and Indian Ocean.\n\"Maliki\".\nApparently derived from the Arabic \"malik\", this was the alternative native style of the sultans of the Kilwa Sultanate in Tanganyika (presently the continental part of Tanzania).\nSwahili Coast.\n\"Mfalume\" is the title of various native Muslim rulers, generally rendered in Arabic and in western languages as Sultan:\n\"Sultani\".\nThis was the native ruler's title in the Tanzanian state of Uhehe.\nSoutheast and East Asia.\nIn Indonesia (formerly in the Dutch East Indies):\nIn Malaysia:\nIn Brunei:\nIn China:\nIn the Philippines:\nIn Thailand:\nCurrent sultans.\nSultans of sovereign states\nSultans in federal monarchies\nSultan with power within republics\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64648", "revid": "50880149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64648", "title": "Shah", "text": "Royal title of Persian origin \nSh\u0101h (; ) is a royal title meaning 'king' in Persian. Though chiefly associated with the monarchs of Iran, it was also used to refer to the leaders of numerous Persianate societies, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Khanate of Bukhara and the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, and various Afghan dynasties, as well as among Gurkhas. With regard to Iranian history, in particular, each ruling monarch was not seen simply as the head of the concurrent dynasty and state, but as the successor to a long line of royalty beginning with the original Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great. To this end, he was more emphatically known as the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h ( ), meaning 'King of Kings', since the Achaemenid dynasty. A roughly equivalent title is P\u0101dish\u0101h (; lit.\u2009'Master King'), which was most widespread during the Muslim period in the Indian subcontinent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe word descends from Old Persian \"x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya\" 'king', which used to be considered a borrowing from Median as it was compared to Avestan \"x\u0161a\u03b8ra-\", 'power' and 'command', corresponding to Sanskrit \"k\u1e63atra-\" (same meaning), from which \"k\u1e63atriya-\", 'warrior', is derived. Most recently, the form \"x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya\" has been analyzed as a genuine, inherited Persian formation with the meaning 'pertaining to reigning, ruling'. This formation with the 'origin' suffix \"-iya\" is derived from a deverbal abstract noun *\"x\u0161\u0101y-a\u03b8a-\" 'rule, ruling, \"Herrschaft\"', from the (Old Persian) verb \"x\u0161\u0101y-\" 'to rule, reign'. The full, Old Persian title of the Achaemenid rulers of the First Persian Empire was \"X\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya X\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iy\u0101n\u0101m\" or (Middle Persian) \"\u0160\u00e2h\u00e2n \u0160\u00e2h\", 'King of Kings' or 'Emperor'. This title has ancient Near Eastern or Mesopotamian precedents. The earliest attestation of such a title dates back to the Middle Assyrian period as \"\u0161ar \u0161arr\u0101ni\", in reference to the Assyrian ruler Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243\u20131207 BC).\nHistory.\nPersian dynasties.\n\"Sh\u0101h\", also known by its full-length term \"Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h\" (King of Kings), was the title of the Persian emperors. It includes rulers of the first Persian Empire, the Achaemenid dynasty, who unified Persia in the sixth century BC, and created a vast intercontinental empire, as well as rulers of succeeding dynasties throughout history until the 20th century and the Imperial House of Pahlavi.\nWhile in Western sources the Ottoman monarch is most often referred to as a Sultan, in Ottoman territory he was most often referred to as \"Padishah\" and several used the title Shah in their tughras. Their male offspring received the title of \"\u015eehzade\", or prince (literally, \"offspring of the Shah\", from Persian \"shahzadeh\").\nThe full title of the Achaemenid rulers was \"X\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya X\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iy\u0101n\u0101m\", literally \"King of Kings\" in Old Persian, corresponding to Middle Persian \"\u0160\u00e2h\u00e2n \u0160\u00e2h\", and Modern Persian (\"\u0160\u00e2han\u0161\u00e2h\"). In Greek, this phrase was translated as (\"basileus t\u014dn basil\u00e9\u014dn\"), \"King of Kings\", equivalent to \"Emperor\". Both terms were often shortened to their roots \"shah\" and \"basileus\".\nIn Western languages, \"Shah\" is often used as an imprecise rendering of \"\u0160\u0101han\u0161\u0101h\". For a long time, Europeans thought of \"Shah\" as a particular royal title rather than an imperial one, although the monarchs of Persia regarded themselves as emperors of the Persian Empire (later the Empire of Iran). The European opinion changed in the Napoleonic era, when Persia was an ally of the Western powers eager to make the Ottoman Sultan release his hold on various (mainly Christian) European parts of the Ottoman Empire, and western (Christian) emperors had obtained the Ottoman acknowledgement that their western imperial styles were to be rendered in Turkish as \"padishah\".\nIn the twentieth century, the Shah of Persia, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, officially adopted the title \"\u0160\u00e2han\u0161\u00e2h\" and, in western languages, the rendering \"Emperor\". He also styled his wife \"Shahb\u00e2n\u016b\" (\"Empress\"). Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was the last Shah, as the Iranian monarchy was abolished after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nImpact and influence.\nDerived terms.\n\"Shahzade\".\n\"Shahzade\" (, transliterated as \"\u0160\u00e2hz\u00e2de\"). In the realm of a shah (or a loftier derived ruler style), a prince or princess of the royal blood was logically called \"shahzada\" as the term is derived from shah using the Persian patronymic suffix -z\u00e2de or -z\u00e2deh, \"born from\" or \"descendant of\". However the precise full styles can differ in the court traditions of each shah's kingdom. This title was given to the princes of the Ottoman Empire (\"\u015eehzade\", Ottoman Turkish: \u0634\u0647\u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647) and was used by the princes of Islamic India (\"Shahz\u0101da\", Urdu: \u0634\u06c1\u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647, ) such as in the Mughal Empire. The Mughals and the Sultans of Delhi were of Indo-Persian and Turco-Mongol origin, a continuation of traditions and habits ever since Persian language was first introduced into the region by Turco-Persian dynasties centuries earlier.\nThus, in Oudh, only sons of the sovereign \"shah bahadur\" (see above) were by birth-right styled \"Shahzada [personal title] Mirza [personal name] Bahadur\", though this style could also be extended to individual grandsons and even further relatives. Other male descendants of the sovereign in the male line were merely styled \"Mirza [personal name]\" or \"[personal name] Mirza\". This could even apply to non-Muslim dynasties. For example, the younger sons of the ruling Sikh maharaja of Punjab were styled \"Shahzada [personal name] Singh Bahadur\".\nThe borrowing \"shahajada\", \"Shah's son\", taken from the Mughal title Shahzada, was the usual princely title borne by the grandsons and male descendants of a Nepalese sovereign in the male line of the Shah dynasty until its abolition in 2008.\nFor the heir to a \"Persian-style\" shah's royal throne, more specific titles were used, containing the key element \"Vali Ahad\", usually in addition to \"shahzada\", where his junior siblings enjoyed this style.\nArmenian names.\nArmenian compound personal names often contain the element \"\u0161ah,\" meaning \"king\" in Middle Persian and New Persian. These names can be found in both masculine and feminine forms and may include native Armenian or foreign components. The element \"\u0161ah\" can appear as either the first or second component and is sometimes part of doublet forms with the components reversed. For example, masculine names include \u0160ah-amir and Amir-\u0161ah, \u0160ah-paron and Paron-\u0161ah, and Vahram-\u0161ah; feminine names include \u0160ah-xat\u2018un and Xat\u2018un-\u0161ah, and \u0160ah-tikin.\nSome examples of these compound names include masculine \u0160ah-aziz and feminine Aziz-\u0161ah, masculine Sult\u2018an-\u0161ah and feminine \u0160ah-sult\u2018an, and masculine Melik\u2018-\u0161ah and feminine \u0160ah-mel\u0113/ik\u2018. These names, particularly the feminine forms, sometimes vary in gender depending on the source.\nThe name Artam\u0161in, for instance, is based on *Artam from Old Iranian *R\u0325t\u0101ma-, interpreted as \"having power of/from R\u0325ta.\" The auslaut of the Armenian name suggests a connection to the Iranian word for \"king,\" \u0161\u0101h, found in various languages including Middle Persian and New Persian.\nIn another example, the name \u0160a\u0161t\u02bbi is interpreted as \"\u0160ah-Lady,\" with the second component reflecting the Arabic term sitt\u012b, meaning \"My lady, lady.\" This name is found in a colophon from the Ko\u0142bay monastery as the name of a sister of Dawit\u02bb and priest Vardan.\nOverall, Armenian compound names containing the element \"\u0161ah\" provide insight into the linguistic and cultural interactions between Armenian and Iranian languages and cultures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was created from parts of the former provinces of Guyenne and Gascony.\nFrom 1793 to 1795, the department's name was changed to \"Bec-d'Amb\u00e8s\" to avoid the association with the Girondist political party of the French Revolution.\nIn July 2022, Gironde was affected by large wildfires.\nGeography.\nGironde is part of the current region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and is surrounded by the departments of Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, Dordogne and Charente-Maritime and the Atlantic Ocean on the west. With an area of 10,000\u00a0km2, Gironde is the largest department in metropolitan France, and the second-largest in entire France. Its size is larger than Lebanon or the province of Banten. If overseas departments are included, however, Gironde's land area is dwarfed by the 83,846\u00a0km2 of French Guiana.\nGironde is well known for the C\u00f4te d'Argent beach which is Europe's longest, attracting many surfers to Lacanau each year. It is also the birthplace of Jacques-Yves Cousteau who studied the sea and all forms of life in water.\nThe Great Dune of Pyla in Arcachon Bay near Bordeaux is the tallest sand dune in Europe.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrincipal towns.\nThe most populous commune is Bordeaux, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 30,000 inhabitants:\nPolitics.\nThe President of the Departmental Council is Jean-Luc Gleyze of the Socialist Party.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The other color appearance parameters are colorfulness, saturation (also known as intensity or chroma), lightness, and brightness. Usually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness - for example: \"light blue\", \"pastel blue\", \"vivid blue\", and \"cobalt blue\". Exceptions include brown, which is a dark orange.\nIn painting, a hue is a \"pure\" pigment\u2014one without tint or shade (added white or black pigment, respectively).\nThe human brain first processes hues in areas in the extended V4 called globs.\nDeriving a hue.\nThe concept of a color system with a hue was explored as early as 1830 with Philipp Otto Runge's color sphere. The Munsell color system from the 1930s was a great step forward, as it was realized that perceptual uniformity means the color space can no longer be a sphere.\nAs a convention, the hue for red is set to 0\u00b0 for most color spaces with a hue.\nOpponent color spaces.\nIn opponent color spaces in which two of the axes are perceptually orthogonal to lightness, such as the CIE 1976 (\"L\"*, \"a\"*, \"b\"*) (CIELAB) and 1976 (\"L\"*, \"u\"*, \"v\"*) (CIELUV) color spaces, hue may be computed together with chroma by converting these coordinates from rectangular form to polar form. Hue is the angular component of the polar representation, while chroma is the radial component.\nSpecifically, in CIELAB\nformula_1\nwhile, analogously, in CIELUV\nformula_2\nwhere, atan2 is a two-argument inverse tangent.\nDefining hue in terms of RGB.\nPreucil describes a color hexagon, similar to a trilinear plot described by Evans, Hanson, and Brewer, which may be used to compute hue from RGB. To place red at 0\u00b0, green at 120\u00b0, and blue at 240\u00b0,\nformula_3\nEquivalently, one may solve\nformula_4\nPreucil used a polar plot, which he termed a color circle. Using R, G, and B, one may compute hue angle using the following scheme: determine which of the six possible orderings of R, G, and B prevail, then apply the formula given in the table below.\nIn each case the formula contains the fraction formula_5, where \"H\" is the highest of R, G, and B; \"L\" is the lowest, and \"M\" is the mid one between the other two. This is referred to as the \"Preucil hue error\" and was used in the computation of mask strength in photomechanical color reproduction.\nHue angles computed for the Preucil circle agree with the hue angle computed for the Preucil hexagon at integer multiples of 30\u00b0 (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and the colors midway between contiguous pairs) and differ by approximately 1.2\u00b0 at odd integer multiples of 15\u00b0 (based on the circle formula), the maximal divergence between the two.\nThe process of converting an RGB color into an HSL or HSV color space is usually based on a 6-piece piecewise mapping, treating the HSV cone as a hexacone, or the HSL double cone as a double hexacone. The formulae used are those in the table above.\nOne might notice that the HSL/HSV hue \"circle\" does not appear to all be of the same lightness. This is a known issue of this RGB-based derivation of hue.\nUsage in art.\nManufacturers of pigments use the word hue, for example, \"cadmium yellow (hue)\" to indicate that the original pigmentation ingredient, often toxic, has been replaced by safer (or cheaper) alternatives whilst retaining the hue of the original. Replacements are often used for chromium, cadmium and alizarin.\nHue vs. dominant wavelength.\nDominant wavelength (or sometimes equivalent wavelength) is a physical analog to the perceptual attribute hue. On a chromaticity diagram, a line is drawn from a white point through the coordinates of the color in question, until it intersects the spectral locus. The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color's dominant wavelength if the point is on the same side of the white point as the spectral locus, and as the color's complementary wavelength if the point is on the opposite side.\nHue difference notation.\nThere are two main ways in which hue difference is quantified. The first is the simple difference between the two hue angles. The symbol for this expression of hue difference is formula_6 in CIELAB and formula_7 in CIELUV. The other is computed as the residual total color difference after Lightness and Chroma differences have been accounted for; its symbol is formula_8 in CIELAB and formula_9 in CIELUV.\nNames and other notations.\nThere exists some correspondence, more or less precise, between hue values and color terms (names). One approach in color science is to use traditional color terms but try to give them more precise definitions. See spectral color#Spectral color terms for names of highly saturated colors with the hue from \u2248 0\u00b0 (red) up to \u2248 275\u00b0 (violet), and line of purples#Table of highly-saturated purple colors for color terms of the remaining part of the color wheel.\nAlternative approach is to use a systematic notation. It can be a standard angle notation for certain color model such as HSL/HSV mentioned above, CIELUV, or CIECAM02. Alphanumeric notations such as of Munsell color system, NCS, and Pantone Matching System are also used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64657", "revid": "332841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64657", "title": "The Big Blue", "text": "1988 film by Luc Besson\nThe Big Blue (released in some countries under the French title Le Grand Bleu) is a 1988 drama film directed by Luc Besson. Inspired by the \"Cin\u00e9ma du look\" movement, the film is a heavily fictionalized and dramatized story of the friendship and sporting rivalry between two leading contemporary champion free divers in the 20th century: Jacques Mayol (played by Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo Maiorca (renamed \"Enzo Molinari\" and played by Jean Reno), and Mayol's fictionalized relationship with his girlfriend Johana Baker (played by Rosanna Arquette).\n\"The Big Blue\" became one of France's most commercially successful films (although an adaptation for US release was a commercial failure in that country). French president Jacques Chirac referred to the film in describing Mayol, after his suicide by hanging in 2001, as an enduring symbol for the \"Big Blue\" generation.\nThe story was heavily adapted for cinema. In real life, Mayol lived from 1927 to 2001 and Maiorca retired from diving to politics in the 1980s. Both set no-limits-category deep diving records below 100 metres, and Mayol was indeed involved in scientific research into human aquatic potential, but neither reached as portrayed in the film, and they were not direct competitors. Mayol himself was a screenwriter for the film, and Mayol's search for love, family, \"wholeness\" and the meaning of life and death, and the conflict and tension between his yearning for the deep and his relationship with his girlfriend are also major elements of the latter part of the film.\nPlot.\nChildren Jacques Mayol and Enzo Molinari grow up in Amorgos, Greece in the 1960s. Enzo challenges Jacques to collect a coin on the sea floor but Jacques refuses. Jacques' father\u2014who harvests shellfish from the seabed using a pump-supplied air hose and helmet\u2014goes diving. His breathing apparatus and rope gets caught and punctured by rocks, and weighed down by water, he drowns in front of the children.\nBy the 1980s, both are well known for their freediving skills. In Sicily, Enzo rescues a trapped diver from a shipwreck. He is a world champion freediver and now wishes to find Jacques and persuade him to return to no-limits freediving to prove he is still the better of the two. Jacques works as a human research subject with dolphins and is participating in research into human physiology in the lakes of the Peruvian Andes, where his bodily responses to cold water immersion are being recorded. Insurance broker Johana Baker visits the station and is introduced to Jacques. After hearing that Jacques will be at the World Diving Championships in Taormina, Sicily, she fabricates an insurance problem that requires her presence there, to meet him again. The two start dating. However, neither of them realizes the extent of Jacques' allure for the deep. Jacques beats Enzo by 1 metre, and Enzo offers him a crystal dolphin as a gift, and a tape measure to show the small difference between their respective records. Johana goes back home to New York but is fired after her deception is discovered; she leaves New York and begins to live with Jacques. She hears the story that mermaids appear to the ones who truly love the sea and lead them to an enchanted place.\nAt the next World Diving Championships, Enzo beats Jacques' record. The depths at which the divers compete enter new territory, and the dive doctor suggests they should stop, to no avail. Jacques is asked to look at a dolphinarium where a new dolphin has been placed, and where the dolphins are no longer performing; surmising that the new dolphin is homesick, the three of them break in at night to liberate and return her to the sea. Back at the competition, other divers attempt to break Enzo's world record, but each fails. Jacques succeeds, reaching . Angered by this, Enzo prepares to break Jacques' record. The doctor warns that the competitors must not go deeper, as the pressure becomes lethal at those depths. Enzo dismisses the doctor and attempts the dive anyway but is unable to return to the surface. Jacques dives to rescue him. Enzo, dying, tells Jacques that he was right and that it is better down there. He begs Jacques to help him back down to the depths, where he belongs. Distraught, Jacques refuses, and Enzo dies in his arms. To honor his dying wish, Jacques takes Enzo's body back down to a depth where the human body becomes negatively buoyant, and lets his friend sink into the depths. Jacques\u2014himself suffering from cardiac arrest after the dive\u2014is rescued by supervising scuba divers and requires his heart to be restarted with a defibrillator before being placed in medical quarters to recover.\nJacques appears to be recovering from the diving accident but later experiences a hallucinatory dream in which the ceiling collapses and the room fills with water, and he finds himself in the ocean depths with dolphins. After discovering she is pregnant, Johana returns to check up on Jacques but finds him lying unresponsive in his bed with bloody ears and a bloody nose. Johana attempts to help him, but Jacques gets up and walks to the diving boat and gets suited up for one final dive. Desperately, Johana begs Jacques not to go, saying she is alive but whatever has happened at the depths is not, but he says he has to. She announces she is pregnant and begs Jacques to stay. However, she eventually lets him go. The two embrace and Johana breaks down crying. Jacques then places the release cord for the dive ballast in her hand, and\u2014still sobbing\u2014she pulls it, sending him down to the depths. Jacques descends and floats for a moment, staring into the darkness. A dolphin then appears, and Jacques lets go of his harness, swimming away with it into the darkness.\nOriginal and alternate (US) endings.\nThe original ending (with Jacques swimming into the ocean's depths with a dolphin) was intentionally ambiguous; even though considering the depth Jacques has swum to, it appears highly unlikely that he could regain the surface alive.\nIn the American adaptation, the ending is extended with an additional scene, where it is shown that after swimming away with the dolphin, Jacques is returned to the surface.\nComparison with real life.\nThe film was heavily fictionalized. In real life, Jacques Mayol and Enzo Maiorca were indeed champions and contemporaries. However, they did not directly compete, neither reached 400 feet, and neither died while diving.\nMayol was indeed involved in scientific research into human aquatic potential, and was fascinated by dolphins, and was recorded as having a heartbeat that slowed from 60 to 27 beats per minute when diving. He held numerous world records, including dives to below 100 metres. After a bout of depression, he killed himself in 2001, long after the film's release.\nMaiorca (renamed as \"Enzo Molinari\" in the film) also set numerous depth records from 1960 to 1988, despite involuntarily retiring from the sport for over a decade between 1974 and 1986 after an outburst on TV cost him a competition ban. He entered politics in the 1990s, and became a member of the Italian Senate for a time. For many years, he resisted public showing of the film in Italy, as he considered it to caricature him poorly; after Mayol's death in 2001, he relented and accepted the showing of the film.\nProduction.\nBesson was initially unsure of whom to cast in the main role of Mayol. He initially offered the role to Christopher Lambert and Mickey Rourke and even considered himself for the role until someone suggested Jean-Marc Barr. Besson has a cameo appearance as one of the divers in the film. \"The Big Blue\" was the most financially successful French film of the 1980s, selling 9,193,873 tickets in France alone, and played in French theaters for a year.\nWith its extensive underwater scenes and languid score (as with nearly all of Besson's films, the soundtrack was composed by \u00c9ric Serra), the film has been both praised as beautiful and serene, and in equal measure criticized as being too drawn out, overly reflective and introspective. While popular in Europe, the film was a commercial failure in North America. The American version was recut to include a simplified \"happy\" ending, and Serra's score was replaced with a soundtrack composed by Bill Conti. This version was only available on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States (both with 4\u00d73 pan-and-scan transfers) and is currently out of print. The director later released a longer director's cut on DVD, featuring the original ending and an extended version of the Serra score.\nMuch of the film was shot on the Greek island of Amorgos, where Agia Anna and the monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa can be seen. The film was dedicated to his daughter Juliette Besson, who required surgery after becoming ill during filming.\nReception.\nThe film was met with positive reviews in Europe, where it was described as \"one of the most significant cult movies of the 1980s\" by French Cinema historian R\u00e9mi Lanzoni, who described it as \"ooz[ing] with a sensuous beauty unlike any other film at the time\".\nThe film was slightly edited for US release to have a new, positive ending and the original score was also replaced.\nThe US release was met with above average reviews. The film aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes gave it 62%, based on 21 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though this movie features beautiful cinematography, it drags on, being way too overblown and melodramatic.\"\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\", praised its cinematography, but warned viewers to \"be prepared to want to come up for air only minutes into [the film]\", referring to the film's pointless plot.\nThe film sold only 97,817 tickets in its opening week in and around Paris but went on to become one of the most popular French films of all time in France with admissions of 9.2\u00a0million.\nAccolades.\n\"The Big Blue\" was nominated for several C\u00e9sar Awards and won C\u00e9sar Award for Best Music Written for a Film (\u00c9ric Serra) and Best Sound in 1989. The film also won France's National Academy of Cinema's Academy Award in 1989.\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival.\nAndrzej Malinowski's film poster for \"The Big Blue\" received a C\u00e9sar Award nomination in 1989 from the French Academy of Arts and Film Techniques.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD on 21 July 2009.\nA Blu-ray version containing both the extended and theatrical versions was released on 14 September 2009, in the United Kingdom, but this contains French-dubbed versions of both cuts, rather than the original English language. This was later corrected and the second release contained a LPCM 2.0 English soundtrack and a DTS 2.0 French dub. The French Blu-ray release contains only the Director's Cut of the film but with a French DTS-MA 5.1 soundtrack and is supplemented with Besson's \"Atlantis\" documentary on Blu-ray as well.\nIn popular culture.\nA poster for the film can be seen in the photo studio in the 1992 South Korean film \"The Moon Is... the Sun's Dream\".\nIn 1993, the Israeli singer Sharon Lifshitz released the song \"Ha'ish Me'hayam\" (\u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05de\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u2013 The Man From The Sea) which was written by Tzruya Lahav and was based on the film.\nIn the 2009 Japanese anime series \"Eden of the East\", Akira plays the film in his villa's cinema for Saki, who was a big fan. The title of the episode, \"On the Night of the Late Show\", is a reference to this scene.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64658", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64658", "title": "Logogram", "text": "Grapheme which represents a word or a morpheme\nIn a written language, a logogram (from Ancient Greek 'word', and 'that which is drawn or written'), also logograph or lexigraph, is a written character that represents a semantic component of a language, such as a word or morpheme. Chinese characters as used in Chinese as well as other languages are logograms, as are Egyptian hieroglyphs and characters in cuneiform script. A writing system that primarily uses logograms is called a \"logography\". Non-logographic writing systems, such as alphabets and syllabaries, are \"phonemic\": their individual symbols represent sounds directly and lack any inherent meaning. However, all known logographies have some phonetic component, generally based on the rebus principle, and the addition of a phonetic component to pure ideographs is considered to be a key innovation in enabling the writing system to adequately encode human language.\nTypes of logographic systems.\nSome of the earliest recorded writing systems are logographic; the first historical civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and Mesoamerica all used some form of logographic writing.\nAll logographic scripts ever used for natural languages rely on the rebus principle to extend a relatively limited set of logograms: A subset of characters is used for their phonetic values, either consonantal or syllabic. The term logosyllabary is used to emphasize the partially phonetic nature of these scripts when the phonetic domain is the syllable. In Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Ch'olti', and in Chinese, there has been the additional development of determinatives, which are combined with logograms to narrow down their possible meaning. In Chinese, they are fused with logographic elements used phonetically; such \"radical and phonetic\" characters make up the bulk of the script. Ancient Egyptian and Chinese relegated the active use of rebus to the spelling of foreign and dialectical words.\nLogoconsonantal.\nLogoconsonantal scripts have graphemes that may be extended phonetically according to the consonants of the words they represent, ignoring the vowels. For example, Egyptian G38 was used to write both \"s\u021d\" 'duck' and \"s\u021d\" 'son', though it is likely that these words were not pronounced the same except for their consonants. The primary examples of logoconsonantal scripts are Egyptian hieroglyphs, hieratic, and demotic: Ancient Egyptian.\nLogosyllabic.\nLogosyllabic (or \"morphosyllabic\") scripts have graphemes which represent morphemes, often polysyllabic morphemes, but when extended phonetically represent single syllables. They include cuneiform, Anatolian hieroglyphs, Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A and Linear B, Chinese characters, Maya script, Aztec script, Mixtec script, and the first five phases of the Bamum script.\nOthers.\nA peculiar system of logograms developed within the Pahlavi scripts (developed from the abjad of Aramaic) used to write Middle Persian during much of the Sassanid period; the logograms were composed of letters that spelled out the word in Aramaic but were pronounced as in Persian (for instance, the combination \"\" would be pronounced \"shah\"). These logograms, called (a form of heterograms), were dispensed with altogether after the Arab conquest of Persia and the adoption of a variant of the Arabic alphabet.\nSemantic and phonetic dimensions.\nAll historical logographic systems include a phonetic dimension, as it is impractical to have a separate basic character for every word or morpheme in a language. In some cases, such as cuneiform as it was used for Akkadian, the vast majority of glyphs are used for their sound values rather than logographically. Many logographic systems also have a semantic/ideographic component (see ideogram), called \"determinatives\" in the case of Egyptian and \"radicals\" in the case of Chinese.\nTypical Egyptian usage was to augment a logogram, which may potentially represent several words with different pronunciations, with a determinate to narrow down the meaning, and a phonetic component to specify the pronunciation. In the case of Chinese, the vast majority of characters are a fixed combination of a radical that indicates its nominal category, plus a phonetic to give an idea of the pronunciation. The Mayan system used logograms with phonetic complements like the Egyptian, while lacking ideographic components.\nUniversal logograms.\nNot all logograms are associated with one specific language, and some are not associated with any language at all. The ampersand is a logogram in the Latin script, a combination of the letters \"e\" and \"t.\" In Latin, \"et\" translates to \"and,\" and the ampersand is still used to represent this word today, however, it does so in a variety of languages, being a representative of morphemes \"and,\" \"y,\" or \"en,\" if they are a speaker of English, Spanish, or Dutch, respectively.\nOutside of any script is Unicode, a compilation of characters of various meanings. They state their intention to build the standard to include every character from every language. It's the generally accepted standard for computer character encoding, but others, like ASCII and Baudot, exist and serve various purposes in digital communication. Many logograms in these databases are ubiquitous, and are used on the Internet by users worldwide.\nChinese characters.\nChinese scholars have traditionally classified Chinese characters into six types by etymology.\nThe first two types are \"single-body\", meaning that the character was created independently of other characters. \"Single-body\" pictograms and ideograms make up only a small proportion of Chinese logograms. More productive for the Chinese script were the two\n\"compound\" methods, i.e. the character was created from assembling different characters. Despite being called \"compounds\", these logograms are still single characters, and are written to take up the same amount of space as any other logogram. The final two types are methods in the usage of characters rather than the formation of characters themselves.\nThe most productive method of Chinese writing, the radical-phonetic, was made possible by ignoring certain distinctions in the phonetic system of syllables. In Old Chinese, post-final ending consonants and were typically ignored; these developed into tones in Middle Chinese, which were likewise ignored when new characters were created. Also ignored were differences in aspiration (between aspirated vs. unaspirated obstruents, and voiced vs. unvoiced sonorants); the Old Chinese difference between type-A and type-B syllables (often described as presence vs. absence of palatalization or pharyngealization); and sometimes, voicing of initial obstruents and/or the presence of a medial after the initial consonant. In earlier times, greater phonetic freedom was generally allowed. During Middle Chinese times, newly created characters tended to match pronunciation exactly, other than the tone \u2013 often by using as the phonetic component a character that itself is a radical-phonetic compound.\nDue to the long period of language evolution, such component \"hints\" within characters as provided by the radical-phonetic compounds are sometimes useless and may be misleading in modern usage. As an example, based on 'each', pronounced \"m\u011bi\" in Standard Mandarin, are the characters 'to humiliate', 'to regret', and 'sea', pronounced respectively \"w\u01d4\", \"hu\u01d0\", and \"h\u01cei\" in Mandarin. Three of these characters were pronounced very similarly in Old Chinese \u2013 \u00a0(\u6bcf), \u00a0(\u6094), and \u00a0(\u6d77) according to a recent reconstruction by William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart \u2013 but sound changes in the intervening 3,000 years or so (including two different dialectal developments, in the case of the last two characters) have resulted in radically different pronunciations.\nChinese characters used in Japanese and Korean.\nWithin the context of the Chinese language, Chinese characters (known as hanzi) by and large represent words and morphemes rather than pure ideas; however, the adoption of Chinese characters by the Japanese and Korean languages (where they are known as kanji and hanja, respectively) have resulted in some complications to this picture.\nMany Chinese words, composed of Chinese morphemes, were borrowed into Japanese and Korean together with their character representations; in this case, the morphemes and characters were borrowed together. In other cases, however, characters were borrowed to represent native Japanese and Korean morphemes, on the basis of meaning alone. As a result, a single character can end up representing multiple morphemes of similar meaning but with different origins across several languages. Because of this, kanji and hanja are sometimes described as morphographic writing systems.\nDifferences in processing of logographic and phonologic writing systems.\nBecause much research on language processing has centered on English and other alphabetically written languages, many theories of language processing have stressed the role of phonology in producing speech. Contrasting logographically coded languages, where a single character is represented phonetically and ideographically, with phonetically/phonemically spelled languages has yielded insights into how different languages rely on different processing mechanisms. Studies on the processing of logographically coded languages have amongst other things looked at neurobiological differences in processing, with one area of particular interest being hemispheric lateralization. Since logographically coded languages are more closely associated with images than alphabetically coded languages, several researchers have hypothesized that right-side activation should be more prominent in logographically coded languages. Although some studies have yielded results consistent with this hypothesis there are too many contrasting results to make any final conclusions about the role of hemispheric lateralization in orthographically versus phonetically coded languages.\nAnother topic that has been given some attention is differences in processing of homophones. Verdonschot et al. examined differences in the time it took to read a homophone out loud when a picture that was either related or unrelated to a homophonic character was presented before the character. Both Japanese and Chinese homophones were examined. Whereas word production of alphabetically coded languages (such as English) has shown a relatively robust immunity to the effect of context stimuli, Verdschot et al. found that Japanese homophones seem particularly sensitive to these types of effects. Specifically, reaction times were shorter when participants were presented with a phonologically related picture before being asked to read a target character out loud. An example of a phonologically related stimulus from the study would be for instance when participants were presented with a picture of an elephant, which is pronounced \"zou\" in Japanese, before being presented with the Chinese character , which is also read \"zou\". No effect of phonologically related context pictures were found for the reaction times for reading Chinese words. A comparison of the (partially) logographically coded languages Japanese and Chinese is interesting because whereas the Japanese language consists of more than 60% homographic heterophones (characters that can be read two or more different ways), most Chinese characters only have one reading. Because both languages are logographically coded, the difference in latency in reading aloud Japanese and Chinese due to context effects cannot be ascribed to the logographic nature of the writing systems. Instead, the authors hypothesize that the difference in latency times is due to additional processing costs in Japanese, where the reader cannot rely solely on a direct orthography-to-phonology route, but information on a lexical-syntactical level must also be accessed in order to choose the correct pronunciation. This hypothesis is confirmed by studies finding that Japanese Alzheimer's disease patients whose comprehension of characters had deteriorated still could read the words out loud with no particular difficulty.\nStudies contrasting the processing of English and Chinese homophones in lexical decision tasks have found an advantage for homophone processing in Chinese, and a disadvantage for processing homophones in English. The processing disadvantage in English is usually described in terms of the relative lack of homophones in the English language. When a homophonic word is encountered, the phonological representation of that word is first activated. However, since this is an ambiguous stimulus, a matching at the orthographic/lexical (\"mental dictionary\") level is necessary before the stimulus can be disambiguated, and the correct pronunciation can be chosen. In contrast, in a language (such as Chinese) where many characters with the same reading exists, it is hypothesized that the person reading the character will be more familiar with homophones, and that this familiarity will aid the processing of the character, and the subsequent selection of the correct pronunciation, leading to shorter reaction times when attending to the stimulus. In an attempt to better understand homophony effects on processing, Hino et al. conducted a series of experiments using Japanese as their target language. While controlling for familiarity, they found a processing advantage for homophones over non-homophones in Japanese, similar to what has previously been found in Chinese. The researchers also tested whether orthographically similar homophones would yield a disadvantage in processing, as has been the case with English homophones, but found no evidence for this. It is evident that there is a difference in how homophones are processed in logographically coded and alphabetically coded languages, but whether the advantage for processing of homophones in the logographically coded languages Japanese and Chinese (i.e. their writing systems) is due to the logographic nature of the scripts, or if it merely reflects an advantage for languages with more homophones regardless of script nature, remains to be seen.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nSeparating writing and pronunciation.\nThe main difference between logograms and other writing systems is that the graphemes are not linked directly to their pronunciation. An advantage of this separation is that understanding of the pronunciation or language of the writer is unnecessary, e.g. 1 is understood regardless of whether it be called \"one\", \"ichi\" or \"w\u0101\u1e25id\" by its reader. Likewise, people speaking different varieties of Chinese may not understand each other in speaking, but may do so to a significant extent in writing even if they do not write in Standard Chinese. Therefore, in China, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan before modern times, communication by writing () was the norm of East Asian international trade and diplomacy using Classical Chinese.\nThis separation, however, also has the great disadvantage of requiring the memorization of the logograms when learning to read and write, separately from the pronunciation. Though not from an inherent feature of logograms but due to its unique history of development, Japanese has the added complication that almost every logogram has more than one pronunciation. Conversely, a phonetic character set is written precisely as it is spoken, but with the disadvantage that slight pronunciation differences introduce ambiguities. Many alphabetic systems such as those of Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, and Finnish make the practical compromise of standardizing how words are written while maintaining a nearly one-to-one relation between characters and sounds. Orthographies in some other languages, such as English, French, Thai and Tibetan, are all more complicated than that; character combinations are often pronounced in multiple ways, usually depending on their history. Hangul, the Korean language's writing system, is an example of an alphabetic script that was designed to replace the logogrammatic hanja in order to increase literacy. The latter is now rarely used, but retains some currency in South Korea, sometimes in combination with hangul.\nAccording to government-commissioned research, the most commonly used 3,500 characters listed in the People's Republic of China's \"Chart of Common Characters of Modern Chinese\" (, \"Xi\u00e0nd\u00e0i H\u00e0ny\u01d4 Ch\u00e1ngy\u00f2ngz\u00ec Bi\u01ceo\") cover 99.48% of a two-million-word sample. As for the case of traditional Chinese characters, 4,808 characters are listed in the \"Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters\" () by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, while 4,759 in the \"List of Graphemes of Commonly-Used Chinese Characters\" () by the Education and Manpower Bureau of Hong Kong, both of which are intended to be taught during elementary and junior secondary education. Education after elementary school includes not as many new characters as new words, which are mostly combinations of two or more already learned characters.\nCharacters in information technology.\nEntering complex characters can be cumbersome on electronic devices due to a practical limitation in the number of input keys. There exist various input methods for entering logograms, either by breaking them up into their constituent parts such as with the Cangjie and Wubi methods of typing Chinese, or using phonetic systems such as Bopomofo or Pinyin where the word is entered as pronounced and then selected from a list of logograms matching it. While the former method is (linearly) faster, it is more difficult to learn. With the Chinese alphabet system however, the strokes forming the logogram are typed as they are normally written, and the corresponding logogram is then entered.\nAlso due to the number of glyphs, in programming and computing in general, more memory is needed to store each grapheme, as the character set is larger. As a comparison, ISO 8859 requires only one byte for each grapheme, while the Basic Multilingual Plane encoded in UTF-8 requires up to three bytes. On the other hand, English words, for example, average five characters and a space per word and thus need six bytes for every word. Since many logograms contain more than one grapheme, it is not clear which is more memory-efficient. Variable-width encodings allow a unified character encoding standard such as Unicode to use only the bytes necessary to represent a character, reducing the overhead that results merging large character sets with smaller ones.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He made optical glass, an achromatic telescope, and objective lenses. He developed diffraction grating and also invented the spectroscope. In 1814, he discovered and studied the dark absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun now known as Fraunhofer lines.\nThe German research organization Fraunhofer Society, which is Europe's biggest Society for the advancement of applied research, is named after him. Fraunhofer lines are used in astronomy to determine the composition of celestial bodies. His epitaph reads , Latin for 'He brought closer the stars.'\nBiography.\nJoseph Fraunhofer was the 11th child, born into a Roman Catholic family in Straubing, in the Electorate of Bavaria, to Franz Xaver Fraunhofer and Maria Anna Fr\u00f6hlich. His father and paternal grandfather Johann Michael had been master glassmakers in Straubing. Fr\u00f6hlich's family also came from a lineage of glassmakers going back to the 16th century. He was orphaned at the age of 11 and started working as an apprentice to a harsh glassmaker named Philipp Anton Weichelsberger. In 1801, the workshop in which he was working collapsed, and he was buried in the rubble. The rescue operation was led by Prince-Elector Maximilian Joseph. The prince entered Fraunhofer's life, providing him with books and forcing his employer to allow the young Fraunhofer time to study.\nJoseph Utzschneider, a privy councilor, was also at the site of the disaster, and would also become a benefactor to Fraunhofer. With the money given to him by the prince upon his rescue and the support he received from Utzschneider, Fraunhofer was able to continue his education alongside his practical training. In 1806, Utzschneider and Georg von Reichenbach brought Fraunhofer into their Institute at Benediktbeuern, a secularised Benedictine monastery devoted to glassmaking. There he discovered how to make fine optical glass and invented precise methods for measuring optical dispersion.\nIt was at the Institute that Fraunhofer met Pierre-Louis Guinand (), a Swiss glass technician, who instructed Fraunhofer in glassmaking at Utzschneider's behest. By 1809, the mechanical part of the Optical Institute was chiefly under Fraunhofer's direction, and Fraunhofer became one of the members of the firm that same year. In 1814, Guinand left the firm, as did Reichenbach. Guinand would later become a partner with Fraunhofer in the firm, and the name was changed to Utzschneider-und-Fraunhofer. During 1818, Fraunhofer became the director of the Optical Institute. Due to the fine optical instruments developed by Fraunhofer, Bavaria overtook England as the center of the optics industry. Even the likes of Michael Faraday were unable to produce glass that could rival Fraunhofer.\nHis illustrious career eventually earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Erlangen in 1822. In 1824, Fraunhofer was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown by King Maximilian I, through which he was raised into personal nobility (with the title \"Ritter von\", i.e. knight). The same year, he was also made an honorary citizen of Munich.\nLike many glassmakers of his era, he was poisoned by heavy metal vapors, resulting in his premature death. Fraunhofer died in 1826 at the age of 39. His most valuable glassmaking recipes are thought to have gone to the grave with him.\nInvention and scientific research.\nOne of the most difficult operations of practical optics during the time period of Fraunhofer's life was accurately polishing the spherical surfaces of large object glasses. Fraunhofer invented the machine which rendered the surface more accurately than conventional grinding. He also invented other grinding and polishing machines and introduced many improvements into the manufacture of the different kinds of glass used for optical instruments, which he always found to have flaws and irregularities of various sorts.\nIn 1811, he constructed a new kind of furnace, and during his second melting session when he melted a large quantity of glass, he found that he could produce flint glass, which, when taken from the bottom of a vessel containing roughly 224 pounds of glass, had the same refractive power as glass taken from the surface. He found that English crown glass and German table glass both contained defects which tended to cause irregular refraction. In the thicker and larger glasses, there would be even more of such defects, so that in larger telescopes this kind of glass would not be fit for objective lenses. Fraunhofer accordingly made his own crown glass.\nIt was thought that the accurate determination of power for a given medium to refract rays of light and separate the different colors which they contain was impeded by the absence of precise boundaries between the colors of the spectrum, making it difficult to accurately measure the angle of refraction. To address this limitation, Fraunhofer performed a series of experiments for the purpose of producing homogeneous light artificially, and unable to effect his object in a direct way, he did so by means of lamps and prisms.\nDiscovery of dark absorption lines.\nBy 1814, Fraunhofer had invented the modern spectroscope. In the course of his experiments, he discovered a bright fixed line which appears in the orange color of the spectrum when it is produced by the light of fire. This line enabled him afterward to determine the absolute power of refraction in different substances. Experiments to ascertain whether the solar spectrum contained the same bright line in orange as the line produced by the orange of fire light led him to the discovery of 574 dark fixed lines in the solar spectrum. Today, millions of such fixed absorption lines are now known.\nContinuing to investigate, Fraunhofer detected dark lines also appearing in the spectra of several bright stars, but in slightly different arrangements. He ruled out the possibility that the lines were produced as the light passes through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. If that were the case they would not appear in different arrangements. He concluded that the lines originate in the nature of the stars and sun and carry information about the source of light, regardless of how far away that source is. He found that the spectra of Sirius and other first-magnitude stars differed from the sun and from each other, thus founding stellar spectroscopy.\nThese dark fixed lines were later shown to be mostly atomic absorption lines, as explained by Kirchhoff and Bunsen in 1859, with the rest identified as telluric lines originating from absorption by oxygen molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. These lines are still called \"Fraunhofer lines\" in his honor; his discovery had gone far beyond the half-dozen apparent divisions in the solar spectrum that had previously been noted by Wollaston in 1802.\nInvention of optical instruments.\nFraunhofer also developed a diffraction grating in 1821, after James Gregory discovered the phenomenon of diffraction grating and after the American astronomer David Rittenhouse invented the first manmade diffraction grating in 1785. Fraunhofer was the first who used a diffraction grating to obtain line spectra and the first who measured the wavelengths of spectral lines with a diffraction grating.\nUltimately, however, his primary passion was still practical optics; he once wrote that \"In all my experiments I could, owing to lack of time, pay attention to only those matters which appeared to have a bearing upon practical optics\".\nTelescopes and optical instruments.\nFraunhofer produced various optical instruments for his firm. This included the Fraunhofer Dorpat Refractor used by Struve (delivered 1824 to Dorpat Observatory), and the Bessel Heliometer (delivered posthumously), which were both used to collect data for stellar parallax. The firm's successor, Merz und Mahler, made a telescope for the New Berlin Observatory, which confirmed the existence of the major planet Neptune. Possibly the last telescope objective made by Fraunhofer was supplied for a transit telescope at the City Observatory, Edinburgh, the telescope itself being completed by Repsold of Hamburg after Fraunhofer's death.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were the daughters of the primordial sea gods Phorcys and Ceto and, among others, sisters of the Gorgons. Their names were Deino (), Pemphredo (), and Enyo (; not to be confused with the war goddess, Enyo). The Graeae are best known from their encounter with Perseus, who, after capturing their eye, forced them to reveal information about the Gorgons.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Graeae\" is probably derived from the adjective \"old woman\", derived from the Proto-Indo-European root , \"to grow old\" via .\nMythology.\nThe Graeae were daughters of the sea-deities Ceto and Phorcys (from which their name the Phorcydes derived) and sisters to the Gorgons. The Graeae took the form of old, grey-haired women. Their age was so great that a human childhood for them was hardly conceivable. In \"Theogony\", however, Hesiod describes the Graeae as being \"fair-cheeked\". In \"Prometheus Bound\", the Graeae are described as being \"ancient maidens of swan-like aspect\" (; perhaps here meaning \"white-haired\").\nHesiod names only two Graeae, the \"well-clad\" \"Pemphredo\" ( \"alarm\") and the \"saffron-robed\" Enyo (), while Apollodorus lists Deino ( \"dread\", the dreadful anticipation of horror) as a third. Calling them \"Phorcides\", Hyginus, in addition to Pemphredo and Enyo, adds Persis, noting that \"for this last others say Dino\".\nThey shared one eye and one tooth, which they took turns using. By stealing their eye while they were passing it among themselves, the hero Perseus forced them to tell the whereabouts of the three objects needed to kill Medusa (in other versions, the whereabouts of Medusa) by ransoming their shared eye for the information.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His first assignment was the construction of new railway lines in the Mayenne area, in the course of which his left arm had to be amputated after being crushed in a construction accident.\nIn 1886, Bienven\u00fce moved on to Paris to design and supervise the construction of aqueducts for the city, drawing water from the rivers Aube and Loire. Next, he built a cable railway near the Place de la R\u00e9publique and created the park of Buttes-Chaumont. \nParis city officials selected Bienven\u00fce to become chief engineer for the Paris M\u00e9tro in 1896. He designed a special way of building new tunnels which allowed the swift repaving of the roads above; this involved (among other things) building the crown of the tunnel first and the floor last, the reverse of the usual method at that time. Bienven\u00fce has the credit for the mostly swift and relatively uneventful construction of the M\u00e9tro through the difficult and heterogenous Parisian soils and rocks. He came up with the idea of freezing wet and unstable soil in order to permit the drilling of tunnels. He was to supervise the Paris Metro construction for more than three decades, finally retiring on 6\u00a0December 1932.\nBienven\u00fce's construction of the M\u00e9tro was widely praised and has been described admiringly as a work \"worthy of the Romans\". He eventually accumulated many honors for his engineering accomplishments, including the \"Grand Prix Berger\" of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (1909) and the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor (1929).\nOn 30\u00a0June 1933, the Avenue du Maine station on the Metro was renamed Bienven\u00fce in his honor. The naming ceremony took place in his presence; there was a last-minute scramble to repaint the station's new nameboards when it was discovered that the unusual diaeresis in his name had been omitted, making it the French word for \"welcome\". In 1942 the station was linked to the adjacent Montparnasse station, forming a single station named Montparnasse-Bienven\u00fce.\nBienven\u00fce was buried in 1936 at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\n\"Lyc\u00e9e Fulgence Bienven\u00fce\u200a\" high school in Loud\u00e9ac, Brittany is named after Bienven\u00fce.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are named after Augustus De Morgan, a 19th-century British mathematician. The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation.\nThe rules can be expressed in English as:\nor\nor\nwhere \"A or B\" is an \"inclusive or\" meaning \"at least\" one of A or B rather than an \"exclusive or\" that means \"exactly\" one of A or B.\nAnother form of De Morgan's law is the following as seen below.\nformula_1\nformula_2\nApplications of the rules include simplification of logical expressions in computer programs and digital circuit designs. De Morgan's laws are an example of a more general concept of mathematical duality.\nFormal notation.\nThe \"negation of conjunction\" rule may be written in sequent notation:\nformula_3\nThe \"negation of disjunction\" rule may be written as:\nformula_4\nIn rule form: \"negation of conjunction\"\nformula_5\nand \"negation of disjunction\"\nformula_6\nand expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 and formula_9 are propositions expressed in some formal system.\nThe generalized De Morgan's laws provide an equivalence for negating a conjunction or disjunction involving multiple terms.For a set of propositions formula_10, the generalized De Morgan's Laws are as follows:\nformula_11\nThese laws generalize De Morgan's original laws for negating conjunctions and disjunctions.\nSubstitution form.\nDe Morgan's laws are normally shown in the compact form above, with the negation of the output on the left and negation of the inputs on the right. A clearer form for substitution can be stated as:\nformula_12\nThis emphasizes the need to invert both the inputs and the output, as well as change the operator when doing a substitution.\nSet theory.\nIn set theory, it is often stated as \"union and intersection interchange under complementation\", which can be formally expressed as:\nformula_13\nwhere:\nUnions and intersections of any number of sets.\nThe generalized form is\n formula_18\nwhere \"I\" is some, possibly countably or uncountably infinite, indexing set.\nIn set notation, De Morgan's laws can be remembered using the mnemonic \"break the line, change the sign\".\nBoolean algebra.\nIn Boolean algebra, similarly, this law which can be formally expressed as:\nformula_19\nwhere:\nwhich can be generalized to\n formula_24\nEngineering.\nIn electrical and computer engineering, De Morgan's laws are commonly written as:\n formula_25\nand\n formula_26\nwhere:\nText searching.\nDe Morgan's laws commonly apply to text searching using Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. Consider a set of documents containing the words \"cats\" and \"dogs\". De Morgan's laws hold that these two searches will return the same set of documents:\nSearch A: NOT (cats OR dogs)\nSearch B: (NOT cats) AND (NOT dogs)\nThe corpus of documents containing \"cats\" or \"dogs\" can be represented by four documents:\nDocument 1: Contains only the word \"cats\".\nDocument 2: Contains only \"dogs\".\nDocument 3: Contains both \"cats\" and \"dogs\".\nDocument 4: Contains neither \"cats\" nor \"dogs\".\nTo evaluate Search A, clearly the search \"(cats OR dogs)\" will hit on Documents 1, 2, and 3. So the negation of that search (which is Search A) will hit everything else, which is Document 4.\nEvaluating Search B, the search \"(NOT cats)\" will hit on documents that do not contain \"cats\", which is Documents 2 and 4. Similarly the search \"(NOT dogs)\" will hit on Documents 1 and 4. Applying the AND operator to these two searches (which is Search B) will hit on the documents that are common to these two searches, which is Document 4.\nA similar evaluation can be applied to show that the following two searches will both return Documents 1, 2, and 4:\nSearch C: NOT (cats AND dogs),\nSearch D: (NOT cats) OR (NOT dogs).\nHistory.\nThe laws are named after Augustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871), who introduced a formal version of the laws to classical propositional logic. De Morgan's formulation was influenced by the algebraization of logic undertaken by George Boole, which later cemented De Morgan's claim to the find. Nevertheless, a similar observation was made by Aristotle, and was known to Greek and Medieval logicians. For example, in the 14th century, William of Ockham wrote down the words that would result by reading the laws out. Jean Buridan, in his , also describes rules of conversion that follow the lines of De Morgan's laws. Still, De Morgan is given credit for stating the laws in the terms of modern formal logic, and incorporating them into the language of logic. De Morgan's laws can be proved easily, and may even seem trivial. Nonetheless, these laws are helpful in making valid inferences in proofs and deductive arguments.\nProof for Boolean algebra.\nDe Morgan's theorem may be applied to the negation of a disjunction or the negation of a conjunction in all or part of a formula.\nNegation of a disjunction.\nIn the case of its application to a disjunction, consider the following claim: \"it is false that either of A or B is true\", which is written as:\nformula_29\nIn that it has been established that \"neither\" A nor B is true, then it must follow that both A is not true and B is not true, which may be written directly as:\nformula_30\nIf either A or B \"were\" true, then the disjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Presented in English, this follows the logic that \"since two things are both false, it is also false that either of them is true\".\nWorking in the opposite direction, the second expression asserts that A is false and B is false (or equivalently that \"not A\" and \"not B\" are true). Knowing this, a disjunction of A and B must be false also. The negation of said disjunction must thus be true, and the result is identical to the first claim.\nNegation of a conjunction.\nThe application of De Morgan's theorem to conjunction is very similar to its application to a disjunction both in form and rationale. Consider the following claim: \"it is false that A and B are both true\", which is written as:\nformula_31\nIn order for this claim to be true, either or both of A or B must be false, for if they both were true, then the conjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Thus, one (at least) or more of A and B must be false (or equivalently, one or more of \"not A\" and \"not B\" must be true). This may be written directly as,\nformula_32\nPresented in a natural language like English, it is expressed as \"since it is false that two things are both true, at least one of them must be false\".\nWorking in the opposite direction again, the second expression asserts that at least one of \"not A\" and \"not B\" must be true, or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false. Since at least one of them must be false, then their conjunction would likewise be false. Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression, and this expression is identical to the first claim.\nProof for set theory.\nHere we use formula_14 to denote the complement of A, as above in . The proof that formula_34 is completed in 2 steps by proving both formula_35 and formula_36.\nPart 1.\nLet formula_37. Then, formula_38.\nBecause formula_39, it must be the case that formula_40 or formula_41.\nIf formula_40, then formula_43, so formula_44.\nSimilarly, if formula_41, then formula_46, so formula_47.\nThus, formula_48;\nthat is, formula_35.\nPart 2.\nTo prove the reverse direction, let formula_44, and for contradiction assume formula_51.\nUnder that assumption, it must be the case that formula_52,\nso it follows that formula_53 and formula_54, and thus formula_55 and formula_56.\nHowever, that means formula_57, in contradiction to the hypothesis that formula_44,\ntherefore, the assumption formula_51 must not be the case, meaning that formula_60.\nHence, formula_61,\nthat is, formula_36.\nConclusion.\nIf formula_36 \"and\" formula_64, then formula_34; this concludes the proof of De Morgan's law.\nThe other De Morgan's law, formula_66, is proven similarly.\nGeneralising De Morgan duality.\nIn extensions of classical propositional logic, the duality still holds (that is, to any logical operator one can always find its dual), since in the presence of the identities governing negation, one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another. This leads to an important property of logics based on classical logic, namely the existence of negation normal forms: any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the non-logical atoms of the formula. The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications, for example in digital circuit design, where it is used to manipulate the types of logic gates, and in formal logic, where it is needed to find the conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form of a formula. Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated logical conditions. They are also often useful in computations in elementary probability theory.\nLet one define the dual of any propositional operator P(\"p\", \"q\", ...) depending on elementary propositions \"p\", \"q\", ... to be the operator formula_67 defined by\nformula_68\nExtension to predicate and modal logic.\nThis duality can be generalised to quantifiers, so for example the universal quantifier and existential quantifier are duals:\nformula_69\nformula_70\nTo relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws, consider a domain of discourse \"D\" (with some small number of entities) to which properties are ascribed universally and existentially, such as\n\"D\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}.\nThen express universal quantifier equivalently by conjunction of individual statements \nformula_71\nand existential quantifier by disjunction of individual statements \nformula_72\nBut, using De Morgan's laws,\nformula_73\nand\nformula_74\nverifying the quantifier dualities in the model.\nThen, the quantifier dualities can be extended further to modal logic, relating the box (\"necessarily\") and diamond (\"possibly\") operators:\nformula_75\nformula_76\nIn its application to the alethic modalities of possibility and necessity, Aristotle observed this case, and in the case of normal modal logic, the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using Kripke semantics.\nIn intuitionistic logic.\nThree out of the four implications of de Morgan's laws hold in intuitionistic logic. Specifically, we have\nformula_77\nand\nformula_78\nThe converse of the last implication does not hold in pure intuitionistic logic. That is, the failure of the joint proposition formula_79 cannot necessarily be resolved to the failure of either of the two conjuncts. For example, from knowing it not to be the case that both Alice and Bob showed up to their date, it does not follow who did not show up. The latter principle is equivalent to the principle of the weak excluded middle formula_80,\nformula_81\nThis weak form can be used as a foundation for an intermediate logic.\nFor a refined version of the failing law concerning existential statements, see the lesser limited principle of omniscience formula_82, which however is different from formula_83.\nThe validity of the other three De Morgan's laws remains true if negation formula_84 is replaced by implication formula_85 for some arbitrary constant predicate C, meaning that the above laws are still true in minimal logic.\nSimilarly to the above, the quantifier laws:\nformula_86\nand\nformula_87\nare tautologies even in minimal logic with negation replaced with implying a fixed formula_9, while the converse of the last law does not have to be true in general.\nFurther, one still has\nformula_89\nformula_90\nformula_91\nformula_92\nbut their inversion implies excluded middle, formula_93.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The act gradually phased out and disbanded the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), but the regulatory powers of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over all aspects of aviation safety were not diminished.\nHistory.\nSince 1938, the federal CAB had regulated all domestic interstate air transport routes as a public utility, setting fares, routes, and schedules. Airlines that flew only intrastate routes, however, were not regulated by the CAB but were regulated by the governments of the states in which they operated. One way that the CAB promoted air travel was generally attempting to hold fares down in the short-haul market, which would be subsidized by higher fares in the long-haul market. The CAB also had to ensure that the airlines had a reasonable rate of return.\nThe CAB had earned a reputation for bureaucratic complacency; airlines were subject to lengthy delays when they applied for new routes or fare changes, and were often not approved. For example, World Airways applied to begin a low-fare New York City\u2013to\u2013Los Angeles route in 1967; the CAB studied the request for over six years, only to dismiss it because the record was \"stale\". Continental Airlines began service between Denver and San Diego after eight years only because a United States Court of Appeals ordered the CAB to approve the application.\nThis rigid system encountered tremendous pressure in the 1970s. The 1973 oil crisis and stagflation radically changed the economic environment, as did technological advances such as the jumbo jet. Most major airlines, whose profits were virtually guaranteed, favored the rigid system, but passengers who were forced to pay escalating fares were against it and were joined by communities that subsidized air service at ever-higher rates. The United States Congress became concerned that air transport, in the long run, might follow the nation's railroads into trouble. The Penn Central Railroad had collapsed in 1970, which was at that time the largest bankruptcy in history; this resulted in a huge taxpayer-funded bailout and the creation of the government-owned corporations Conrail and Amtrak.\nLeading economists had argued for several decades that the regulation led to inefficiency and higher costs. The Carter administration argued that the industry and its customers would benefit from new entrants, the abolishing of price regulation, and reduced control over routes and hub cities.\nIn 1970 and 1971, the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon administration, along with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and other agencies, proposed legislation to diminish price collusion and entry barriers in rail and trucking transportation. While the initiative was in process in the Ford administration, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which had jurisdiction over antitrust law, began hearings on airline deregulation in 1975. Senator Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy took the lead in the hearings.\nThe committee was deemed a friendlier forum than what likely would have been the more appropriate venue, the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee. The Ford administration supported the Judiciary Committee initiative.\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of economics at Cornell University, to be chair of the CAB. A concerted push for the legislation had developed from leading economists, leading think-tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. The coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.\nDan McKinnon would be the last chairman of the CAB and would oversee its final closure on January 1, 1985.\nLegislative terms.\nSenator Howard Cannon of Nevada introduced S. 2493 on February 6, 1978. The bill was passed and was signed by Carter on October 24, 1978.\nThe stated goals of the Act included the following:\nThe Act intended for various restrictions on airline operations to be removed over four years, with complete elimination of restrictions on domestic routes and new services by December 31, 1981, and the end of all domestic fare regulation by January 1, 1983. In practice, changes came rather more rapidly than that.\nAmong its many terms, the act did the following:\nSafety inspections and air traffic control remained in the hands of the FAA, and the act also required the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress about air safety and any implications that deregulation would have in that matter.\nThe ADA (along with the Montreal Convention with regard to international flights) also has the effect of preempting state law with regard to claims against airlines for delays, discrimination, consumer protection violations and other allegations of passenger mistreatment.\nEffects.\nA 1996 Government Accountability Office report found that the average fare per passenger mile was about nine percent lower in 1994 than in 1979. Between 1976 and 1990 the paid fare had declined approximately thirty percent in inflation-adjusted terms. Passenger loads have risen, partly because airlines can now transfer larger aircraft to longer, busier routes and replace them with smaller ones on shorter, lower-traffic routes.\nHowever, these trends have not been distributed evenly throughout the national air transportation network. Costs have fallen more dramatically on higher-traffic, longer-distance routes than on shorter ones.\nExposure to competition led to heavy losses and conflicts with labor unions for a number of carriers. Between 1978 and mid-2001, eight major carriers (Eastern, Midway, Braniff, Pan Am, Continental, Northwest Airlines, Frontier, and TWA) and more than 100 smaller airlines went bankrupt or were liquidated, including most of the dozens of new airlines founded in deregulation's aftermath.\nFor the most part, smaller markets did not suffer the erosion of service that had been predicted by some opponents of deregulation. However, until the advent of low-cost carriers, point-to-point air transport declined in favor of a more pronounced hub-and-spoke system. A traveler starting from a non-hub airport (a spoke) would fly into the hub, then reach the final destination by flying from the hub to another airport, the spoke. While more efficient for serving smaller markets, this system has enabled some airlines to drive out competition from their \"fortress hubs.\" The growth of low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines has brought more point-to-point service back into the United States air transport system, and contributed to the development of a wider range of aircraft types that are better adaptable to markets of varying sizes.\nIn 2011, Supreme Court Justice member Stephen Breyer, who was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the 1970s and worked with Senator Kennedy on the bill, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What does the industry's history tell us? Was this effort worthwhile? Certainly it shows that every major reform brings about new, sometimes unforeseen, problems. No one foresaw the industry's spectacular growth, with the number of air passengers increasing from 207.5 million in 1974 to 721.1 million last year. As a result, no one foresaw the extent to which new bottlenecks would develop: a flight-choked Northeast corridor, overcrowded airports, delays, and terrorist risks consequently making air travel increasingly difficult. Nor did anyone foresee the extent to which change might unfairly harm workers in the industry. Still, fares have come down. Airline revenue per passenger mile has declined from an inflation-adjusted 33.3 cents in 1974, to 13 cents in the first half of 2010. In 1974 the cheapest round-trip New York-Los Angeles flight (in inflation-adjusted dollars) that regulators would allow: $1,442. Today one can fly that same route for $268. That is why the number of travelers has gone way up. So we sit in crowded planes, munch potato chips, flare up when the loudspeaker announces yet another flight delay. But how many now will vote to go back to the \"good old days\" of paying high, regulated prices for better service? Even among business travelers, who wants to pay \"full fare for the briefcase?\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He achieved fame with a leading role on the comedy-drama series \"Moonlighting\" (1985\u20131989) and has appeared in over one hundred films, gaining recognition as an action hero for his portrayal of John McClane in the \"Die Hard\" franchise (1988\u20132013).\nWillis's other credits include \"The Last Boy Scout\" (1991), \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), \"12 Monkeys\" (1995), \"The Fifth Element\" (1997), \"Armageddon\" (1998), \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999), \"Unbreakable\", \"The Whole Nine Yards\" (both 2000), \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), \"Sin City\" (2005), \"The Expendables\", \"Red\" (both 2010), \"Looper\" (2012), and \"Glass\" (2019). In the last years of his career, he starred in many low-budget direct-to-video films, which were poorly received. Willis retired in 2022 due to aphasia, and was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023.\nAs a singer, Willis released his debut album, \"The Return of Bruno\", in 1987, followed by two more albums in 1989 and 2001. He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of \"Misery\" in 2015. Willis has received various accolades throughout his career, including a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. Films featuring Willis have grossed between US$ and US$3.05\u00a0billion at North American box offices, making him the eighth-highest-grossing leading actor in 2010.\nEarly life and education.\nWalter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany; his mother, Marlene, was from Kassel, Germany, and his father, David Willis (1929\u20132009), was an American soldier. He has a younger sister, Florence, and two younger brothers, Robert (1959\u20132001) and David. After being discharged from the military in 1957, his father relocated the family to his hometown of Carneys Point, New Jersey. Willis has described his background as a \"long line of blue-collar people\". His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic and factory worker.\nWillis spoke with a stutter. He attended Penns Grove High School in Carneys Point Township, where his schoolmates nicknamed him \"Buck-Buck\". Willis joined the drama club, and found that acting on stage reduced his stutter. He was eventually elected student council president. He graduated from Penns Grove in 1973.\nAfter graduating from high school, Willis worked as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported crew members at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater. He turned to acting after working as a private investigator, a role he would later play in the comedy-drama series \"Moonlighting\" and the action-comedy film \"The Last Boy Scout\".\nWillis enrolled in the drama program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in a production of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". He left the school in 1977, and moved to New York City, where he supported himself in the early 1980s as a bartender at various nightspots in Manhattan including Kamikaze, Cafe Central &amp; Chelsea Central, while living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.\nCareer.\n1980s: \"Moonlighting\", \"Die Hard\" and rise to fame.\nWillis was cast as David Addison Jr. in the television series \"Moonlighting\" (1985\u20131989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position. His starring role in \"Moonlighting\", opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor. During the show's five seasons, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy. During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products. The advertising campaign paid Willis US$5\u20137\u00a0million over two years. Willis chose not to renew his contract when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.\nIn 1987, Willis obtained his first lead role in the Blake Edwards film \"Blind Date\", co-starring with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in \"Sunset\" (1988). The same year, he starred in an action role in \"Die Hard\" (1988) as John McClane. He performed most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with \"Die Hard\", Willis had a leading role in the drama \"In Country\" as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in \"Look Who's Talking\" (1989) and the sequel \"Look Who's Talking Too\" (1990).\nIn the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues, \"The Return of Bruno\", which included the hit single \"Respect Yourself\" featuring the Pointer Sisters. The LP was promoted by a \"Spinal Tap\"\u2013like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song \"Under the Boardwalk\" as a second single; it reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, but was less successful in the US. Willis returned to the recording studio several times.\n1990s: \"Die Hard\" sequels, \"Pulp Fiction\" and dramatic roles.\nHaving acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in \"Die Hard\", Willis reprised his role in the sequels \"Die Hard 2\" (1990) and \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" (1995). These first three installments in the \"Die Hard\" series grossed over US$700\u00a0million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars. At one point, \"Die Hard 2\" and \"Ghost\", starring Willis's then wife Demi Moore, would occupy the number one and number two spots at the box office, a feat that would not be accomplished again for a married Hollywood couple until 2024.\nIn the early 1990s, Willis's career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" (1990) and \"Hudson Hawk\" (1991), although he did find box office success with \"The Last Boy Scout\" (1991). He gained more success with \"Striking Distance\" (1993) but flopped again with \"Color of Night\" (1994): it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995. \"Maxim\" also ranked his sex scene in the film as the best in film history.\nIn 1994, Willis also had a leading role in one part of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed \"Pulp Fiction;\" the film's success gave a boost to his career, and he starred alongside his \"Look Who's Talking\" co-star John Travolta. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon \"Bruno the Kid\" which featured a CGI representation of himself. That same year, he starred in Mike Judge's animated film \"Beavis and Butt-head Do America\" with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named \"Muddy Grimes\", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in \"12 Monkeys\" (1995) and \"The Fifth Element\" (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like \"The Jackal\" (which despite negative reviews was a box office hit), \"Mercury Rising\", and \"Breakfast of Champions\", as well as the implosion of the production of \"Broadway Brawler\", a debacle salvaged only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed \"Armageddon\", which Willis had agreed to star in as compensation for the failed production, and which turned out to be the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game \"Apocalypse\". In 1999, Willis played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film \"The Sixth Sense\", which was both a commercial and critical success.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Willis won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on \"Friends\" (in which he played the father of Ross Geller's much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on \"Friends\". Also in 2000, Willis played Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski in \"The Whole Nine Yards\" alongside \"Friends\" star Matthew Perry, and Russ Duritz in \"Disney's The Kid\" opposite Emily Mortimer. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001) but dropped out to work on recording an album. In the sequel, \"Ocean's Twelve\" (2004), he makes a cameo appearance as himself. In 2005, he appeared in the film adaptation of \"Sin City\". In 2006, he lent his voice as RJ the Raccoon in \"Over the Hedge\". In 2007, he appeared in the \"Planet Terror\" half of the double feature \"Grindhouse\" as the villain, a mutant soldier. This marked Willis's second collaboration with the director Robert Rodriguez, following \"Sin City\".\nWillis appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show on February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis staged elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated birdshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (a parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.\nOn April 12, 2007, he appeared again, this time wearing a Sanjaya Malakar wig. On his June 25, 2007, appearance, he wore a mini-wind turbine on his head to accompany a joke about his own fictional documentary titled \"An Unappealing Hunch\" (a wordplay on \"An Inconvenient Truth\"). Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials. Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged \"Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce\", in honor of Willis.\nWillis has appeared in five films with Samuel\u00a0L. Jackson (1993's National Lampoon's \"Loaded Weapon 1\", 1994's \"Pulp Fiction\", 1995's \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\", 2000's \"Unbreakable\", and 2019's \"Glass\") and both actors were slated to work together in \"Black Water Transit\", before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film \"Hostage\". In 2006, he appeared in the crime/drama film \"Alpha Dog\", opposite Sharon Stone. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller \"Perfect Stranger\", opposite Halle Berry, and reprised his role as John McClane in \"Live Free or Die Hard\". Subsequently, he appeared in the films \"What Just Happened\" (2008) and \"Surrogates\" (2009), based on the comic book of the same name.\nWillis was slated to play U.S. Army general William\u00a0R. Peers in director Oliver Stone's \"Pinkville\", a drama about the investigation of the 1968 My Lai massacre. However, due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, the film was canceled. Willis appeared on the 2008 Blues Traveler album \"North Hollywood Shootout\", giving a spoken word performance over an instrumental blues rock jam on the track \"Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob's Machine Shop)\". In early 2009, he appeared in an advertising campaign to publicize the insurance company Norwich Union's change of name to Aviva.\n2010s.\nAs of 2010, Willis was the eighth highest-grossing actor in a leading role and 12th-highest including supporting roles. Willis starred with Tracy Morgan in the 2010 comedy \"Cop Out\", directed by Kevin Smith, about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card. Willis appeared in the music video for the song \"Stylo\" by Gorillaz. Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with the former Planet Hollywood co-owners and 80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film \"The Expendables\". Willis played the role of CIA agent \"Mr. Church\". It was the first time the three action stars had appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, it was one of the most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009. Willis next starred in \"Red\", an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.\nWillis starred alongside Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Frances McDormand in \"Moonrise Kingdom\" (2012). Filming took place in Rhode Island under the direction of Wes Anderson, in 2011. Willis returned, in an expanded role, in \"The Expendables 2\" (2012). He appeared alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the sci-fi action film \"Looper\" (2012), as the older version of Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe.\nWillis teamed up with 50 Cent in a film directed by David Barrett called \"Fire with Fire\", starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a fireman who must save the love of his life. Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in \"Lay the Favorite\", directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler. The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.\nWillis reprised his most famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, starring in \"A Good Day to Die Hard\", which was released on February 14, 2013. In an interview, Willis said, \"I have a warm spot in my heart for \"Die Hard\"... it's just the sheer novelty of being able to play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in \"Die Hard\". I try to improve my work every time.\" That same year, Willis reprised his role as Frank Moses in \"Red 2\".\nOn October 12, 2013, Willis hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" with Katy Perry as a musical guest. In 2015, Willis made his Broadway debut in William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen King's novel \"Misery\" opposite Laurie Metcalf at the Broadhurst Theatre. His performance was generally panned by critics, who called it \"vacant\" and \"inert\". Willis was the subject of a roast by Comedy Central in a program broadcast on July 29, 2018. Willis played himself in a cameo in the 2019 film \"\".\n2020s: Critical decline, health problems and retirement.\nIn the final years of his career, Willis starred in many low-budget independent thrillers and science fiction films. He worked primarily with the production companies Emmett/Furla Oasis (which produced 20 films starring Willis) and 308 Entertainment Inc. Most of the films were released direct-to-video and were widely panned. The Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual award for the year's worst films and performances, created a dedicated category, the Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 Movie, for Willis's roles in eight films released that year. Chris Nashawaty of \"Esquire\" described the direct-to-video films as \"a profitable safe harbor\" for older actors, similar to \"The Expendables\". Willis would often earn US$2 million for two days' work, with an average of 15 minutes' screentime per film. He nonetheless featured heavily in the films' promotional materials, earning them the derogatory nickname \"geezer teasers\". \nThose working on the films later said Willis appeared confused, did not understand why he was there and had to be fed lines through an earpiece. Days before Willis was scheduled to arrive on set for \"Out of Death\" (2021), the screenwriter, Bill Lawrence, was instructed to reduce his role and abbreviate his dialogue. The director, Mike Burns, was told to complete all of Willis's scenes in a single day of filming. \nOn March 30, 2022, Willis's family announced that he was retiring because he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder typically caused by damage to the area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension. The Golden Raspberry Awards retracted its Willis category, deeming it inappropriate to give a Razzie to someone whose performance was affected by a medical condition. At the time of his retirement, Willis had completed 11 films awaiting release.\nBusiness activities.\nWillis owns houses in Los Angeles and Penns Grove, New Jersey. He also rents apartments at Trump Tower and in Riverside South, Manhattan. In 2000, Willis and his business partner Arnold Rifkin started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after \"Live Free or Die Hard\". He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and was one of the first promoters of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Willis and the other actors were paid for their appearances and endorsements through an employee stock ownership plan.\nIn 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company. In 2018, Willis became the brand ambassador of the Hungarian brand Hell Energy Drink.\nPersonal life.\nWillis's acting role models are Gary Cooper, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen, and John Wayne. He is left-handed. He resides in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles with his family.\nOn November 21, 1987, Willis married Demi Moore at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. On December 20, the couple held a second reception for about 450 guests on a soundstage at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank. They have three daughters: Rumer (b. 1988), Scout (b. 1991), and Tallulah (b. 1994). Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998. They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000, and the divorce was finalized later that day. Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, \"I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.\" He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation. He has maintained a close friendship with both Moore and her subsequent husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding.\nWillis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after ten months together. He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009; guests included his three daughters, as well as Moore and Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills six days later. The couple has two daughters, one born in 2012 and another born in 2014.\nIn August 2025, Emma revealed that she and Willis were now living in separate homes. Emma said that this was due to Willis' declining health, with his new, separate one-story home being better suited to accommodate his progressing frontotemporal dementia.\nHealth.\nOn February 16, 2023, Willis's family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. According to Gregg Day, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic's Florida campus, the symptoms include difficulties with language and comprehension, and misinterpretation of instructions. In a statement, the family said that Willis's condition had progressed and that \"challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease\". They expressed hope that media attention on Willis would raise awareness about the disease. Emma Willis's memoir \"The Unexpected Journey\", which focuses on her experience as her husband's caregiver, was published in September 2025.\nAccording to Heming, as his condition progressed, Willis's family made the decision to have him live in a separate, one-story home designed to accommodate his needs and provide a calm environment. This arrangement was intended to prioritize the well-being of their two daughters, Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn, ensuring they have a stable home life while still maintaining close contact with their father. Willis resides in this home with a full-time care team, and his family visits him regularly, often for meals and quality time. Despite the separation, the family emphasizes that the home remains filled with love, care, and laughter, reflecting their commitment to supporting Willis through his health challenges.\nMilitary interests.\nThroughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as \"In Country\", \"The Siege\", \"Hart's War\", \"Tears of the Sun\", \"Grindhouse\", and \"\". Willis grew up in a military family. Willis has donated Girl Scout cookies to the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS \"John\u00a0F. Kennedy\" and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.\nIn 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered US$1\u00a0million to any noncombatant who turned in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press was more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:\nReligious beliefs.\nWillis was a Lutheran, but says he no longer practices. In a July 1998 interview with \"George\" magazine, he said, \"Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?\"\nWhen asked by a \"Hollywood.tv\" reporter how he stays grounded in Hollywood, Willis said, \"I just thank God every day for...everything great that's come my way.\"\nPolitical views.\nIn 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for then Democratic Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign in the 1988 presidential elections. In the 1992 presidential election, however, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. In 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole because Dole criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film \"Striptease\". Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year.\nIn 2006, Willis said that the United States should intervene more extensively in Colombia to end drug trafficking from that nation. In several interviews Willis has said that he supports increased salaries for teachers and police officers, and that he is disappointed in the United States foster care system and its treatment of Native Americans. Willis has supported gun rights, saying, \"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.\"\nIn February 2006, when Willis was in Manhattan to promote his film \"16 Blocks\", he was asked his opinion on the Bush administration. Willis responded: \"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.\" Willis did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he said that he maintains some beliefs aligned with Republican ideas.\nOn August 17, 2006, Willis was named in a \"Los Angeles Times\" advertisement that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. In the 2012 presidential election, Willis said that he had a negative opinion of Mitt Romney.\nActing credits and accolades.\nWillis has won a variety of awards and has received various honors throughout his career in television and film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

De Bruijn debuted at the World Aquatics Championships in January 1991, winning a bronze medal with the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay team, with which she won the gold medal at the European LC Championships in August of that year.\nThe following year, de Bruijn made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and finished 8th in the 100\u00a0m and 4\u00d7100\u00a0m freestyle events. She did not compete at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1999, she won the 50\u00a0m freestyle at the European Championships. The following year, after having swum several 50\u00a0m freestyle world records, she competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She won the 50 and 100\u00a0m freestyle, and the 100\u00a0m butterfly, setting world records in all three events. She also won a silver medal with the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m freestyle relay team. Her nickname became \"Invincible Inky\".\nShe was named by \"Swimming World\" as the \"Female World Swimmer of the Year\" in both 2000 and 2001. She won titles in three events at the 2001 World Championships. At the 2003 World Championships, de Bruijn successfully defended her 50\u00a0m freestyle and butterfly titles. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she defended her gold medal in the 50\u00a0m free, and took silver in the 100\u00a0m free, and two bronze: one in the 100\u00a0m butterfly and another in the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay. This made her the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history. This record was only surpassed by Anthony Ervin at the age of 36, he won the gold medal for the men's 50m freestyle at the Rio 2016 Olympics. De Bruijn's 2004 title retains its place as the oldest female Olympic champion in swimming history.\nWith an Olympic medal total of four gold, two silver and two bronze, she is the fourth most successful Dutch Olympian of all time. Moreover, her combined nine individual titles won at the Olympics (four) and World Aquatics Championships (five) were a record for female swimmers until Katie Ledecky won her 10th at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nIn March 2007, de Bruijn announced her retirement from competitive swimming.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a de Bruijn swam only in the heats\nPost-swimming career.\nDe Bruijn resides in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and previously trained in Portland, Oregon.\nShe was the face for Dutch lingerie brand \"Sapph\", along with kickboxer Remy Bonjasky, the face for the men's line of the brand.\nShe appeared in a special episode of the Dutch naked dating reality television programme \"Adam Zkt.

Constantine's death marked the definitive end of the Eastern Roman Empire, which traced its origin to Constantine the Great's foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire's new capital in 330.\nConstantine was the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Serbian noblewoman Helena Draga\u0161. Little is known of his early life, but from the 1420s onward, he repeatedly demonstrated great skill as a military general. Based on his career and surviving contemporary sources, Constantine appears to have been primarily a soldier. This does not mean that Constantine was not also a skilled administrator: he was trusted and favored to such an extent by his older brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, that he was designated as regent twice during John VIII's journeys away from Constantinople in 1423\u20131424 and 1437\u20131440. In 1427\u20131428, Constantine and John fended off an attack on the Morea (the Peloponnese) by Carlo I Tocco, ruler of Epirus, and in 1428 Constantine was proclaimed Despot of the Morea and ruled the province together with his older brother Theodore and his younger brother Thomas. Together, they extended Roman rule to cover almost the entire Peloponnese for the first time since the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years before and rebuilt the ancient Hexamilion wall, which defended the peninsula from outside attacks. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Constantine personally led a campaign into Central Greece and Thessaly in 1444\u20131446, attempting to extend Byzantine rule into Greece once more.\nIn October 1448, John VIII died without children, and as his favored successor, Constantine was proclaimed emperor on 6 January 1449. During his brief reign, Constantine would have to deal with three main issues. First, there was the issue of an heir, as Constantine was also childless. Despite attempts by Constantine's friend and confidant George Sphrantzes to find him a wife, Constantine ultimately died unmarried. The second concern was religious conflict within what little remained of his empire. Emperor Constantine and his predecessor John VIII both supported the reunion between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches proclaimed at the Council of Florence. They accordingly sought to secure military aid from Catholic Europe, but much of the Byzantine populace, led by Mark of Ephesus, opposed the church union. Finally, the most important concern was the growing Ottoman Empire, which by 1449 completely surrounded Constantinople. In April 1453, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II laid siege to Constantinople with an army perhaps numbering as many as 80,000 men. Even though the city's defenders may have numbered less than a tenth of the sultan's army, Constantine considered the idea of abandoning Constantinople unthinkable. The emperor stayed to defend the city, which fell on 29 May 1453. Constantine died in battle on the following day. Although no reliable eyewitness accounts of his death survived, most historical accounts agree that the emperor died fighting in a last stand against the Ottomans.\nConstantine was the last Christian ruler of Constantinople, which alongside his bravery at the city's fall cemented him as a near-legendary figure in later histories and Greek folklore. Some saw the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) under Constantine the Great and its loss under another Constantine as fulfillment of the city's destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by a Romulus and lost under another, Romulus Augustulus. He became known in later Greek folklore as the Marble Emperor (, lit.\u2009'Emperor turned into Marble'), reflecting a popular legend that Constantine had not actually died, but had been rescued by an angel and turned into marble, hidden beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople awaiting a call from God to be restored to life and reconquer both the city and the old empire.\nEarly life.\nFamily and background.\nConstantine Dragases Palaiologos was born on 8 February 1404 as the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (r.1391\u20131425), the eighth emperor of the Palaiologos dynasty. Constantine's mother (from whom he took his second last name) was Helena Draga\u0161, member of the powerful House of Draga\u0161 and daughter of Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanovi\u0107. Through his paternal grandmother, Helena (1333\u20131396), Constantine was related to the prominent Kantakouzenos family, while his maternal lineage linked him to the Serbian imperial Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. Constantine is frequently described as \"Porphyrog\u00e9nn\u0113tos\" (\"born in the purple\"), a distinction granted to sons born to a reigning emperor in the imperial palace.\nManuel ruled a disintegrating and dwindling Byzantine Empire. The catalyst of Byzantium's fall had been the arrival of the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia in the 11th century. Though some emperors, such as Alexios I and Manuel I, had successfully recovered portions of Anatolia through help from western crusaders, their gains were only temporary. Anatolia was the empire's most fertile, populated, and wealthy region, and after its loss, Byzantium more or less experienced constant decline. Although most of it was eventually reconquered, the Byzantine Empire was crippled by the 1204 Fourth Crusade and the loss of Constantinople to the Latin Empire, formed by the crusaders. The Byzantine Empire, under the founder of the Palaiologos dynasty, Michael VIII, retook Constantinople in 1261. Over the course of the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks had conquered vast swaths of territories and by 1405, they ruled much of Anatolia, Bulgaria, central Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Thessaly. The Byzantine Empire, once extending throughout the eastern Mediterranean, was reduced to the imperial capital of Constantinople, the Peloponnese, and a handful of islands in the Aegean Sea, and was also forced to pay tribute to the Ottomans.\nAs the empire dwindled, the emperors concluded that the only way to ensure that their remaining territory was kept intact was to grant some of their holdings to their sons, who received the title of despot, as appanages to defend and govern. Manuel's oldest son, John, was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed his father. The second son, Theodore, was designated as the Despot of the Morea (the prosperous province constituting the Peloponnese) and the third son, Andronikos, was proclaimed as Despot of Thessaloniki in 1408. The younger sons; Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas, were kept in Constantinople as there was not sufficient land left to grant them.\nLittle is known of Constantine's early life. From an early age, he was admired by George Sphrantzes (later a famed Byzantine historian), who would later enter his service, and later encomiasts often wrote that Constantine had always been courageous, adventurous, and skilled in martial arts, horsemanship, and hunting. Many accounts of Constantine's life, both before and after he became emperor, are heavily skewed and eulogize his reign, as most of them lack contemporary sources and were composed after his death. Based on his actions and the surviving commentary from some of his advisors and contemporaries, Constantine appeared to have been more comfortable with military matters than with matters of state or diplomacy, though he was also a competent administrator\u2014as illustrated by his tenures as regent\u2014and tended to heed his councilors' advice on important matters of state. Aside from stylized and smudged depictions on seals and coins, no contemporary depictions of Constantine survive. Notable images of Constantine include a seal currently located in Vienna (of unknown provenance, probably from an imperial chrysobull), a few coins, and his portrait among the other Byzantine emperors in the Biblioteca Estense copy of the history of Zonaras. In the latter he is shown with a rounded beard, in noted contrast to his forked-bearded relatives, but it is unclear whether that reflects his actual appearance.\nEarly career.\nAfter an unsuccessful Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1422, Manuel II suffered a stroke and was left paralyzed in one side of his body. He lived for another three years, but the empire's government was effectively in the hands of Constantine's brother John. Thessaloniki was also under siege by the Ottomans; to prevent it from falling into their hands, John gave the city to the Republic of Venice. As Manuel II had once hoped years ago, John hoped to rally support from Western Europe, and he left Constantinople in November 1423 to travel to Venice and Hungary. By this time, Manuel had abandoned his hope of western aid and had even attempted to dissuade John from pursuing it. Manuel believed that an eventual church union, which would become John's goal, would only antagonize the Turks and the empire's populace, which could have started a civil war.\nJohn was impressed by his brother's actions during the 1422 Ottoman siege, and trusted him more than his other brothers. Constantine was given the title of despot and was left to rule Constantinople as regent. With the aid of his bedridden father Manuel, Constantine drew up a new peace treaty with the Ottoman sultan Murad II, who momentarily spared Constantinople from further Turkish attacks. John returned from his journey in November 1424 after failing to procure help. On 21 July 1425, Manuel died and John became the senior emperor, John VIII Palaiologos. Constantine was granted a strip of land to the north of Constantinople that extended from the town of Mesembria in the north to Derkos in the south. It also included the port of Selymbria as his appanage in 1425. Although this strip of land was small, it was close to Constantinople and strategically important, which demonstrated that Constantine was trusted by both Manuel II and John.\nAfter Constantine's successful tenure as regent, John deemed his brother loyal and capable. Because their brother Theodore expressed his discontent over his position as Despot of the Morea to John during the latter's visit in 1423, John soon recalled Constantine from Mesembria and designated him as Theodore's successor. Theodore eventually changed his mind, but John would eventually assign Constantine to the Morea as a despot in 1427 after a campaign there. Though Theodore was content to rule in the Morea, historian Donald Nicol believes that the support was helpful, as the peninsula was repeatedly threatened by external forces throughout the 1420s. In 1423, the Ottomans broke through the ancient Hexamilion wall\u2014which guarded the Peloponnese\u2014and devastated the Morea. The Morea was also constantly threatened by Carlo I Tocco, the Italian ruler of Epirus, who campaigned against Theodore shortly before the Ottoman invasion and again in 1426, occupying territory in the northwestern parts of the Morea.\nIn 1427, John VIII personally set out to deal with Tocco, bringing Constantine and Sphrantzes with him. On 26 December 1427, the two brothers reached Mystras, the capital of the Morea, and made their way to the town of Glarentza, which was captured by the Epirotes. In the Battle of the Echinades, a naval skirmish off the coast of Glarentza, Tocco was defeated and he agreed to relinquish his conquests in the Morea. In order to seal the peace, Tocco offered his niece, Creusa Tocco (whose name was later changed to the Greek \"Theodora\"), in marriage to Constantine, her dowry being Glarentza and the other Moreot territories. Glarentza was given to the Byzantines on 1 May 1428 and on 1 July, Constantine married Theodora.\nDespot of the Morea.\nEarly rule in the Morea.\nThe transfer of Tocco's conquered Moreot territories to Constantine complicated the Morea's government structure. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as a third Despot of the Morea, which meant that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities. Theodore did not share control over Mystras with Constantine or Thomas; instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of Aigio, fortresses and towns in Laconia (in the south), and Kalamata and Messenia in the west. Constantine made Glarentza, which he was entitled to by marriage, his capital. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of Kalavryta. During his tenure as despot, Constantine was brave and energetic, but generally cautious.\nShortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, joined forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategically important port of Patras in the northwest of the Morea, which was ruled by its Catholic Archbishop, Pandolphe de Malatesta (Theodore's brother-in-law). The campaign ended in failure, possibly due to Theodore's reluctant participation and Thomas' inexperience. Constantine confided with Sphrantzes and John at a secret meeting in Mystras that he would make a second attempt to retake Patras by himself; if he failed, he would return to his old appanage by the Black Sea. Constantine and Sphrantzes, confident that the city's many Greek inhabitants would support their takeover, marched towards Patras on 1 March 1429, and they besieged the city on 20 March. The siege developed into a long and drawn-out engagement, with occasional skirmishes. At one point, Constantine's horse was shot and killed under him and the despot nearly died, being saved by Sphrantzes at the cost of Sphrantzes being captured by the defenders of Patras (though he would be released, albeit in a state of near-death, on 23 April). After almost two months, the defenders opened up to the possibility of negotiation in May. Malatesta journeyed to Italy in an attempt to recruit reinforcements and the defenders agreed that if he did not return to them by the end of the month, Patras would surrender. Constantine agreed to this and withdrew his army. On 1 June, Constantine returned to the city and, since the Archbishop had not returned, met with the city's leaders in the city's Cathedral of St. Andrew on 4 June and they accepted him as their new lord. The Archbishop's castle, located on a nearby hill, held out against Constantine for another 12 months before surrendering.\nConstantine's capture of Patras was seen as an affront by the Pope, the Venetians, and the Ottomans. In order to pacify any threats, Constantine sent ambassadors to all three, with Sphrantzes being sent to talk with Turahan, the Ottoman governor of Thessaly. Although Sphrantzes was successful in removing the threat of Turkish reprisal, the threat from the west was realized as the dispossessed Archbishop arrived at the head of a mercenary army of Catalans. Unfortunately for Malatesta, the Catalans had little interest in helping him recover Patras, and they attacked and seized Glarentza instead, which Constantine had to buy back from them for 6,000 Venetian ducats, and began plundering the Moreot coastline. To prevent Glarentza from being seized by pirates, Constantine eventually ordered it to be destroyed. During this perilous time, Constantine suffered another loss: Theodora died in November 1429. The grief-stricken Constantine first had her buried at Glarentza, but then moved to Mystras. Once the Archbishop's castle surrendered to Constantine in July 1430, the city was fully restored to Byzantine rule after 225 years of foreign occupation. In November, Sphrantzes was rewarded by being proclaimed as the city's governor.\nBy the early 1430s, the efforts of Constantine and his younger brother Thomas had ensured that nearly all of the Peloponnese was under Byzantine rule again since the Fourth Crusade. Thomas ended the Principality of Achaea by marrying Catherine Zaccaria, daughter and heir of the final prince, Centurione II Zaccaria. When Centurione died in 1432, Thomas took control of all his remaining territories by right of marriage. The only lands in the Peloponnese remaining under foreign rule were the few port towns and cities still held by the Republic of Venice. Sultan Murad II felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, Turahan sent his troops south on Murad's orders to demolish the Hexamilion wall in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals.\nSecond tenure as regent.\nIn March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement (presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII) with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for Elis, which Thomas made his new capital. Relationships between the three despots eventually soured. John VIII had no sons to succeed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was known to be Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had a good relationship with his older brother, it was resented by Constantine's older brother Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore falsely believed it was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, and he travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch Gregory Mammas was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. The brothers agreed that Constantine was to return to Constantinople, while Theodore and Thomas would remain in the Morea. John needed Constantine in Constantinople as he was departing for Italy soon. On 24 September 1437, Constantine reached Constantinople. Although he was not proclaimed as co-emperor, his appointment as regent for a second time, suggested to John by their mother Helena, indicated that he was to be regarded as John's intended heir.\nJohn left for Italy in November to attend the Council of Ferrara in an effort to unite the Eastern and Western churches. Although many in the Byzantine Empire opposed a union of the Churches, as it would mean religious submission under the Papacy, John viewed a union as necessary. The papacy did not view the situation of the Christians in the East as something positive, but it would not call for any aid to the disintegrating empire if it did not acknowledge obedience to the Catholic Church and renounce what Catholics perceived as errors. John brought a large delegation to Italy, including Joseph II, the Patriarch of Constantinople; representatives of the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem; large numbers of bishops, monks, and priests; and his younger brother Demetrios. Demetrios showed opposition against a church union, but John decided not to leave him in the East since Demetrios had shown rebellious tendencies and was thought to try to take the throne with Ottoman support. Constantine was not left without supporting courtiers in Constantinople: Constantine's and John's cousin Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos and the experienced statesman Loukas Notaras were left in the city. Helena and Sphrantzes were also there to advise Constantine. In 1438, Constantine served as the best man at Sphrantzes' wedding, and would later become the godfather to two of Sphrantzes' children.\nDuring John's absence from Constantinople, the Ottomans abided by the previously established peace. Trouble appeared to have brewed only once: in early 1439, Constantine wrote to his brother in Italy to remind the Pope that the Byzantines had been promised two warships by the end of spring. Constantine hoped that the ships would leave Italy within fifteen days, as he believed that Murad II was planning a strong offensive against Constantinople. Although the ships were not sent, Constantinople was not in danger as Murad's campaign focused on taking Smederevo in Serbia.\nIn June 1439, the council in Florence, Italy, declared that the churches had been reunited. John returned to Constantinople on 1 February 1440. Although he was received with a grand ceremony organized by Constantine and Demetrios (who had returned sometime earlier), the news of the unification stirred a wave of resentment and bitterness among the general populace, who felt that John had betrayed their faith and their world view. Many feared the union would arouse suspicion among the Ottomans. Constantine's agreed with his brother's views on the union: if a sacrifice of the independence of their church resulted in the Westerners organizing a crusade and saving Constantinople, it would not have been in vain.\nSecond marriage and Ottoman threats.\nDespite having been relieved of his duties as regent upon John's return, Constantine stayed in the capital for the rest of 1440. He may have stayed in order to find a suitable wife, wishing to remarry since it had been more than ten years since Theodora's death. He decided on Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino I Gattilusio, the Genoese lord of the island Lesbos. Sphrantzes was sent to Lesbos in December 1440 to propose and arrange the marriage. In late 1441, Constantine sailed to Lesbos with Sphrantzes and Loukas Notaras, and in August he married Caterina. In September, he left Lesbos, leaving Caterina with her father on Lesbos, to travel to the Morea.\nUpon his return to the Morea, Constantine observed that Theodore and Thomas had ruled well without him. He believed that he could serve the empire's needs better if he was closer to the capital. His younger brother Demetrios governed Constantine's former appanage around Mesembria in Thrace, and Constantine pondered the possibility that he and Demetrios could switch places, with Constantine regaining the Black Sea appanage and Demetrios being granted Constantine's holdings in the Morea. Constantine sent Sphrantzes to propose the idea to both Demetrios and Murad II, who by this point had to be consulted about any appointments.\nBy 1442, Demetrios had no desire for new appointments and was eyeing the imperial throne. He had just made a deal with Murad himself and raised an army, portraying himself as the champion of the Turk-supported cause that opposed the union of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and declared war on John. When Sphrantzes reached Demetrios to forward Constantine's offer, Demetrios was already preparing to march on Constantinople. The danger he posed to the city was so great that Constantine was summoned from the Morea by John to oversee the city's defenses. In April 1442, Demetrios and the Ottomans began their attack and in July, Constantine left the Morea to relieve his brother in the capital. On the way, Constantine met his wife at Lesbos and together they sailed to Lemnos, where they were stopped by an Ottoman blockade and were trapped for months. Although Venice sent ships to assist them, Caterina fell ill and died in August; she was buried at Myrina on Lemnos. Constantine did not reach Constantinople until November and by then, the Ottoman attack had already been repelled. Demetrios' punishment was a brief imprisonment. In March 1443, Sphrantzes was made governor of Selymbria in Constantine's name. From Selymbria, Sphrantzes and Constantine were able to keep a watchful eye on Demetrios' activities. In November, Constantine relinquished control of Selymbria to Theodore, who had abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, which made Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea and gave Constantine Mystras, the despotate's prosperous capital.\nDespot at Mystras.\nWith Theodore and Demetrios gone, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea. By this time, the Morea was the cultural center of the Byzantine world and provided a more hopeful atmosphere than Constantinople. Patrons of art and science had settled there at Theodore's invitation and churches, monasteries, and mansions continued to be built. The two Palaiologos brothers hoped to make the Morea into a safe and nearly self-sufficient principality. The philosopher Gemistus Pletho, employed in Constantine's service, said that while Constantinople had once been the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \"New Sparta\", a centralized and strong Hellenic kingdom in its own right.\nOne of the projects of the brothers' plan to strengthen the despotate was the reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall, which was destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall by March 1444. The project impressed many of their subjects and contemporaries, including the Venetian lords in the Peloponnese, who had politely declined to help with its funding. The restoration had cost much in both money and manpower; many of the Moreot landowners had momentarily fled to Venetian lands to avoid financing the venture while others had rebelled before being compelled through military means. Constantine attempted to attract the loyalty of the Moreot landowners by granting them both further lands and various privileges. He also staged local athletic games, where young Moreots could run races for prizes.\nIn the summer of 1444, perhaps encouraged by news from the west that a crusade had set out from Hungary in 1443, Constantine invaded the Latin Duchy of Athens, his direct northern neighbor and an Ottoman vassal. Through Sphrantzes, Constantine was in contact with Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who along with W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland and Hungary was one of the leaders of the crusade. Cesarini was made aware of Constantine's intentions and that he was ready to aid the crusade in striking at the Ottomans from the south. Constantine swiftly captured Athens and Thebes, which forced Duke Nerio II Acciaioli to pay the tribute to him instead of the Ottomans. The recapture of Athens was seen as a particularly glorious feat. One of Constantine's counsellors compared the despot to the legendary ancient Athenian general Themistocles. Although the crusading army was destroyed by the Ottoman army led by Murad II at the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444, Constantine was not deterred. His initial campaign had been remarkably successful and he had also received foreign support from Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, who had sent him 300 soldiers. With the Burgundian soldiers and his own men, Constantine raided central Greece as far north as the Pindus mountains in Thessaly, where the locals happily welcomed him as their new lord. As Constantine's campaign progressed, one of his governors, Constantine Kantakouzenos, also made his way north, attacked Thessaly, and seized the town of Lidoriki from the Ottomans. The townspeople were so excited at their liberation that they renamed the town to Kantakouzinopolis in his honor.\nTiring of Constantine's successes, Murad II, accompanied by Duke Nerio II of Athens, marched on the Morea in 1446, with an army possibly numbering as many as 60,000 men. Despite the overwhelming number of Ottoman troops, Constantine refused to surrender his gains in Greece and instead prepared for battle. The Ottomans quickly restored control over Thessaly; Constantine and Thomas rallied at the Hexamilion wall, which the Ottomans reached on 27 November. Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as 20,000 men, to defend it. Although the wall might have held against the great Ottoman army under normal circumstances, Murad had brought cannons with him and by 10 December, the wall had been reduced to rubble and most of the defenders were either killed or captured; Constantine and Thomas barely escaped the catastrophic defeat. Turahan was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese. Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad only wanted to instill terror and did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time. The Turks left the peninsula devastated and depopulated. Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord, pay him tribute, and promise to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.\nReign as emperor.\nAccession to the throne.\nTheodore, once Despot of the Morea, died in June 1448 and on 31 October that same year, John VIII Palaiologos died in Constantinople. Compared to his other living brothers, Constantine was the most popular of the Palaiologoi, both in the Morea and in the capital. It was well known that John's favored successor was Constantine and ultimately, the will of Helena Draga\u0161 (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed in the matter. Both Thomas, who appeared to have had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine left the Morea. Although many favored Demetrios for his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, and stalled Demetrios' attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios was overruled, though he later proclaimed Constantine as his new emperor. Soon thereafter, Sphrantzes informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the appointment on 6 December 1448. With the issue of succession peacefully resolved, Helena sent two envoys, Manuel Palaiologos Iagros and Alexios Philanthropenos Laskaris, to the Morea to proclaim Constantine as emperor and bring him to the capital. Thomas also accompanied them.\nIn a small civil ceremony at Mystras, possibly in one of the churches or in the Despot's Palace, on 6 January 1449, Constantine was proclaimed Emperor of the Romans. He was not given a crown; instead, Constantine may have put on another type of imperial headgear, a , on his head with his own hands. Although emperors were traditionally crowned in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, there was historical precedent for smaller and local ceremonies: centuries ago, Manuel I Komnenos had been given the title of emperor by his dying father, John II Komnenos, in Cilicia; Constantine's great-grandfather, John VI Kantakouzenos, had been proclaimed emperor at Didymoteicho in Thrace. Both Manuel I and John VI had been careful to perform the traditional coronation ceremony in Constantinople once they reached the capital. In Constantine's case, no such ceremony was ever performed. Both Constantine and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory III Mammas, were supporters of the Union of the Churches: a ceremony in which Gregory crowned Constantine emperor might have led the anti-unionists in the capital to rebel. Constantine's rise to emperor was controversial: although he was accepted on account of his lineage with few alternative candidates, his lack of a full coronation and support for the Union of the Churches damaged public perception of the new emperor.\nCareful not to anger the anti-unionists through being crowned by Gregory III, Constantine believed that his proclamation at Mystras had sufficed as an imperial coronation and had given him all the constitutional rights of the one true emperor. In his earliest known imperial document, a chrysobull from February 1449, he refers to himself as \"Constantine Palaiologos in Christ true Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\". Constantine arrived at Constantinople on 12 March 1449, having been provided means of travel by a Catalan ship.\nConstantine was well prepared for his accession to the throne after serving as regent twice and ruling numerous fiefs throughout the crumbling empire. By Constantine's time, Constantinople was a shadow of its former glory; the city never truly recovered from the 1204 sack by the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade. Instead of the grand imperial capital it once was, 15th century Constantinople was an almost rural network of population centers, with many of the city's churches and palaces, including the former imperial palace, abandoned and in disrepair. Instead of the former imperial palace, the Palaiologoi emperors used the Palace of Blachernae, located considerably closer to the city's walls, as their main residence. The city's population had declined significantly due to the Latin occupation, the 14th century civil wars, and outbreaks of the Black Death in 1347, 1409 and 1410. By the time Constantine became emperor, only about 50,000 people lived in the city.\nInitial concerns.\nOne of Constantine's most pressing concerns was the Ottomans. One of his first acts as emperor, just two weeks after arriving in the capital, was to attempt to secure the empire by arranging a truce with Murad II. He sent an ambassador, Andronikos Iagaris, to the sultan. Iagaris was successful, and the agreed-upon truce also included Constantine's brothers in the Morea to secure the province from further Ottoman attacks. In order to remove his rebellious brother Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine had made Demetrios his replacement as Despot of the Morea to rule the despotate alongside Thomas. Demetrios was granted Constantine's former capital, Mystras, and given authority over the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, while Thomas ruled the northwest and Corinthia alternating between Patras and Leontari as his place of residence.\nConstantine tried to hold numerous discussions with the anti-unionists in the capital, who had organized themselves as a \"synaxis\" to oppose Patriarch Gregory III's authority, on account of him being a unionist. Constantine was not a fanatical unionist and merely viewed the Union of the Churches as necessary for the empire's survival. The unionists found this argument to be baseless and materialistic, believing that help would be more likely to come through trust in God than a western crusading campaign.\nAnother pressing concern was the continuation of the imperial family as neither Constantine nor his brothers had male children at the time. In February 1449, Constantine had sent Manuel Dishypatos as an envoy to Italy to speak with Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in order to secure military aid against the Ottomans and forge a marriage alliance. The intended match was the daughter of Alfonso's nephew, Beatrice of Coimbra, but the alliance failed. In October 1449, Constantine sent Sphrantzes to the east to visit the Empire of Trebizond and the Kingdom of Georgia and see if there were any suitable brides there. Sphrantzes, accompanied by a large retinue of priests, nobles, musicians and soldiers, left the capital for nearly two years.\nWhile at the court of Emperor John IV Megas Komnenos in Trebizond, Sphrantzes was made aware that Murad II had died. Though John IV saw this as positive news, Sphrantzes was more anxious: the old sultan had grown tired and had given up all hope of conquering Constantinople. His young son and successor, Mehmed II, was ambitious, young and energetic. Sphrantzes had the idea that the sultan could be dissuaded from invading Constantinople if Constantine married Murad II's widow, Mara Brankovi\u0107. Constantine supported the idea when he received Sphrantzes' report in May 1451 and sent envoys to Serbia, where Mara had returned to after Murad II's death. Many of Constantine's courtiers opposed the idea due to a distrust of the Serbians, causing Constantine to question the viability of the match. Ultimately, the opposition of the courtiers to the marriage proved pointless: Mara had no wish to remarry, as she vowed to live a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her life once released from the Ottomans. Sphrantzes then decided that a Georgian bride would suit the emperor best and returned to Constantinople in September 1451, bringing a Georgian ambassador with him. Constantine thanked Sphrantzes for his efforts and they agreed that Sphrantzes was to return to Georgia in the spring of 1452 and forge a marriage alliance. Due to mounting tensions with the Ottomans, Sphrantzes ultimately did not return to Georgia.\nOn 23 March 1450, Helena Draga\u0161 died. She was highly respected among the Byzantines and was mourned deeply. Gemistus Pletho, the Moreot philosopher previously at Constantine's court in the Morea, and Gennadios Scholarios, future Patriarch of Constantinople, both wrote funeral orations praising her. Pletho praised Helena's fortitude and intellect, and compared her to legendary Greek heroine Penelope on account of her prudence. Constantine's other advisors were often at odds with the emperor and each other. Her death left Constantine unsure of which advisor to rely on the most. Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, the \"megas domestikos\" (or commander-in-chief), disagreed with the emperor on a number of matters, including the decision to marry a Georgian princess instead of an imperial princess from Trebizond. The most powerful figure at the court was Loukas Notaras, an experienced statesman and \"megas doux\" (commander-in-chief of the navy). Although Sphrantzes disliked Notaras, he was a close friend of Constantine. As the Byzantine Empire no longer had a navy, Notaras' position was more of an informal prime minister-type role than a position of military command. Notaras believed that Constantinople's massive defenses would stall any attack on the city and allow western Christians to aid them in time. Due to his influence and friendship with the emperor, Constantine was likely influenced by his hopes and ideas. Sphrantzes was promoted to \"First Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe\": his office gave him near unhindered access to the imperial residence and a position to influence the emperor. Sphrantzes was even more cautious towards the Ottomans than Notaras, and believed the \"megas doux\" risked antagonizing the new sultan. Although Sphrantzes also approved of appealing to the west for aid, he believed that any appeals had to be highly discreet in order to avoid Ottoman attention.\nSearch for allies.\nShortly after Murad II's death, Constantine was quick to send envoys to the new Sultan Mehmed II in an attempt to arrange a new truce. Mehmed supposedly received Constantine's envoys with great respect and put their minds to rest through swearing by Allah, the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, and the angels and archangels that he would live in peace with the Byzantines and their emperor for the rest of his life. Constantine was unconvinced and suspected that Mehmed's mood could abruptly change in the future. In order to prepare for the future possibility of Ottoman attack, Constantine needed to secure alliances and the most powerful realms that might be inclined to aid him were in the West.\nThe nearest and most concerned potential ally was Venice, which operated a large commercial colony in their quarter of Constantinople. However, the Venetians were not to be trusted. During the first few months of his rule as emperor, Constantine had raised the taxes on the goods the Venetians imported to Constantinople since the imperial treasury was nearly empty and funds had to be raised through some means. In August 1450, the Venetians had threatened to transfer their trade to another port, perhaps one under Ottoman control, and despite Constantine writing to the Doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari, in October 1450, the Venetians were unconvinced and signed a formal treaty with Mehmed II in 1451. To annoy the Venetians, Constantine attempted to seal a deal with the Republic of Ragusa in 1451, offering them a place to trade in Constantinople with limited tax concessions, though the Ragusans could offer little military aid to the empire.\nMost of the kingdoms in Western Europe were occupied with their own wars at the time and the crushing defeat at the Battle of Varna had quelled most of the crusading spirit. The news that Murad II had died and been succeeded by his young son also lulled the western Europeans into a false sense of security. To the papacy, the Union of the Churches was a far more pressing concern than the threat of Ottoman attack. In August 1451, Constantine's ambassador Andronikos Bryennios Leontaris arrived in Rome to deliver a letter to Pope Nicholas V, which contained a statement from the anti-unionist \"synaxis\" at Constantinople. Constantine hoped that the Pope would read the letter and understand Constantine's difficulties with making the Union of the Churches a reality in the east. The letter contained the \"synaxis\"'s proposal that a new council be held at Constantinople, with an equal number of representatives from both churches (since the Orthodox had been heavily outnumbered at the previous council). On 27 September, Nicholas V replied to Constantine after he heard that the unionist Patriarch Gregory III had resigned following the opposition against him. Nicholas V merely wrote that Constantine had to try harder to convince his people and clergy and that the price of further military aid from the west was full acceptance of the union achieved at Florence; the name of the Pope had to be commemorated in the churches in Greece and Gregory III had to be reinstated as patriarch. The ultimatum was a setback for Constantine, who had done his best to enforce the union without inciting riots in Constantinople. The Pope appeared to have completely ignored the sentiment of the anti-unionist \"synaxis\". Nicholas V sent a papal legate, Cardinal Isidore of Kiev, to Constantinople to attempt to help Constantine enforce the union, but Isidore did not arrive until October 1452, when the city faced more pressing concerns.\nDealings with Mehmed II.\nA great-grandson of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, Orhan \u00c7elebi, lived as a hostage in Constantinople. Other than Mehmed II, Orhan was the only known living male member of the Ottoman dynasty, and thus was a potential rival claimant to the sultanate. Mehmed had previously agreed to pay annually for Orhan being kept at Constantinople, but in 1451, Constantine sent a message to the sultan complaining that the payment was not sufficient and hinted that unless more money was paid, Orhan might be released, possibly sparking an Ottoman civil war. The strategy of attempting to use hostage Ottoman princes had been used before by Constantine's father Manuel II, but it was a risky one. Mehmed's grand vizier, \u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha, received the message at Bursa and was appalled at the threat, considering the Byzantine to be inept. Halil had long been relied upon by the Byzantines, through bribes and friendship, to maintain peaceful relations with the Ottomans, but his influence over Mehmed was limited and he was ultimately loyal to the Ottomans, not the Byzantines. Because of the blatant provocation to the sultan, he lost his temper with the Byzantine messengers, supposedly shouting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You stupid Greeks, I have had enough of your devious ways. The late sultan was a lenient and conscientious friend to you. The present sultan is not of the same mind. If Constantine eludes his bold and impetuous grasp, it will only be because God continues to overlook your cunning and wicked schemes. You are fools to think you can frighten us with your fantasies, and that when the ink on our recent treaty is barely dry. We are not children without strength or reason. If you think you can start something, then do so. If you want to proclaim Orhan as Sultan in Thrace, go ahead. If you want to bring the Hungarians across the Danube, let them come. If you want to recover the places which you lost long since, try it. But know this: you will make no headway in any of these things. All that you will achieve is to lose what little you still have.\nConstantine and his advisors had catastrophically misjudged the determination of the new sultan. Throughout his brief reign, Constantine and his advisors had been unable to form an effective foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire. Constantine mainly continued the policy of his predecessors, doing what he could to brace Constantinople for attack, but also alternated between supplicating and confronting the Ottomans. Constantine's advisors had little knowledge and expertise on the Ottoman court and disagreed in how to deal with the Ottoman threat and as Constantine wavered between the opinions of his different councillors, his policy towards Murad and Mehmed was not coherent and resulted in disaster.\nMehmed II considered Constantine to have broken the terms of their 1449 truce and quickly revoked the small concessions he had given to the Byzantines. The threat of releasing Orhan gave Mehmed a pretext for concentrating all of his efforts on seizing Constantinople, his true goal since he had become sultan. Mehmed believed that the conquest of Constantinople was essential to the survival of the Ottoman state: by taking the city, he would prevent any potential crusade from using it as a base and prevent it falling into the hands of a rival more dangerous than the Byzantines. Furthermore, Mehmed had an intense interest in ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine history, his childhood heroes being figures like Achilles and Alexander the Great.\nMehmed began preparations immediately. In the spring of 1452, work had begun on the Rumelihisar\u0131 castle, constructed on the western side of the Bosporus strait, opposite to the already existing Anadoluhisar\u0131 castle on the eastern side. With the two castles, Mehmed could control sea traffic in the Bosporus and could blockade Constantinople both by land and sea. Constantine, horrified by the implications of the construction project, protested that Mehmed's grandfather Mehmed I had respectfully asked the permission of Emperor Manuel II before constructing the eastern castle and reminded the sultan of their existing truce. Based on his actions in the Morea, especially during at the time of the Crusade of Varna, Constantine was clearly anti-Turkish and he preferred himself to take aggressive action against the Ottoman Empire; his attempts to appeal to Mehmed were simply a stalling tactic. Mehmed's response to Constantine was that the area he built the fortress on had been uninhabited and that Constantine owned nothing outside of Constantinople's walls.\nAs panic ensued in Constantinople, the Rumelihisar\u0131 was completed in August 1452, intended not only to serve as a means to blockade Constantinople but also as the base from which Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was to be directed. To clear the site of the new castle, some local churches were demolished, which angered the local Greek populace. The Ottomans had sent some animals to graze on Byzantine farmland on the shores of the Sea of Marmara, which also angered the locals. Outraged, Constantine formally declared war on Mehmed II, closing the gates of Constantinople and arresting all Turks within the city walls. Seeing the futility in this move, Constantine renounced his actions three days later and set the prisoners free. After the capture of several Italian ships and the execution of their crews during Mehmed's eventual siege of Constantinople, Constantine reluctantly ordered the execution of all Turks within the city walls.\nConstantine began to prepare for what was at best a blockade, and at worst a siege, gathering provisions and working to repair Constantinople's walls. Manuel Palaiologos Iagros, one of the envoys who had invested Constantine as emperor in 1449, was put in charge of the restoration of the formidable walls, a project which was completed late in 1452. He sent more urgent requests for aid to the west. Near the end of 1451, he had sent a message to Venice stating that unless they sent reinforcements to him at once, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Although the Venetians were sympathetic to the Byzantine cause, they explained in their reply in February 1452 that although they could ship armor and gunpowder to him, they had no troops to spare as they were fighting against neighboring city-states in Italy at the time. When the Ottomans sank a Venetian trading ship in the Bosporus in November 1452 and executed the ship's survivors on account of the ship refusing to pay a new toll instituted by Mehmed, the Venetian attitude changed as they now also found themselves at war with the Ottomans. Desperate for aid, Constantine sent pleas for reinforcements to his brothers in the Morea and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, promising the latter the island of Lemnos if he brought help. The Hungarian warrior John Hunyadi was invited to help and was promised Selymbria or Mesembria if he came with aid. The Genoese on the island Chios were also sent a plea, being promised payment in return for military assistance. Constantine received little practical response to his pleas.\nReligious disunity in Constantinople.\nAbove all, Constantine sent many appeals for aid to Pope Nicholas V. Although sympathetic, Nicholas V believed that the papacy could not go to the rescue of the Byzantines unless they fully accepted the Union of the Churches and his spiritual authority. Furthermore, he knew that the papacy alone could not do much against the formidable Ottoman Turks, a similar response to one given by Venice, which promised military assistance only if others in Western Europe also came to Constantinople's defense. On 26 October 1452, Nicholas V's legate, Isidore of Kiev, arrived at Constantinople together with the Latin Archbishop of Mytilene, Leonard of Chios. With them, they brought a small force of 200 Neapolitan archers. Though they made little difference in coming battle, the reinforcements were probably more appreciated by Constantinople's citizens than the actual purpose of Isidore's and Leonard's visit: cementing the Union of the Churches. Their arrival in the city spurred the anti-unionists into a frenzy. On 13 September 1452, a month before Isidore and Leonard arrived, the lawyer and anti-unionist Theodore Agallianos had written a short chronicle of contemporary events, concluding with the following words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This was written in the third year of the reign of Constantine Palaiologos, who remains uncrowned because the church has no leader and is indeed in disarray as the result of the turmoil and confusion brought upon it by the falsely named union which his brother and predecessor John Palaiologos engineered... This union was evil and displeasing to God and has instead split the church and scattered its children and destroyed us utterly. Truth to tell, this is the source of all our other misfortunes.\nConstantine and his brother John VIII before him had badly misjudged the level of opposition against the church union. Loukas Notaras was successful in calming down the situation in Constantinople somewhat, explaining to an assembly of nobles that the Catholic visit was made with good intentions and that the soldiers who had accompanied Isidore and Leonard might just be an advance guard; more military aid might have been on its way. Many nobles were convinced that a spiritual price could be paid for material rewards and that if they were rescued from the immediate danger, there would be time later to think more clearly in a calmer atmosphere. George Sphrantzes suggested to Constantine that he name Isidore as the new Patriarch of Constantinople as Gregory III had not been seen for some time and was unlikely to return. Although such an appointment might have gratified the pope and led to further aid being sent, Constantine realized that it would only stir up the anti-unionists more. Once the people of Constantinople realized that no further immediate aid in addition to the 200 soldiers was coming from the papacy, they rioted in the streets.\nLeonard of Chios confided in the emperor that he believed him to be far too lenient with the anti-unionists, urging him to arrest their leaders and try harder to push back the opposition to the Union of the Churches. Constantine opposed the idea, perhaps under the assumption that arresting the leaders would turn them into martyrs for their cause. Instead, Constantine summoned the leaders of the \"synaxis\" to the imperial palace on 15 November 1452, and once again asked them to write a document with their objections to the union achieved at Florence, which they were eager to do. On 25 November, the Ottomans sank another Venetian trading ship with cannon fire from the new Rumelihisar\u0131 castle, an event which captured the minds of the Byzantines and united them in fear and panic. As a result, the anti-unionist cause gradually died down. On 12 December, a Catholic liturgy commemorating the names of the Pope and Patriarch Gregory III was held in the Hagia Sophia by Isidore. Constantine and his court were present, as was a large number of the city's citizens (Isidore stated that all of its inhabitants attended the ceremony).\nFinal preparations.\nConstantine's brothers in the Morea could not bring him any help: Turahan had been called on by Mehmed to invade and devastate the Morea again in October 1452 to keep the two despots occupied. The Morea was devastated, with Constantine's brothers only achieving one small success with the capture of Turahan's son, Ahmed, in battle. Constantine then had to rely on the only other parties which had expressed interest in aiding him: Venice, the pope, and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. Although Venice had been slow to act, the Venetians in Constantinople acted immediately without waiting for orders when the Ottomans sank their ships. The Venetian bailie in Constantinople, Girolamo Minotto, called an emergency meeting with the Venetians in the city, which was also attended by Constantine and Cardinal Isidore. Most of the Venetians voted to stay in Constantinople and aid the Byzantines in their defense of the city, agreeing that no Venetian ships were to leave Constantinople's harbor. The decision of the local Venetians to stay and die for the city had a significantly greater effect on the Venetian government than Constantine's pleas.\nIn February 1453, Doge Foscari ordered the preparation of warships and army recruitment, both of which were to head for Constantinople in April. He sent letters to the pope, Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, King Ladislaus V of Hungary, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III to inform them that unless Western Christianity acted, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Though the increase in diplomatic activity was impressive, it came too late to save Constantinople: the equipment and financing of a joint papal-Venetian armada took longer than expected, the Venetians had misjudged the amount of time on their hands, and messages took at least a month to travel from Constantinople to Venice. Emperor Frederick III's only response to the crisis was a letter sent to Mehmed II in which he threatened the sultan with an attack from all of western Christendom unless the sultan demolished the Rumelihisar\u0131 castle and abandoned his plans to Constantinople. Constantine continued to hope for help and sent more letters in early 1453 to Venice and Alfonso V, asking not only for soldiers but also food as his people were beginning to suffer from the Ottoman blockade of the city. Alfonso responded to his plea by quickly sending a ship with provisions.\nThroughout the long winter of 1452\u20131453, Constantine ordered the citizens of Constantinople to restore the city's imposing walls and gather as many weapons as they could. Ships were sent to the islands still under Byzantine rule to gather further supplies and provisions. The defenders grew anxious as the news of a huge cannon at the Ottoman camp that was assembled by the Hungarian engineer Orban reached the city. Loukas Notaras was given command of the walls along the sea walls of the Golden Horn and various sons of the Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos families were appointed to man other positions. Many of the city's foreign inhabitants, notably the Venetians, offered their aid. Constantine asked them to man the battlements to show the Ottomans how many defenders they were to face. When the Venetians offered their service to guard four of the city's land gates, Constantine accepted and entrusted them with the keys. Some of the city's Genoese population also aided the Byzantines. In January 1453, notable Genoese aid arrived voluntarily in the form of Giovanni Giustiniani\u2014a renowned soldier known for his skill in siege warfare\u2014and 700 soldiers under his command. Giustiniani was appointed by Constantine as the general commander for the walls on Constantinople's land side. Giustiniani was given the rank of \"protostrator\" and promised the island of Lemnos as a reward (though it had already been promised to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, should he come to the city's aid). In addition to the limited western aid, Orhan \u00c7elebi, the Ottoman contender held as a hostage in the city, and his considerable retinue of Ottoman troops, also assisted in the city's defense.\nOn 2 April 1453, Mehmed's advance guard arrived outside Constantinople and began pitching up a camp. On 5 April, the sultan himself arrived at the head of his army and encamped within firing range of the city's Gate of St. Romanus. Bombardment of the city walls began almost immediately on 6 April. Most estimates of the number of soldiers defending Constantinople's walls in 1453 range from 6,000 to 8,500, out of which 5,000\u20136,000 were Greeks, most of whom were untrained militia soldiers. An additional 1,000 Byzantine soldiers were kept as reserves inside the city. Mehmed's army massively outnumbered the Christian defenders; his forces might have been as many as 80,000 men, including about 5,000 elite janissaries. Even then, Constantinople's fall was not inevitable; the strength of the walls made the Ottoman numerical advantage irrelevant at first and under other circumstances, the Byzantines and their allies could have survived until help arrived. The Ottoman use of cannons intensified and sped up the siege considerably.\nFall of Constantinople.\nSiege.\nAn Ottoman fleet attempted to get into the Golden Horn while Mehmed began bombarding Constantinople's land walls. Foreseeing this possibility, Constantine had constructed a massive chain laid across the Golden Horn which prevented the fleet's passage. The chain was only lifted temporarily a few days after the siege began to allow the passage of three Genoese ships sent by the papacy and a large ship with food sent by Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. The arrival of these ships on 20 April, and the failure of the Ottomans to stop them, was a significant victory for the Christians and significantly increased their morale. The ships, carrying soldiers, weapons and supplies, had passed by Mehmed's scouts alongside the Bosphorus unnoticed. Mehmed ordered his admiral, Suleiman Baltoghlu, to capture the ships and their crews at all costs. As the naval battle between the smaller Ottoman ships and the large western ships commenced, Mehmed rode his horse into the water to shout unhelpful naval commands to Baltoghlu, who pretended not to hear them. Baltoghlu withdrew the smaller ships so that the few large Ottoman vessels could fire on the western ships, but the Ottoman cannons were too low to do damage to the crews and decks and their shots were too small to seriously damage the hulls. As the sun set, the wind suddenly returned and the ships passed through the Ottoman blockade, aided by three Venetian ships which had sailed out to meet and cover them.\nThe sea walls were weaker than Constantinople's land walls, and Mehmed was determined to get his fleet into the Golden Horn; he needed some way to circumvent Constantine's chain. On 23 April, the defenders of Constantinople observed the Ottoman fleet managed to get into the Golden Horn by being pulled across a massive series of tracks, constructed on Mehmed's orders, across the hill behind Galata, the Genoese colony on the opposite side of the Golden Horn. Although the Venetians attempted to attack the ships and set fire to them, their attempt was unsuccessful.\nAs the siege progressed, it became clearer that the forces defending the city would not be enough to man both the sea walls and the land walls. Furthermore, food was running out and as food prices rose to compensate, many of the poor began to starve. On Constantine's orders, the Byzantine garrison collected money from churches, monasteries and private residences to pay for food for the poor. Objects of precious metal held by the churches were seized and melted down, though Constantine promised the clergy that he would repay them four-fold once the battle had been won. The Ottomans bombarded the city's outer walls continuously, and eventually opened up a small breach which exposed the inner defenses. Constantine grew more and more anxious. He sent messages begging the sultan to withdraw, promising whatever amount of tribute he wanted, but Mehmed was determined to take the city. The sultan supposedly responded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Either I shall take this city, or the city will take me, dead or alive. If you will admit defeat and withdraw in peace, I shall give you the Peloponnese and other provinces for your brothers and we shall be friends. If you persist in denying me peaceful entry into the city, I shall force my way in and I shall slay you and all your nobles; and I shall slaughter all the survivors and allow my troops to plunder at will. The city is all I want, even if it is empty.\nTo Constantine, the idea of abandoning Constantinople was unthinkable. He did not bother to reply to the sultan's suggestion. Some days after offering Constantine the chance to surrender, Mehmed sent a new messenger to address the citizens of Constantinople, imploring them to surrender and save themselves from death or slavery. The sultan informed them that he would let them live as they were, in exchange for an annual tribute, or allow them to leave the city unharmed with their belongings. Some of Constantine's companions and councilors implored him to escape the city, rather than die in its defense: if he escaped unharmed, Constantine could set up an empire-in-exile in the Morea or somewhere else and carry on the war against the Ottomans. Constantine did not accept their ideas; he refused to be remembered as the emperor who ran away. According to later chroniclers, Constantine's response to the idea of escaping was the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God forbid that I should live as an Emperor without an Empire. As my city falls, I will fall with it. Whosoever wishes to escape, let him save himself if he can, and whoever is ready to face death, let him follow me.\nConstantine then sent a response to the sultan, the last communication between a Byzantine emperor and an Ottoman sultan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.\nThe only hope the citizens could cling to was the news that the Venetian fleet was on its way to relieve Constantinople. When a Venetian reconnaissance ship that had slipped through the Ottoman blockade returned to the city to report that no relief force had been seen, it was made clear that the few forces that had gathered at Constantinople would have to fight the Ottoman army alone. The news that the whole of Christendom appeared to have deserted them unnerved some of the Venetians and Genoese defenders and in-fighting broke out between them, forcing Constantine to remind them that there were more important enemies at hand. Constantine resolved to commit himself and the city to the mercy of Christ; if the city fell, it would be God's will.\nFinal days and final assault.\nThe Byzantines observed strange and ominous signs in the days leading up to the final Ottoman assault on the city. On 22 May, there was a lunar eclipse for three hours, harkening to a prophecy that Constantinople would fall when the moon was on wane. In order to encourage the defenders, Constantine commanded that the icon of Mary, the city's protector, was to be carried in a procession through the streets. The procession was abandoned when the icon slipped from its frame and the weather turned to rain and hail. Carrying out the procession on the next day was impossible as the city became engulfed in a thick fog.\nOn 26 May, the Ottomans held a war council. \u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha, who believed western military aid to the city was imminent, counseled Mehmed to compromise with the Byzantines and withdraw whereas Zagan Pasha, a military officer, urged the sultan to push on and pointed out that Alexander the Great had conquered almost the entire known world when he was young. Perhaps knowing that they would support a final assault, Mehmed ordered Zagan to tour the camp and gather the opinions of the soldiers. On the evening of 26 May, the dome of the Hagia Sophia was lit up by a strange and mysterious light phenomenon, also spotted by the Ottomans from their camp outside the city. The Ottomans saw it as a great omen for their victory and the Byzantines saw it as a sign of impending doom. 28 May was calm, as Mehmed had ordered a day of rest before his final assault. The citizens who had not been put to work on repairing the crumbling walls or manning them prayed in the streets. On Constantine's orders, icons and relics from all the monasteries and churches in the city were carried along the walls. Both Catholics and Orthodox defenders joined in prayers and hymns and Constantine led the procession himself. Giustiniani sent word to Loukas Notaras to request that Notaras' artillery be brought to defend the land walls, which Notaras refused. Giustiniani accused Notaras of treachery and they almost fought each other before Constantine intervened.\nIn the evening, the crowds moved to the Hagia Sophia, with Orthodox and Catholic Christians joining and praying, the fear of impending doom having done more to unite them than the councils ever could. Cardinal Isidore was in attendance, as was Emperor Constantine. Constantine prayed and asked for forgiveness and remission of his sins from all the bishops there before he received communion at the church's altar. The emperor then left the church, going to the imperial palace and asking his household there for forgiveness and saying farewell to them before again disappearing into the night, going to make a final inspection of the soldiers manning the city walls.\nWithout warning, the Ottomans began their final assault in the early hours of 29 May. The service in the Hagia Sophia was interrupted, with fighting-age men rushing to the walls to defend the city and the other men and women helping the parts of the army stationed within the city. Waves of Mehmed's troops charged at Constantinople's land walls, hammering at the weakest section for more than two hours. Despite the relentless attack, the defense, led by Giustiniani and supported by Constantine, held firm. Unbeknownst to anyone, after six hours of fighting, just before sunrise, Giustiniani was mortally wounded. Constantine begged Giustiniani to stay and continue fighting, allegedly saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My brother, fight bravely. Do not forsake us in your distress. The salvation of the City depends on you. Return to your post. Where are you going?\nGiustiniani was too weak, however, and his bodyguards carried him to the harbor and escaped the city on a Genoese ship. The Genoese troops wavered when they saw their commander leave them, and though the Byzantine defenders fought on, the Ottomans soon gained control of both the outer and inner walls. About fifty Ottoman soldiers made it through one of the gates, the \"Kerkoporta\", and were the first of the enemy to enter Constantinople; it had been left unlocked and ajar by a Venetian party the night before. Ascending up the tower above the \"Kerkoporta\", they managed to raise an Ottoman flag above the wall. The Ottomans stormed through the wall and many of the defenders panicked with no means of escape. Constantinople had fallen. Giustiniani died of his wounds on his way home. Loukas Notaras was initially captured alive before being executed shortly after. Cardinal Isidore disguised himself as a slave and escaped across the Golden Horn to Galata. Orhan, Mehmed's cousin, disguised himself as a monk in an attempt to escape, but was identified and killed.\nDeath.\nConstantine died the day Constantinople fell. There were no known surviving eyewitnesses to the death of the emperor and none of his entourage survived to offer any credible account of his death. The Greek historian Michael Critobulus, who later worked in the service of Mehmed, wrote that Constantine died fighting the Ottomans. Later Greek historians accepted Critobulus's account, never doubting that Constantine died as a hero and martyr, an idea never seriously questioned in the Greek-speaking world. Though none of the authors were eyewitnesses, a vast majority of those who wrote of Constantinople's fall, both Christians and Muslims, agree that Constantine died in the battle, with only three accounts claiming that the emperor escaped the city. It also seems probable that his body was later found and decapitated. According to Critobulus, the last words of Constantine before he charged at the Ottomans were \"the city is fallen and I am still alive\".\nThere were other conflicting contemporary accounts of Constantine's demise. Leonard of Chios, who was taken prisoner by the Ottomans but later managed to escape, wrote that once Giustiniani had fled the battle, Constantine's courage failed and the emperor implored his young officers to kill him so that he would not be captured alive by the Ottomans. None of the soldiers were brave enough to kill the emperor and once the Ottomans broke through, Constantine fell in the ensuing fight, only to briefly get up before falling again and being trampled. The Venetian physician Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro, who was present at the siege, wrote that no one knew if the emperor had died or escaped the city alive, noting that some said that his corpse had been seen among the dead while others claimed that he had hanged himself as soon as the Ottomans had broken through at the St. Romanus gate. Cardinal Isidore wrote, like Critobulus, that Constantine had died fighting at the St. Romanus gate. Isidore also added that he had heard that the Ottomans had found his body, cut off his head and presented it to Mehmed as a gift, who was delighted and showered the head with insults before taking it with him to Adrianople as a trophy. Jacopo Tedaldi, a merchant from Florence who participated in the final fight, wrote that \"some say that his head was cut off; others that he perished in the crush at the gate. Both stories may well be true\".\nOttoman accounts of Constantine's demise all agree that the emperor was decapitated. Tursun Beg, who was part of Mehmed's army at the battle, wrote a less heroic account of Constantine's death than the Christian authors. According to Tursun, Constantine panicked and fled, making for the harbor in hopes of finding a ship to escape the city. On his way there, he came across a band of Turkish marines, and after charging and nearly killing one of them, was decapitated. A later account by Ottoman historian Ibn Kemal is similar to Tursun's account, but states that the emperor's head was cut off by a giant marine, who killed him without realizing who he was. Nicola Sagundino, a Venetian who had once been a prisoner of the Ottomans following their conquest of Thessaloniki decades before, gave an account of Constantine's death to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in 1454 since he believed that the emperor's fate \"deserved to be recorded and remembered for all time\". Sagundino stated that although Giustiniani implored the emperor to escape as he was carried away after falling on the battlefield, Constantine refused and preferred to die with his empire. Constantine went to where the fighting appeared to be thickest and, as it would be unworthy of him to be captured alive, implored his officers to kill him. When none of them obeyed his command, Constantine threw off his imperial regalia, as to not let himself be distinguished from the other soldiers, and disappeared into the fray, sword in hand. According to one source, when Mehmed wanted the defeated Constantine to be brought to him, he was told it was too late as the emperor was dead. A search for the body was conducted, and when it was found, the emperor's head was cut off and paraded through Constantinople before it was sent to the Sultan of Egypt as a gift, alongside twenty captured women and forty captured men.\nLegacy.\nHistoriography.\nConstantine's death marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, an institution tracing its origin to Constantine the Great's foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire's new capital in 330. Even as their realm gradually became more restricted to only Greek-speaking lands, the people of the Byzantine Empire continually maintained that they were \"Romaioi\" (Romans), not \"Hellenes\" (Greeks); as such, Constantine's death also marked the end of the line of Roman Emperors started by Augustus 1,480 years earlier. Constantine's death and the fall of Constantinople also marked the true birth of the Ottoman Empire, which dominated much of the eastern Mediterranean until its fall in 1922. The conquest of Constantinople had been a dream of Islamic armies since the 8th century and through its possession, Mehmed II and his successors claimed to be the heirs of the Roman emperors.\nThere is no evidence that Constantine ever rejected the hated union of the Churches achieved at Florence in 1439 after spending a lot of energy to realize it. Many of his subjects had chastised him as a traitor and heretic while he lived and he, like many of his predecessors before him, died in communion with the Church of Rome. Nevertheless, Constantine's actions during the fall of Constantinople and his death fighting the Turks redeemed the popular view of him. The Greeks forgot or ignored that Constantine had died a \"heretic\", and many considered him a martyr. In the eyes of the Orthodox Church, Constantine's death sanctified him and he died a hero. In Athens, the modern capital of Greece, there are two statues of Constantine: a colossal monument depicting the emperor on horseback on the waterfront of Palaio Faliro, and a smaller statue in the city's cathedral square, which portrays the emperor on foot with a drawn sword. There are no statues of emperors such as Basil II or Alexios I Komnenos, who were significantly more successful and died of natural causes after long and glorious reigns.\nScholarly works on Constantine and the fall of Constantinople tend to portray Constantine, his advisors, and companions as victims of the events that surrounded the city's fall. There are three main works that deal with Constantine and his life: the earliest is \u010cedomilj Mijatovi\u0107's \"Constantine Palaeologus (1448\u20131453) or The Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks\" (1892), written at a time when tensions were rising between the relatively new Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire. War appeared imminent and Mijatovi\u0107's work was intended to serve as propaganda for the Greek cause by portraying Constantine as a tragic victim of events he had no possibility of affecting. The text is dedicated to the young Prince Constantine, of the same name as the old emperor and the heir to the Greek throne, and its preface states that \"Constantinople may soon again change masters\", alluding to the possibility that Greece might conquer the ancient city.\nThe second major work on Constantine, Steven Runciman's \"The Fall of Constantinople 1453\" (1965), also characterizes Constantine through Constantinople's fall, portraying Constantine as tragic figure who did everything to save his empire from the Ottomans. However, Runciman partly blames Constantine for antagonizing Mehmed II through his threats concerning Orhan. The third major work, Donald Nicol's \"The Immortal Emperor: The Life and Legend of Constantine Palaiologos, Last Emperor of the Romans\" (1992), examines Constantine's entire life and analyzes the trials and hardships he faced not only as emperor, but as Despot of the Morea as well. Nicol's work places considerably less emphasis on the importance of individuals than the preceding works do, though Constantine is again portrayed as a mostly tragic figure.\nA less positive assessment of Constantine was given by Marios Philippides in \"Constantine XI Draga\u0161 Palaeologus (1404\u20131453): The Last Emperor of Byzantium\" (2019). Philippides sees no evidence that Constantine was a great statesman or a great soldier. Although the emperor had visions for his reign, Philippides deems him as diplomatically ineffective and unable to inspire the support of his people to achieve his goals. Philippides is highly critical of Nicol's \"The Immortal Emperor\", which he sees as unbalanced. In his book, Philippides points out that Constantine's reconquest of the Morea from the Latins had mostly been achieved through marriages and not military victories. Though much of Philippides' work relies on primary sources, some of his negative assessment seems speculative; he suggests that Constantine's campaigns in the Morea made the peninsula \"easier prey for the Turks\", something that cannot be substantiated through the actual events that unfolded.\nLegends of Constantine's family.\nConstantine's two marriages were brief and though he had attempted to find a third wife before the fall of Constantinople, he died unmarried and without children. His closest surviving relatives were his surviving brothers in the Morea: Thomas and Demetrios. Despite this, there was a persistent story that Constantine had left a widow and several daughters. The earliest documented evidence of this idea can be found in a letter by Aeneas Silvius (the future Pope Pius II) to Pope Nicholas V, dated July 1453. In Aeneas's \"Cosmographia\" (1456\u20131457), the story is elaborated upon: Mehmed II supposedly defiled and murdered the empress and Constantine's daughters in the celebrations after his victory. Aeneas also wrote of an imaginary son of Constantine who escaped to Galata, across the Golden Horn. The story of Constantine's wife and daughters might have been further propagated through the spread of the late 15th-century Russian tale called the \"Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad\", where a similar account appears. 16th-century French chronicler Mathieu d'Escouchy wrote that Mehmed raped the empress in the Hagia Sophia and then confined her to his harem.\nThe story of Constantine's supposed family survived into modern Greek folklore. One story, propagated until as late as the 20th century, was that Constantine's supposed empress had been six months pregnant at the time of Constantinople's fall and that a son had been born to her while Mehmed was warring in the north. The empress raised the boy, and though he was well-versed in the Christian faith and the Greek language in his youth, he turned to Islam as an adult and eventually became sultan himself, which meant that all Ottoman sultans after him would have been Constantine's descendants. Though the circumstances are completely fictional, the story might carry a shred of the truth; a grandson of Constantine's brother Thomas, Andreas Palaiologos, lived in Constantinople in the 16th century, converted to Islam and served as an Ottoman court official.\nAnother late folk story said that Constantine's empress had shut herself in the imperial palace after Mehmed's victory. After the Ottomans failed to break her barricades and enter the palace, Mehmed had to agree to give her three concessions: that all coins minted by the sultans in the city would bear the names of Constantinople or Constantine, that there would be a street reserved for Greeks alone, and that the bodies of the Christian dead would be given funerals according to Christian custom.\nLamentations.\nThe fall of Constantinople shocked Christians throughout Europe. In Orthodox Christianity, Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia became symbols of lost grandeur. In the Russian Nestor Iskander tale, the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) by Constantine the Great and its loss under an emperor by the same name was not seen as a coincidence, but as the fulfilling of the city's destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by Romulus and lost under Romulus Augustulus.\nAndronikos Kallistos, a prominent 15th-century Greek scholar and Byzantine refugee to Italy, wrote a text entitled \"Monodia\" in which he laments the fall of Constantinople and mourns Constantine Palaiologos, whom he refers to as \"a ruler more perceptive than Themistocles, more fluent than Nestor, wiser than Cyrus, more just than Rhadamanthus and braver than Hercules\".\nThe 1453 Greek long poem \"Capture of the City\", of uncertain authorship, laments the bad luck of Constantine, which the author blames on Constantine's ill-advised destruction of Glarentza (including its churches) in the 1420s. According to the author, all of Constantine's other misfortunes\u2014the destruction of the Hexamilion wall, the death of his brother John VIII, and the fall of Constantinople\u2014were the result of what happened at Glarentza. Even then, Constantine was not to blame for Constantinople's fall: he had done what he could and ultimately relied on help from Western Europe that never came. The poem concludes that people say Constantine died by his own sword, and ends with personally addressing the dead emperor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tell me, where are you to be found? Are you alive, or did you die by your own sword? The conquering Sultan Mehmed searched among the severed heads and corpses, but he never found you ... There are those that say that you are hidden beneath the almighty right hand of the Lord. Would that you were really alive and not dead.\nThe Marble Emperor.\nIn 15th-century Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles's \"The Histories\", Chalkokondyles finished his account of Byzantine history with hope for a time when a Christian emperor would rule over the Greeks again. In the late 15th century, a legend originated among the Greeks that Constantine had not actually died, but was merely asleep and was waiting on a call from heaven to come and rescue his people. This legend eventually became the legend of the \"Marble Emperor\" (Greek: \"Marmaromenos Vasilefs\", lit. the \"Emperor/King turned into Marble\"). Constantine Palaiologos, hero of the final Christian days of Constantinople, had not died, but had been rescued, turned into marble and immortalized by an angel moments before he was to be killed by the Ottomans. The angel then hid him in a secret cave beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople (where emperors in the past had marched during triumphs), where he awaits the angel's call to awaken and retake the city. The Turks later walled up the Golden Gate, explained by the story as a precaution against Constantine's eventual resurrection: when God wills Constantinople to be restored, the angel will descend from heaven, resurrect Constantine, give him the sword he used in the final battle and Constantine will then march into his city and restore his fallen empire, driving the Turks as far away as the \"Red Apple Tree\", their legendary homeland. According to the legend, Constantine's resurrection would be heralded by the bellowing of a great ox.\nThe story can be seen depicted in a series of seventeen miniatures in a 1590 chronicle by Cretan historian and painter Georgios Klontzas. Klontzas' miniatures show the emperor sleeping beneath Constantinople and guarded by angels, being crowned once more in the Hagia Sophia, entering the imperial palace and then fighting a string of battles against the Turks. Following his inevitable victories, Constantine prays at Caesarea (Kayseri), marches on Palestine and returns triumphant to Constantinople before entering Jerusalem. At Jerusalem, Constantine delivers his crown and the True Cross to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and finally travels to Calvary, where he dies, his mission completed. In the final miniature, Constantine is buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nIn 1625, Thomas Roe, an English diplomat, sought permission from the Ottoman government to remove some of the stones from the walled-up Golden Gate to send them to his friend, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who was collecting antiquities. Roe was denied permission and observed that the Turks had some sort of superstitious dread of the gate, recording that the statues placed on it by the Turks were enchanted and that if they were destroyed or taken down, a \"great alteration\" would occur to the city.\nThe prophecy of the Marble Emperor endured until the Greek War of Independence in the 19th century and beyond. It was fuelled when the King of the Hellenes, George I, named his firstborn son and heir Constantine in 1868. His name echoed the emperors of old, proclaiming his succession not just to the new Greek kings, but to the Byzantine emperors before them as well. Once he acceded to the throne as Constantine I of Greece, many in Greece hailed him as \"Constantine XII\" instead. Constantine I's conquest of Thessaloniki from the Turks in 1912 and his leadership in the Balkan Wars 1912\u20131913 seemed to be evidence that the prophecy was about to be realized; Constantinople and the Red Apple Tree were believed to be Constantine's next goals. When Constantine was forced to abdicate in 1917, many believed he had been unjustly removed before completing his sacred destiny. The hope of capturing Constantinople would not be completely dashed until the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War in 1922.\nRegnal number.\nConstantine Palaiologos is generally reckoned to have been the eleventh emperor with that name. As such, he is typically referred to as \"Constantine XI\", with 'XI' being a regnal number, used in monarchies since the Middle Ages to differentiate among rulers with the same name in the same office, reigning of the same territory. Regnal numbers were never used in the Roman Empire and despite an increase in emperors of the same name during the Middle Ages, such as the many emperors named Michael, Leo, John or Constantine, the practice was never introduced in the Byzantine Empire. Instead, the Byzantines used nicknames (for instance \"Michael \"the Drunkard\"\", now given the number Michael III) or patronymics (for instance \"Constantine, \"son of Manuel\"\" rather than Constantine XI) to distinguish emperors of the same name. The modern numbering of the Byzantine emperors is a purely historiographical invention, created by historians beginning with Edward Gibbon in his \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1776\u20131789).\nSince the name Constantine connected an emperor with the founder of Constantinople and the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine the Great, the name was particularly popular among emperors. Whilst modern historiography generally recognizes eleven emperors by the name, older works have occasionally numbered Constantine Palaiologos differently. Gibbon numbered him as \"Constantine XIII\" after counting two junior co-emperors, Constantine Lekapenos (co-emperor 924\u2013945) and Constantine Doukas (co-emperor 1074\u20131078 and 1081\u20131087). The modern number, \"XI\", was established with the publication of the revised edition of Charles le Beau's \"Histoire du Bas-Empire en commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 Constantin le Grand\" in 1836. Early numismatic (coin-related) works typically assigned Constantine Palaiologos higher numerals since there were numerous coins minted by junior co-emperors of the name Constantine as well.\nThere is particular confusion in the correct number of Constantines since there are two different Roman emperors commonly numbered as Constantine III\":\" the Western usurper Constantine III (r.407\u2013411) of the early 5th century and the briefly reigning Byzantine Constantine III (r.641) of the 7th century. In addition to them, the emperor commonly known today as Constans II (r.641\u2013668) actually reigned under the name Constantine, and has sometimes been referred to as Constantine III. A difficult case is Constantine Laskaris, who might have been the first, albeit ephemeral, emperor of the Empire of Nicaea, one of the Byzantine successor states after the Fourth Crusade. It is unclear whether Constantine Laskaris ruled as emperor or not and he is sometimes counted as \"Constantine XI\", which would make Constantine Palaiologos \"Constantine XII\". Constantine Laskaris is sometimes referred to as \"Constantine (XI)\", with Constantine Palaiologos numbered \"Constantine XI (XII)\".\nCounting comprehensively those who were officially recognized as rulers under the name Constantine, including those that only ruled nominally as co-emperors but with the supreme title, the total number of emperors named Constantine would be 18. By counting and numbering all previous co-emperors with that name, including Constantine (son of Leo V), Constantine (son of Basil I), Constantine Lekapenos and Constantine Doukas, in addition to Constans II, Constantine Laskaris and the western Constantine III, Constantine Palaiologos would most appropriately be numbered as \"Constantine XVIII\". Scholars commonly do not number co-emperors as the extent of their rule was mostly nominal and, unless they inherited the throne later, did not hold independent supreme power. By counting the western Constantine III, Constans II and Constantine Laskaris\u2014all emperors reigning with supreme power under the name of Constantine (though it is questionable in Laskaris's case)\u2014the numbering of Constantine Palaiologos would be \"Constantine XIV\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her novel \"La pla\u00e7a del diamant\" ('The diamond square', translated as \"The Time of the Doves\", 1962) has become the most popular Catalan novel to date and has been translated into over 30 languages. Some critics consider it to be one of the best novels published in Spain after the Spanish Civil War.\nAfter her death, one more of her artistic aspects was discovered, painting, which had remained in the background due to the importance that Rodoreda gave to writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I write because I like to write.

And excess has always scared me.\u2014\u200a\nBiography.\nChildhood (1908-1921).\nMerc\u00e8 Rosa Rodoreda i Gurgu\u00ed was born on October 10, 1908, at 340 \"carrer de Balmes, Barcelona\" Her parents were Andreu Rodoreda, from Terrassa and Montserrat Gurgu\u00ed, from Maresme. Both were lovers of literature and theater and had attended recital classes taught by Adri\u00e0 Gual at the School of Dramatic Art (which would later become the Institute of Theater). Her mother also had an interest in music.\nHer parents' financial problems forced her to leave school at age nine, from 1915 to 1917 at the Lurdes School in the Sarri\u00e0 neighborhood and from 1917 to 1920 at the \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Lourdes\" center, which was closest to her home, on Calle de Padua, at the height of the street of Vallirana. Later she went to an academy where she studied only French and business arithmetic.\nHer maternal grandfather, Pere Gurgu\u00ed, was an admirer of Jacint Verdaguer (of whom he had been a friend) and had collaborated as an editor in the magazines \"La Renaixensa\" and \"L'Arc de Sant Mart\u00ed\". In 1910, Pere Gurgu\u00ed had a monument in memory of Jacint Verdaguer erected in the garden of his house that bore an engraving with the title of the two most important works of the author, \"Canig\u00f3\" and \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\"; that place became the space for parties and family gatherings. The figure of her grandfather marked her intensely and she came to consider him her teacher. Gurgu\u00ed instilled in her a deep Catalan feeling, and a love for the Catalan language and flowers that were well reflected throughout Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda's work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I remember the feeling of being at home when, leaning over the railing of the roof, I saw the blue flowers of the jacaranda fall on the grass and the hydrangeas. I will never know how to explain it; I have never felt more at home than when I lived at my grandfather's house with my parents.\u2014\u200a\nOn May 18, 1913, when she was only five years old, she performed for the first time in a play playing the role of the girl Kitty in \"The Mysterious Jimmy Samson\", at the \"Torrent de les Flors\" theater. Years later, this character was, in a certain way, recovered for the story \"The bathroom\", within the work \"Twenty-two stories\".\nDuring her childhood she read all the classic and modern Catalan authors, such as Jacint Verdaguer, Ramon Llull, Joan Maragall, Josep Maria de Sagarra and Josep Carner, among others, surely influenced by the bohemian atmosphere that was breathed in her family's home.\nOn May 30, 1920, she participated in the drama \"Fifteen Days of Reign\" at Lourdes School. In the same act she also read the poem in Catalan called \"La negra\".\nIn 1921, her uncle Juan moved in with the family and changed the lifestyle of all its members, imposing austerity and conventional order. She had idealized him as a result of the letters she had previously received and ended up marrying him on October 10, 1928, her twentieth birthday, in the church of Bonanova. He was fourteen years older than her and, due to the degree of consanguinity, they needed a papal dispensation.\nYouth (1921-1938).\nAfter the wedding, the couple went to Paris on a honeymoon, and then they settled in a house on Zaragoza Street. Her husband had gone to Argentina when he was very young and had returned with a small fortune.\nOn July 23, 1929, their only son, Jordi Gurgu\u00ed i Rodoreda, was born. From that moment on, Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda began to do literary tests, to get rid of the economic and social dependency that the monotonous married life gave her. That is how she began to consider writing as a profession. Every day she locked herself for a while in a blue dovecote that was in Manuel Angelon's maternal house, which possibly later served as an inspiration to include the dovecote in \"The Time of the Doves\". During that time, she wrote verses, a theatrical comedy (which remains defunct), and a novel. Meanwhile, the Second Republic was proclaimed.\nSecond Spanish Republic.\nIn 1931 she began to take classes at the Dalmau Lyceum, where she improved her knowledge of language under the guidance of the pedagogue, linguist and esperantist Delf\u00ed Dalmau i Enero, who greatly influenced her and encouraged her to train, and with whom a bond of friendship developed. Rodoreda showed Dalmau what she wrote and he encouraged her to make these first texts public. According to Dalmau, Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda was an exceptional student, possessing spiritual fulfillment and a promising literary soul. This admiration led Dalmau to ask her to be one of the counterparts in her work \"Pol\u00e9mica\", An Apology for Catalan and Esperanto; she answered affirmatively and the piece was published in 1934. As the teacher Dalmau recognized, this work had also been influenced by Rodoreda's observations.\nIn 1932, the first novel by Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda entitled \"Am I an honored woman?\" and also some stories for various newspapers. The work went almost unnoticed until it was nominated for the \"Crexells Prize\" in 1933, although the winner of that year was Carles Soldevila. Also in that year of 1932, on October 20, she published an interview with the actress Maria Vila in the \"Mirador\" magazine.\nOn October 1, 1933, she began her journalistic career in the weekly magazine \"Clarisme\" where she published twenty-two contributions: five prose on traditional culture, thirteen interviews, two reviews, a short story, and three comments on political, musical and film themes. That same year, she joined the Barcelona Press Association, which evidenced her intention to formalize collaboration with journalistic work.\nIn the spring of 1934 she published her second work, \"What cannot be escaped\", in the editions of the magazine Clarisme. In May of that same year, she won the \"Independent Casino Award of the Floral Games of Lleida\" with the story \"The little mermaid and the dolphin\", which is currently lost.\nAfter writing that second work, Joan Puig i Ferrater, director of Ediciones Proa, visited her and was interested in publishing her next work: A day in the life of a man, which was published in the autumn of that same year in Proa. Rodoreda began to enter the literary world thanks to the help of Puig i Ferrater himself, who opened the doors of \"El Club de los Novelistas\", made up of authors such as Armand Obiols, Francesc Trabal or Joan Oliver, who were also former members of The Sabadell Group. At that time, she began to read the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky.\nFrom 1935 to 1939, she published a total of sixteen stories for children in the newspaper \"La Publicidad\", in a section called \"A while with children\". \"Noteworthy is The Boy\" and \"The House\", dedicated to her son, and also \"The Sheet\", which she dedicated to Josep Carner. In addition, she combined it with the publication of stories in the leading Catalan press media such as \"La Revista\", \"La Veu de Catalunya\" and \"Mirador\", among others.\nIn 1936 she published her fourth novel, \"Crim\". Later, Rodoreda rejected this novel, along with the previous three, considering them the product of inexperience.\nSpanish Civil War.\nFrom 1937 until that moment, Rodoreda held the position of Catalan language corrector in the Generalitat's Propaganda Commissariat. In this place she met writers of that time such as Aurora Bertrana, Maria Teresa Vernet, and also established a friendship with Susina Amat, Julieta Franquesa, Anna Muri\u00e0 and Carmen Manrubia.\nShe was awarded the 1937 Joan Crexells Prize for her work \"Aloma\". That same year, she separated from her husband Joan Gurgu\u00ed, after nine years of marriage and with one child. Her alleged lover, Andreu Nin, was arrested on June 16 in front of his party's headquarters on La Rambla in Barcelona, where days later he was tortured and killed by Soviet police officers on the orders of General Alexander Orlov, in the prison of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares.\nIn 1938, the fifth novel by Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda entitled \"Aloma\" was published by the Institution of Catalan Letters. This was the first work that Rodoreda accepted as hers, although later she rewrote and published it again. The same year, on behalf of the PEN Club of Catalonia, she traveled together with the Catalan writer Francesc Trabal, and read a welcome written by Carles Riba at the international congress of the PEN club in Prague.\nExile (1938-1972).\nOn January 23, 1939, a few months before the defeat of the Republicans, she fled into exile. Thinking that the separation would be brief, she left her son with her mother. Although she had never participated in politics, she left on the advice of her mother, who feared problems due to collaborative activities with Catalan publications and some left-wing magazines in previous years. Along with other intellectuals of the time, she went from Barcelona to Gerona with a bookmobile owned by the Ministry of Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia, then she followed the path through Mas Perx\u00e9s, in the municipality of Agullana, until crossing the administrative border by Le Perthus and entered Northern Catalonia on January 30. After spending the night in Le Boulou, they went to Perpignan; where they spent three days and then traveled to Toulouse by train.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The war was over, and we had to leave Spain. Me, not for nothing, because I had never been in politics, but the fact of having written in Catalan, and for having collaborated in magazines, let's say on the left, etcetera, etcetera. And advised by my mother, because I left thinking that after three, four or five months I would return home, but then it became eternal.\u2014\u200a\nRoissy-en-Brie.\nShe arrived in the French capital at the end of February and in early April she moved to Roissy-en-Brie, a town near the east of the capital. She settled in the castle of Roissy-en-Brie, an 18th-century building, which was offered as a refuge for writers. She shared a home for a few months with other intellectuals such as Anna Muri\u00e0, C\u00e9sar Augusto Jordana, Armand Obiols, Francesc Trabal and Carles Riba.\nIn Roissy-en-Brie several love affairs arose; one of them was between Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda and Armand Obiols. The problems in the castle arose because Armand Obiols was married to Francesc Trabal's sister and they had a son, who had remained in Barcelona with his mother. Furthermore, Armand Obiols' mother-in-law had traveled with Trabal to Roissy-en-Brie along with other members of the Trabal family. Consequently, this affair divided the Catalan exiles into two opposing camps. According to Anna Muri\u00e0, Francesc Trabal was opposed not only by his sister but by jealousy, since he would have had a secret relationship with Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda in Barcelona that only the two of them and their confidante knew. Rodoreda wanted to write a book about it called The Roissy novel, however, she never decided to do it.\nThe atmosphere of stability offered by the castle was disturbed by the start of World War II. At that time, some decided to flee to Latin American countries and others preferred to stay in France; this last destination was the one chosen by Rodoreda and Obiols. Later they moved to the Villa Rosset house, on the outskirts of the city.\nEscaping from the Nazi troops.\nMerc\u00e8 Rodoreda, along with other writers who were still taking refuge in France, had to flee from Paris in mid-June 1940 due to the advance of the Germans army going in the direction of Orl\u00e9ans by way of Artenay. Josep Maria Esverd was able to get a truck to flee France; however, the next day the truck was requisitioned by French troops. After an unsuccessful attempt to catch a train, they had to flee south on foot. The objective was to cross the Loire River in order to enter the unoccupied area, but shortly before reaching Orleans it was found on fire and there was no bridge left on that stretch of the Loire River; consequently, they deviated from the fixed route.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So we started the retreat on foot for three weeks. We spent about three weeks fleeing from the Nazis and walking on French roads [...] We passed over a bridge to Beaugency, which was being mined by French gunners. It was an afternoon with a very dark and very low sky. The Germans began to bombard the bridge with scary stukes; and you could see the bombs falling and exploding nearby. [...] There were dead people on the bridge. Something terrible! So, we headed to Orleans, thinking we could rest there for a day or two, but when we got to see Orleans ... Orleans was on fire, because it had just been bombed. It was then that we slept in a country house that smelled of bad meat and sour wine, because it was evident that many people had passed by that house; and we slept there all night watching from the windows how Orleans burned.\u2014\u200a\nFor twelve days they were sheltered in a farm until the signing of the armistice of 22 June 1940, after they crossed the Loire River through the town of Meung-sur-Loire, which was completely destroyed. From there they traveled even further south, this time settling in Limoges.\nLimoges-Bordeaux.\nIn Limoges, she settled in a room at 12 Hijas-Notre-Dame street. These were difficult times for Rodoreda, because on June 5, 1941, her partner Armand Obiols was arrested, and she was left alone until October of that year. During that time Armand Obiols had to do forced labor in Saillat-sur-Vienne in a quarry. However, several efforts by Rodoreda got him to be sent to Bordeaux. When Obiols was already in better living conditions in Bordeaux, Rodoreda became involved in a study circle dedicated to reading and learning the English language.\nDuring the following months, the relationship between Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda and Armand Obiols was mostly at a distance, and only sporadically could they see each other in person. It was not until the end of August 1943 that Rodoreda moved to number 43 \"Chauffours\" street in Bordeaux where she was reunited with her lover. In Bordeaux she lived very hard times and, in her words, she sewed \"until dirty\" in a warehouse for much of the day, a job that did not leave her time to write.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have made blouses for nine French people and I have been very hungry. I have met very interesting people and the coat I am wearing was inherited from a Russian Jewish woman who committed suicide with Veronal. In Limoges they kept an ovary of mine but what I will not leave in France will be neither my energy nor my youth, until I am fifty I intend to preserve a certain refined genre [...] And, above all, I want to write, I need to write; nothing has given me so much pleasure since I was in the world, as a freshly edited book of mine smelling of fresh ink. I'm sorry I didn't come with you, I would have felt more accompanied, I would have worked, all these useless, demoralizing years weigh on me, but I will take revenge. I will make them useful, stimulating my enemies to tremble. On the slightest occasion I will do a Sicilian horse entry again. There will be no one to stop me.\u2014\u200a\nParis.\nThe return to Paris took place in September 1946 when Rodoreda and Obiols moved to the house of Rafael Tasis in exile, the house was located at number 9 \"Co\u00ebtlogon\" street. A short time later, the couple moved to the sixth floor of number 21 on \"Cherche-Midi\" street, in the residential area of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, which was a meeting place for many intellectuals of the time. This was her home for eight years and, in fact, she did not fully disengage until 1977.\nAt the beginning of 1947, she was able to leave her job as a seamstress to go back to work as a collaborator in the magazine \"Revista de Catalunya\". Apart from publishing narrations during that year in the various editions of the magazine, she was also able to publish some in Chile and Mexico.\nFrom 1947 to 1953, Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda was unable to cultivate extensive literature because just in 1945 she had begun to suffer from health problems, along with the reappearance of somatic paralysis in her right arm. For this reason, she intensified her poetic creation and found her teacher in Josep Carner, with whom she maintained a close relationship by correspondence. In 1952, she began recovery therapy at the Ch\u00e2tel-Guyon spa. During the years that she was in Paris, she also began two novels that she did not finish.\nIn 1947, during the Floral Games of the Catalan Language held in London, she won her first Natural Flower with six sonnets: \"Rosa\", \"Amor novell\", \"Adam a Eva\", \"Ocell\" and two more untitled sonnets. With the poem \"M\u00f3n d'Ulisses\", Rodoreda won for the second time the Natural Flower of the Floral Games of 1948 in Paris, a poem that was published in the magazine \"La Nostra Revista\" that same year. \"Albes i nits\" gave her the third victory in the Floral Games contest and, consequently, she was named \"\"Mestre en Gai Saber\" in Montevideo in 1949. That same year she visited Barcelona for the first time after exile.\nIn 1951, she also approached painting, interested above all in painters such as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Joan Mir\u00f3, and she made some of her own creations. In a 1954 letter to Armand Oriols she explains that she already had a \"style and a world\" in painting, yet she acknowledged that her place was in writing. On the other hand, Obiols, began to work as a translator for UNESCO thanks to Quiroga Pl\u00e1, and two years later, in 1953, he permanently moved to Geneva.\nGeneva.\nIn 1954, Rodoreda and Obiols moved into an apartment at 19 Violet street, in a bourgeois neighborhood in the city of Geneva. In this city, she always felt exiled and even recognized that Geneva \"is a very boring city, suitable for writing\". Shortly after, Obiols had to move to Vienna for work reasons. That same year, Rodoreda made a trip to Barcelona to attend the wedding of her son, Jordi Gurgu\u00ed i Rodoreda.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda, interview by Baltasar Porcel to Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda (1972)\nIn 1956, she won the Joan Maragall Essay Prize with \"Three Sonnets and a Song\" that was published in the literary supplement \"La Gaceta de Letras de La Nova Revista (1955-1958)\". Likewise, for her story \"Carnaval\" she was awarded the Joan Santamaria Prize in Barcelona that same year.\nIn 1958 the book of short stories written under the name of \"Twenty-two short stories\" was published which, a year earlier, had received the prestigious Victor Catal\u00e0 Prize. Some of these stories had already been published in Mexico during her exile in France, while others were unpublished. As the author confessed, this book came from a technical crisis that led to an unequal literary level among the various stories, although they were tied by a thematic unit.\nAccording to some unpublished annotations that spoke of Geneva, Rodoreda revealed that during those years she saw writers such as Eugeni Xammar, Julio Cort\u00e1zar and his wife, and Jorge Sempr\u00fan.\nDuring her long stay in Geneva, she created a garden that she would later replicate in Romany\u00e0 de la Selva. The many flowers that surrounded her served as inspiration to portray the flowers that would end up making up \"Real Flowers\" within \"Viatges i Flors\", along with the trips that she would write in Romany\u00e0; however, this book was not published until 1980.\n\"La Perla del Lago\" was the title of a potential novel by the author that remained incomplete, and was kept in the archives of the Institute of Catalan Studies. The title is the name of a restaurant on the shore of Lake Geneva in a corner of Geneva that she frequented. It was a location near the United Nations building where the author regularly ate, and from where she had a great view in the dining room on the upper floors. As described in the prologue of \"Broken Mirror\", the eyes of the protagonist Teresa Goday de Valldaura were the same as the lady of Lem\u00e1n.\nIn 1958, she submitted \"Una mica d'hist\u00f2ria\" (\"A bit of history\") for the Joanot Martorell Prize, although she did not win but Ricard Salvat did with \"\"Animals destroying laws\"; however, this novel was published in 1967 this time under the title \"Garden by the Sea\". She also wrote the short story \"Ron Negrita\" for the volume \"The 7 Deadly Sins Seen by 21 Storytellers\", although it would later become part of the volume \"It looked like silk and other stories\"\". From 1958 onwards, and without breaking up with Rodoreda, Obiols maintained a relationship with a woman in Geneva until his death.\nIn 1959, Rodoreda began to write the novel that was possibly the best of her career \"The Time of the Doves\" (\"Colometa\"), published in 1962 as \"La pla\u00e7a del Diamant\" for \"El Club de los Novelistas\". In 1960, she submitted the novel to the \"Premi Sant Jordi de novel\u00b7la\", previously known as the Joanot Martorell Prize, however, she did not win but the Enric Mass\u00f3 y Urgell\u00e8s prize was won with her novel \"Vivir es no facil\" (\"Living is not easy\"). Joan Fuster also sent her to 'The Novelists Club', which at that time was run by Joan Sales. Sales was delighted by the novel and started a correspondence with Rodoreda. From that moment, she found in the Editor Club a space where she could pour her literary work, where Salas was a co-founder. When it was published in 1962, the novel was not exactly the one that had been presented for the Sant Jordi prize, but it had received an extension both in chapters and in corrections by Salas, Obiols and the author herself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Explaining the genesis of \"La Plaza del Diamante\" might be interesting, but is it possible to explain how a novel is formed, what impulses provoke it, how strong a will does it make it continue, that what has been done has to end with a struggle? Started easily? Would it be enough to say that I was thinking of it in Geneva looking at the Sal\u00e8ve mountain or walking through La Perla del Lago? [...] I wrote it feverishly, as if every working day was the last of my life. I worked blinded; I would correct what I had written in the morning in the afternoon, ensuring that, despite the rush with which I was writing, the horse would not run out of control, holding the reins well so that it did not deviate from the path. [...] It was a time of great nervous tension, which left me half ill.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1961, she sent another work to the same award, \"Death in Spring\", which did not win either, but rather it was Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s with \"The Last Landing\" who was victorious.\nIn 1965, Rodoreda took the first steps in the publication of her Complete Works after a request from Joaquim Molas, however they would not be published in Ediciones 62 until 1977. The work did not include any of her first four works (\"I am an honest woman?\", \"What cannot escape\", \"A day in the life of a man\" and \"Crime\") because she considered that they were the result of her inexperience and she agreed to rewrite \"Aloma\" to adapt it to the level of her current work; and that it would be reissued in 1969.\nIn 1966, her mother, Montserrat Gurgu\u00ed, died; and three years later her uncle-husband, Joan Gurgu\u00ed. As a result of the death of her husband, the relationship between mother and son was strained due to problems with the distribution of the inheritance. However, in 1966 was the year in which \"La calle de las Camelias\" was published that received the Sant Jordi Prize without her having submitted a candidacy; This fact was used for the direction to decide to award a work already published. With this same novel she also received the \"Serra d'Or Critical Prize for Literature and Essay\" in 1967, and the Ramon Llull Novel Award in 1969. In 1967, she began working on the novel \"Broken Mirror\", which years later would become one of the most successful works of the author. \"Broken mirror\" was the result of the reworking of the play \"A day\" that had not been able to premiere. She also published two works: \"Garden by the Sea\" and a collection of stories entitled \"My Cristina and other stories\".\nFrom 1970 onwards, her work began to be translated into other languages, though her first translated work was \"La Plaza del Diamante\" in Spanish in 1965. In 1971, her feeling of exile was accentuated with the death of her companion of many years, Armand Obiols, at the Vienna University Hospital. This fact, together with the discovery of another Obiols lover, left her even more alone and broken in Switzerland. During those days, she wrote a shocking little card about the hard days she spent in the hospital; currently, this card is kept in the archives of the IEC. Consequently, after the reunion with some friends from the time of the Civil War, she decided to settle in 1972 in Carmen Manrubia's chalet in Romany\u00e0 de la Selva, without ceasing to reside in Geneva, albeit more and more sporadically.\nRomany\u00e0 de la Selva (1972-1983).\nIn 1972, she spent the summer in \"La Senyal\" - currently called \"La Senyal Vell\" - in Romany\u00e0 de la Selva, which was a house owned by her friend Carmen Manrubia, however it had been designed by both of them. Her friendship with Carmen Manrubia existed since when they worked together in the \"Propaganda Commissariat\" of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, although they became estranged when Manrubio and Rodoreda went into exile in different countries. Also participating in this project were Carmen Manrubia's adopted son, Carlos, Susina Amat and Esther Floricourt. She lived in this house for six years, until in 1979 she built her own house in Romany\u00e0. The name chosen by the two friends for the house, \"La senyal\", refers to the stigma of Cain in the work \"Demian\" by Hermann Hesse.\nAt Manrubio's house she substantially completed the writing work for Broken Mirror that had already begun in Geneva years before. This work is considered the most successful of her literary production and was published in 1974. She also wrote there Trips to various towns within Trips and flowers and the novel War, So Much War These two books were published in 1980 and with these she won the City of Barcelona Award. That same year, he also went to Barcelona to make the proclamation of the Festes de la Merc\u00e8. Also in that same year, she was awarded the Catalan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award for her literary career in the Catalan language, thus achieving her consecration as a writer. In 1978, \"Semblava de seda i altres contes\" (\"It looked like silk and other stories\") was published, which was a compilation of stories written throughout her life.\nThe joint project between Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda and Manrubio failed. Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda bought a piece of land in 1977 in which she had a house built next to the existing one; which would be finished in 1979. According to Anna Maria Saludes and Amat, this abandonment of the Manrubio house was given by Rodoreda's need to follow a life in solitude typical of her character; fruit of the difficult coexistence between the two.\nIn 1979, she wrote her theatrical comedy \"El Maniqu\u00ed\", which was premiered in the same year by the Brujas de Dol company at the Sitges International Theater Festival directed by Aracelli Bruch.\nIn those last years of her life, Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda saw her novels several times on the small and big screen. First, her novel \"Aloma\", directed by Llu\u00eds Pascual, made the leap to television in 1978. Later, made the leap to the big screen \"La pla\u00e7a del Diamant\" (1982) with Silvia Munt in the role of Colometa and directed by Francesc Betriu.\nIn 1982, she wrote a compilation of biographical articles published in Serra d'Or titled \"Childhood Files\". Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda belonged to the Catalan Language Writers Association and was a member and honorary member after her return.\nDuring the last period of her life, her works developed from her usual psychologic style to become more akin to symbolism in its more cryptic form.\nIn 1998, a literature prize was instituted in her name: the Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda prize for short stories and narratives.\nShe was made a Member of Honour of the \"Associaci\u00f3 d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana\", the Association of Writers in Catalan Language. The library in Platja d'Aro is named in her honor.\nDeath.\nAt 1:30\u00a0p.m. on April 13, 1983, Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda died of very advanced liver cancer at the Mu\u00f1oz Clinic, in Girona. During her last days, when she was already admitted to the hospital, she reconciled with the members of her family after they were notified by Joan Sales. As explained by Rodoreda's close friend, Isabel Par\u00e9s, when Rodoreda was diagnosed with cancer, she collapsed and did not want to fight to live.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda, \"Death in Spring\"\nThe burning chapel was installed in the Palau Solterra of the Department of Culture of the Generalitat and, following her wishes, Rodoreda was buried in the Romany\u00e0 de la Selva cemetery in a massive burial attended by many of her colleagues and colleagues. other personalities of the moment.

One of the several tombs of Sari Saltik is found in town.\nThe Babadag Lake is divided only by a strip of marshland from Razim Lake, a broad landlocked sheet of water spilling into the Black Sea.\nHistory.\nThe name of Babadag is connected with 13th century dervish Baba Sari Saltik, who is said to have led a number of Turkomans to Dobruja and to have settled them in this area. The town was first mentioned by Ibn Battuta under the name Baba Saltuk, as the furthermost outpost of the \"Turks\" (i.e., the Golden Horde).\nThe town was conquered by Bayezid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in his 1393 Danubian campaign. The construction of a fortress was begun here in 1633 during the reign of Murad IV, but by 1650 only the fortress's foundation walls and towers were standing. In the 17th century, it occasionally served as the winter headquarters for the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire during their wars with Russia. The town's location near to the Black Sea made it a target for the Russian navy, the town was bombed by the Russians in 1854 during the Crimean War. In the mid-19th century, Babadag formed part of the region (\"sanjak\") of Silistra within the \"Bulgarian Government\" (Danube Vilayet). Following the 1877\u20131878 war between the Ottoman and Russian empires, Babadag became part of independent Romania.\nMilitary training facility.\nAt Babadag, the Romanian Army operates a military training facility. With a total surface area of , the area can accommodate live-fire exercises for infantry and tanks at company level as well as artillery subunits. In 2008, United States Army forces started to train at Babadag as part of Romania's integration into NATO. In 2022, units of the 101st Airborne Division (that has returned to Europe for the first time since the end World War II) deployed to the Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Air Base have been training at the Babadag base, near the border with Ukraine.

In 1205 he acknowledged the feudal supremacy of the papacy and was crowned in Rome by Pope Innocent III, swearing to defend the Catholic faith (hence his epithet, \"the Catholic\"). He was the first king of Aragon to be crowned by the pope.\nIn the first decade of the thirteenth century Peter commissioned the \"Liber feudorum Ceritaniae\", an illustrated codex cartulary for the counties of Cerdagne, Conflent, and Roussillon.\nMarriage.\nOn 15 June 1204 Peter married (as her third husband) Marie of Montpellier, daughter and heiress of William VIII of Montpellier by Eudocia Comnena. She gave him a son, James, but Peter soon repudiated her. Marie was popularly venerated as a saint for her piety and marital suffering, but was never canonized; she died in Rome in 1213. Marie also perhaps bore Peter II a daughter, \"Sancha\", at Collioure in October 1205 according to Christian Nique. (\"Sancha\" was born in 1206 according to other accounts; in 1208 according to Mark Gregory Pegg, but February 1208 is more likely the year the couple's son was born). Sancha was betrothed to Raymond VII the son Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, not long after her birth, according to Nique, only days (sources differ as to how long). The marriage contract included Marie's inheritance, Montpellier, which was to be passed to the child immediately should something happen to Peter, says Nique, citing documents discovered in 1850, something Marie would at first not agree to, but finally agreed to a few months later, stating that she had agreed under pressure. However the child's younger brother James makes no mention of her and Sancha was apparently dead before the New Year, according to Nique's information.\nWarfare.\nPeter participated in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 which marked the turning point of Muslim domination in the Iberian peninsula.\nThe Crown of Aragon was widespread in the area that is now southwestern France, but which at that time was under the control of vassal local princes, such as the Counts of Toulouse. The Cathars or Albigenses rejected the authority and the teachings of the Catholic Church. Innocent called upon Philip II of France to suppress the Albigenses. Under the leadership of Simon de Montfort a campaign was launched. The Albigensian Crusade, begun in 1209, led to the slaughter of approximately 20,000 men, women and children, Cathar and Catholic alike. Over the course of twenty years military campaigns essentially destroyed the previously flourishing civilization of Occitania and by 1229 brought the region firmly under the control of the King of France, and the Capetian dynasty from the north of France.\nPeter returned from Las Navas in autumn 1212 to find that Simon de Montfort had conquered Toulouse, exiling Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who was Peter's brother-in-law and vassal. Peter crossed the Pyrenees and arrived at Muret in September 1213 to confront Montfort's army. He was accompanied by Raymond of Toulouse, who tried to persuade Peter to avoid battle and instead starve out Montfort's forces. This suggestion was rejected.\nThe Battle of Muret began on 12 September 1213. The Aragonese forces were disorganized and disintegrated under the assault of Montfort's squadrons. Peter himself was caught in the thick of fighting, and died as a result of a courageous last stand. He was thrown to the ground and killed. The Aragonese forces broke in panic when their king was slain and Montfort's crusaders won a crushing victory.\nThe nobility of Toulouse, vassals of the Crown of Aragon, were defeated. The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in 1229, in which the integration of the Occitan territory into the French crown was agreed upon.\nUpon Peter's death, the kingdom passed to his only son by Marie of Montpellier, the future James the Conqueror.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A successful general, Maurice was chosen as heir and son-in-law by his predecessor Tiberius II.\nMaurice's reign was troubled by almost constant warfare. After he became emperor, he brought the war with Sasanian Persia to a victorious conclusion. The empire's eastern border in the South Caucasus was vastly expanded and, for the first time in nearly two centuries, the Romans were no longer obliged to pay the Persians thousands of pounds of gold annually for peace. \nAfterward, Maurice campaigned extensively in the Balkans against the Avars\u2014pushing them back across the Danube by 599. He also conducted campaigns across the Danube, the first Roman emperor to do so in over two centuries. In the west, he established two large semi-autonomous provinces called exarchates, ruled by \"exarchs\", or viceroys of the emperor. In Italy Maurice established the Exarchate of Italy in 584, the first real effort by the empire to halt the advance of the Lombards. With the creation of the Exarchate of Africa in 591 he further solidified the power of Constantinople in the western Mediterranean.\nMaurice's successes on battlefields and in foreign policy were counterbalanced by mounting financial difficulties of the empire. Maurice responded with several unpopular measures which alienated both the army and the general populace. In 602, dissatisfied soldiers elected an officer named Phocas, who usurped the throne and ordered the execution of Maurice and his six sons. This event would prove a disaster for the empire, sparking a twenty-six-year war with a resurgent Sassanid Persia which would leave both empires devastated prior to the Arab conquests. \nMaurice's reign is a relatively well-documented era of late antiquity, in particular by the historian Theophylact Simocatta. The \"Strategikon\", a manual of war which influenced European and Middle Eastern military traditions for well over a millennium, is traditionally attributed to Maurice.\nLife.\nOrigins and early life.\nMaurice was born in Arabissus in Cappadocia in 539. His father was Paul. He had one brother, Peter, and two sisters, Theoctista and Gordia, the latter of whom was later the wife of the general Philippicus. He is recorded to have been a native Greek speaker, unlike the previous emperors since Anastasius I Dicorus. Contemporary Eastern Roman sources call him a local Cappadocian. Paul the Deacon, a late 8th-century Lombard writer, calls him the first emperor \"from the race of the Greeks\". Evagrius, writing under Maurice's reign, declared he traced his lines to Old Rome, which could be either truth or a flattery. Legends from much later times call him Armenian (in reference to the territories of later Cilician Armenia), but the historicity of this claim is opposed by the historian Anthony Kaldellis.\nMaurice first came to Constantinople as a \"notarius\" to serve as secretary to Tiberius, the \"comes excubitorum\" (commander of the Excubitors, the imperial bodyguard). When Tiberius was named \"Caesar\" in 574, Maurice was appointed to succeed him as \"comes excubitorum\".\nPersian War and accession to the throne.\nIn late 577, despite a complete lack of military experience, Maurice was named as \"magister militum per Orientem\", effectively commander-in-chief of the Roman army in the east. He succeeded General Justinian in the ongoing war against Sassanid Persia. At about the same time he was raised to the rank of \"patrikios\", the empire's senior honorific title, which was limited to a small number of holders. \nIn 578, a truce in Mesopotamia came to an end and the main focus of the war shifted to that front. After Persian raids in Mesopotamia, Maurice mounted attacks on both sides of the Tigris, captured the fortress of Aphumon and sacked Singara. Sassanid emperor Khosrow sought peace in 579, but died before an agreement could be reached and his successor Hormizd IV (r. 579\u2013590) broke off the negotiations. In 580, Byzantium's Arab allies the Ghassanids scored a victory over the Lakhmids, Arab allies of the Sassanids, while Byzantine raids again penetrated east of the Tigris. Around this time the future Khosrow II was put in charge of the situation in Armenia, where he succeeded in convincing most of the rebel leaders to return to Sassanid allegiance, although Iberia remained loyal to the Byzantines.\nThe following year an ambitious campaign by Maurice, supported by Ghassanid forces under al-Mundhir III, targeted Ctesiphon, the Sassanid capital. The combined force moved south along the river Euphrates accompanied by a fleet of ships. The army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near Ctesiphon. There they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians. \nIn response to Maurice's advance, Sassanid general Adarmahan was ordered to operate in northern Mesopotamia, threatening the Roman army's supply line. Adarmahan pillaged Osrhoene, and was successful in capturing its capital, Edessa. He then marched his army toward Callinicum on the Euphrates. With the possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone Maurice was forced to retreat. The retreat was arduous for the tired army, and Maurice and al-Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition's failure. However, they cooperated in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum.\nThe mutual recriminations were not laid to rest by this. Despite his successes, al-Mundhir was accused by Maurice of treason during the preceding campaign. Maurice claimed that al-Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians, who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates. The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie, as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders. \nBoth Maurice and al-Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius, who tried to reconcile them. Maurice visited Constantinople himself, where he was able to persuade Tiberius of al-Mundhir's guilt. The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians; Irfan Shah\u00eed says that it probably had more to do with Maurice's dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler. This was compounded by the Byzantines' habitual distrust of the \"barbarian\" and supposedly innately traitorous Arabs, as well as by al-Mundhir's staunchly Monophysite faith. Al-Mundhir was arrested the following year on suspicion of treachery, triggering war between Byzantines and Ghassanids and marking the beginning of the end of the Ghassanid kingdom.\nIn June of 582 Maurice scored a decisive victory against Adarmahan near Constantina. Adarmahan barely escaped the field, while his co-commander Tamkhosrau was killed. In the same month Emperor Tiberius was struck down by an illness which shortly thereafter killed him. In this state Tiberius initially named two heirs, each of whom was to marry one of his daughters. Maurice was betrothed to Constantina, and Germanus, related to emperor Justinian I, was married to Charito. Some historians believe that the plan was to divide the empire in two, with Maurice receiving the eastern provinces and Germanus the western. \nOn 5 August, Tiberius was on his deathbed and civilian, military and ecclesiastical dignitaries awaited the appointment of his successor. He then chose Maurice and named him \"Caesar\", after which he adopted the name \"Tiberius\". John of Niki\u00fb and Theophanes the Confessor write that Germanus was proclaimed \"caesar\" at the same time. However, on 11 August 582, only Maurice is recorded as \"Caesar\" in the subscription of a law of Tiberius. According to John of Niki\u00fb, Germanus was Tiberius' favored candidate for the throne but declined out of humility. Maurice was crowned emperor soon after, on 13 August. Tiberius had reportedly prepared a speech on the matter but at this point was too weak to speak. The \"quaestor sacri palatii\" (the senior judicial official of the empire) read it for him. The speech proclaimed Maurice as \"Augustus\" and sole successor to the throne. On 14 August 582 Tiberius died. Maurice became sole emperor, marrying Constantina in the autumn.\nShortly after his ascension the advantage he had gained at the Battle of Constantina was lost when his successor as \"magister militum\" of the east, John Mystacon, was defeated at the River Nymphios by Kardarigan. The situation was difficult: Maurice ruled a bankrupt Empire; it was at war with Persia; he was paying extremely high tribute to the Avars, 80,000 gold solidi a year; and the Balkan provinces were being thoroughly devastated by the Slavs.\nMaurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Roman troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Romans secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. \nIn 590, two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrow II, the new king. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrow. Khosrow and the two Parthians fled to the Eastern Roman court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrow regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of the Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrow.\nSubsequently, Khosrow was adopted by the emperor in order to seal their alliance. The adoption was made through a rite of \"adoptio per arma\", which ordinarily assumed the Christian character of its partakers. However, the chief Byzantine bishops, \"despite their best attempts\", failed to convert Khosrow. Khosrow rewarded Maurice by ceding to the empire western Armenia up to the lakes Van and Sevan, including the large cities of Martyropolis, Tigranokert, Manzikert, Ani, and Yerevan. Maurice's treaty brought a new status-quo to the east territorially. Byzantium was enlarged to an extent never before achieved by the empire. During the new \"perpetual peace\" millions of solidi were saved by the remission of tribute to the Persians.\nBalkan war.\nThe Avars arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 568. Almost immediately they launched an attack on Sirmium, the keystone to the Roman defences on the Danube, but were repulsed. They then sent 10,000 Kotrigur Huns to invade the Roman province of Dalmatia. There followed a period of consolidation, during which the Romans paid them 80,000 gold solidi a year. In 579, his treasury empty, Tiberius II stopped the payments.\nThe Avars retaliated with another siege of Sirmium. The city fell in c. 581. After the capture of Sirmium, the Avars demanded 100,000 solidi a year.\nRefused, they used the strategically important city as a base of operations against several poorly defended forts along the Danube and began pillaging the northern and eastern Balkans. The Slavs began settling the land from the 580s on. \nIn 584, the Slavs threatened the capital and in 586 the Avars besieged Thessalonica, while the Slavs went as far as the Peloponnese. After his victory on the eastern frontier in 591, Maurice was free to focus on the Balkans. He launched several campaigns against the Slavs and Avars. In 592 his troops retook Singidunum (modern Belgrade) from the Avars. His commander-in-chief Priscus defeated the Slavs, Avars and Gepids south of the Danube in 593. The same year he crossed the Danube into modern-day Wallachia to continue his series of victories. In 594, Maurice replaced Priscus with his rather inexperienced brother Peter, who, despite initial failures, scored another victory in Wallachia. Priscus, now in command of another army further upstream, defeated the Avars again in 595. The latter now only dared to attack peripherally, in Dalmatia two years later. In the same year the Byzantines concluded a peace treaty with the Avar leader Bayan I, which allowed the Romans to send expeditions into Wallachia. \nIn 598, Maurice broke the treaty to permit a retaliation campaign inside the Avar homeland. In 599 and 601 the Roman forces wreaked havoc amongst the Avars and Gepids. In 602, the Slavs suffered a crushing defeat in Wallachia. The Roman troops were now able to hold the Danube line again. Meanwhile, Maurice was making plans for repopulating devastated areas in the Balkans by using Armenian settlers. Maurice also planned to lead further campaigns against the Avar Khaganate, so as to either destroy them or force them into submission.\nDomestic policy.\nIn the west, Maurice organised the threatened imperial dominions in Italy into the Exarchate of Italy. The Late Roman administrative system provided for a clear distinction between civil and military offices, primarily to lessen the possibility of rebellion by over-powerful provincial governors. In 584, Maurice created the office of exarch, which combined the supreme civil authority of a \"praetorian prefect\" and the military authority of a \"magister militum\" and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Constantinople. The Exarchate was successful in slowing the Lombard advance in Italy. In 591, he created a second Exarchate in North Africa, along similar lines.\nIn 597, an ailing Maurice wrote his last will, in which he described his ideas of governing the empire. His eldest son, Theodosius, would rule the eastern provinces from Constantinople; his second son, Tiberius, would rule the western exarchates from Rome. Some historians believe he intended for his younger sons to rule from Alexandria, Carthage, and Antioch. His intent was to maintain the unity of the empire; this idea bears a strong resemblance to the Tetrarchy of Diocletian. However, Maurice's violent death prevented these plans from coming to fruition.\nIn religious matters, Maurice was tolerant towards Monophysitism, although he was a supporter of the Council of Chalcedon. He clashed with Pope Gregory I over the latter's defence of Rome against the Lombards.\nMaurice's efforts to consolidate the empire slowly but steadily succeeded, especially after the peace with Persia. His initial popularity apparently declined during his reign, mostly because of his fiscal policies. In 588 he announced a cut in military wages by a quarter, leading to a serious mutiny by troops on the Persian front. He refused to pay a small ransom in 599 or 600 to free 12,000 Byzantine soldiers taken prisoner by the Avars and the prisoners were killed.\nFamily.\nMaurice's marriage produced nine known children:\nA daughter, Miriam/Maria, is recorded by the 12th-century chronicler Michael the Syrian and other eastern sources as married to Khosrow II but not in any Byzantine Greek ones; she is probably legendary.\nHis brother Petrus (c. 550 \u2013 602) became the \"curopalates\" and was killed at the same time as Maurice. Petrus married Anastasia Aerobinda (born c. 570), daughter of Areobindus (born c. 550), and had female issue. Maurice's nephew Domitian of Melitene was probably a son of Petrus.\nOverthrow and death.\nIn the autumn of 602, Maurice decreed that the army should stay for winter beyond the Danube in Sclaveni territory, seeking to capitalize the earlier campaign successes by maintaining pressure on the foreign enemies. The exhausted troops mutinied against the emperor, demanding permission to return to winter quarters. However, Maurice repeatedly ordered his troops to start a new offensive. Enraged, the army proclaimed Phocas their leader and marched to Constantinople. They demanded that Maurice abdicate and proclaim as successor either his son Theodosius or Germanus, Theodosius' father-in-law. In response, Maurice enlisted the circus factions and general Comentiolus to defend the Theodosian Walls. On 21 November, Germanus was accused of treason by Maurice and he sought sanctuary in Hagia Sophia. As riots against Maurice erupted in Constantinople, the emperor, taking his family with him, left the city on a warship heading to Nicomedia in the middle of the night of 22 November. Theodosius was put ashore with direction to seek support from the Persians, though sources claim that he never reached his destination. According to Theophylact, Germanus made an attempt for the throne but when it failed, he paid homage to Phocas, who had emerged as the heavy favorite. \nOn 23 November 602, Phocas was crowned emperor in Hebdomon and two days later, entered Constantinople with unanimous support. His troops captured Maurice and his remaining family, and brought them to the Harbor of Eutropius at Chalcedon. Maurice was murdered at the harbor of Eutropius on 27 November 602. The deposed emperor was forced to watch his five younger sons executed before he was beheaded himself. There is debate over whether Theodosius managed to escape. The Persian king Khosrow II used this coup and the murder of his patron as an excuse for a renewed war against the empire.\nEmpress Constantina and her three daughters were temporarily spared and sent to a monastery. A few years later, Constantina and her daughters were all executed at the harbor of Eutropius when she and Germanus were found guilty of plotting against Phocas. The entire family of Maurice and Constantina was buried at the monastery of St. Mamas or Nea Metanoia that had been founded by Maurice's sister Gordia.\nLegacy.\nAssessments.\nIn ancient sources, Maurice is seen as an able emperor and commander-in-chief, though the description of him by Theophylact may exaggerate these traits. He possessed insight, public spirit, and courage. He was successful in military efforts against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and in diplomacy with Khosrow II. His administrative reforms were the basis for the later introduction of themes as military districts.\nMaurice is traditionally named as author of the military treatise \"Strategikon\". Some historians now believe the \"Strategikon\" is the work of his brother or another general in his court, however.\nHistorian C. W. Previt\u00e9-Orton believes his greatest weakness was his inability to judge how unpopular his decisions were. According to Anthony Kaldellis, his failure to keep the public opinion on his side cost him his life, which was a turning point in the fortunes of the empire. The war against Persia which it caused weakened both empires, enabling the Slavs to permanently settle the Balkans and paving the way for the Arab-Muslim expansion.\nHis court still used Latin alongside Greek, as did the army and administration. Historian A. H. M. Jones characterises the death of Maurice as the end of the era of Classical Antiquity, as the turmoil that shattered the empire over the next four decades permanently and thoroughly changed society and politics.\nLegends.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe first legendary accounts of Maurice's life are recorded in the ninth century, in the work of the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. According to his chronicle \"Chronographia\", the death of the imperial family is due to divine intervention: Christ asked the emperor to choose between a long reign or death and acceptance in the kingdom of heaven. Maurice preferred the second choice.\nThe same story has been recorded in a short Syriac hagiography on the life of the emperor. It is of East Syrian origin. This was later sanctified by the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the Syriac author, the emperor asked in prayer to receive a punishment in this world and a \"perfect reward\" in the kingdom of heaven. The choice was offered by an angel. Anthony Alcock has published an English translation.\nAccording to another legend in the same text, Maurice prevented a nurse from substituting one of his sons so as to save at least one of the heirs of the empire.\nIt has been proposed that the name of the Albanian folk hero Muji derives from that of Emperor Maurice (Murik, Muji). Similarly, the name of the folk hero's wife, Ajkuna (or Kuna), corresponds to that of the Empress Aelia Constantina, the wife of Maurice, if we take into account the laws of phonetic evolution of the Albanian language since Late Antiquity. Though this proposition remains a matter of debate.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Because it is simpler than the halting problem and the \"Entscheidungsproblem\" it is often used in proofs of undecidability.\nDefinition of the problem.\nLet formula_1 be an alphabet with at least two symbols. The input of the problem consists of two finite lists formula_2 and formula_3 of words over formula_1. A solution to this problem is a sequence of indices formula_5 with formula_6 and formula_7 for all formula_8, such that\n formula_9\nThe decision problem then is to decide whether such a solution exists or not.\nformula_10\nformula_11\nAlternative definition.\nThis gives rise to an equivalent alternative definition often found in the literature, according to which any two homomorphisms formula_12 with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which now asks whether there exists a nonempty word formula_13 in the domain such that\nformula_14.\nAnother definition describes this problem easily as a type of puzzle. We begin with a collection of dominos, each containing two strings, one on each side. An individual domino looks like \nformula_15 \nand a collection of dominos looks like \nformula_16. \nThe task is to make a list of these dominos (repetition permitted) so that the string we get by reading off the symbols on the top is the same as the string of symbols on the bottom. This list is called a match. The Post correspondence problem is to determine whether a collection of dominos has a match.\nFor example, the following list is a match for this puzzle.\nformula_17.\nFor some collections of dominos, finding a match may not be possible. For example, the collection\nformula_18.\ncannot contain a match because every top string is longer than the corresponding bottom string.\nExample instances of the problem.\nExample 1.\nConsider the following two lists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA solution to this problem would be the sequence (3, 2, 3, 1), because\n formula_19\nFurthermore, since (3, 2, 3, 1) is a solution, so are all of its \"repetitions\", such as (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), etc.; that is, when a solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions of this repetitive kind.\nHowever, if the two lists had consisted of only formula_20 and formula_21 from those sets, then there would have been no solution (the last letter of any such \u03b1 string is not the same as the letter before it, whereas \u03b2 only constructs pairs of the same letter).\nA convenient way to view an instance of a Post correspondence problem is as a collection of blocks of the form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nthere being an unlimited supply of each type of block. Thus the above example is viewed as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere the solver has an endless supply of each of these three block types. A solution corresponds to some way of laying blocks next to each other so that the string in the top cells corresponds to the string in the bottom cells. Then the solution to the above example corresponds to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExample 2.\nAgain using blocks to represent an instance of the problem, the following is an example that has infinitely many solutions in addition to the kind obtained by merely \"repeating\" a solution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn this instance, every sequence of the form (1, 2, 2, . . ., 2, 3) is a solution (in addition to all their repetitions):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProof sketch of undecidability.\nThe most common proof for the undecidability of PCP describes an instance of PCP that can simulate the computation of an arbitrary Turing machine on a particular input. A match will occur if and only if the input would be accepted by the Turing machine. Because deciding if a Turing machine will accept an input is a basic undecidable problem, PCP cannot be decidable either. The following discussion is based on Michael Sipser's textbook \"Introduction to the Theory of Computation\".\nIn more detail, the idea is that the string along the top and bottom will be a computation history of the Turing machine's computation. This means it will list a string describing the initial state, followed by a string describing the next state, and so on until it ends with a string describing an accepting state. The state strings are separated by some separator symbol (usually written #). According to the definition of a Turing machine, the full state of the machine consists of three parts:\nAlthough the tape has infinitely many cells, only some finite prefix of these will be non-blank. We write these down as part of our state. To describe the state of the finite control, we create new symbols, labelled \"q\"1 through \"q\"\"k\", for each of the finite-state machine's \"k\" states. We insert the correct symbol into the string describing the tape's contents at the position of the tape head, thereby indicating both the tape head's position and the current state of the finite control. For the alphabet {0,1}, a typical state might look something like:\n101101110\"q\"700110.\nA simple computation history would then look something like this:\n\"q\"0101#1\"q\"401#11\"q\"21#1\"q\"810.\nWe start out with this block, where \"x\" is the input string and \"q\"0 is the start state:\nThe top starts out \"lagging\" the bottom by one state, and keeps this lag until the very end stage. Next, for each symbol \"a\" in the tape alphabet, as well as #, we have a \"copy\" block, which copies it unmodified from one state to the next:\nWe also have a block for each position transition the machine can make, showing how the tape head moves, how the finite state changes, and what happens to the surrounding symbols. For example, here the tape head is over a 0 in state 4, and then writes a 1 and moves right, changing to state 7:\nFinally, when the top reaches an accepting state, the bottom needs a chance to finally catch up to complete the match. To allow this, we extend the computation so that once an accepting state is reached, each subsequent machine step will cause a symbol near the tape head to vanish, one at a time, until none remain. If \"q\"\"f\" is an accepting state, we can represent this with the following transition blocks, where \"a\" is a tape alphabet symbol:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWe need one final adaptation for the proof to work: as written above, the block with symbol \"a\" can simply be used in isolation to satisfy the solution. One way to adapt it is to use two different versions of each tape symbol, and require that they alternate from one state to the next. With this change, the initial tile is the only tile that can go first in the match. We can also enforce the final end state of the computation, for example with another symbol (here denoted #end) to terminate the entire history:\nThis shows how a static tile puzzle can simulate a Turing machine computation.\nThe previous example\n\"q\"0101#1\"q\"401#11\"q\"21#1\"q\"810.\nis represented as the following solution to the Post correspondence problem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVariants.\nMany variants of PCP have been considered. One reason is that, when one tries to prove undecidability of some new problem by reducing from PCP, it often happens that the first reduction one finds is not from PCP itself but from an apparently weaker version.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During his time in the air force, Tebbit flew Meteor and Vampire jets. In July 1954, at RAF Waterbeach near Cambridge, he had to escape from a burning Meteor 8 which had crashed off the end of the runway by breaking open the canopy. After completing his national service, he transferred to the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) in April 1952, and was promoted to flying officer.\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Tebbit worked in publishing and advertising. In 1953, Tebbit joined British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a navigator and pilot. Initially, between 1952 and 1955, continued to fly in RAuxAF the with 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron at North Weald in Essex. Of his airline navigation training, he later said: \"In those days it was a considerable academic syllabus. You had to be up to speed on spherical trigonometry to get through it\". During his time at BOAC, he was an official in the British Airline Pilots' Association.\nMember of Parliament.\nTebbit was elected as MP for Epping in 1970 and then for Chingford in February 1974. He is recorded as an MP member of the Conservative Monday Club in 1970.\nTebbit's first intervention as an MP was to ask a question of the then Minister at the Board of Trade, Frederick Corfield, on 6 July 1970. His question was on the subject of a crash of a Comet-4 aircraft in Spain on 3 July, which killed all the 112 people on board at the time.\nIn 1975, six men (the 'Ferrybridge Six') were dismissed from their jobs because of the introduction of a closed shop (an arrangement that only union members could be employed) and were denied unemployment benefit. The Secretary of State for Employment, Michael Foot, commented: \"A person who declines to fall in with new conditions of employment which result from a collective agreement may well be considered to have brought about his own dismissal\". Tebbit accused Foot of \"pure undiluted fascism\" and affirmed that this \"left Mr Foot exposed as a bitter opponent of freedom and liberty\". The next day (2 December) \"The Times\" first leader \u2014titled \"IS MR FOOT A FASCIST?\"\u2014quoted Tebbit and went on:\nMr Foot's doctrine is intolerable because it is a violation of the liberty of the ordinary man in his job. Mr Tebbit is therefore using fascism in a legitimate descriptive sense when he accuses Mr. Foot of it. We perhaps need to revive the phrase \"social fascism\" to describe the modern British development of the corporate state and its bureaucratic attack on personal liberty. The question is not therefore: \"is Mr. Foot a fascist?\" but \"does Mr. Foot know he is a fascist?\"\nDuring the Grunwick dispute, when workers went on strike over pay and working conditions, the owner George Ward refused to recognise their trade union, and there was a split in the Conservative Shadow Cabinet between the conciliatory approach of Jim Prior, the Shadow Employment Secretary, and Keith Joseph. Tebbit involved himself in that dispute by making a controversial speech on 12 September 1977, in which he said:\nInside Britain there is a ... threat from the Marxist collectivist totalitarians. ... Just to state that fact is to be accused of 'union-bashing'. ... Such people are to be found in the Conservative, Liberal and Labour Parties. Their politics may be different but such people share the morality of Laval and P\u00e9tain ... they are willing not only to tolerate evil, but to excuse it. ... Both Jim Prior and Keith Joseph know that George Ward and Grunwick are not perfect, nor was Czechoslovakia perfect in 1938. But if Ward and Grunwick are destroyed by the red fascists, then, as in 1938, we will have to ask, whose turn is it next? Yes, it is like 1938. We can all see the evil, but the doctrine of appeasement is still to be heard.\nTebbit was accused of comparing Prior to Laval and at that year's Conservative Party conference, he attempted to avoid personalising the issue, and openly splitting the party, without retracting what he had said. Tebbit said of these differences: \"I'm a hawk\u2014but no kamikaze. And Jim's a dove\u2014but he's not chicken\".\nDuring a debate in the Commons on 2 March 1978, Michael Foot likened Tebbit to a \"semi-house-trained polecat\" in response to a question from Tebbit asking if he accepted that the legislation being proposed that made it compulsory for people to join a trade union was an act of fascism. After he was made Lord Tebbit in 1992, he chose a winged polecat as a supporter on his coat of arms. Later, in the debate Tebbit asked Foot whether he would \"put a bridle on his foul-mouthed tongue\".\nFirst Thatcher ministry.\nAfter the Conservative Party regained power after the general election of 1979, Tebbit was appointed Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Trade.\nIn the September 1981 Cabinet reshuffle, Thatcher appointed Tebbit as Employment Secretary. This was seen as a shift to a 'tougher' approach to the trade unions than had been the case under Tebbit's predecessor, Jim Prior. Tebbit introduced the Employment Act 1982 which raised the level of compensation for those unfairly dismissed from a closed shop and prohibited closed shops unless 80% of relevant workers approved the arrangement in periodic ballots. It also removed trade unions' immunity from liability in tort \u2013 i.e. made trade unions liable for civil damages if they committed unlawful acts, and made injunctions possible against such acts. In his memoirs Tebbit said that the 1982 Act was his \"greatest achievement in Government\".\nIn March 2021 Tebbit was reported by \"The Times\" to have said, during a Zoom meeting, that Special Branch had regularly spied on union leaders while he was employment secretary.\nIn the aftermath of the 1981 riots in Handsworth and Brixton, Tebbit responded to a suggestion by the Young Conservative National chairman, Iain Picton, that rioting was the natural reaction to unemployment:\nI grew up in the '30s with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking till he found it.\nAs a result, Tebbit is often misquoted as having directly told the unemployed to \"get on your bike\", and he was popularly referred to as \"Onyerbike\" for some considerable time afterwards.\nThe former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan once remarked of Tebbit: \"Heard a chap on the radio this morning talking with a cockney accent. They tell me he is one of Her Majesty's ministers\". Peter Dorey of Cardiff University wrote that \"it was Norman Tebbit ... who was perhaps the public face or voice of Essex man, and articulated his views and prejudices\".\nSecond Thatcher ministry.\nThe Nuffield study of the 1983 general election found that Tebbit was the second most prominent Conservative on radio and television news broadcasts during the campaign with 81 appearances (after Thatcher's 331 appearances).\nIn the post-election October 1983 reshuffle, Tebbit was moved from Employment to become Trade and Industry Secretary, replacing Cecil Parkinson, who had resigned. Thatcher had actually wanted Tebbit to become Home Secretary, but William Whitelaw vetoed this.\nIn 1984 Tebbit was badly injured, with multiple injuries, in the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where he was staying during the Conservative Party Conference, by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. His wife, Margaret, was permanently disabled.\nIn 1985, Tebbit was appointed Chairman of the Conservative Party and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Thatcher wanted to keep him in the Cabinet. During the Westland affair Tebbit was against the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation taking over Westland Aircraft. Tebbit opposed the 1986 United States bombing of Libya from British bases and objected to Thatcher's refusal to consult the Cabinet fully on the matter. However, he did criticise the BBC for its supposedly biased reporting of the raid. During the same year, he disbanded the Federation of Conservative Students for publishing an article, penned by Harry Phibbs, following Nikolai Tolstoy's accusation that former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was complicit in the forced repatriation of Cossacks in the aftermath of the Second World War.\nOn 13 April 1986, Tebbit and his chief of staff Michael Dobbs visited Thatcher at Chequers to present her with the results of polling by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi which found that with inflation down and the trade unions weakened, \"the Prime Minister's combative virtues were being received as vices: her determination was perceived as stubbornness, her single-mindedness as inflexibility, and her strong will as an inability to listen\". Tebbit and Dobbs told her this was becoming known as the \"TBW factor\": TBW standing for \"That Bloody Woman\". They recommended Thatcher take a lower profile in the forthcoming general election.\nA few weeks later, Tebbit gave an interview to John Mortimer for \"The Spectator\" where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's a good deal of admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.\nFor quite a while, Tebbit was seen as Thatcher's natural successor as Party leader. During early 1986, when Thatcher's popularity declined in the polls, commentators began to suggest that the succession of the Conservative leadership would lie between Michael Heseltine and Tebbit.\nAt the 1986 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth, Tebbit\u2014along with Saatchi and Saatchi, Dobbs and the Conservatives' Director of Research, Robin Harris\u2014came up with the next party slogan\u2014'The Next Move Forward'. For the first time, the Conservatives employed pre-conference advertising to publicise the new-style conference. Tebbit persuaded Thatcher that ministers would state their objectives that they would achieve in the next three years; Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would use these to design posters, leaflets, and brochures to be deployed as each minister finished their speech. The aim \"was that in 1986 the media should reflect the image I wanted\u2014of a Government confident, united, clear in where it was going\u2014and determined to get there\". According to Tebbit the conference \"was more successful than I had dared to hope ... the opinion polls which had us 7% behind in June and still 5% down in September now put us back into first place\u2014a position we never relinquished from then right through the election campaign. The Prime Minister's ratings were immediately restored\".\nA MORI opinion poll in March 1987 saw Tebbit as second-favourite amongst voters as Thatcher's successor (Heseltine: 24% vs Tebbit: 15%); however, amongst Conservative voters, Tebbit was the front-runner with (Heseltine: 14% vs Tebbit: 21%). In October 1988, MORI asked the same question, with similar results (Heseltine: 22% vs Tebbit: 15%) and (Heseltine: 20% vs Tebbit: 26%) amongst Conservative voters. However, Thatcher apparently once told Rupert Murdoch: \"I couldn't get him elected as leader of the Tory party even if I wanted \u2013 nor would the country elect him if he was\".\nOn 6 January 1987, the journalist Hugo Young published a quote attributed to Tebbit in \"The Guardian\" newspaper. Tebbit's chief of staff, Michael Dobbs, responded by writing a letter to the newspaper citing Young's dislike of Tebbit, adding \"Perhaps this explains the invention of the quotation he [Mr Young] attributed to Mr Tebbit\". The quote was \"No-one with a conscience votes Conservative\". Before this letter was published, however, the words \"the invention of\" had been removed. Despite publishing this letter \"The Guardian\" subsequently repeated the quote, and Young again attributed it to him in a letter to \"The Spectator\". Tebbit feared that if no action was taken against \"The Guardian\" the Labour Party would use this quote against the Conservatives in the forthcoming general election. With Thatcher's consent Tebbit threatened the newspaper with legal action if they did not retract the quotation and apologise to Tebbit. The case continued until 1988 when \"The Guardian\" apologised, published a retraction and paid \u00a314,000 in libel damages in an out-of-court settlement.\nDuring the 1987 general election, Tebbit and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spearheaded the Conservative campaign, focusing on the economy and defence. However, when on 'Wobbly Thursday' it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the 'exiles' camp of David Young, Tim Bell and the Young and Rubicam firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young's memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: \"Norman, listen to me, we're about to lose this fucking election\". In his memoirs, Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: \"We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong\u2014defence, taxation, and the economy\". During the election campaign, however, Tebbit and Thatcher argued. Tebbit had already informed Thatcher at the beginning of the campaign that he would leave the government after the election to care for his wife.\nThatcher said to her friend Woodrow Wyatt on the Sunday after polling day in 1987: \"He'll carry the scar of that Brighton bombing all his life. I didn't want him to go. Whenever he is away from her he can't even attend to business properly. He's always ringing up to find out if the nurses are looking after his wife all right\". In her memoirs, Thatcher said she \"bitterly regretted\" losing a like-minded person from the Cabinet.\nOn 31 July 1987, Tebbit was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour.\nBackbenches.\nAs Trade and Industry Secretary, Tebbit had privatised British Telecom in November 1984. He became a director of the company on 3 November 1987; this gave him an additional salary plus shares in the company.\nIn late 1987 and 1988, Tebbit formed a temporary alliance with Michael Heseltine in campaigning for the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, which they succeeded in achieving through a backbench amendment.\nTebbit was also prominent in an unsuccessful Conservative backbench rebellion against a Bill to give 50,000 households (around 250,000 people) from Hong Kong British citizenship.\nIn April 1988, Tebbit caused much controversy when, in front of an audience of South African dignitaries, he accused critics of South African apartheid of cowardice and \"stinking hypocrisy\". He said that, although black critics attacked apartheid in South Africa, they did not speak out against violence among black tribes in South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was visiting London at the time and called on Thatcher to repudiate the remarks; instead, she defended Tebbit.\nIn April 1990, he proposed the \"Cricket test\", also known as the \"Tebbit Test\", when he argued that whether people from ethnic minorities in Britain supported the England cricket team (rather than the team from their country of ancestry) should be considered a barometer\u2014but not the sole indicator\u2014of whether they are truly British: \"A large proportion of Britain's Asian population fail to pass the cricket test. Which side do they cheer for? It's an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?\"\nTebbit told Woodrow Wyatt in 1991 that he did not think certain immigrant communities would assimilate \"because some of them insist on sticking to their own culture, like the Muslims in Bradford and so forth, and they are extremely dangerous\". In August 2005, after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which were carried out by three young men of Pakistani descent and one of Jamaican descent, Tebbit claimed vindication for these views.\nIn a conversation with Woodrow Wyatt on 19 December 1988, Tebbit said he would not go back into politics unless Thatcher \"was run over by the proverbial bus and he didn't like the look of the person he thought might get her job and destroy the work they've done\". On another occasion (22 February 1990), Tebbit said to Wyatt that he would stand for the Conservative leadership if Thatcher suddenly resigned; but when Alec Douglas-Home suggested that Thatcher would not stand at the next election because she must be tired, Tebbit disagreed: \"She has got amazing stamina\".\nFollowing Geoffrey Howe's resignation from the government in November 1990, Thatcher asked Tebbit to return to the Cabinet as Education Secretary, but he refused on the grounds that he was looking after his disabled wife. During the 1990 Conservative leadership election, Tebbit was on Thatcher's campaign team with the job of assessing her support amongst Conservative MPs. According to Thatcher's biographer John Campbell, Tebbit was \"her most visible cheerleader ... who characteristically took the fight to Heseltine by holding a cheeky press conference on his Belgravia doorstep\". After the first ballot but before the results became known, Tebbit wanted Thatcher to make a clear commitment to fight the second ballot if her vote fell short of the amount needed to win outright. When Tebbit saw Thatcher on 21 November he told her she was the candidate with the best chance of beating Heseltine. However, Thatcher withdrew from the contest the next day. Tebbit wanted to stand, but never did. Tebbit subsequently switched his support to John Major.\nAfter Major came back from Maastricht with an opt-out from the Social Chapter and the single currency, Tebbit was one of the few MPs in the debate on 18 December 1991 to criticise the new powers the Community would acquire. He said the government had been on the defensive against \"federalist follies\" and that Maastricht had seen \"a series of bridgeheads into our constitution, into the powers of this House, and into the lives of individuals and businesses\".\nAfter leaving the House of Commons.\nTebbit decided not to stand in the 1992 election, to devote more time to caring for his disabled wife. Following the election he was granted a life peerage and entered the House of Lords, having been created Baron Tebbit, of Chingford in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, on 6 July 1992. His former seat of Chingford was aggregated in 1997 with Woodford Green in boundary changes and was held for the Conservative Party by his successor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Iain Duncan Smith. Tebbit famously said: \"If you think I'm right-wing, you should meet this guy\".\nMaastricht Treaty and Europe.\nOn 11 August 1992, Woodrow Wyatt noted in his diary: \"[Thatcher] also seems to have formed a new alliance with Tebbit who stirs her up and talks a lot of nonsense [about the Treaty].\"\nAt the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed John Major's government when he made a speech attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as \"young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident \u2013 the lager louts of our party\" in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, Norman Fowler. Tebbit held aloft a copy of the Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back \"No!\" after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers. Gyles Brandreth, a Conservative whip, wrote in his diary:\nThe talk of the town is Norman Tebbit's vulgar grand-standing barn-storming performance on Europe. He savaged Maastricht, poured scorn on monetary union, patronised the PM ... and brought the conference (or a good part of it) to its feet roaring for more. He stood there, arms aloft, acknowledging the ovation, Norman the conqueror.\nIn his memoirs, Major accused Tebbit of hypocrisy and disloyalty because Tebbit had encouraged Conservative MPs to vote for the Single European Act in 1986 but was now campaigning for Maastricht's rejection.\nIn March 2007, Tebbit became patron of the cross-party Better Off Out campaign, which advocated British withdrawal from the EU. Tebbit issued a statement explaining his support:\nFrom being a supporter of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 I have come to believe that the United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends and the rest of the world\u00a0\u2013 but we would prefer to govern ourselves.\nInvolvement with the Conservative Party after 1992.\nTebbit privately said of John Major on 17 November 1994: \"He has the mulishness of a weak man with stupidity\". When asked what would it take for him to support Major, Tebbit responded: \"Have an entirely new department, the sole job of which would be to deal with the Brussels machinery in every aspect. I agree that we don't want to leave the EU, but we've got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don't like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of\".\nIn 1995, Tebbit publicly backed John Redwood's bid for the Conservative Party leadership, praising his \"brains, courage and humour\".\nIn an interview for the \"New Statesman\" magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague's right-ward shift and said that he had \"never been a [Michael] Portillo fan\". He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher's resignation: \"When I look at what happened to the party, I tell myself that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose I am one of those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister\". When asked if he regretted also allowing Major to become Prime Minister, Tebbit responded:\nI helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't have been on the radar screen. I'd have been opposing Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won ... he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision ... I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.\nIn August 2002, Tebbit called on the then leader of the Conservatives, Iain Duncan Smith, to \"clear out\" Conservative Central Office of \"squabbling children\" who were involved with infighting within the Party. He named Mark MacGregor, a former leader of the Federation of Conservative Students which Tebbit disbanded for \"loony Right libertarian politics\", as one of them. Then, in October the same year, Tebbit accused a group of Conservative \"modernisers\" called \"The Movement\" of trying to get him expelled from the Party. Tebbit said that The Movement consisted of a \"loose\" grouping of thirteen members who had previously supported Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo for Party leader. Duncan Smith subsequently denied that Tebbit would ever be expelled and Thatcher publicly said she was \"appalled\" at attempts to have Tebbit expelled and telephoned him to say that she was \"four square behind him\".\nIn February 2003, Tebbit gave a speech to an audience of the Chartered Institute of Journalists at London's Reform Club in Pall Mall, urging journalists to reject political correctness in favour of \"open, honest and vigorous debate\". He blamed \"timid\" politicians, including members of his own party, for allowing PC language and ideas to take hold in Britain by default.\nTebbit backed David Davis for Party leader during the 2005 Conservative leadership election.\nOn 30 January 2006, he accused the Conservative Party of abandoning the party's true supporters on the Right, and opposed the new Leader David Cameron's attempts \"to reposition the party on the 'Left of the middle ground'\".\nIn an interview with \"The Times\" in September 2007, Tebbit said the Conservatives lack somebody of the standing of Thatcher, and said that although it did not matter if Cameron's team were educated at Eton, \"what a lot of people will suggest is that they don't know how the other half lives. David and his colleagues\u00a0\u2013 the very clever young men they have in Central Office these days\u00a0\u2013 are very intellectually clever, but they have no experience of the world whatsoever. He has spent much of his time in the Conservative Party and as a public relations guy. Well, it's not the experience of most people in the streets. That's the real attack and that's damaging to him, I think\".\nIn February 2008, after a magazine article written by shadow education secretary Michael Gove, Tebbit publicly criticised what he characterised as \"the poisonous tree of Blairism\", which he said had been \"planted\" in the Conservative Party front bench.\nTebbit was the vice-president of the Conservative Way Forward group. He continued his criticism of the Conservative Party's move to a more \"centre-right\" position by stating that their abandonment of the traditional right vote has created a political vacuum, contributing to the rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), including two MP defections, both from the Conservatives.\nTebbit retired from the House of Lords on 31 March 2022, under provision in the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.\nOther political views.\nOverseas aid.\nSpeaking in the Lords on 26 November 1996, Lord Tebbit criticised aid to Africa, saying that most aid sent to Africa goes down a \"sink of iniquity, corruption and violence\" and does little to help the poor. A spokesman for the charity Oxfam said Tebbit's view was \"simplistic and unhelpful\". Later Lord Tebbit defended his statement that most money went \"into the pockets\" of politicians \"to buy guns for warlords\".\nHomosexuality.\nIn a letter to \"The Daily Telegraph\" in November 1998, Tebbit said homosexuals should be barred from being Home Secretary. A Conservative Party spokesman said Tebbit was \"out of touch\" and the official spokesman for William Hague, then Conservative Party leader, said Hague disagreed with Tebbit. In 2013 Tebbit wrote in his \"Telegraph\" blog that his views concerning whether a homosexual person could be Home Secretary had changed.\nIn 2004 he opposed the British Government's Civil Partnership Act 2004. In an interview for \"The Big Issue\" in May 2013, Lord Tebbit said that the coalition government's determination to pass the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had alienated grassroots Tories. He also speculated that it could mean that a lesbian queen could give birth to a future monarch by artificial insemination, and that the legislation might allow him to marry his own son to escape inheritance tax.\nIn 2018 Tebbit said that he would not attend services at St Edmundsbury Cathedral conducted by new dean Joe Hawes, because of Hawes' civil partnership with another clergyman. Tebbit described Hawes as a \"sodomite\". Hawes said that he felt \"absolutely no ill will\" towards Tebbit for his comments and stated: \"I have always admired the way in which Lord Tebbit has cared for his wife with such devotion following the Brighton bomb.\" Subsequently, Hawes and Tebbit became friends, and Tebbit resumed attending services at the cathedral. Hawes presided over the funeral services for both Margaret and Norman Tebbit in 2021 and 2025, respectively. Hawes later described their relationship as \"a rather extraordinary friendship\".\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn October 1999, he spoke out against the plans to abolish the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Tebbit said he was against throwing the Constabulary's name and badge \"into the modernisation trash can\" and that the RUC had been \"the thin green line standing between bloody anarchy and the rule of law\". Tebbit also mocked Blair's pledge at the Labour conference to \"set people free\": \"He has set them free. More than 250 terrorists, bombers and extortionists. Kneecappers, kidnappers, arsonists and killers have been set free. But their victims remain imprisoned. Some are imprisoned within broken bodies. Some imprisoned in grief for their loved ones. Some imprisoned by death in their graves\".\nOther parties.\nIn an article for \"The Spectator\" in May 2001 Tebbit said that retired British security service agents from the Foreign Office had infiltrated James Goldsmith's Referendum Party in the 1990s and then later infiltrated UKIP. Tebbit called for an independent enquiry into the matter.\nMiners' strike.\nIn 2009, Tebbit said he had regrets about the 1984\u20131985 miners' strike:\nThose mining communities had good working class values and a sense of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that would be the end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.\nImmigration.\nIn June 2014, in response to an alleged Islamist plot to infiltrate schools in Birmingham, Tebbit wrote in \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"No one should have been surprised at what was going on in schools in Birmingham. It is precisely what I was talking about over 20 years ago and Enoch Powell was warning against long before that. We have imported far too many immigrants who have come here not to live in our society, but to replicate here the society of their homelands.\"\n\"Foreigners\" speech.\nIn 2017, Lord Tebbit criticised a Lords amendment to the Brexit bill which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens to live and work within the UK after Brexit. He also criticised the Lords for \"thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners\" and \"[looking] after the foreigners and not the British\", as Theresa May had hoped to leave this amendment out of the bill to secure the rights of British citizens living in EU countries post-Brexit. His comments produced \"loud gasps\" from the majority of peers (but gained audible support by a number on the Conservative benches), adding that \"Of course we don't have the power to look after our citizens overseas, not in these days when we don't have many gunboats\".\nPersonal life, illness and death.\nTebbit lived in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, until his death. He was an agnostic. He remarked tongue-in-cheek in a March 2011 interview, when asked whether he thinks God exists, \"I'm not sure. He ought to. Things would work better.\" He married Margaret Daines in 1956. The couple had two sons and a daughter. He was once described as a 'keen amateur chef' and published a book on cooking game.\nIn December 2013, Tebbit suffered a cardiac incident, praising the NHS for their quick and decisive action. In a May 2014 interview, he talked about discovering he had been suffering from a form of cardiac arrhythmia for more than 40 years: \"The suspicion I had a heart problem caused me to puzzle over earlier incidents in my life,\" he said, reflecting on his RAF jet fighter crash in 1954. \"I suspect that, that morning, stressed from the previous day and having had little sleep, I lost consciousness on that take-off run.\"\nTebbit's wife died at home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 19 December 2020, aged 86, after having suffered from depression and dementia with Lewy bodies.\nTebbit died at his home on 7 July 2025, aged 94.\nIn the media.\nIn the late 1980s, Tebbit was frequently the target for stand-up comedian Ben Elton, who typically referred to him as \"Normo Tebbs\".\nTebbit was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series \"Tory! Tory! Tory!\". In 2011, writing in his \"Telegraph\" blog, he uncharacteristically praised an article in \"The Guardian\" by Michael White. Tebbit cited White's article (an account of Pauline Pearce's visit to the 2011 Tory party conference) as being \"a perfect illustration of my theory of the common ground of politics.\"\nCritics nicknamed Tebbit \"The Chingford Skinhead\". The satirical TV puppet show \"Spitting Image\" portrayed him as a sinister, leather-clad bovverboy beating up fellow cabinet members and keeping order in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. The Professor of English at University College London, John Mullan, has written: \"In \"Spitting Image\" and probably the middle-class imagination, Norman Tebbit was given an Essex drag on his vowels which he hardly possessed. He should speak in that way because of what he represented\".\nIn May 2009, Tebbit urged voters to snub the main three political parties in the upcoming EU Parliament election. Tebbit, who in March 2009 had said that he would vote for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), stated: \"Local elections, the great British public should just treat as normal\", but suggested using the European election to send a message to the implicated parties. Tebbit said that there were a series of smaller parties people could vote for in addition to UKIP, including the Green Party, but he urged against voting for the British National Party.\nIn February 2010, Tebbit apologised following an altercation with a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade in Bury St Edmunds. He is said to have been unaware it was Chinese New Year, stating he heard a \"dreadful noise\" outside his Suffolk home. Tebbit said: \"I put my hands on a Chinese drum to try and stop the noise. I got my knuckles rapped for my pains. I then got jostled by a dragon. I have never been jostled by a dragon before. I gave it a shove, then got on my way.\" Tebbit later said he had resolved the matter amicably with the parade's organiser.\nIn July 2013, Tebbit was one of the guests on an episode of Peter Hennessy's BBC Radio 4 programme \"Reflections\" in which he talked about his life and career. Earlier that year he paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher, saying he wished there were \"someone like her now\".\nIn 2016 Tebbit contributed an interview to the documentary film \"\".\nWork in the media.\nTebbit was a columnist for \"The Sun\", 1995\u20137; \"The Mail on Sunday\", 1997\u20132001; and \"The Daily Telegraph\" from 2010\u20132022. Tebbit also wrote for \"The Guardian\" and \"New Statesman\".\nTebbit co-presented the weekly discussion and interview programme \"Target\" on Sky News between 1989 and 1997 alongside the then-Labour MP Austin Mitchell\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64687", "revid": "50747074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64687", "title": "Combined arms", "text": "Approach to warfare\nCombined arms is an approach to warfare that seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects\u2014for example, using infantry and armour in an urban environment in which each supports the other.\nAccording to the strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \"supporting arms\" as follows:\nCombined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).\nThough the lower-echelon units of a combined arms team may be of similar types, a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher-echelon unit, whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an \"ad hoc\" solution to a battlefield problem. For example, an armoured division, the modern paragon of combined arms doctrine, consists of a mixture of mechanized infantry, tank, artillery, reconnaissance, anti-air support, drone support, close air support and helicopter units, all of which are co-ordinated and directed by a unified command structure.\nAlso, most modern military units can, if the situation requires it, call on yet more branches of the military, such as infantry requesting space warfare, Cyberwarfare or Electromagnetic warfare support; or the bombing or shelling by military aircraft or naval forces to augment their ground offensive or protect their land forces. The mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level at which homogeneity ordinarily prevails, such as by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nAncient warfare.\nCombined arms operations date back to antiquity, where armies would usually field a screen of skirmishers to protect their spearmen during the approach to contact. Especially in the case of the Greek hoplites, however, the focus of military thinking lay almost exclusively on the heavy infantry. In more elaborate situations armies of various nationalities fielded different combinations of light, medium, or heavy infantry, light or heavy cavalry, chariotry, camelry, elephantry, and artillery (mechanical weapons). Combined arms in this context was how to best use the cooperating units, variously armed with side-arms, spears, or missile weapons in order to coordinate an attack to disrupt and then destroy the enemy.\nPhilip II of Macedon greatly improved upon the limited combined arms tactics of the Greek city-states and combined the newly created Macedonian phalanx with heavy cavalry and other forces. The phalanx would hold the opposing line in place, until the heavy cavalry could smash and break the enemy line by achieving local superiority.\nThe early Republic Roman Legion was a combined arms force and consisted of five classes of troops. Lightly equipped velites acted as skirmishers armed with light javelins. The hastati and principes formed the main attacking strength of the legion with swords and pila, whilst the triarii formed the defensive backbone of the legion fighting as spearmen (initially as a denser Greek phalanx and later as a looser spear wall formation) with long spears and large shields. The fifth class of troops were the equites (the cavalry), which were used for scouting, pursuit and to guard the flanks.\nThe Legion then became notionally a unit of heavy infantrymen armed with just sword and pilum, and fielded with a small attached auxiliary skirmishers and missile troops, and incorporated a small cavalry unit. The legion was sometimes also incorporated into a higher-echelon combined arms unit \u2013 e.g., in one period it was customary for a general to command two legions plus two similarly sized units of auxiliaries, lighter units useful as screens or for combat in rough terrain. Later during the Roman Empire, auxiliary soldiers outnumbered the core legionary troops.\nThe army of the Han dynasty is also an example, fielding m\u00eal\u00e9e infantry (equipped with a variety of different weapons ranging from swords to pikes to halberd-like weapons), archers, crossbowmen, and cavalry (ranging from horse archers to heavy lancers). One recorded tactical formation during the Han dynasty included three ranks of halberds, swordsmen, and spearmen, supported by crossbows, and with cavalry on the flanks.\nCivilizations such as the Carthaginians and Sassanids also were known to have fielded a combination of infantry supported by powerful cavalry.\nPost-Classical warfare.\nAt the Battle of Hastings (1066) English infantry fighting from behind a shield wall were defeated by a Norman army consisting of archers, foot soldiers (infantry), and mounted knights (cavalry). One of the tactics used by the Normans was to tempt the English to leave the shield wall to attack retreating Norman infantry only to destroy them in the open with cavalry. Likewise Scottish sheltrons \u2013 which had been developed to counter the charges by English heavy cavalry, and had been used successfully against English cavalry at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297) \u2013 were destroyed at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) by English archers acting in concert with mounted knights. Both Hastings and Falkirk showed how combined arms could be used to defeat enemies relying on only one arm.\nThe English victories of Cr\u00e9cy, Poitiers and Agincourt were examples of a simple form of combined arms, with a combination of dismounted knights forming a foundation for formations of English longbowmen. The lightly protected longbowmen could down their French opponents at a distance, whilst the armoured men-at-arms could deal with any Frenchmen who made it to the English lines. This is the crux of combined arms: to allow a combination of forces to achieve what would be impossible for its constituent elements to do alone.\nDuring the Middle Ages military forces used combined arms as a method of winning battles and furthering a war leader or king's long-term goals. Some historians claim that during the Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat \"as a general military engagement\". In the pursuit of a leader's goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops.\nEach type of military formation \u2013 infantry, archers, cavalry, or peasants \u2013 has certain advantages that the other does not have. Infantry allows a force to hold ground and in the event of overwhelming enemy forces withdraw into terrain that mounted troops cannot maneuver as easily, thus negating the advantage of the horse. Archers provide standoff with their bows or crossbows. Cavalry can maneuver faster and provide fast attack before the enemy has had time to prepare defenses. Peasants are more numerous and cheaper on the royal coffers. Over the long term the army can cross-train and learn the skills of the specialties to increase combat effectiveness. This is known as a combat multiplier today. The combination of the different skills help provide a commander the flexibility to minimize risk when it comes to engagements. The overall objective of any military force is to fight and win, while also preserving the largest number of combatants to carry on the larger strategic aims of the king. This can be seen in some of the engagements during the Middle Ages.\nEarly Modern warfare.\n15th to 17th centuries.\nGenerally the savanna cavalries of West Africa used a combined arms approach, seldom operating without supporting infantry.\nThe French army of the Valois kings, composed of heavily armoured \"gendarmes\" (professional versions of the medieval knight), Swiss and Landsknecht mercenary pikemen, and heavy cannons took form during the transition from the medieval way of war to the early modern period.\nThe late 15th century saw the development of combined pike and shot formations in Europe, starting with the \"colunelas\" of the Spanish general Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, evolving into the \"tercios\" of Habsburg Spain and the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Emperor during the 16th century.\nIn Japan, at the battle of Nagashino (\u9577\u7be0\u306e\u6226\u3044) in 1575, forces of the Oda clan successfully employed combined arms against the Takeda clan, which heavily relied on cavalry. The Oda army erected palisades to protect their ashigaru musketeers that shot down the Takeda cavalry while their samurai cut down any enemies who managed to approach melee range.\nThe 17th century saw increasing use of combined arms at lower (regimental) level. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was the proponent of the idea. For fire support he attached teams of \"commanded musketeers\" to cavalry units and fielded light 3-pounder guns to provide infantry units with organic artillery.\nModern warfare.\nIn the eighteenth century, the concept of the legion was revived. Legions now consisted of musketeers, light infantry, dragoons and artillery in a brigade sized force. These legions often combined professional military personnel with militia. Perhaps the most notable example is the use of light cavalry, light infantry and light horse artillery in advance detachments by France's La Grande Arm\u00e9e during the Napoleonic Wars.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nAfter 25\u00a0years of near continuous warfare, the armies that met at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 were organized in a similar manner \u2013 into corps which contained infantry, cavalry and artillery (see Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign), and used similar combined arms tactics. Within each corps were divisions of infantry or cavalry made up of brigades and an artillery unit. An army would usually also have reserves of all three arms under the direct command of the army commander which could be sent in support of any corps or division of a corps to increase any arm which the army general considered necessary. The great French cavalry charge commanded by Marshal Ney during the battle failed to break Wellington's squares of infantry and Ney's failure to supplement his cavalry with sufficient horse artillery to break the squares open is usually given as a major contributing factor in the failure. It is an example of why generals needed to use combined arms to overcome the tactics used by enemy officers to frustrate an attack by a single arm of an army.\nIn contrast the 27th\u00a0(Inniskilling) suffered 478\u00a0casualties from an initial strength of 750\u00a0because of their exposure to attack by French combined arms. They were located near the centre of Wellington's line, but unlike most of the rest of Wellington's infantry were in a declivity on the exposed side of the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment. Exposed as they were, they were forced to stand in square for most of the day for fear of cavalry attack and so made an easy dense target for Napoleon's massed artillery.\n20th-century developments.\nFirst World War.\nThe development of modern combined arms tactics began in the First World War. Early in the Western Front, fighting descended into stagnant trench warfare. Generals on both sides applied conventional military thinking to the new weapons and situations that they faced. In these early stages, tactics typically consisted of heavy artillery barrages followed by massed frontal assaults against well entrenched enemies. These tactics were largely unsuccessful and resulted in large loss of life.\nAs the war progressed new combined arms tactics were developed, often described then as the \"all arms battle\". These included direct close artillery fire support for attacking soldiers (the creeping barrage), air support and mutual support of tanks and infantry. One of the first instances of combined arms was the Battle of Cambrai, in which the British used tanks, artillery, infantry, small arms and air power to break through enemy lines. Previously such a battle would have lasted months with many hundreds of thousands of casualties. Co-ordination and planning were the key elements, and the use of combined arms tactics in the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918 allowed the Allied forces to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy trenches, forcing the surrender of the Central Powers.\nSecond World War.\nIn World War II combined arms was a fundamental part of some operational doctrines like Heinz Guderian's Blitzkrieg, or the Soviet deep battle doctrine, which was based on combining tanks, mobile units (mechanised infantry or cavalry) and infantry, while supported by artillery.\nCold War years.\nIn 1963 the United States Marine Corps formalized the concept of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force, which combined Marine aviation and Marine ground units for expeditionary missions.\nThe Vietnam War had a profound influence on the development of the US Army's combined arms doctrine. Due to the very difficult terrain that prevented access to the enemy-held areas of operation, troops were often deployed by air assault. For this reason, US troops in Vietnam saw six times more combat than in preceding wars, due to less time spent on logistic delays. The result: an infantry unit increased in effectiveness by a factor of four for its size, when supported with helicopter-delivered ammunition, food and fuel. In time the US Army in Vietnam also learned to combine helicopter operations and airmobile infantry with the armoured and artillery units operating from fire support bases as well as the US brown-water navy and USAF close air support units supporting them.\nAirLand Battle was the overall conceptual framework that formed the basis of the US Army's European warfighting doctrine from 1982 into the late 1990s. AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding those front line enemy forces.\nIn the 1991 Gulf War, General Schwarzkopf used a mix of strikes by fixed-wing aircraft including carpet bombing and precision bombing in combination with large numbers of strikes by attack helicopters. During the ground assault phase, tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The front line moved forward at upwards of 40\u201350\u00a0km/h at the upper limit of the Army's tracked vehicles.\nPost Cold War.\nIn 2000, the US Army began developing a new set of doctrines intended to use information superiority to wage warfare. Six pieces of equipment were crucial for this: Boeing E-3 Sentry for Airborne early warning and control, Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (for Airborne ground surveillance), GPS, VHF SINCGARS (for ground and airborne communications), and ruggedized computers. The mix is supplemented by satellite photos and passive reception of enemy radio emissions, forward observers with digital target designation, specialized scouting aircraft, anti-artillery radars and gun-laying software for artillery.\nBased on this doctrine, many US ground vehicles moved across the landscape alone. If they encountered an enemy troop or vehicle concentration, they would assume a defensive posture, lay down as much covering fire as they could, designate the targets for requested air and artillery assets. Within a few minutes, on station aircraft would direct their missions to cover the ground vehicle. Within a half-hour heavy attack forces would concentrate to relieve the isolated vehicle. In an hour and a half the relieved vehicle would be resupplied.\n21st-century developments.\nIn 2020, the Israel Defense Forces established the Multidimensional Unit, a dedicated combined arms battalion to test the viability of full integration of infantry, armor, and aircraft into a single battalion command structure. The unit fields Merkava Mk.4 main battle tanks, F-16D multirole fighters, Heron and Hermes 450 drones, and AH-64 Apache helicopters.\nDuring the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian units demonstrated the essentialness of 21st century combined arms against a numerically superior adversary; and demonstrated how Russian tanks, no matter how numerous, could be highly vulnerable when deployed without sufficient infantry cover, air defense, and electronic warfare support.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Forster", "text": "English novelist and writer (1879\u20131970)\nEdward Morgan Forster (1 January 1879 \u2013 7 June 1970) was an English author. He is best known for his novels, particularly \"A Room with a View\" (1908), \"Howards End\" (1910) and \"A Passage to India\" (1924). He also wrote numerous short stories, essays, speeches and broadcasts, as well as biographies and pageant plays. His short story \"The Machine Stops\" (1909) is often viewed as the beginning of technological dystopian fiction. He also co-authored the libretto to Benjamin Britten's opera \"Billy Budd\" (1951). Many of his novels examine class differences and hypocrisy. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work.\nConsidered one of the most successful of the Edwardian era English novelists, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 22 separate years. He declined a knighthood in 1949, though he received the Order of Merit upon his 90th birthday. Forster was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1953, and in 1961 he was one of the first five authors named as a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature.\nAfter attending Tonbridge School, Forster studied history and classics at King's College, Cambridge, where he met fellow future writers such as Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. He then travelled throughout Europe before publishing his first novel, \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\", in 1905. The last of his novels to be published, \"Maurice\", is a tale of homosexual love in early 20th-century England. While completed in 1914, the novel was not published until 1971, the year after his death. \nMany of his novels were posthumously adapted for cinema, including Merchant Ivory Productions of \"A Room with a View\" (1985), \"Maurice\" (1987) and \"Howards End\" (1992), critically acclaimed period dramas which featured lavish sets and esteemed British actors, including Helena Bonham Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis, Hugh Grant, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Director David Lean filmed another well-received adaptation, \"A Passage to India\", in 1984.\nEarly life.\nForster, born at 6 Melcombe Place, Dorset Square, London NW1, which no longer stands, was the only child of the Anglo-Irish Alice Clara \"Lily\" (n\u00e9e Whichelo) and a Welsh architect, Edward Morgan Llewellyn Forster. He was registered as Henry Morgan Forster, but accidentally baptised Edward Morgan Forster. His father died of tuberculosis on 30 October 1880, before Forster's second birthday. His father's sisters helped his mother to raise him. The tension between his father's straight-laced, religious family and his doting mother influenced the themes of his work. \nIn 1883, he and his mother moved to Rooks Nest, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where they lived until 1893. This was to serve as a model for the house Howards End in his novel of that name. It is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England for historic interest and literary associations. Forster had fond memories of his childhood at Rooks Nest. He continued to visit the house into the later 1940s, and he retained the furniture all his life.\nAmong Forster's ancestors were members of the Clapham Sect, a social reform group in the Church of England. Forster inherited \u00a38,000 () in trust from his paternal great-aunt Marianne Thornton (daughter of the abolitionist Henry Thornton), who died on 5 November 1887. This was enough to live on and enabled him to become a writer. He attended as a day boy Tonbridge School in Kent, where the school theatre has been named in his honour, although he is known to have been unhappy there.\nAt King's College, Cambridge in 1897\u20131901, he became a member of the Christian Scientist Church known as the Apostles (formally the Cambridge \"Conversazione\" Society). They met in secret to discuss their work on philosophical and moral questions. Many of its members went on to constitute what came to be known as the Bloomsbury Group, of which Forster was a member in the 1910s and 1920s. There is a famous recreation of Forster's Cambridge at the beginning of \"The Longest Journey\". The Schlegel sisters of \"Howards End\" are based to some degree on Vanessa and Virginia Stephen. Forster graduated with a BA with second-class honours in classics and history.\nIn 1903, Forster travelled in Greece and Italy out of interest in their classical heritage. He then sought a post in Germany, to learn the language, and spent several months in the summer of 1905 in Nassenheide, Pomerania (now the Polish village of Rz\u0119dziny), as a tutor to the children of the writer Elizabeth von Arnim. He wrote a short memoir of this experience, which was one of the happiest times in his life.\nCareer.\nIn 1914, he visited Egypt, Germany and India with the classicist Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, by which time he had written all but one of his novels. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, Forster served as a Chief Searcher (for missing servicemen) for the British Red Cross in Alexandria, Egypt.\nForster spent a second spell in India in the early 1920s as private secretary to Tukojirao III, Maharajah of Dewas. \"The Hill of Devi\" is his non-fictional account of this period. Upon his return to England, Forster wrote \"A Passage to India\". All six of his novels were completed in Weybridge, Surrey.\nForster was awarded a Benson Medal in 1937. In the 1930s and 1940s, Forster became a notable broadcaster on BBC Radio, and while George Orwell was the BBC India Section talks producer from 1941 to 1943, he commissioned from Forster a weekly book review. Forster was President of the National Council for Civil Liberties, as well as Cambridge Humanists from 1959 to his death. Forster became publicly associated with the British Humanist Association. In addition to his broadcasting, he advocated individual liberty and penal reform and opposed censorship by writing articles, sitting on committees and signing letters. He testified as a witness for the defence in the 1960 obscenity trial over the sexually explicit content in D.H. Lawrence's previously unpublished \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\".\nForster was elected an honorary fellow of King's College in January 1946, and lived for the most part in the college, doing relatively little. In April 1947 he arrived in America for a three-month nationwide tour of public readings and sightseeing, returning to the East Coast in June. He declined a knighthood in 1949 and was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1953. At age 82, he wrote his last short story, \"Little Imber\", a science fiction tale. According to his friend Richard Marquand, Forster was critical of American foreign policy in his latter years, which was one reason he refused offers to adapt his novels for the screen, as Forster felt such productions would involve American financing.\nAt 85 he went on a pilgrimage to the Wiltshire countryside that had inspired his favourite among his own novels, \"The Longest Journey\", escorted by William Golding. In 1961, he was one of the first five authors named as a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature. In 1969, he was made a member of the Order of Merit on his 90th birthday.\nWork.\nNovels.\nForster had five novels published in his lifetime. Although \"Maurice\" was published shortly after his death, it had been written nearly sixty years earlier. His first novel, \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" (1905), tells of Lilia, a young English widow who falls in love with an Italian, and of the efforts of her bourgeois relatives to get her back from Monteriano (based on San Gimignano). Philip Herriton's mission to retrieve her from Italy has features in common with that of Lambert Strether in Henry James's \"The Ambassadors.\" Forster discussed James' novel ironically and somewhat disapprovingly in his book \"Aspects of the Novel\" (1927). \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" was adapted as a 1991 film directed by Charles Sturridge, starring Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Graves, Judy Davis and Helen Mirren.\nNext, Forster published \"The Longest Journey\" (1907), an inverted \"Bildungsroman\" following the lame Rickie Elliott from Cambridge to a career as a struggling writer and then a post as a schoolmaster, married to an unappealing Agnes Pembroke. In a series of scenes on the Wiltshire hills, which introduce Rickie's wild half-brother Stephen Wonham, Forster attempts a kind of sublime related to those of Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence.\nForster's third novel, \"A Room with a View\" (1908), is his lightest and most optimistic. It was started in 1901, before any of his others, initially under the title \"Lucy\". It explores young Lucy Honeychurch's trip to Italy with a cousin and the choice she must make between the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. George's father Mr Emerson quotes thinkers who influenced Forster, including Samuel Butler. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1985 by the Merchant Ivory team, starring Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Julian Sands, Denholm Elliott and Daniel Day-Lewis, and as a televised adaptation of the same name in 2007 by Andrew Davies.\n\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" and \"A Room with a View\" can be seen as Forster's Italian novels. Both include references to the famous Baedeker guidebooks and concern narrow-minded middle-class English tourists abroad. The books share themes with his short stories collected in \"The Celestial Omnibus\" and \"The Eternal Moment\".\n\"Howards End\" (1910) is an ambitious \"condition-of-England\" novel about various groups among the Edwardian middle classes, represented by the Schlegels (bohemian intellectuals), the Wilcoxes (thoughtless plutocrats) and the Basts (struggling lower-middle-class aspirants). \"Howards End\" was adapted as a film in 1992 by the Merchant-Ivory team, starring Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter. Thompson won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Margaret Schlegel. It was also adapted as a miniseries in 2017. An opera libretto \"Howards End, America\" was created in 2016 by Claudia Stevens.\nForster's greatest success, \"A Passage to India\" (1924) takes as its subject the relations between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. Forster connects personal relations with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the Marabar Caves. Forster makes special mention of the author Ahmed Ali and his \"Twilight in Delhi\" in a preface to its Everyman's Library Edition. The novel was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. \"A Passage to India\" was adapted as a play in 1960, directed by Frank Hauser, and as a film in 1984, directed by David Lean, starring Alec Guinness, Judy Davis and Peggy Ashcroft, with the latter winning the 1985 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. \n\"Maurice\" (1971), published posthumously, is a homosexual love story that also returns to matters familiar from Forster's first three novels, such as the suburbs of London in the English home counties, the experience of attending Cambridge, and the wild landscape of Wiltshire. The novel was controversial, given that Forster's homosexuality had not been publicly known or widely acknowledged. Today's critics continue to debate over the extent to which Forster's sexuality and personal activities influenced his writing. \"Maurice\" was adapted as a film in 1987 by the Merchant Ivory team. It starred James Wilby and Hugh Grant who played lovers (for which both gained acclaim) and Rupert Graves, with Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow and Ben Kingsley in the supporting cast.\nEarly in his career, Forster attempted a historical novel about the Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho and the Italian condottiero Sigismondo de Malatesta, but was dissatisfied with the result and never published it, though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.\nCritical reception.\nForster's first novel, \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\", was described by reviewers as \"astonishing\" and \"brilliantly original\". \"The Manchester Guardian\" (forerunner of \"The Guardian\") noted \"a persistent vein of cynicism which is apt to repel,\" though \"the cynicism is not deep-seated.\" The novel is labelled \"a sordid comedy culminating, unexpectedly and with a real dramatic force, in a grotesque tragedy.\" Lionel Trilling remarked on this first novel as \"a whole and mature work dominated by a fresh and commanding intelligence\".\nSubsequent books were similarly received on publication. \"The Manchester Guardian\" commented on \"Howards End\", describing it as \"a novel of high quality written with what appears to be a feminine brilliance of perception... witty and penetrating.\" An essay by David Cecil in \"Poets and Storytellers\" (1949) describes Forster as \"pulsing with intelligence and sensibility\", but primarily concerned with an original moral vision: \"He tells a story as well as anyone who ever lived\".\nThe beginning of technological dystopian fiction is traced to Forster's \"The Machine Stops\", a 1909 short story where most people live underground in isolation. M. Keith Booker states that \"The Machine Stops,\" \"We\" and \"Brave New World\" are \"the great defining texts of the genre of dystopian fiction, both in [the] vividness of their engagement with real-world social and political issues and in the scope of their critique of the societies on which they focus.\" Will Gompertz for the BBC writes, \"The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020.\"\nAmerican interest in Forster was spurred by Lionel Trilling's \"E. M. Forster: A Study\", which called him \"the only living novelist who can be read again and again and who, after each reading, gives me what few writers can give us after our first days of novel-reading, the sensation of having learned something.\" \nCriticism of his works has included comments on unlikely pairings of characters who marry or get engaged and the lack of realistic depiction of sexual attraction.\nKey themes.\nForster was President of the Cambridge Humanists from 1959 until his death and a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association from 1963 until his death. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections despite the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the 1938 essay \"What I Believe\" (reprinted with two other humanist essays \u2013 and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter). When Forster's cousin Philip Whichelo donated a portrait of Forster to the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GLHA), Jim Herrick, the founder, quoted Forster's words: \"The humanist has four leading characteristics \u2013 curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.\"\nTwo of Forster's best-known works, \"A Passage to India\" and \"Howards End\", explore the irreconcilability of class differences. \"A Room with a View\" also shows how questions of propriety and class can make human connection difficult. \"A Room with a View\" is his most widely read and accessible work, remaining popular long after its original publication. His posthumous novel \"Maurice\" explores the possibility of class reconciliation as one facet of a homosexual relationship.\nSexuality is another key theme in Forster's works. Some critics have argued that a general shift from heterosexual to homosexual love can be observed throughout the course of his writing career. The foreword to \"Maurice\" describes his struggle with his homosexuality, while he explored similar issues in several volumes of short stories. Forster's explicitly homosexual writings, the novel \"Maurice\" and the short story collection \"The Life to Come,\" were published shortly after his death. Beyond his literary explorations of sexuality, Forster also expressed his views publicly; in 1953, Forster openly advocated in \"The New Statesman and Nation\" for a change in the law in regard to homosexuality (which would be legalised in England and Wales in 1967, three years prior to his death), arguing that homosexuality between adults should be treated without bias and on the same grounds as heterosexuality.\nForster is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised (as by his friend Roger Fry) for his attachment to mysticism. One example of his symbolism is the wych elm tree in \"Howards End.\" The characters of Mrs Wilcox in that novel and Mrs Moore in \"A Passage to India\" have a mystical link with the past, and a striking ability to connect with people from beyond their own circles. Forster, Henry James, and W. Somerset Maugham were the earliest writers in English to portray characters from diverse countries \u2013 France, Germany, Italy and India. Their work explores cultural conflict, but arguably the motifs of humanism and cosmopolitanism are dominant. In a way, this is anticipation of the concept of human beings shedding national identities and becoming more and more liberal and tolerant.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nFrom 1925 until his mother's death at age 90 in March 1945, Forster lived with her at the house of West Hackhurst in the village of Abinger Hammer, Surrey; he continued to live there until September 1946. His London base was 26 Brunswick Square from 1930 to 1939, after which he rented 9 Arlington Park Mansions in Chiswick until at least 1961. \nFriendships.\nThough conscious of his repressed desires, it was while stationed in Egypt, that Forster became friendly with the Greek poet C.P. Cavafy, described in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" article on Forster as \"an active homosexual\". \nHe was a close friend of the socialist poet and philosopher Edward Carpenter. A visit to Carpenter and his younger lover George Merrill in 1913 inspired Forster's novel \"Maurice\", which is partly based on them. During his time in Egypt he also wrote regularly to Carpenter, whom he told about openly gay life in Alexandria.\nHe is considered part of the Bloomsbury Group. Forster also edited the letters of Eliza Fay (1756\u20131816) from India, in an edition first published in 1925. In 2012, Tim Leggatt, who had known Forster for his last 15 years, wrote a memoir based on unpublished correspondence with him over those years. He was friends with fellow gay novelist Christopher Isherwood, whom William Plomer introduced to him in 1932 and to whom he showed an early draft of \"Maurice\" decades before its posthumous publication. Writers with whom he associated included the poet Siegfried Sassoon and the Belfast-based novelist Forrest Reid.\nRelationships.\nWhile not out publicly during his own lifetime, Forster was homosexual, about which he was open with his close friends but not the public. He never married and had a number of male lovers during his adult life. In 1906 Forster fell in love with Syed Ross Masood, a 17-year-old Indian future Oxford student he tutored in Latin. Masood had a more romantic, poetic view of friendship, confusing Forster with avowals of love. \nWhilst in Egypt Forster \"lost his R [respectability]\" to a wounded soldier in 1917 and had a short-lived but emotionally powerful affair with an Egyptian tram conductor, Mohammad el Adl. The pair met in 1917 and quickly developed an interest in each other. Their relationship began to end in 1918, as el Adl prepared to marry. El Adl and his wife had a son, who they named Morgan. After returning to England in 1919, Forster visited el Adl in 1922 and found him deathly ill with tuberculosis. After el Adl's death, his widow sent his wedding ring to Forster. Forster kept el Adl's letters for the rest of his life.\nIn 1960, Forster began a relationship with the Bulgarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Mattei Radev, a picture framer and art collector who moved in Bloomsbury group circles. He was Forster's junior by 46 years. They met at Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset, a country retreat shared by Edward Sackville-West and the gallery owner and artist Eardley Knollys.\nBob Buckingham.\nIn 1930, Forster began his 40 year relationship with Bob Buckingham (1904\u20131975), a married policeman. Forster was both the witness to Buckingham's marriage to May Hockey in 1932 and the godfather of their son, Robert Morgan, the following year. While living at King's College, he spent weekends with the family and included both husband and wife in his circle, which included J. R. Ackerley, a writer and literary editor of \"The Listener,\" the psychologist W. J. H. Sprott, and for a time, the composer Benjamin Britten. \nIn the early years, Forster was jealous of May, but over time they too grew close. After a fall in April 1961, he spent his final years in Cambridge at King's College, but in his final years, having suffered a series of strokes, May insisted that he move into the family home where she could look after him. Forster died of a stroke on 7 June 1970 at the age of 91, at the Buckinghams' home in Coventry, Warwickshire. His ashes, mingled with those of Buckingham, were later scattered in the rose garden of Coventry's crematorium, near Warwick University.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA wide variety of other journals, plays, and draft fiction are archived at King's College.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64689", "revid": "26604133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64689", "title": "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec", "text": "French painter and illustrator (1864\u20131901)\n\"Comte\" Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa (24 November 1864\u00a0\u2013 9 September 1901), known as Toulouse-Lautrec (), was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist, and illustrator. His immersion in the colourful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce popular works of art from decadent affairs.\nBorn into the aristocracy, Toulouse-Lautrec broke both his legs during adolescence, leaving him with a stunted appearance. In later life, he developed an affinity for brothels and prostitutes that directed the subject matter for many of his works, which record details of the late-19th-century bohemian lifestyle in Paris. He is among the painters described as Post-Impressionists, with Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Georges Seurat also commonly considered as belonging in this loose group.\nIn a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house, \"La Blanchisseuse\", Toulouse-Lautrec's early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4\u00a0million, setting a new record for the artist for a price at auction.\nEarly life.\nHenri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa was born at Demoiselles d'Imbert du Bosc (his great-aunts) home at rue de l'\u00c9cole Mage (presently 14, rue Henri de Toulouse Lautrec), Albi, in the south of France, the firstborn child of Count Alphonse de Toulouse-Lautrec Montfa (1838\u20131913) and Ad\u00e8le Zo\u00eb Tapi\u00e9 de Celeyran (1841\u20131930). He was a member of an aristocratic family (descended from both the Counts of Toulouse and Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, as well as the Viscounts of Montfa). His younger brother was born in 1867 but died the following year. Both sons enjoyed the \"titres de courtoisie\" of \"Comte\". If Toulouse-Lautrec had outlived his father, he would have inherited the family title of \"Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec\".\nAfter the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec's parents separated, and a nanny cared for him. At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec lived with his mother in Paris, where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. A friend of his father, Ren\u00e9 Princeteau, sometimes visited to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse-Lautrec's early paintings are of horses, a speciality of Princeteau's and a subject Toulouse-Lautrec later revisited in his \"Circus Paintings\".\nIn 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at Am\u00e9lie-les-Bains, and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son's growth and development.\nDisability and health problems.\nToulouse-Lautrec's parents were first cousins (their mothers were sisters), and his congenital health conditions have often been attributed to a family history of inbreeding.\nAt the age of 13, Toulouse-Lautrec fractured his right femur, and at age 14, he fractured his left femur. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder along the lines of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Toulouse-Lautrec's legs ceased to grow when he reached . He developed an adult torso while retaining his child-sized legs.\nParis.\nDuring a stay in Nice, France, his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec's parents to allow him to return to Paris and study under the portrait painter L\u00e9on Bonnat. He returned to Paris in 1882. Toulouse-Lautrec's mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family's influence to gain him entry to Bonnat's studio. He was drawn to Montmartre, the area of Paris known for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years.\nAfter Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of Fernand Cormon in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time, he met \u00c9mile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat's, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumoured to be Marie-Charlet.\nEarly career.\nIn 1885, Toulouse-Lautrec began to exhibit his work at the cabaret of Aristide Bruant's \"Mirliton\".\nWith his studies finished, Toulouse-Lautrec participated in an exposition in 1887 in Toulouse using the pseudonym \"Tr\u00e9clau\", the verlan of the family name \"Lautrec\". He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and Louis Anquetin.\nIn 1885, Toulouse-Lautrec met Suzanne Valadon. He made several portraits of her and supported her ambition as an artist. It is believed that they were lovers and that she wanted to marry him. Their relationship ended, and Valadon attempted suicide in 1888.\nRise to recognition.\nIn 1888, the Belgian critic Octave Maus invited Lautrec to present eleven pieces at the \"Vingt\" (the 'Twenties') exhibition in Brussels in February. Theo van Gogh, the brother of Vincent van Gogh, bought \"Poudre de Riz\" (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the Goupil &amp; Cie gallery.\nFrom 1889 to 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants regularly. He made several landscapes of Montmartre. Tucked deep into Montmartre in Monsieur Pere Foret's garden, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant en plein air paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in \"The Laundress\" (1888).\nIn 1890, during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, he challenged to a duel the artist Henry de Groux, who criticised van Gogh's works. Paul Signac also declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec was killed. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group, and the duel never took place.\nToulouse-Lautrec contributed several illustrations to the magazine \"Le Rire\" during the mid-1890s.\nInteractions with women.\nIn addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also visited prostitutes. He was fascinated by their lifestyle as well as that of the \"urban underclass\", and he incorporated those characters into his paintings. Fellow painter \u00c9douard Vuillard later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, \"the real reasons for his behaviour were moral ones\u00a0... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his condition and the moral penury of the prostitute.\"\nThe prostitutes inspired Toulouse-Lautrec. He would frequently visit a brothel located in Rue d'Amboise, where he had a favourite called Mireille. He created about a hundred drawings and fifty paintings inspired by the life of these women. In 1892 and 1893, he created a series of two women in bed together called \"Le Lit\", and in 1894 he painted \"Sal\u00f3n de la Rue des Moulins\u200a\" from memory in his studio.\nToulouse-Lautrec declared, \"A model is always a stuffed doll, but these women are alive. I wouldn't venture to pay them the hundred sous to sit for me, and God knows whether they would be worth it. They stretch out on the sofas like animals, make no demand and they are not in the least bit conceited.\" He was well appreciated by the women, saying, \"I have found girls of my own size! Nowhere else do I feel so much at home.\"\nThe Moulin Rouge.\nWhen the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened in 1889, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as La Goulue (The Glutton), who created the French can-can; and the much subtler dancer Jane Avril.\nOther caf\u00e9-concerts also commissioned posters from Toulouse-Lautrec, such as the Caf\u00e9 des Ambassadeurs, for which he made the now iconic poster of his friend Aristide Bruant, when he moved there in 1892.\nLondon.\nToulouse-Lautrec's family were Anglophiles, and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough. He travelled to London, where he was commissioned by the J. &amp; E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their paper confetti (plaster confetti was banned after the 1892 Mardi Gras) and the bicycle advert \"La Cha\u00eene Simpson\".\nWhile in London, Toulouse-Lautrec met and befriended Oscar Wilde. When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him, and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde's trial.\nAlcoholism.\nToulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which some biographers theorize may have contributed to his alcoholism\nInitially, Toulouse-Lautrec only drank beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into spirits, namely absinthe. The \"Earthquake Cocktail\" (\"Tremblement de Terre\") is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half cognac in a wine goblet. Because of his underdeveloped legs, he walked with the aid of a cane, which he hollowed out and kept filled with liquor.\nCooking skills.\nLike Claude Monet, Lautrec was known for his cooking. Culinary historian Alexandra Leaf highlights Monet and Lautrec as the two \"most serious gourmets\" among their peers. Lautrec's love for cooking stemmed from his family upbringing and early childhood, where he first learned culinary values. Before he became widely known as a painter, he was called \"Henri the cook\" by his cousins.\nLautrec's penchant for art and cooking eventually led him to combine the visual and culinary arts, usually as a formal celebration of the release of new artworks, resulting in noteworthy parties for which he designed the menu (which were often artworks in themselves), bought and prepared the food, and created new cocktails. Lautrec's most famous party, held at the Natansons' Paris house in February 1895, is often regarded as one of the most notorious parties in art history. 300 guests were invited, with a claimed 2,000 cocktails served, all accompanied by side dishes of gourmet food, with Lautrec working diligently as the sole chef and bartender, dressed in a white linen jacket, complete with a freshly shaved bald head and no beard. Ironically, by the end of the night, Lautrec appeared to be the only one still awake and sober.\nLautrec was part of a group of gourmands, initially formed by Gustave Geffroy (1855\u20131926), the historian of the Impressionists, and Claude Monet, who met up every Friday night for dinner at \"Drouant\", a restaurant in the Palais Garnier neighborhood. After Lautrec's death, his close friend Maurice Joyant published Lautrec's collection of recipes\u00a0\u2013 some original, some adapted\u00a0\u2013 in the book \"La Cuisine de Monsieur Momo, C\u00e9libataire\" (1930), along with a color book frontispiece of \"Toulouse Lautrec Cooking\" by Vuillard. It was revised in 1966 as \"L'art de la cuisine\". The cookbook features 150 recipes, many of which were Lautrec's signature dishes, such as \"Catalan salad\". Art historian Charles Stuckey describes it as the first cookbook ever published by an artist, albeit posthumously. An English translation, entitled \"The Art of Cuisine\" was published in 1966.\nDeath.\nBy February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec's alcoholism began to take its toll, and he collapsed from exhaustion. His family had him committed to Folie Saint-James, a sanatorium in Neuilly-sur-Seine for three months. While committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio and travelled throughout France. Both his physical and mental health began to decline due to alcoholism and syphilis.\nIn March 1901, a stroke left Lautrec paralyzed from the legs down and confined him to a wheelchair. On August 15, 1901, while in Taussat, he suffered a stroke which left him hemiplegic. On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, Toulouse-Lautrec died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, Ch\u00e2teau Malrom\u00e9, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimeti\u00e8re de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometres from the estate. Toulouse-Lautrec's last words reportedly were \"Le vieux con!\" (\"The old fool!\"), his goodbye to his father, who was killing a fly over his son's deathbed.\nAfter Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, \"Comtesse\" Ad\u00e8le de Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in Albi, his birthplace, to show his works. The Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec owns the most extensive collection of his works.\nArt.\nIn a career of less than 20 years, Toulouse-Lautrec created:\nToulouse-Lautrec's debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, that within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at \"A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re\" by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. Toulouse-Lautrec's style was also influenced by the Ukiyo-e genre of Japanese woodblock prints, which became popular in the Parisian art world.\nToulouse-Lautrec excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the colour and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualised. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette \"alone\", and the names of many of these characters have been recorded. His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately \"sympathetic\" and \"dispassionate\".\nToulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his highly linear approach emphasising contours. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes leaving much of the board visible. Many of his works may be best described as \"drawings in coloured paint.\"\nOn 20 August 2018, Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television programme \"Fake or Fortune?\". Researchers attempted to discover whether he had created two newly discovered sketchbooks.\n\"See also .\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64692", "revid": "48683141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64692", "title": "Bombing of Dresden", "text": "Aerial bombing attacks in 1945\nThe bombing of Dresden was a joint British and American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, during World War II. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 772 heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed more than of the city centre. Up to 25,000 people were killed. Three more USAAF air raids followed, two occurring on 2 March aimed at the city's railway marshalling yard and one smaller raid on 17 April aimed at industrial areas.\nPostwar discussions about whether the attacks were justified made the event a moral \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" of the war. Nazi Germany's desperate struggle to maintain resistance in the closing months of the war is widely understood today, but Allied intelligence assessments at the time painted a different picture. There was uncertainty over whether the Soviets could sustain their advance on Germany, and rumours of the establishment of a Nazi redoubt in Southern Germany were taken too seriously.\nThe Allies saw the Dresden operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target, which United States Air Force reports, declassified decades later, noted as a major rail transport and communication centre, housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort. Several researchers later asserted that not all communications infrastructure was targeted, and neither were the extensive industrial areas located outside the city centre. Critics of the bombing argue that Dresden was a cultural landmark with little strategic significance, and that the attacks were indiscriminate area bombing and were not proportionate to military gains. Some claim that the raid was a war crime. Nazi propaganda exaggerated the death toll of the bombing, and the German far-right has referred to it as \"Dresden's Holocaust of bombs\".\nIn the many decades since the war large variations in the claimed death toll have led to controversy, though the numbers themselves are no longer a major point of contention among historians. City authorities at the time estimated that there were as many as 25,000 victims, a figure that subsequent investigations supported, including a 2010 study commissioned by the city council. In March 1945, the German government ordered its press to publish a falsified casualty figure of 200,000, and death tolls as high as 500,000 have been claimed. These inflated figures were disseminated in the West for decades, notably by David Irving, a Holocaust denier, who in 1966 announced that the documentation he had worked from had been forged and that the real figures supported the 25,000 number.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nEarly in 1945, the German offensive known as the Battle of the Bulge had been exhausted, as was the Luftwaffe's failed New Year's Day attack. The Red Army had launched its Silesian Offensives into pre-war German territory. The German army was retreating on all fronts, but still resisting. On 8 February 1945, the Red Army crossed the Oder River, with positions just from Berlin. A special British Joint Intelligence Subcommittee report, \"German Strategy and Capacity to Resist\", prepared for Winston Churchill's eyes only, predicted that Germany might collapse as early as mid-April if the Soviets overran its eastern defences. Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans might hold out until November if they could prevent the Soviets from taking Silesia. Despite the post-war assessment, there were serious doubts in Allied intelligence as to how well the war was going for them, with fears of a \"Nazi redoubt\" being established, or of the Russian advance faltering. Hence, any assistance to the Soviets on the Eastern Front could shorten the war.\nA large scale aerial attack on Berlin and other eastern cities was examined under the code name Operation Thunderclap in mid-1944, but was shelved on 16 August. This was later reexamined, and the decision made to pursue a more limited operation. The Soviet Army continued its push towards the Reich despite severe losses, which they sought to minimize in the final phase of the war. On 5 January 1945, two North American B-25 Mitchell bombers dropped 300,000 leaflets over Dresden with the \"Appeal of 50 German generals to the German army and people\".\nOn 22 January 1945, the RAF director of bomber operations, Air Commodore Sydney Bufton, sent Deputy Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Sir Norman Bottomley a minute suggesting that if Thunderclap was timed so that it appeared to be a coordinated air attack to aid the current Soviet offensive, then the effect of the bombing on German morale would be increased. On 25 January, the Joint Intelligence Committee supported the idea, as Ultra-based intelligence had indicated that dozens of German divisions deployed in the west were moving to reinforce the Eastern Front, and that interdiction of these troop movements should be a \"high priority\". Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, AOC-in-C Bomber Command, nicknamed \"Bomber Harris\", was known as an ardent supporter of area bombing; when asked for his view, he proposed a simultaneous attack on Chemnitz, Leipzig and Dresden. That evening Churchill asked the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, what plans had been drawn up to carry out these proposals. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff, answered: \"We should use available effort in one big attack on Berlin and attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz, or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East, but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West.\" He mentioned that aircraft diverted to such raids should not be taken away from the current primary tasks of destroying oil production facilities, jet aircraft factories, and submarine yards.\nChurchill was not satisfied with this answer and on 26 January pressed Sinclair for a plan of operations: \"I asked [last night] whether Berlin, and no doubt other large cities in east Germany, should not now be considered especially attractive targets ... Pray, report to me tomorrow what is going to be done\".\nIn response to Churchill's inquiry, Sinclair approached Bottomley, who asked Harris to undertake attacks on Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz as soon as moonlight and weather permitted, \"with the particular object of exploiting the confused conditions which are likely to exist in the above-mentioned cities during the successful Russian advance\". This allowed Sinclair to inform Churchill on 27 January of the Air Staff's agreement that, \"subject to the overriding claims\" on other targets under the Pointblank Directive, strikes against communications in these cities to disrupt civilian evacuation from the east and troop movement from the west would be made.\nOn 31 January, Bottomley sent Portal a message saying a heavy attack on Dresden and other cities \"will cause great confusion in civilian evacuation from the east and hamper movement of reinforcements from other fronts\". British historian Frederick Taylor mentions a further memo sent to the Chiefs of Staff Committee by Air Marshal Sir Douglas Evill on 1 February, in which Evill states interfering with mass civilian movements was a key factor in the decision to bomb the city centre. Attacking main railway junctions, telephone systems, city administration and utilities would result in \"chaos\". Britain had ostensibly learned this after the Coventry Blitz, when loss of this crucial infrastructure had supposedly longer-lasting effects than attacks on war plants.\nDuring the Yalta Conference on 4 February, the Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, General Aleksei Antonov, raised the issue of hampering the reinforcement of German troops from the western front by paralyzing the junctions of Berlin and Leipzig with aerial bombardment. In response, Portal, who was in Yalta, asked Bottomley to send him a list of objectives to discuss with the Soviets. Bottomley's list included oil plants, tank and aircraft factories and the cities of Berlin and Dresden. However, according to Richard Overy, the discussion with the Soviet Chief of Staff, Aleksei Antonov, recorded in the minutes, only mentions the bombing of Berlin and Leipzig. The bombing of Dresden was a Western plan, but the Soviets were told in advance about the operation.\nMilitary and industrial profile.\nAccording to the RAF at the time, Dresden was Germany's seventh-largest city and the largest remaining unbombed, built-up area. Taylor writes that an official 1942 guide to the city described it as \"one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich\" and in 1944 the German Army High Command's Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that were supplying the army with materiel. Nonetheless, according to some historians, the contribution of Dresden to the German war effort may not have been as significant as the planners thought.\nThe US Air Force Historical Division wrote a report, which remained classified until December 1978, in response to international concern about the bombing. It said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the German war effort at the time of the raid. According to the report, there were aircraft components factories; a poison gas factory (Chemische Fabrik Goye and Company); an anti-aircraft and field gun factory (Lehman); an optical goods factory (Zeiss Ikon AG); and factories producing electrical and X-ray apparatus (Koch &amp; Sterzel AG); gears and differentials (Saxoniswerke); and electric gauges (Gebr\u00fcder Bassler). The report also mentioned barracks, hutted camps, and a munitions storage depot.\nThe USAF report also states that two of Dresden's traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east\u2013west along the central European uplands. The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines. Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that \"I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians\".\nAn RAF memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack gave some reasoning for the raid:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than Manchester is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter to workers, refugees, and troops alike, but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas. At one time well known for its china, Dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance ... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front, to prevent the use of the city in the way of further advance, and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do. \nIn the raid, major industrial areas in the suburbs, which stretched for miles, were not targeted. According to historian Donald Miller, \"the economic disruption would have been far greater had Bomber Command targeted the suburban areas where most of Dresden's manufacturing might was concentrated\".\nIn his biography of Attlee and Churchill, Leo McKinstry wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Churchill arrived at Yalta on 4 February 1945, the first question that Stalin put to him was: 'Why haven't you bombed Dresden?' His enquiry reflected the importance that the Soviet Union attached to an attack on the city, following intelligence reports that Germany was moving large numbers of troops towards the Breslau Front. Churchill assured Stalin that an Allied attack was imminent.\nThe attacks.\nNight of 13/14 February.\nThe Dresden attack was to have begun with a USAAF Eighth Air Force bombing raid on 13 February 1945. The Eighth Air Force had already bombed the railway yards near the centre of the city twice in daytime raids: once on 7 October 1944 with 70 tons of high-explosive bombs killing more than 400, then again with 133 bombers on 16 January 1945, dropping 279 tons of high-explosives and 41 tons of incendiaries.\nOn 13 February 1945, bad weather over Europe prevented any USAAF operations, and it was left to RAF Bomber Command to carry out the first raid. It had been decided that the raid would be a double strike, in which a second wave of bombers would attack three hours after the first, just as the rescue teams were trying to put out the fires. As was standard practice, other raids were carried out that night to confuse German air defences. Three hundred and sixty heavy bombers (Lancasters and Halifaxes) bombed a synthetic oil plant in B\u00f6hlen, from Dresden, while 71 de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers attacked Magdeburg with small numbers of Mosquitos carrying out nuisance raids on Bonn, Misburg near Hanover and Nuremberg.\nWhen Polish crews of the designated squadrons were preparing for the mission, the terms of the Yalta agreement were made known to them. There was a huge uproar, since the Yalta agreement handed parts of Poland over to the Soviet Union. There was talk of mutiny among the Polish pilots, and their British officers removed their side arms. The Polish Government ordered the pilots to follow their orders and fly their missions over Dresden, which they did.\nThe first of the British aircraft took off at around 17:20 hours CET for the journey. This was a group of Lancasters from Bomber Command's 83 Squadron, No. 5 Group, acting as the Pathfinders, or flare force, whose job it was to find Dresden and drop magnesium parachute flares, known to the Germans as \"Christmas trees\", to mark and light up Dresden for the aircraft that would mark the target itself. The next set of aircraft to leave England were twin-engined Mosquito marker planes, which would identify target areas and drop target indicators (TIs) that marked the target for the bombers to aim at. The attack was to centre on the Ostragehege sports stadium, next to the city's medieval \"Altstadt\" (old town), with its congested and highly combustible timbered buildings.\nThe main bomber force, called \"Plate Rack\", took off shortly after the Pathfinders. This group of 254 Lancasters carried 500 tons of high explosives and 375 tons of incendiaries (\"fire bombs\"). There were 200,000 incendiaries in all, with the high-explosive bombs ranging in weight from \u00a0\u2013 the two-ton \"cookies\", also known as \"blockbusters\" because they could destroy The high explosives were intended to rupture water mains and blow off roofs, doors, and windows to expose the interiors of the buildings and create an air flow to feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that followed.\nThe Lancasters crossed into France near the Somme, then into Germany just north of Cologne. At 22:00 hours, the force heading for B\u00f6hlen split away from Plate Rack, which turned south-east toward the Elbe. By this time, ten of the Lancasters were out of service, leaving 244 to continue to Dresden.\nThe sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). The 'Master Bomber' Wing Commander Maurice Smith, flying in a Mosquito, gave the order to the Lancasters: \"Controller to Plate Rack Force: Come in and bomb glow of red target indicators as planned. Bomb the glow of red TIs as planned\".\nIn the first attack, the first bombs were released at 22:13, the last at 22:28. The Lancasters delivered 881.1 tons of bombs, of which 57% were high explosive and 43% incendiary. The fan-shaped area that was bombed was long, and at its extreme about wide. The shape and total devastation of the area was created by the bombers of No. 5 Group flying over the head of the fan (Ostragehege stadium) on prearranged compass bearings and releasing their bombs at different prearranged times.\nThe second attack, three hours later, was by Lancaster aircraft of 1, 3, 6 and 8 Groups, 8 Group being the Pathfinders. By now, the thousands of fires from the burning city could be seen more than away on the ground. From the air, the second wave of bombers sighted the fires from a distance of over . The Pathfinders therefore decided to expand the target, dropping flares on either side of the firestorm, including the , the main train station, and the , a large park, both undamaged by the first raid. The German sirens sounded again at 01:05, but these were small hand-held sirens that were heard within only a block. Between 01:21 and 01:45, 529 Lancasters dropped more than 1,800 tons of bombs.\n14\u201315 February.\nOn the morning of 14 February 431 United States Army Air Force bombers of the Eighth Air Force's 1st Bombardment Division were scheduled to bomb Dresden near midday, and the 457 aircraft of 3rd Bombardment Division were to follow to bomb Chemnitz, while the 375 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Division would bomb a synthetic oil plant in Magdeburg. Another 84 bombers would attack Wesel. The bomber groups were protected by 784 North American P-51 Mustangs of the Eighth Air Force's VIII Fighter Command, 316 of which covered the Dresden attack \u2013 a total of almost 2,100 Eighth Army Air Force aircraft over Saxony during 14 February. The smoke plume over Dresden by now reached and was plainly visible to the approaching raid.\nPrimary sources disagree as to whether the aiming point was the marshalling yards near the centre of the city or the centre of the built-up urban area. The report by the 1st Bombardment Division's commander to his commander states that the targeting sequence was the centre of the built-up area in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz would be targeted. If both were obscured, they were to bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40 per cent incendiaries\u2014much closer to the RAF city-busting mix than the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40 per cent mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10 per cent incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.\n316 B-17 Flying Fortresses bombed Dresden, dropping 771 tons of bombs. The remaining 115 bombers from the stream of 431 misidentified their targets. Sixty bombed Prague, dropping 153 tons of bombs, while others bombed Br\u00fcx and Pilsen. The 379th bombardment group started to bomb Dresden at 12:17, aiming at marshalling yards in the Friedrichstadt district west of the city centre, as the area was unobscured by smoke or cloud. The 303rd group arrived over Dresden two minutes after the 379th and found their view obscured by clouds, so they bombed Dresden using H2X radar. The groups that followed the 303rd (92nd, 306th, 379th, 384th and 457th) also found Dresden obscured by clouds, and they too used H2X. H2X aiming caused the groups to bomb with a wide dispersal over the Dresden area. The last group to attack Dresden was the 306th, and they finished by 12:30.\nNo evidence of strafing of civilians has ever been found, although a March 1945 article in the Nazi-run weekly newspaper \"Das Reich\" claimed this had occurred. Historian G\u00f6tz Bergander, an eyewitness to the raids, found no reports on strafing for 13\u201315 February by any pilots or the German military and police. He asserted in \"Dresden im Luftkrieg\" (1977) that only a few tales of civilians being strafed were reliable in detail, and all were related to the daylight attack on 14 February. He concluded that some memory of eyewitnesses was real, but that it had misinterpreted the firing in a dogfight as deliberately aimed at people on the ground. In 2000, historian Helmut Schnatz found an explicit order to RAF pilots not to strafe civilians on the way back from Dresden. He also reconstructed timelines with the result that strafing would have been almost impossible due to lack of time and fuel. Frederick Taylor in \"Dresden\" (2004), basing most of his analysis on the work of Bergander and Schnatz, concludes that no strafing took place, although some stray bullets from aerial dogfights may have hit the ground and been mistaken for strafing by those in the vicinity. The official historical commission collected 103 detailed eyewitness accounts and let the local bomb disposal services search according to their assertions. They found no bullets or fragments that would have been used by planes of the Dresden raids.\nOn 15 February, the 1st Bombardment Division's primary target\u2014the B\u00f6hlen synthetic oil plant near Leipzig\u2014was obscured by clouds, so its groups diverted to their secondary target, Dresden. Dresden was also obscured by clouds, so the groups targeted the city using H2X. The first group to arrive over the target was the 401st, but it missed the city centre and bombed Dresden's southeastern suburbs, with bombs also landing on the nearby towns of Meissen and Pirna. The other groups all bombed Dresden between 12:00 and 12:10. They failed to hit the marshalling yards in the Friedrichstadt district and, as in the previous raid, ordnance was scattered over a wide area. Railroad operations at Dresden resumed within three days.\nGerman defensive action.\nDresden's air defences had been depleted as anti-aircraft guns were requisitioned for use against the Red Army in the east, and the city lost its last massive flak battery in January 1945. The Luftwaffe was largely ineffective, with planes that were unsafe to fly due to lack of parts and maintenance and a critical shortage of aviation fuel. The German radar system was also degraded, lowering the warning time to prepare for air attacks. The RAF also had an advantage over the Germans in the field of electronic radar countermeasures.\nOf 796 British bombers that participated, six were lost, three of those hit by bombs dropped by aircraft flying over them. The following day, only a single US bomber was shot down, as the large escort force was able to prevent Luftwaffe day fighters from disrupting the attack.\nOn the ground.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"It is not possible to describe! Explosion after explosion. It was beyond belief, worse than the blackest nightmare. So many people were horribly burnt and injured. It became more and more difficult to breathe. It was dark and all of us tried to leave this cellar with inconceivable panic. Dead and dying people were trampled upon, luggage was left or snatched up out of our hands by rescuers. The basket with our twins covered with wet cloths was snatched up out of my mother's hands and we were pushed upstairs by the people behind us. We saw the burning street, the falling ruins and the terrible firestorm. My mother covered us with wet blankets and coats she found in a water tub.\"\n\"We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere, everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.\"\n\"I cannot forget these terrible details. I can never forget them.\"\nThe sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Frederick Taylor writes that the Germans could see that a large enemy bomber formation\u2014or what they called \"\" (lit: a fat dog, a \"major thing\")\u2014was approaching somewhere in the east. At 21:39 the Reich Air Defence Leadership issued an enemy aircraft warning for Dresden, although at that point it was thought Leipzig might be the target. At 21:59 the Local Air Raid Leadership confirmed that the bombers were in the area of Dresden-Pirna. Taylor writes the city was largely undefended; a night fighter force of ten Messerschmitt Bf 110Gs at Klotzsche airfield was scrambled, but it took them half an hour to get into an attack position. At 22:03 the Local Air Raid Leadership issued the first definitive warning: \"Warning! Warning! Warning! The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area\". Some 10,000 fled to the great open space of the Grosse Garten, the royal park of Dresden, nearly in all. Here they were caught by the second raid, which started without an air-raid warning, at 1:22\u00a0a.m. At 11:30\u00a0a.m., the third wave of bombers, the two hundred and eleven American Flying Fortresses, began their attack.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To my left I suddenly see a woman. I can see her to this day and shall never forget it. She carries a bundle in her arms. It is a baby. She runs, she falls, and the child flies in an arc into the fire.\nSuddenly, I saw people again, right in front of me. They scream and gesticulate with their hands, and then\u2014to my utter horror and amazement\u2014I see how one after the other they simply seem to let themselves drop to the ground. (Today I know that these unfortunate people were the victims of lack of oxygen.) They fainted and then burnt to cinders.\nInsane fear grips me and from then on I repeat one simple sentence to myself continuously: \"I don't want to burn to death\". I do not know how many people I fell over. I know only one thing: that I must not burn.\u2014\u200a&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suddenly, the sirens stopped. Then flares filled the night sky with blinding light, dripping burning phosphorus onto the streets and buildings. It was then that we realized we were trapped in a locked cage that stood every chance of becoming a mass grave.\u2014\u200a\nThere were few public air raid shelters. The largest, beneath the main railway station, housed 6,000 refugees. As a result, most people took shelter in cellars, but one of the air raid precautions the city had taken was to remove thick cellar walls between rows of buildings and replace them with thin partitions that could be knocked through in an emergency. The idea was that, as one building collapsed or filled with smoke, those sheltering in the basements could knock walls down and move into adjoining buildings. With the city on fire everywhere, those fleeing from one burning cellar simply ran into another, with the result that thousands of bodies were found piled up in houses at the ends of city blocks.\nA Dresden police report written shortly after the attacks reported that the old town and the inner eastern suburbs had been engulfed in a single fire that had destroyed almost 12,000 dwellings. The same report said that the raids had destroyed the Wehrmacht's main command post in the Taschenbergpalais, 63 administration buildings, the railways, 19 military hospitals, 19 ships and barges, and a number of less significant military facilities. The destruction also encompassed 640 shops, 64 warehouses, 39 schools, 31 stores, 31 large hotels, 26 public houses/bars, 26 insurance buildings, 24 banks, 19 postal facilities, 19 hospitals and private clinics including auxiliary, overflow hospitals, 18 cinemas, 11 churches and 6 chapels, 5 consulates, 4 tram facilities, 3 theatres, 2 market halls, the zoo, the waterworks, and 5 other cultural buildings. Almost 200 factories were damaged, 136 seriously (including several of the Zeiss Ikon precision optical engineering works), 28 with medium to serious damage, and 35 with light damage.\nAn RAF assessment showed that 23 per cent of the industrial buildings and 56 per cent of the non-industrial buildings, not counting residential buildings, had been seriously damaged. Around 78,000 dwellings had been completely destroyed; 27,700 were uninhabitable, and 64,500 damaged but readily repairable.\nDuring his post-war interrogation, Albert Speer, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production, said that Dresden's industrial recovery from the bombings was rapid.\nFatalities.\nAccording to the official German report (Order of the Day) no.\u00a047 (\"TB47\") issued on 22 March, the number of dead recovered by that date was 20,204, including 6,865 who were cremated on the \"Altmarkt\" square, and they expected the total number of deaths to be about 25,000. Another report on 3 April put the number of corpses recovered at 22,096. Three municipal and 17 rural cemeteries outside Dresden recorded up to 30 April 1945 a total of at least 21,895 buried bodies from the Dresden raids, including those cremated on the \"Altmarkt\".\nBetween 100,000 and 200,000 refugees fleeing westward from advancing Soviet forces were in the city at the time of the bombing. Exact figures are unknown, but reliable estimates were calculated based on train arrivals, foot traffic, and the extent to which emergency accommodation had to be organised. The city authorities did not distinguish between residents and refugees when establishing casualty numbers and \"took great pains to count all the dead, identified and unidentified\". This was largely achievable because most of the dead succumbed to suffocation; in only four places were recovered remains so badly burned that it was impossible to ascertain the number of victims. The uncertainty this introduced is thought to amount to no more than 100 people. 35,000 people were registered with the authorities as missing after the raids, around 10,000 were later found alive.\nA further 1,858 bodies were discovered during the reconstruction of Dresden between the end of the war and 1966. Since 1989, despite extensive excavation for new buildings, no new war-related bodies have been found. Seeking to establish a definitive casualty figure, in part to address propagandisation of the bombing by far-right groups, the Dresden city council in 2005 authorised an independent Historians' Commission (\"Historikerkommission\") to conduct a new, thorough investigation, collecting and evaluating available sources. The results were published in 2010 and stated that between 22,700 and 25,000 people had been killed.\nWartime political responses.\nGerman.\nDevelopment of a German political response to the raid took several turns. Initially, some of the leadership, especially Robert Ley and Joseph Goebbels, wanted to use the raid as a pretext for abandonment of the Geneva Conventions on the Western Front. In the end, the only political action the German government took was to exploit the bombing for propaganda purposes. Goebbels is reported to have wept with rage for twenty minutes after he heard the news of the catastrophe, before launching into a bitter attack on Hermann G\u00f6ring, the commander of the Luftwaffe: \"If I had the power I would drag this cowardly good-for-nothing, this Reich marshal, before a court. ... How much guilt does this parasite not bear for all this, which we owe to his indolence and love of his own comforts...\". On 16 February, the Propaganda Ministry issued a press release that claimed that Dresden had no war industries; it was a city of culture. On 25 February, a new leaflet with photographs of two burned children was released under the title \"Dresden\u2014Massacre of Refugees\", stating that 200,000 had died. Since no official estimate had been developed, the numbers were speculative, but newspapers such as the Stockholm \"Svenska Morgonbladet\" used phrases such as \"privately from Berlin\", to explain where they had obtained the figures. Frederick Taylor states that \"there is good reason to believe that later in March copies of\u2014or extracts from\u2014[an official police report] were leaked to the neutral press by Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry ... doctored with an extra zero to increase [the total dead from the raid] to 202,040\". On 4 March, \"Das Reich\", a weekly newspaper founded by Goebbels, published a lengthy article emphasising the suffering and destruction of a cultural icon, without mentioning damage to the German war effort.\nTaylor writes that this propaganda was effective, as it not only influenced attitudes in neutral countries at the time, but also reached the House of Commons, when Richard Stokes, a Labour Member of Parliament, and a long term opponent of area-bombing, quoted information from the German Press Agency (controlled by the Propaganda Ministry). It was Stokes's questions in the House of Commons that were in large part responsible for the shift in British opinion against this type of raid. Taylor suggests that, although the destruction of Dresden would have affected people's support for the Allies regardless of German propaganda, at least some of the outrage did depend on Goebbels' falsification of the casualty figures.\nBritish.\nThe destruction of the city provoked unease in intellectual circles in Britain. According to Max Hastings, by February 1945, attacks upon German cities had become largely irrelevant to the outcome of the war and the name of Dresden resonated with cultured people all over Europe\u2014\"the home of so much charm and beauty, a refuge for Trollope's heroines, a landmark of the Grand Tour.\" He writes that the bombing was the first time the public in Allied countries seriously questioned the military actions used to defeat the Germans.\nThe unease was made worse by an Associated Press story that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. At a press briefing held by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force two days after the raids, British Air Commodore Colin McKay Grierson told journalists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First of all they (Dresden and similar towns) are the centres to which evacuees are being moved. They are centres of communications through which traffic is moving across to the Russian Front, and from the Western Front to the East, and they are sufficiently close to the Russian Front for the Russians to continue the successful prosecution of their battle. I think these three reasons probably cover the bombing.\nOne of the journalists asked whether the principal aim of bombing Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies. Grierson answered that the primary aim was to attack communications to prevent the Germans from moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroy \"what is left of German morale\". Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, subsequently filed a story claiming that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a longtime opponent of strategic bombing, Richard Stokes MP, asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March.\nChurchill subsequently re-evaluated the goals of the bombing campaigns, to focus less on strategic targets, and more toward targets of tactical significance. On 28 March, in a draft of a memo for General Ismay and the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, in the actual memorandum, Churchill removed references to the increasing of terror as an aim for political reasons, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of the so called \"area bombing\" of German cities should be reviewed from the point of view of our own interests. If we come into control of an entirely ruined land, there will be a great shortage of accommodation for ourselves and our Allies: and we shall be unable to get housing materials out of Germany for our own needs because some temporary provision would have to be made for the Germans themselves. We must see to it that our attacks do not do more harm to ourselves in the long run than they do to the enemy's immediate war effort. Pray let me have your views.\nHaving been given a paraphrased version of Churchill's memo by Bottomley, on 29 March, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris wrote to the Air Ministry:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe phrase \"worth the bones of one British grenadier\" echoed Otto von Bismarck's: \"The whole of the Balkans is not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier\". Under pressure from the Chiefs of Staff and in response to the views expressed by Portal and Harris among others, Churchill withdrew his memo and issued a new one. This was completed on 1 April 1945:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the moment has come when the question of the so called 'area-bombing' of German cities should be reviewed from the point of view of our own interests. If we come into control of an entirely ruined land, there will be a great shortage of accommodation for ourselves and our allies. ... We must see to it that our attacks do no more harm to ourselves in the long run than they do to the enemy's war effort.\nAmerican.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith was among those in the Roosevelt administration who had qualms about the bombing. As one of the directors of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, formed late in the war by the American Office of Strategic Services to assess the results of the aerial bombardments of Nazi Germany, he wrote: \"The incredible cruelty of the attack on Dresden when the war had already been won\u2014and the death of children, women, and civilians\u2014that was extremely weighty and of no avail\". The Survey's majority view on the Allies' bombing of German cities, however, concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The city area raids have left their mark on the German people as well as on their cities. Far more than any other military action that preceded the actual occupation of Germany itself, these attacks left the German people with a solid lesson in the disadvantages of war. It was a terrible lesson; conceivably that lesson, both in Germany and abroad, could be the most lasting single effect of the air war.\nReconstruction and reconciliation.\nAfter the war, and again after German reunification, great efforts were made to rebuild some of Dresden's former landmarks, such as the Frauenkirche, the Semperoper (the Saxony state opera house) and the Zwinger Palace (the latter two were rebuilt before reunification).\nIn 1956, Dresden entered a twin-town relationship with Coventry. As a centre of military and munitions production, Coventry suffered some of the worst attacks on any British city at the hands of the Luftwaffe during the Coventry Blitzes of 1940 and 1941, which killed over 1,200 civilians and destroyed its cathedral.\nIn 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a group of prominent Dresdeners formed an international appeal known as the \"Call from Dresden\" to request help in rebuilding the Lutheran Frauenkirche, the destruction of which had over the years become a symbol of the bombing. The baroque Church of Our Lady (completed in 1743) had initially appeared to survive the raids, but collapsed a few days later, and the ruins were left in place by later Communist governments as an anti-war memorial.\nA British charity, the Dresden Trust, was formed in 1993 to raise funds in response to the call for help, eventually raising over \u00a3 from British society, equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023. One of the gifts they made to the project was an orb and cross made in London by goldsmiths at Grant Macdonald and at least tall, using medieval nails recovered from the ruins of the roof of Coventry Cathedral, and crafted in part by Alan Smith, the son of a pilot who took part in the raid.\nThe new Frauenkirche was reconstructed over seven years by architects using 3D computer technology to analyse old photographs and every piece of rubble that had been kept and was formally consecrated on 30 October 2005, in a service attended by some 1,800 guests, including Germany's president, Horst K\u00f6hler, previous chancellors Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Angela Merkel, and the Duke of Kent.\nA further development towards the reconstruction of Dresden's historical core came in 1999 when the Dresden Historical Neumarkt Society (GHND) was founded. The society is committed to reconstructing the historic city centre as much as possible. When plans for the rebuilding of Dresden's Frauenkirche became certain, the GHND began calls for the reconstruction of historic buildings that surrounded it.\nIn 2003, a petition in support of reconstructing the Neumarkt area was signed by nearly 68,000 people, amounting to 15% of the entire electorate. This demonstrated broad support for the initiative and widespread appreciation for historical Dresden. This led to the city council's decision to rebuild a large amount of baroque buildings in accordance to historical designs, but with modern buildings in between them.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], reconstruction of the surrounding Neumarkt buildings continues.\nPost-war debate.\nThe bombing of Dresden remains controversial and is subject to an ongoing debate by historians and scholars regarding the moral and military justifications surrounding the event. British historian Frederick Taylor wrote of the attacks: \"The destruction of Dresden has an epically tragic quality to it. It was a wonderfully beautiful city and a symbol of baroque humanism and all that was best in Germany. It also contained all of the worst from Germany during the Nazi period. In that sense it is an absolutely exemplary tragedy for the horrors of 20th century warfare and a symbol of destruction\".\nSeveral factors have made the bombing a unique point of contention and debate. First among these are the Nazi government's exaggerated claims immediately afterwards. The fact that the attack was carried out in the final stages of the war, and the public perception that, unlike Hamburg, Dresden was not a major industrial centre and its contribution to the war effort was not so significant, fueled the flames of controversy.\nLegal considerations.\nThe Hague Conventions, addressing the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power. Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update enacted international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law does not mean that the laws of war did not cover aerial warfare, but the existing laws remained open to interpretation. Specifically, whether the attack can be considered a war crime depends on whether the city was defended and whether resistance was offered against an approaching enemy. Allied arguments centre around the existence of a local air defence system and additional ground defences the Germans were constructing in anticipation of Soviet advances.\nFalsification of evidence.\nHolocaust deniers and pro-Nazi polemicists\u2014most notably British writer David Irving\u2014use the bombing in an attempt to establish a moral equivalence between the war crimes committed by the Nazi government and the killing of German civilians by Allied bombing raids. As such, grossly inflated casualty figures have been promulgated over the years, many based on a figure of over 200,000 deaths quoted in a forged version of the casualty report, \"Tagesbefehl\" No. 47, that originated with Hitler's Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Irving himself grossly exaggerated the death toll in his book \"The Destruction of Dresden\", arguing that the Allied bombing killed 135,000 inhabitants; these figures were initially widely accepted, but are now considered to be wildly inflated.\nMarshall inquiry.\nAn inquiry conducted at the behest of U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, stated the raid was justified by the available intelligence. The inquiry declared the elimination of the German ability to reinforce a counter-attack against Marshal Ivan Konev's extended line or, alternatively, to retreat and regroup using Dresden as a base of operations, were important military objectives. As Dresden had been largely untouched during the war due to its location, it was one of few remaining rail and communications centres. A secondary objective was to disrupt the industrial use of Dresden for munitions manufacture, which American intelligence believed was the case. The shock to military planners and to the Allied civilian populations of the German counterattack known as the Battle of the Bulge had ended speculation that the war was almost over, and may have contributed to the decision to continue with the aerial bombardment of German cities.\nThe inquiry concluded that by the presence of active German military units nearby, and the presence of fighters and anti-aircraft within an effective range, Dresden qualified as \"defended\". By this stage in the war both the British and the Germans had integrated air defences at the national level; the tribunal argued that this meant no German city was undefended.\nMarshall's tribunal declared that no extraordinary decision was made to single out Dresden (for instance, to take advantage of a large number of refugees, or purposely terrorise the German populace), arguing that the area bombing was intended to disrupt communications and destroy industrial production. The American inquiry established that the Soviets, under allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested area bombing of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point following a German strategic retreat.\nU.S. Air Force Historical Division report.\nA report by the U.S. Air Force Historical Division (USAFHD) analysed the circumstances of the raid and concluded that it was militarily necessary and justified, based on the following points:\nThe first point regarding the legitimacy of the raid depends on two claims: first, that the railyards subjected to American precision bombing were an important logistical target, and that the city was also an important industrial centre. Even after the main firebombing, there were two further raids on the Dresden railway yards by the USAAF. The first was on 2 March 1945, by 406 B-17s, which dropped 940 tons of high-explosive bombs and 141 tons of incendiaries. The second was on 17 April, when 580 B-17s dropped 1,554 tons of high-explosive bombs and 165 tons of incendiaries.\nAs far as Dresden being a militarily significant industrial centre, an official 1942 guide described the German city as \"...one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich,\" and in 1944, the German Army High Command's Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that supplied materiel to the military. Dresden was the seventh largest German city, and by far the largest un-bombed built-up area left, and thus was contributing to the defence of Germany itself.\nAccording to the USAFHD, there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden at the time of the raid. These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.), aircraft components, anti-aircraft guns, field guns, and small arms, poison gas, gears and differentials, electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric gauges, gas masks, Junkers aircraft engines, and Messerschmitt fighter cockpit parts.\nThe second of the five points addresses the prohibition in the Hague Conventions, of \"attack or bombardment\" of \"undefended\" towns. The USAFHD report states that Dresden was protected by anti-aircraft defences, antiaircraft guns, and searchlights, under the Combined Dresden (Corps Area IV) and Berlin (Corps Area III) Air Service Commands.\nThe third and fourth points say that the size of the Dresden raid\u2014in terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery\u2014were commensurate with the military objective and similar to other Allied bombings. On 23 February 1945, the Allies bombed Pforzheim and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities. The most devastating raid on any city was on Tokyo on 9\u201310 March (the \"Meetinghouse\" raid) which caused over 100,000 casualties, many civilian. The tonnage and types of bombs listed in the service records of the Dresden raid were comparable to (or less than) throw weights of bombs dropped in other air attacks carried out in 1945. In the case of Dresden, as in many other similar attacks, the hour break in between the RAF raids was a deliberate ploy to attack the fire fighters, medical teams, and military units.\nIn late July 1943, the city of Hamburg was bombed during Operation Gomorrah by combined RAF and USAAF strategic bomber forces. Four major raids were carried out in the span of 10 days, of which the most notable, on the night of 27\u201328 July, created a devastating firestorm effect similar to Dresden's, killing an estimated 18,474 people. The death toll for that night is included in the overall estimated total of 37,000 for the series of raids. Two-thirds of the remaining population reportedly fled the city after the raids.\nThe fifth point is that the firebombing achieved the intended effect of disabling the industry in Dresden. It was estimated that at least 23 per cent of the city's industrial buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The damage to other infrastructure and communications was immense, which would have severely limited the potential use of Dresden to stop the Soviet advance. The report concludes with: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArguments against justification.\nMilitary reasons.\nThe journalist Alexander McKee cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not targeted during the raid. The \"hutted camps\" mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: \"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped\". McKee further asserts \"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built-up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure.\"\nAccording to historian S\u00f6nke Neitzel, \"it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front. The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in German industry at this stage in the war\". Neitzel later posits that attacks which are not just indiscriminate but also target civilians are war crimes. Wing Commander H. R. Allen said, \"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence\".\nAs an immoral act, but not a war crime.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... ever since the deliberate mass bombing of civilians in the second world war, and as a direct response to it, the international community has outlawed the practice. It first tried to do so in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, but the UK and the US would not agree, since to do so would have been an admission of guilt for their systematic \"area bombing\" of German and Japanese civilians.\u2014\u200a\nFrederick Taylor told \"Der Spiegel\", \"I personally find the attack on Dresden horrific. It was overdone, it was excessive and is to be regretted enormously,\" but, \"A war crime is a very specific thing which international lawyers argue about all the time and I would not be prepared to commit myself nor do I see why I should. I'm a historian.\" Similarly, British philosopher A. C. Grayling has described RAF area bombardment as an \"immoral act\" and \"moral crime\" because \"destroying everything... contravenes every moral and humanitarian principle debated in connection with the just conduct of war\", though Grayling insisted that it \"is not strictly correct to describe area bombing as a 'war crime'.\"\nAs a war crime.\nAccording to Gregory Stanton, lawyer and president of Genocide Watch:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... every human being having the capacity for both good and evil. The Nazi Holocaust was among the most evil genocides in history. But the Allies' firebombing of Dresden and nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were also war crimes \u2013 and as Leo Kuper and Eric Markusen have argued, also acts of genocide. We are all capable of evil and must be restrained by law from committing it.\nHistorian Donald Bloxham states, \"The bombing of Dresden on 13\u201314 February 1945 was a war crime\". He further argues there was a strong \"prima facie\" case for trying Winston Churchill among others and a theoretical case Churchill could have been found guilty. \"This should be a sobering thought. If, however it is also a startling one, this is probably less the result of widespread understanding of the nuance of international law and more because in the popular mind 'war criminal', like 'paedophile' or 'terrorist', has developed into a moral rather than a legal categorisation\".\nGerman author G\u00fcnter Grass is one of several intellectuals and commentators who have also called the bombing a war crime.\nProponents of this position argue that the devastation from firebombing was greater than anything that could be justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a case. The Allies were aware of the effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.\nAs of concealed purpose.\nA revisionist story, persisting into the 21st century, was that the bombing was done, at least in part, to give the Soviets a signal demonstration\u2013a warning\u2013of the destructive power of the Allied bomber forces (the Soviets were expected to occupy Dresden presently).\nPolitical response in Germany.\nFar-right politicians in Germany have sparked a great deal of controversy by promoting the term (transl.\u2009holocaust by bombs) to describe the raids. writes that, for decades, the Communist government of East Germany promoted the bombing as an example of \"Anglo-American terror\", and now the same rhetoric is being used by the far right. An example can be found in the extremist nationalist party \"Die Heimat\". A party's representative, J\u00fcrgen Gansel, described the Dresden raids as \"mass murder\", and \"Dresden's holocaust of bombs\". This provoked an outrage in the German parliament and triggered responses from the media. Prosecutors said that it was legal to call the bombing a holocaust. In 2010 groups opposing the far-right blocked a demonstration of far-right organisations.\nPhrases like \"Bomber-Harris, do it again!\", \"Bomber-Harris Superstar \u2013 Thanks from the red Antifa\", and \" (transl.\u2009\"German perpetrators are no victims!\") are popular slogans among the so-called \"Anti-Germans\"\u00a0\u2013 a small radical left-wing political movement in Germany and Austria. In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing, Anti-Germans praised the bombing on the grounds that so many of the city's civilians had supported Nazism. Similar rallies take place every year.\nIn literature and the arts.\nKurt Vonnegut.\nKurt Vonnegut's novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death\" (1969) used some elements from his experiences as a prisoner of war at Dresden during the bombing. The death toll of 135,000 given by Vonnegut was taken from \"The Destruction of Dresden\", a 1963 book by Holocaust denier David Irving. In a 1965 letter to \"The Guardian\", Irving later adjusted his estimates even higher, \"almost certainly between 100,000 and 250,000\", but these figures were inflated; Irving finally published a correction in \"The Times\" in a 1966 letter to the editor lowering it to 25,000, in line with subsequent scholarship. Despite Irving's eventual much lower numbers, and later accusations of generally poor scholarship, the figure popularised by Vonnegut remains in general circulation.\nIn a 2006 \"Rolling Stone\" article, Vonnegut is quoted recalling \"utter destruction\" and \"carnage unfathomable\". The Germans put him and other POWs to work gathering bodies for mass burial. \"But there were too many corpses to bury. So instead the Nazis sent in troops with flamethrowers. All these civilians' remains were burned to ashes.\"\nIn the special introduction to the 1976 Franklin Library edition of the novel, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it. I am that person. I wrote this book, which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation, such as it is. One way or another, I got two or three dollars for every person killed. Some business I'm in.\nThe firebombing of Dresden was depicted in George Roy Hill's 1972 movie adaptation of Vonnegut's novel.\nVonnegut's experiences in Dresden were also used in several of his other books and are included in his posthumously published writings in \"Armageddon in Retrospect\". In one of those essays, Vonnegut paraphrased leaflets dropped by the Allies in the days after the bombings as saying: To the people of Dresden: We were forced to bomb your city because of the heavy military traffic your railroad facilities have been carrying. We realize that we haven't always hit our objectives. Destruction of anything other than military objectives was unintentional, unavoidable fortunes of war. Vonnegut notes that many of those railroad facilities were not actually bombed, and those that were hit were restored to operation within several days.\nFreeman Dyson, a British-American physicist who had worked as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 to the end of the war, wrote in later years (1979):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For many years I had intended to write a book on the bombing. Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and saw what happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true.\nIn 1995, Vonnegut recalled having discussed the bombing with Dyson, and quotes Dyson as attributing the decision to bomb Dresden to \"bureaucratic momentum\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64695", "revid": "275202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64695", "title": "Professor Frink", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nProfessor John I.Q. Nerdelbaum Frink Jr. is a recurring character in the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". He is voiced by Hank Azaria, and first appeared in the 1991 episode \"Old Money\". Frink is Springfield's nerdy scientist/professor and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat mad and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his trademark.\nFrink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in \"Old Money\", since he was trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria ad-libbed a voice for the character, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's Julius Kelp character from \"The Nutty Professor\". The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personality\u00a0\u2013 he became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink's father in the 2003 episode \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\".\nThe professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from \"The Simpsons\". Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood. The character's popularity has led to him giving the name to the computer programming language Frink.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nJohn Frink is generally depicted as Springfield's stereotypical nerdy, mad, and socially inept scientist, inventor, and mathematician. He wears thick glasses, a white lab coat (which was green in earlier seasons), a blue bow-tie atop a white buttoned-up shirt, and pink pants, and has buckteeth and center-parted hair. Frink is a college professor at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology and runs his own astronomical observatory. He has an IQ of 197\u00a0\u2013 it was 199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield's brief intellectual junta\u00a0\u2013 and is a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa. Frink is generally very polite and friendly. He has a trademark mannerism of using Jerry Lewis-style gibberish when excited, such as \"HOYVIN-GLAVIN!\" and \"FLAVIN\" and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to \"carry the one\" in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and use or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. \"Father and I got along like positrons and antineutrinos!\" or \"microcalifragilistics\".\nFrink often tries to use his mad and bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually do not work or only make things worse. Most of his inventions never function properly or are of no real use. He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a drilling machine that can cut through anything. Some of Frink's unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), the \"Gamble-Tron 2000\", a machine designed to predict pro football scores (after it predicts one team will win by 200 points, Frink physically attacks it on live television), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash to the ground and catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured \"Frink's Disease\" and discovered the element \"Frinkonium\". He has also mastered astrology to the point where he can use it to accurately predict the future, and has been shown to be capable of time travel.\nThe professor has a son who is seen in \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\" during a convention for infant and toddler products as a pilot of a remote-controlled plane (he flies out the window of the building while in the plane and crashes), and in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\" at a robot battle (operating the robot). On the show, Frink has made mention of a wife, but there have also been jokes about him having had little contact with women in his life.\nFrink often appears in the \"Treehouse of Horror\" Halloween episodes of \"The Simpsons\", which are not accepted as canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Frink's bizarre inventions and understanding of advanced physics usually fit well into these supernatural plotlines. In \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\", Bart enters Frink's matter teleporter and \u2013 echoing the film \"The Fly\" \u2013 it results in an accidental mix between Bart's genes and the genes of a housefly that was also present in the transporter at the same time. In \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\", it is revealed that Frink had a father who was killed by a shark, whom he brings back to life in the episode by piecing together his body parts. Unfortunately, the man decides to steal body parts to improve himself after he is revived. In the latter episode, Frink is awarded a Nobel Prize.\nCharacter.\nFrink first appeared in the season two episode \"Old Money\" that aired on March 28, 1991. In that episode, Grampa Simpson inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that \"it is just a prototype. With proper funding I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!\" Grampa responds with \"But I want to help people, not kill 'em!\", to which Frink replies \"Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she's hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one.\"\nIn the original script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film \"The Nutty Professor\", and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening told \"TV Guide\" that \"He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single line\u00a0\u2013 and most of these characters have very few lines\u00a0\u2013 and he just brings it to life. Every time.\" Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him look even more like Lewis's character. Writer Jay Kogen named the character after his friend and fellow television writer John Frink, who was later hired on \"The Simpsons\". Frink's nonsensical utterances are written in the scripts as \"Frink noise\".\nAzaria has voiced Frink ever since the first appearance of the professor. Of the many characters that Azaria voices, Frink is his favorite because he was a fan of Lewis in his younger years and he enjoys imitating the voice of the Nutty Professor. He has said that \"once you start talking like [Julius Kelp] it's very hard to stop. On each take, I'll make it sillier, I always have. I'll add more and more stupid noises and sounds to it. If they let me keep going, it gets ridiculous.\"\nAs a homage to Lewis, Azaria conceived the idea of the Treehouse of Horror XIV segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" wrote that it is hard to tell Frink and his father's voices apart: \"Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking.\" In addition, \"The Knoxville News-Sentinel\"'s Terry Morrow commented that \"to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard \"Simpsons\" fans live for.\"\nReception.\nFrink is a popular character on \"The Simpsons\" and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of \"The Tuscaloosa News\" named him his favorite secondary character from the show. \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\"'s Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on \"The Simpsons\", writing that \"Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny.\" On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral \"Simpsons\" characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the \"Simpsons\" universe \"as the town's brilliant mad scientist.\" They highlighted a scene from the episode \"The PTA Disbands\", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children \"wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels\" as he did. Nick Griffiths of \"Radio Times\" named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has \"always loved Professor Frink\", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word \"the\", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"'s David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of \"TV's great tech figures\", writing that apart from being smart, the professor is best known for his \"rather idiosyncratic speech patterns\u00a0\u2013 hmmguyvin-whey-hey.\" Joe Rhodes of \"TV Guide\" listed the following as the professor's most memorable line: \"Sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab with the running and the exploding and the crying when the monkeys stole the glasses off my head.\"\nSeveral critics have commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's \"Tech &amp; Gadgets\" wrote that \"When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king\", and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in \"The Simpsons\". Although he added that it \"was not one of [Frink's] most successful\", since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: \"Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?\" Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of \"Locus\" listed the scene in \"The Simpsons Movie\" that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.\nMerchandising and legacy.\nFrink has appeared in various merchandise related to \"The Simpsons\", including issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", the simulator ride \"The Simpsons Ride\" at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, and video games such as \"The Simpsons Wrestling\", ', ', and \"The Simpsons Game\". He has also been turned into a Halloween-inspired action figure that was packaged with Kids Meals at Burger King in October and November 2002. In addition, Frink was featured on the cover of the October 16, 2000 issue of \"TV Guide\". In 2015, \"Lego\" released a second series for their \"Simpsons\" \"Lego Minifigures\" theme. The second series features Frink.\nThe professor has also affected real-life science. Frink, a computer programming language, was named after him. It is, according to creator of the language, \"designed to make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out right, and to make a tool that's really useful in the real world. It tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps you easily verify that your answers make sense.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Comparable to Dukes/Grand Dukes, Boyars were second only to the ruling princes, grand princes or tsars from the 10th to the 17th centuries.\nEtymology.\nAlso known as \"bolyar\"; variants in other languages include or ; , , pl.\u2009\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435; , ; and .\nThe title Boila is predecessor or old form of the title Bolyar (the Bulgarian word for Boyar). Boila was a title worn by some of the Bulgar aristocrats (mostly of regional governors and noble warriors) in the First Bulgarian Empire (681\u20131018). The plural form of boila (\"noble\"), \"bolyare\" is attested in Bulgar inscriptions and rendered as \"boilades\" or \"boliades\" in the Greek of Byzantine documents.\nMultiple different derivation theories of the word have been suggested by scholars and linguists, such as it having possible roots from old Turkic: \"bai\" (\"noble, rich\"; \"cf.\" \"bay\") plus Turkic \"\u00e4r\" (\"man, men\"), proto-Slavic \"boj\" (fight, battle) or from Romanian \"boi\" (oxen, cattle) to \"Boier\" (owner of cattle).\nBolyars in Bulgaria.\nThe oldest Slavic form of \"boyar\"\u2014\"bolyarin\", pl. \"bolyari\" (, pl. )\u2014dates from the 10th century, and it is found in Bulgaria, also popular as old Bulgar title \"boila\", which denoted a high aristocratic status among the Bulgars. It was probably built from Turkic \"bol\"- meaning \"many\" and \"yarin, yarki\"- meaning \"bright, enlightened\". In support of this hypothesis is the 10th-century diplomatic protocol of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, where the Bulgarian nobles are called \"boliades\", while the 9th-century Bulgar sources call them \"boila\".\nA member of the nobility during the First Bulgarian Empire was called a \"boila\", while in the Second Bulgarian Empire, the corresponding title became \"bolyar\" or \"bolyarin\". \"Bolyar\", as well as its predecessor, \"boila\", was a hereditary title. The Bulgarian bolyars were divided into \"veliki\" (\"great\") and \"malki\" (\"minor\").\nPresently in Bulgaria, the word \"bolyari\" is used as a nickname for the inhabitants of Veliko Tarnovo\u2014once the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\nBoyars in Serbia.\nIn medieval Serbia, the rank of the boyars () was equivalent to the rank of the baron; meaning \"free warrior\" (or \"free man\" in general), it was the first rank after the non-free peasants or serfs. The etymology of the term comes from the word \"battle\" (). The boyars of Serbia were literally \"men for the battle\" or the warrior class, in contrast to the peasants. They could own land but were obliged to defend it and fight for the king. With the rule of the Ottoman Empire after 1450, the Ottoman as well as the Austro-Hungarian terms exchanged the Serbian one. Today, it is an archaic term representing the aristocracy ().\nBoyars in Rus'.\nFrom the 9th to 13th century, boyars wielded considerable power through their military support of the Rus's princes. Power and prestige of many of them, however, soon came to depend almost completely on service to the state, family history of service and, to a lesser extent, land ownership. Boyars of Kievan Rus were visually very similar to knights, but after the Mongol invasion, their cultural links were mostly lost.\nThe boyars occupied the highest state offices and, through a council (duma), advised the grand duke. They received extensive grants of land and, as members of the Boyars' Duma, were the major legislators of Kievan Rus'.\nAfter the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the boyars from western and southern parts of Kievan Rus' (modern Belarus and Ukraine) were incorporated into Lithuanian and Polish nobility (szlachta). In the 16th and 17th centuries, many of those Rus boyars who failed to get the status of a nobleman actively participated in the formation of the Cossack army.\nBoyars in Novgorod and Pskov formed a sort of republic, where the power of princes (knyaz) was strongly limited until the conquest by Moscow. Boyars kept their influence in the Russian principalities of Vladimir, Tver and Moscow. Only after the centralization of power by Moscow was the power of the boyars diminished.\nTsardom of Russia.\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, the boyars of Moscow had considerable influence that continued from the Muscovy period. However, starting with the reign of Ivan III, the boyars were starting to lose that influence to the authoritative tsars in Muscovy. Because of Ivan III's expansionist policies, administrative changes were needed in order to ease the burden of governing Muscovy. Small principalities knew their loyal subjects by name, but after the consolidation of territories under Ivan, familial loyalty and friendship with the boyar's subjects turned those same subjects into administrative lists. The face of provincial rule disappeared.\nBoyar membership, until the 16th century, did not necessarily require one to be Russian, or even Orthodox, as historians note that many boyars came from places like Lithuania or the Nogais, and some remained Muslims for a generation after the Mongols were ousted. What is interesting about the boyars is their implied duties. Because boyars were not constitutionally instituted, much of their powers and duties came from agreements signed between princes. Agreements, such as one between Ivan III and Mikhail Borisovich in 1484 showed how allegiances needed to be earned and secured, rather than implied and enforced.\nInstead of the grand prince personally overseeing his lands, he had to rely on his captains and close advisors to oversee day-to-day operations. Instead of the great voice the boyars had previously in their advisory roles, they now had less bargaining power and mobility. They answered questions posed by the grand prince, and Ivan III even made sure to get their approval on special events, such as his marriage to Zoe Paleologa, or the attack on Novgorod. This was to ensure the boyars and their military power remained loyal to the tsar.\nThe grand duke also made sure that peasants could not leave the princes' lands, or from one place to another, in the mid-1400s, effectively establishing serfdom. The boyars gained rewards and gifts as well. Some boyars were sent to regions as governors, and could \u201cfeed off\u201d the locals in this way. Still, by the end of the 15th century, boyar membership had declined, and merit rather than family background decided who became a boyar. When Ivan IV became the tsar, more radical changes were implemented to limit boyar influence.\nIvan IV became the grand prince of all Muscovy in 1533 at the age of three, but various boyar factions tried to compete for control of the regency. When Ivan IV came to power in 1547, much more of the boyars' independent political power became obsolete. The independence and autonomy experienced by the princes of the regions in Muscovy was abolished under Ivan IV by the end of the sixteenth century, making them \"the prince's sons\", or just simple boyars serving the Grand Prince. Ivan IV divided Muscovy into two parts in 1565, and in the private part, the terror began.\nThe boyars attempted to band together and resist, but instead of constitutionally establishing their role in government, Ivan IV ruthlessly crushed the boyar opposition with the use of the oprichnina terror purges. Land grants were also given to subjects that provided military service, and soon this type of land grant became the more common compared to inherited land among the boyars. Ivan IV consolidated his power, centralized royal power, and made every effort possible to curb the influence of the princes.\nAfter Ivan IV, a time of troubles began when his son Fedor died without an heir, ending the Rurik dynasty. The boyar Boris Godunov tried to proclaim himself tsar, but several boyar factions refused to recognize him. The chaos continued after the first False Dmitriy gained the throne, and civil war erupted. When the Romanovs took over, the seventeenth century became one filled with administrative reform. A comprehensive legal code was introduced, and a merging of the boyars into the elite bureaucracy was beginning to form.\nBy the end of the Time of Troubles, the boyars had lost nearly all independent power. Instead of going to Moscow to gain more power, the boyars felt defeated, and felt compelled to go to Moscow to maintain a united and strong Russia. Second, the boyars lost their independent principalities, where they maintained all their power, and instead governed districts and regions under the grand prince of the time. Boyars also lost their advisory influence over the grand prince with tools such as the duma, and instead the grand prince no longer felt compelled to listen to the demands of the boyars. The tsar no longer feared losing their military support, and unification of Muscovy became paramount in importance. With Peter the Great, the final nail in the coffin happened for the boyars' power, and they would never recover from his administrative reforms.\nPeter the Great, who took power in 1697, took it upon himself to westernize Russia, and catch it up with the modern world. After the revolt of the streltsy regiments in 1698, Peter the Great returned to Russia, forcing government officials and those that were financially able to have clean shaven faces and wear Western clothing. Peter also reformed the judicial system, and created a senate with members appointed by him, replacing the old council of boyars that originally advised the tsar. This move he made was one of many that dismantled the powers and status the boyars previously possessed.\nPeter was driving out the conservative and religious faction of the boyars out of the courts, and instead using both foreign and Russian officials to fill the administrative system. Several boyars, as well as other nobility, spoke out against these reforms, including historian Mikhail Shcherbatov, who stated that the reforms Peter made helped destroy Russian tradition, and created people that tried to \"worm their way up, by flattering and humoring the monarch and the grandees in every way.\" Still, the reforms continued, as by this point, the tsar possessed too much power, and Russia became an absolute monarchy more and more with each ruler.\nGalicia.\nThe Galician nobility originally were called boyars. With the annexation of Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as the result of the Galicia-Volhynia wars, local boyars were equated since 1430 in rights along with Polish nobility (szlachta). A great number of boyars fled to the lands of Great Duchy of Lithuania in Volhynia and Podolia.\nBoyars in Moldavia and Wallachia.\nIn the Carpathian regions inhabited by present day Romanians, the boyar () class emerged from the chiefs (named (\"leader\") or (\"judge\") in the areas north of the Danube, and south of the river) of rural communities in the early Middle Ages, who made their judicial and administrative attributions hereditary and gradually expanded them upon other communities. They were \"approved\" by the Ottoman Empire, which had suzerainty over the area. After the appearance of more advanced political structures in the area, their privileged status had to be confirmed by the central power, which used this prerogative to include in the boyar class individuals that distinguished themselves in the military or civilian functions they performed, by allocating them lands from the princely domains.\nHistorian Djuvara explained the hypotheses concerning the origin of the Romanians, such as advancing the theory that the vast majority of the nobility in the medieval states that made up the territory of modern-day Romania was of Cuman origin and not Romanian: \"Romanians were called the black Cumans\".\nThe boyar condition.\nThe Romanian social hierarchy was composed of boyar, (\"turkish: mazul\"), (\"yeoman, freedman\") and (\"serf\"). Being a boyar implied three things: being a land-owner, having serfs, and having a military and/or administrative function. A boyar could have a state function and/or a court function. These functions were called or . Only the prince had the power to assign a boierie. Landowners with serfs but no function were categorized as but were still considered to be of noble origin (, literally \"of boyar bone\"). Small landowners who possessed a domain without distinction () were called , while the serfs (indentured servants) were called .\nOrigin.\nAlthough functions could only be accorded by the prince and were not hereditary, land possession was hereditary. The prince could give land to somebody but could not take it from its possessor except for serious reasons such as treason. Therefore, there were two kinds of boyars: those whose families, as chiefs of the ancient rural communities, had held land before the formation of the feudal states, such that the prince merely confirmed their preexisting status as landowners; and those who acquired their domain from a princely donation or who had inherited it from an ancestor who acquired it through such a donation (\"cf.\" the distinction between \"Uradel\" and \"Briefadel\" in the Holy Roman Empire and in its feudal successor regimes). During the Phanariot r\u00e9gime, there were also boyars who had no land at all, but only a function. This way, the number of boyars could be increased, by selling functions to those who could afford them.\nHierarchy.\nThe close alliance between the boyar condition and the military-administrative functions led to a confusion, aggravated by the Phanariots: these functions began to be considered as noble titles, like in the Occident. In fact, this was not at all the case. Traditionally, the boyars were organized in three states: boyars of the first, second, and third states. For example, there was a first or a grand postelnic, a second postelnic, and a third postelnic, each one with his different obligations and rights.\nThe difference of condition was visible even in the vestimentation or physical aspect. Only the boyars of the first state had the right, for example, to grow a beard, the rest being entitled only to a mustache. Within the class of the boyars of the first state, there was the subclass of the \"grand boyars\". Those were great landowners who also had some very high functions, such as the function of great vornic. Above those grand boyars was only the prince.\nThe prince.\nUsually a prince was a boyar before his election or appointment as prince, but this was not an absolute condition. Initially, only princely descendants could be elected princes. During the Phanariot epoch, however, any man could be a prince if appointed by the sultan, and rich enough to buy this appointment from the grand vizier. During the Ottoman suzerainty, and especially during the Phanariot r\u00e9gime, the title of Prince became an administrative function within the imperial Ottoman hierarchy, and thus the ultimate form of boyardness. The title of Prince of Wallachia or Moldavia was equivalent in dignity to that of a Pasha with two horse-tails.\nCultural references.\nNorwegian composer Johan Halvorsen wrote a march entitled \"Bojarenes inntogsmarsj\" (\"Entry March of the Boyars\"), known in Norway as the signal tune for the radio programme \"\u00d8nskekonserten\". Edvard Grieg arranged it for solo piano. August Strindberg requests that this piece be played during his play \"The Dance of Death, Part One\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Topographically, it is predominantly located on the Iranian/Persian plateau. Its mountains have impacted both the political and the economic history of the country for several centuries. The mountains enclose several broad basins, on which major agricultural and urban settlements are located. Until the 20th century, when major highways and railroads were constructed through the mountains to connect the population centers, these basins tended to be relatively isolated from one another.\nTypically, one major town has dominated each basin, and there were complex economic relationships between the town and the hundreds of villages that surrounded it. In the higher elevations of the mountains rimming the basins, tribally organized groups practiced transhumance, moving with their herds of sheep and goats between traditionally established summer and winter pastures. There are no major river systems in the country, and historically transportation was by means of caravans that followed routes traversing gaps and passes in the mountains. The mountains also impeded easy access to the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea.\nWith an area of , Iran ranks seventeenth in size among the countries of the world. Iran shares its northern borders with several post-Soviet states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. These borders extend for more than , including nearly of water along the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. Iran's western borders are with Turkey in the north and Iraq in the south, terminating at the Arvand Rud.\nThe Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman littorals form the entire southern border. To the east lie Afghanistan on the north and Pakistan on the far south. Iran's diagonal distance from Azerbaijan in the northwest to Sistan and Baluchestan province in the southeast is approximately .\nTopography.\nThe topography of Iran consists of rugged, mountainous rims surrounding high interior basins. The main mountain chain is the Zagros Mountains, a series of parallel ridges interspersed with plains that bisect the country from northwest to southeast. Many peaks in the Zagros exceed above sea level, and in the south-central region of the country there are at least five peaks that are over .\nAs the Zagros continue into southeastern Iran, the average elevation of the peaks declines dramatically to under . Rimming the Caspian Sea littoral is another chain of mountains, the narrow but high Alborz Mountains. Volcanic Mount Damavand, , located in the center of the Alborz, is not only the country's highest peak but also the second highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush, after Mount Elbrus.\nThe center of Iran consists of several closed basins that collectively are referred to as the Central Plateau. The average elevation of this plateau is about , but several of the mountains that tower over the plateau exceed . The eastern part of the plateau is covered by two salt deserts, the Dasht-e Kavir (Great Salt Desert) and the Dasht-e Lut. Except for some scattered oases, these deserts are uninhabited.\nParts of northwestern Iran are part of the Armenian highlands, which adjoins it topographically with other parts of neighbouring Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.\nIran has only two expanses of lowlands: the Khuzestan Plain in the southwest and the Caspian Sea coastal plain in the north. The former is a roughly triangular-shaped extension of the Mesopotamia plain and averages about in width. It extends for about inland, barely rising a few meters above sea level, then meets abruptly with the first foothills of the Zagros. Much of the Khuzestan plain is covered with marshes.\nThe Caspian plain is both longer and narrower. It extends for some along the Caspian shore, but its widest point is less than , while at some places less than separate the shore from the Alborz foothills. The Persian Gulf coast south of Khuzestan and the Gulf of Oman coast have no real plains because the Zagros in these areas come right down to the shore.\nThere are no major rivers in the country. Of the small rivers and streams, the only one that is navigable is the -long Karun, which shallow-draft boats can negotiate from Khorramshahr to Ahvaz, a distance of about . Other notable rivers include the Karkheh, spanning and joining the Tigris; and the Zayandeh River, which is long. Several other permanent rivers and streams also drain into the Persian Gulf, while a number of small rivers that originate in the northwestern Zagros or Alborz drain into the Caspian Sea.\nOn the Central Plateau, numerous rivers\u2014most of which have dry beds for the greater part of the year\u2014form from snow melting in the mountains during the spring and flow through permanent channels, draining eventually into salt lakes that also tend to dry up during the summer months. There is a permanent salt lake, Lake Urmia (the traditional name, also cited as Lake Urmiyeh, to which it has reverted after being called Lake Rezaiyeh under Mohammad Reza Shah), in the northwest, whose brine content is too high to support fish or most other forms of aquatic life. There are also several connected salt lakes along the Iran-Afghanistan border in the province of Baluchestan va Sistan.\nIran's highlands are home to some of the world's most unexpected glaciers. Their appearance in the dry environment is advantageous for those who depend on glacial ice as a supply of fresh water. In an expedition, Klaus Thymann together with the environmental charity Project Pressure produced a series of archive and expedition photographs that depict the urgency of the situation surrounding climate change and the individuals who rely on such natural ice forms to sustain life in remote areas.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,481\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Iran, making it the 22nd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.\nClimate.\nIran has a diverse climate. In the northwest, winters are cold with heavy snowfalls and sub-freezing temperatures. Spring and fall are relatively mild, while summers are dry and hot. In the south, winters are mild and summers are very hot, with average daily maximum temperature exceeding in the month of July. On the Khuzestan Plain, summer heat is accompanied by high humidity.\nIn general, Iran has a temperate climate in which most of the relatively scant annual precipitation falls from October through April. In most of the country, yearly precipitation averages or less. The major exceptions are the higher mountain valleys of the Zagros and the Caspian coastal plain, where precipitation averages at least and is in the form of snow at high altitudes. In the western part of the Caspian, rainfall exceeds annually and is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year. This contrasts with some basins of the Central Plateau that receive or less of precipitation. Iran is considered colder than neighboring countries such as Iraq and Turkmenistan, due to its higher elevation.\nFlora and fauna.\n7% of the country is forested. The most extensive growths are found on the mountain slopes rising from the Caspian Sea, with stands of oak, ash, elm, cypress, and other valuable trees. On the plateau proper, areas of scrub oak appear on the best-watered mountain slopes, and villagers cultivate orchards and grow the plane tree, poplar, willow, walnut, beech, maple, and mulberry. Wild plants and shrubs spring from the barren land in the spring and afford pasturage, but the summer sun burns them away. According to FAO reports, the major types of forests that exist in Iran and their respective areas are:\nWildlife of Iran is diverse and composed of several animal species including bears, gazelles, wild pigs, wolves, jackals, panthers, Eurasian lynx, and foxes. Domestic animals include, sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, eagles and falcon are also native to Iran.\nAs of 2001, 20 of Iran's mammal species and 14 bird species are endangered. Among them are the Baluchistan bear (\"Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus\"), a subspecies of Asian black bear, Persian fallow deer, Siberian crane, hawksbill turtle, green turtle, Oxus cobra, Latifi's viper, dugong and dolphins. The Asiatic cheetah is a critically endangered species which is extinct elsewhere and now can only be found in central to northeastern parts of Iran.\nIran lost all its Asiatic lions and Caspian tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century. The Syrian wild ass has become extinct. Syrian brown bears in the mountains, wild sheep and goats, gazelles, Persian onagers, wild pigs, Persian leopards, and foxes abound. Domestic animals include sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, and falcon are native to Iran.\nThe Persian leopard is said to be the largest of all the subspecies of leopards in the world. The main range of this species in Iran closely overlaps with that of bezoar ibex. Hence, it is found throughout Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges, as well as smaller ranges within the Iranian plateau. The leopard population is very sparse, due to loss of habitat, loss of natural prey, and population fragmentation. Apart from bezoar ibex, wild sheep, boar, deer, (either Caspian red deer or roe deer), and domestic animals constitute leopards' diet in Iran.\nEcosystem and biosphere.\nIran's bio-diversity ranks 13th in the world. There are 272 conservation areas around Iran for a total of 17\u00a0million hectares under the supervision of the Department of Environment (Iran), variously named national parks, protected areas, and natural wildlife refuges, all meant to protect the genetic resources of the country. There are only 2,617 rangers and 430 environmental monitoring units engaged in protecting these vast areas, which amounts to 6,500 hectares to cover for each ranger.\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural hazards:\nperiodic droughts, floods; dust storms, sandstorms; earthquakes along western border and in the northeast\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues:\nair pollution, especially in urban areas, from vehicle emissions, refinery operations, and industrial effluents; deforestation; desertification; oil pollution in the Persian Gulf; wetland losses from drought; soil degradation (salination); inadequate supplies of potable water in some areas; water pollution from raw sewage and industrial waste; urbanization.\nResources and land use.\nNatural resources:\npetroleum, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, manganese, zinc, sulfur\n\"arable land:\"\n10.87%\n\"permanent crops:\"\n1.19%\n\"other:\"\n87.93% (2012 est.)\nIrrigated land:\n (2009)\nTotal renewable water resources:\n137\u00a0km3 (2011)\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\n\"total:\" 93.3\u00a0km3/yr (7%/1%/92%)\n\"per capita:\" 1,306 m3/yr (2004)\n*total: \n**\"country rank in the world:\" 17th\n*land: \n*water: \n* Australia comparative: slightly smaller than Queensland\n* Canada comparative: slightly larger than Quebec\n* United States comparative: slightly larger than Alaska\n* EU comparative: slightly more than three times the size of Metropolitan France\n*total:\n**border countries: Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan-proper , Azerbaijan-Nakhchivan exclave , Iraq , Pakistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan .\n*Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan\n** note: Iran also borders the Caspian Sea, for \n* territorial sea: \n* contiguous zone: \n* exclusive economic zone: with bilateral agreements, or median lines in the Persian Gulf\n* continental shelf: natural prolongation\n* lowest point: Caspian Sea \n* highest point: Mount Damavand \nInternational territorial disputes.\nIran is currently engaged in international territorial disputes with several neighbouring countries.\nThe country protests Afghanistan's limiting flow of dammed tributaries to the Helmand River in periods of drought. The lack of a maritime boundary in the Persian Gulf with Iraq also prompts jurisdictional disputes beyond the mouth of the Arvand Rud. Iran and the United Arab Emirates have a territorial dispute over the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa islands, which are administered by Iran. Iran currently insists on dividing the Caspian Sea resources equally among the five littoral states, after the Russian-backed former soviet breakaway republics refused to respect the 50-50 agreements between Iran and the Soviet Union (despite their international obligation). Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan continue to claim territorial waters thus regarding the Caspian Sea as open international body of water, dismissing its geographically lake nature.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of November\u00a02024[ [update]], Iran's population is around 91.5 million. In recent years, however, Iran's birth rate has dropped significantly. Studies project that Iran's rate of population growth will continue to slow until it stabilises above 100 million by 2050. Half of Iran's population was under 35 years old in 2012. As of January 2025, the average age of the Iranian population is 32 years.\nIn 2009, the number of households stood at 15.3 million (4.8 persons per household). Families earn some 11.8\u00a0million rials (about $960) per month on average (2012).\nAccording to the OECD/World Bank statistics population growth in Iran from 1990 to 2008 was 17.6\u00a0million and 32%. The literacy rate was 80% in 2002, and 85% in 2016. The fertility rate has fallen to 1.44, below the natural replacement rate of 2.1.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2016 population census the population of Iran was 79.9\u00a0million, a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986, an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.2% between 2011 and 2016.\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2020) (Data refer to the Iranian Year which begins on 21 March and ends on 20 March of the following year.):\nTable 9 \u2013 Population and Average Annual Growth by Provinces: 2006 and 2011\n1 The population of the provinces of Alborz and Tehran for 2006 and their average annual growth have been calculated based on the data of 2011.\nUnofficial Translation 17\nTable 10 \u2013 Population Percentages by Province: 2006 and 2011 (Percentage)\n1 The population of the provinces of Alborz and Tehran for 2006 and their average annual growth have been calculated based on the data of 2011.\nUrban population.\nIn addition to its international migration pattern, Iran also exhibits one of the steepest urban growth rates in the world according to the UN humanitarian information unit. According to 2015 population estimates, approximately 73.4 per cent of Iran's population lives in urban areas, up from 27 per cent in 1950.\nThe following is a list of the eight most populous cities in the country:\nVital statistics.\nUN estimates.\n(2022 estimates).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n1 per 10002 TFR = number of children per woman3 per 1000 births\nRegistered births and deaths.\nNote that registrations may be by year of registration and not by year of occurrence.

In 2021, the rate had fallen to 1.7 children per woman. According to a study through the Australian National University, there are both micro and macro factors affecting the fertility rate in Iran, including education, economics, and culture. Micro-factors can include family income levels and individual choices, while macro-factors can include the country's economy, education, and shifting cultural values. The cross-sectional cohort study examined four provinces in Iran (Gilan, Sistan &amp; Baluchistan, West Azerbaijan, and Yazd) and found that trends show that women in all four provinces are choosing to have fewer children compared to the women born in the earlier cohorts. The majority of women agreed with statements such as \"having many children is an obstacle for the parents' interests\" and \"having many children creates financial pressure for the family\" (among others). Other sources also suggest that delayed marriage and a tendency to limit fertility are factors affecting the decline of TFR. A decline in TFR can lead to population decrease, and an ageing population, which can negatively impact the country's economy. In response, Iranian policymakers have attempted to limit these factors by restricting access to contraceptives and surgeries that reduce fertility.\nLife expectancy.\nSex ratio\n \"at birth:\" 1.05 male(s)/female\n \"0-14 years:\" 1.05 male(s)/female\n \"15-24 years:\" 1.05 male(s)/female\n \"25-54 years:\" 1.04 male(s)/female\n \"55-64 years:\" 0.96 male(s)/female\n \"65 years and over:\" 0.87 male(s)/female\n \"total population:\" 1.03 male(s)/female (2020 est.)\nLife expectancy at birth\n \"total population:\" 75.06 years\n \"male:\" 73.71 years\n \"female:\" 76.48 years (2021 est.)\nEthnic groups.\nIran is a mosaic of diverse ethnic groups, contrary to popular belief that all Iranians are \"just Persian\".\nAccording to a 1939 survey and Anthropological study of the people of Iran,209 these were the ethnic groups that resided in the following areas of Iran:\nGenetics.\nHaplogroups.\nY-chromosome DNA.\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, the Iranian Y-chromosome pool is as follows where haplogroups, R1 (25%), J2 (23%) G (14%), J1 (8%) E1b1b (5%), L (4%),\nQ (4%), comprise more than 85% of the total chromosomes.\nMitochondrial DNA.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents the female lineage. West Eurasian mtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).\nAmong them, U3b3 lineages appear to be restricted to populations of Iran and the Caucasus, while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole Near East region.\nIn Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted of the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaks and Mazandarani's, whose genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicities, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's. Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1\u20132% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.\nLevels of genetic variation in Iranian populations are comparable to the other groups from the Caucasus, Anatolia and Europe.\nAutosomal DNA.\nA large-scale genetic analyses on various ethnic groups of Iran, published in 2019, found that genetically speaking different Iranian ethnic groups, such as Persians, Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Lurs, Mazanderanis, Gilaks and Arabs, cluster tightly together, forming a single cluster known as the \"CIC\" (Central Iranian cluster). Compared with worldwide populations, Iranians (CIC) cluster in the center of the wider West Eurasian cluster, close to Europeans, Middle Easterners, and South-Central Asians. Iranian Arabs and Turkic-speaking Azeris genetically overlap with Iranian-speaking peoples such as Persians. The genetic substructure of Iranians was found to be low, compared with other \"1000G\" populations. Iranians display their highest genetic affinity with other Southwest and West Asian populations, followed by Europeans and Central Asian groups. Certain South Asians (specifically the Parsi minority) showed the highest affinity with Iranians, inline with their ethnic history. Overall, the study results suggest that the genetic makeup of the Iranian gene pool formed already about 5,000 years ago and shows high continuity since then, suggesting that they were largely unaffected by migration events from outside groups. On a global scale, Iranians display their highest affinity with other \"West Eurasian\" populations (such as Europeans or South Asians, but also Latin Americans), while Sub-Saharan Africans and East Asians showed large degrees of differentiation with Iranians.\nLanguages and ethnic groups.\nThe largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Luri, Talysh, and Balochi. Speakers of Turkic languages, most notably Azerbaijani Turkish spoken by Azerbaijanis, which is by far the second-most spoken language in the country, but also the Turkmen, and the Qashqai peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Assyrian. A small number of Mandaeans in Khuzestan speak Mandaic. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as Armenian and Russian; also, Georgian (a member of the Kartvelian language family) is spoken in a large pocket only by those Iranian Georgians that live in Fereydan, Fereydunshahr. Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran province and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language.\nThe Circassians in Iran, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.\nJews have had a continuous presence in Iran since the time of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. In 1948, there were approximately 140,000\u2013150,000 Jews living in Iran. According to the Tehran Jewish Committee, the Jewish population of Iran was (more recently) estimated at 25,000 to 35,000, of which approximately 15,000 are in Tehran with the rest residing in Hamadan, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Yazd, Kerman, Rafsanjan, Borujerd, Sanandaj, Tabriz, and Urmia. However, the official 2011 state census recorded only 8,756 Jews in Iran.\nThe CIA World Factbook (which is based on 2013 statistics) gives the following numbers for the languages spoken in Iran today: Persian, Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani 66%; Turkish and other Turkic languages 18%; Kurdish 10%; Arabic 2%; Balochi 2%; others 2% (Armenian, Georgian, Circassian, Assyrian, etc.).\nAccording to anthropologist Brian Spooner, around half of Iran's population uses a language other than Persian at home and in informal public situations.\nOther sources, such as the Library of Congress, and the Encyclopedia of Islam (Leiden) give Iran's ethnic groups as following: Persians 65%, Azerbaijani Turks 16%, Kurds 7%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Baloch 2%, Turkmens 1%, Turkic tribal groups (e.g. Qashqai) 1%, and non-Persian, non-Turkic groups (e.g. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians) less than 1%. For sources prior to and after 2000, see Languages and ethnicities in Iran.\nReligious affiliations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAbout 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the Shi'a branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the Sunni branch, which predominates in neighbouring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, Mandaeans, and Yarsan. By far the largest group of Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has 41,385 adherents as of 2016 census. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognised (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted since its inception in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment. Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000, and 70,000. The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.\nMigration.\nRecent immigration.\nMost of the large Circassian migrational waves towards mainland Iran stem from the Safavid and Qajar era; however, a certain amount also stem from the relatively recent arrivals that migrated as the Circassians were displaced from the Caucasus in the 19th century. A Black African population exists due to historical slavery.\nA substantial number of Russians arrived in the early 20th century as refugees from the Russian Revolution, but their number has dwindled following the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian Revolution.\nIn the 20th to 21st centuries, there has been limited immigration to Iran from Turkey, Iraq (especially huge numbers during the 1970s known as Moaveds), Afghanistan (mostly arriving as refugees in 1978), Lebanon (especially in Qom, though a Lebanese community has been present in the nation for centuries),\nIndia (mostly arriving temporarily during the 1950s to 1970s, typically working as doctors, engineers, and teachers), Korea (mostly in the 1970s as labour migrants), China (mostly since the 2000s working in engineering or business projects), and Pakistan, partly due to labour migrants and partly to Balochi ties across the Iranian-Pakistani border.\nAbout 200,000 Iraqis arrived as refugees in 2003, mostly living in refugee camps near the border; an unknown number of these has since returned to Iraq.\nAs of 2025, around 400,000 authorized foreigners were working in Iran, most of whom were Afghan nationals.\nOver the same period, there has also been substantial emigration from Iran, especially since the Iranian revolution (see Iranian diaspora, Human capital flight from Iran, Jewish exodus from Iran), especially\nto the United States, Canada, Germany, Israel, and Sweden.\nRefugee population.\nIran hosts one of the largest refugee population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan (80%) and Iraq (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation. Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1\u00a0billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150\u00a0million on those in Iran. In 1999, the Iranian government estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10\u00a0million per day, compared with the US$18\u00a0million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999. As of 2016, some 300,000 work permits have been issued for foreign nationals in Iran.\nEmigration.\nThe term \"Iranian citizens abroad\" or \" Iranian/Persian diaspora\" refers to the Iranian people and their children born in Iran but living outside of Iran. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than two billion dollars home in 2006.\nAs of 2010, there are about four to five million Iranians living abroad, mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe, Persian Gulf States, Turkey, Australia and the broader Middle East. According to the 2000 Census and other independent surveys, there are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the U.S., in particular, the Los Angeles area is estimated to be host to approximately 72,000 Iranians, earning the Westwood area of LA the nickname Tehrangeles. Other metropolises that have large Iranian populations include Dubai with 300,000 Iranians, Vancouver, London, Toronto, San Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C., Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt. Their combined net worth is estimated to be $1.3\u00a0trillion.\nNote that this differs from the other Iranian peoples living in other areas of Greater Iran, who are of related ethnolinguistical family, speaking languages belonging to the Iranian languages which is a branch of Indo-European languages.\nPeople of Iranian ancestry.\nTats (Caucasus).\nThe Tats are an Iranian people, presently living within Azerbaijan and Russia (mainly Southern Dagestan). The Tats are part of the indigenous peoples of Iranian origin in the Caucasus.\nTats use the Tat language, a southwestern Iranian language and a variety of Persian Azerbaijani and Russian are also spoken. Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a significant Sunni Muslim minority. Likely the ancestors of modern Tats settled in South Caucasus when the Sassanid Empire from the 3rd to 7th centuries built cities and founded military garrisons to strengthen their positions in this region.\nParsis.\nThe Parsis are the close-knit Zoroastrian community based primarily in India but also found in Pakistan. Parsis are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago. Indian census data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai. There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of Karachi and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000.\nIranis.\nIn Pakistan and India, the term \"Irani\" has come to denote Iranian Zoroastrians who have migrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most Parsis who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them moved during the Qajar era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran. Unlike the Parsis, they speak a Dari dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in Yazd and Kerman. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day Mumbai while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day Karachi. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses. Some, such as Ardeshir Irani, have also become very famous in cinema.\nAjam (Bahrain).\nThe \"Ajam\" are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of Manama and Muharraq. The Iranians who adhere to Shiite sect of Islam are Ajam, and they are different from the Huwala. Ajams are also a large percentage of the populace in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.\nIn addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the Safavid rule of Bahrain (1501\u20131722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.\nHuwala.\nHuwala are the descendants of Persians and Arab-Persians who belong to the Sunni sect of Islam. Huwala migrated from Ahvaz in Iran to the Persian Gulf in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
