Its composition and powers are set out in Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia.\nThe term of members of the House of Representatives is a maximum of three years from the date of the first sitting of the House, but on only one occasion since Federation has the maximum term been reached. The House is almost always dissolved earlier, usually alone but sometimes in a double dissolution alongside the whole Senate. Elections for members of the House of Representatives have always been held in conjunction with those for the Senate since the 1970s. \nA member of the House may be referred to as a \"Member of Parliament\" (\"MP\" or \"Member\"), while a member of the Senate is usually referred to as a \"senator\". Under the conventions of the Westminster system, the government of the day and the prime minister must achieve and maintain the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power.\nThe House of Representatives currently consists of 150 members, elected by and representing single member districts known as electoral divisions (commonly referred to as \"electorates\" or \"seats\"). The number of members is not fixed but can vary with boundary changes resulting from electoral redistributions, which are required on a regular basis. Prior to the 1984 election, the number of members increased from 125 to 148. It was reduced to 147 for the 1993 election, returned to 148 for the 1996 election, increased to 150 for the 2001 election, and stood at 151 for the 2022 Australian federal election. The 2025 election saw 150 seats contested.\nThe House of Representatives chamber is designed to seat up to 172 members, with provision for an ultimate total of 240 to be accommodated.\nEach division elects one member using full-preferential voting. This voting system was put in place after the 1918 Swan by-election, which Labor unexpectedly won when two conservative parties of that era split a substantially larger conservative (and anti-Labor) vote between themselves. The Nationalist government of the time changed the lower house voting system from first-past-the-post to full-preferential voting, effective from the 1919 general election.\nOrigins and role.\nThe Constitution of Australia of 1900 established the House of Representatives in a newly federated Australia. The House is presided over by the speaker. Members of the House are elected from single member electorates (geographic districts, commonly referred to as \"seats\" but officially known as \"Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives\").\nOne vote, one value legislation requires all electorates within each state to have approximately the same number of voters. In 2022 there was an average of just over 117,000 electors per seat. However, the baseline quota for the number of voters in an electorate is determined by the number of voters in the state in which that electorate is found. The electorates of the smallest states and territories tend to have more variation from the mean in terms of numbers of electors. Each state is guaranteed a minimum of five seats in the Constitution, which has the effect of granting Tasmania more seats than they would otherwise be entitled to due to their population size. Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution. Full preferential voting is used in elections. A full allocation of preferences is required for a vote to be considered formal. This allows for a calculation of the two-party-preferred vote.\nUnder section 24 of the Constitution, each state is entitled to members based on a population quota determined from the \"latest statistics of the Commonwealth\". These statistics arise from the census conducted under the auspices of section 51(xi). Until its repeal by the 1967 referendum, section 127 prohibited the inclusion of Aboriginal people in section 24 determinations as including the Indigenous peoples could alter the distribution of seats between the states to the benefit of states with larger Aboriginal populations.\nThe total number of seats representing states in the House of Representatives must be \"as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators\", according to section 24 of the Constitution. This requirement is known as the \"nexus provision\". This requirement was included in the Constitution in order to maintain the power of the Senate relative to the House of Representative: both due to the belief by the drafters of the Constitution that a numerically weaker Senate would inherently lead to a lower \"influence, prestige, and dignity\" and to ensure the influence of the Senate in case of a joint sitting after a double dissolution. Another reason was to make it harder politically for the House of Representatives to be increased, thereby maintaining the smaller states over representation in the lower house due to their constitutional minimum of five seats. The requirements for territory seats are set via legislation, which currently requires that the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have at least one member each.\nAccording to the Australian Constitution, the powers of both Houses are nearly equal, with the consent of both Houses needed to pass legislation. The difference mostly relates to taxation legislation. In practice, by convention, the person who can control a majority of votes in the lower house is invited by the governor-general to form the government. The leader of that party (or coalition of parties) becomes the prime minister, who then can nominate other elected members of the government party in both the House and the Senate to become ministers responsible for various portfolios and administer government departments. \nBills appropriating money (supply bills) can only be introduced or amended in the lower house and thus only the party with a majority in the lower house can govern. In the current Australian party system, virtually all contentious votes are along party lines, with relatively few members crossing the floor to vote against their party's position; thus the party able to form government usually has a majority and is able to reliably win votes in the lower house.\nThe opposition party's main roles in the House are to present arguments against the government's policies and legislation where appropriate, and to attempt to hold the government accountable as much as possible by asking questions of ministers during question time and during debates on motions and legislation. \nThe preferential voting system of the lower house has resulted in a single party or coalition almost always having a majority of seats in the chamber. After the first decade of Federation, the only time when this did not occur was following the 1940 and 2010 elections. By contrast, the only period in recent times during which the government of the day has had a majority in the Senate was from July 2005 (when the senators elected at the 2004 election took their seats) to July 2008 (when the senators elected at the 2007 election took their seats). Hence, results of votes in the Senate are usually more contested and closely watched. \nIn a reflection of the United Kingdom House of Commons, the predominant colour of the furnishings in the House of Representatives is green. However, the colour was lightened and given a uniquely Australian cast in the new Parliament House (opened 1988), suggesting the colour of eucalyptus tree leaves. Also, unlike the House of Commons, the seating arrangement of the crossbench is horse-shoe shaped, a hybrid of oppositional arrangements of the House of Commons and hemicycle arrangements preferred by legislatures of in Europe and the United States.\nAustralian parliaments are notoriously rowdy, with MPs often trading colourful insults. As a result, the speaker frequently has to use the disciplinary powers vested in them under standing orders.\nSince 2015, Australian Federal Police officers armed with assault rifles have been present in both chambers of the federal Parliament.\nElectoral system.\nFrom the beginning of Federation until 1918, first-past-the-post voting was used in order to elect members of the House of Representatives but since the 1918 Swan by-election which Labor unexpectedly won with the largest primary vote due to vote splitting amongst the conservative parties, the Nationalist Party government, a predecessor of the modern-day Liberal Party of Australia, changed the lower house voting system to full preferential voting, as of the subsequent 1919 election. This system has remained in place ever since, allowing the Coalition parties to safely contest the same seats. Full-preference preferential voting re-elected the Hawke government at the 1990 election, the first time in federal history that Labor had obtained a net benefit from preferential voting.\nFrom 1949 onwards, the vast majority of electorates, nearly 90%, are won by the candidate leading on first preferences, giving the same result as if the same votes had been counted using first-past-the-post voting. The highest proportion of seats (up to 2010) won by the candidate not leading on first preferences was the 1972 federal election, with 14 of 125 seats not won by the plurality candidate.\nAllocation process for the House of Representatives.\nThe main elements of the operation of preferential voting for single-member House of Representatives divisions are as follows:\nFollowing the full allocation of preferences, it is possible to derive a two-party-preferred figure, where the votes have been allocated between the two main candidates in the election. In Australia, this is usually between the candidates from the Coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party.\nRelationship with the government.\nUnder the Constitution, the governor-general has the power to appoint and dismiss the \"Queen's [or King's] Ministers of State\" who administer government departments. In practice, the governor-general chooses ministers in accordance with the traditions of the Westminster system that the government be drawn from the party or coalition of parties that has a majority in the House of Representatives, with the leader of the largest party becoming prime minister.\nA sub-set of the most important ministers then meet in a council known as Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and are frequently held to discuss vital issues and make policy decisions. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia's highest formal executive body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. A senior Cabinet member holds the office of vice-president of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the governor-general. The Federal Executive Council is the Australian equivalent of the executive councils and privy councils in other Commonwealth realms such as the King's Privy Council for Canada and the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.\nA minister must be a senator or member of the House of Representatives at the time of their appointment, or become one within three months of their appointment. This provision was included in the Constitution (section 64) to enable the inaugural ministry, led by Edmund Barton, to be appointed on 1 January 1901, even though the first federal elections were not scheduled to be held until 29 and 30 March.\nThe provision was also used after the disappearance and presumed death of the Liberal prime minister Harold Holt in December 1967. The Liberal Party elected John Gorton, then a senator, as its new leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 10 January 1968 (following an interim ministry led by John McEwen). On 1 February, Gorton resigned from the Senate to stand for the 24 February by-election in Holt's former House of Representatives electorate of Higgins due to the convention that the prime minister be a member of the lower house. For 22 days (2 to 23 February inclusive) he was prime minister while a member of neither house of parliament.\nOn a number of occasions when ministers have retired from their seats prior to an election, or stood but lost their own seats in the election, they have retained their ministerial offices until the next government is sworn in.\nCommittees.\nIn addition to the work of the main chamber, the House of Representatives also has a large number of committees which deal with matters referred to them by the main House. They provide the opportunity for all MPs to ask questions of ministers and public officials as well as conduct inquiries, examine policy and legislation. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the government to consider.\nThe ability of the chambers of Parliament to establish committees is given in section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, \"The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.\"Parliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in contempt of parliament. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt. These include refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt. Other powers include, the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.\nProceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament, they are recorded by Hansard, except for private hearings, and also operate under parliamentary privilege. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, are protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.\nTypes of committees include:\nStanding committees, which are established on a permanent basis and are responsible for scrutinising bills and topics referred to them by the chamber; examining the government's budget and activities and for examining departmental annual reports and activities.\nSelect committees, which are temporary committees, established in order to deal with particular issues.\nDomestic committees, which are responsible for administering aspects of the House's own affairs. These include the Selection Committee that determines how the House will deal with particular pieces of legislation and private members business and the Privileges Committee that deals with matters of parliamentary privilege.\nLegislative scrutiny committees, which examine legislation and regulations to determine their impact on individual rights and accountability.\nJoint committees are also established to include both members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nFederation Chamber.\nThe Federation Chamber is a second debating chamber that considers relatively uncontroversial matters referred by the House. The Federation Chamber cannot, however, initiate or make a final decision on any parliamentary business, although it can perform all tasks in between.\nThe Federation Chamber was created in 1994 as the Main Committee, to relieve some of the burden of the House: different matters can be processed in the House at large and in the Federation Chamber, as they sit simultaneously. It is designed to be less formal, with a quorum of only three members: the deputy speaker of the House, one government member, and one non-government member. Decisions must be unanimous: any divided decision sends the question back to the House at large.\nThe Federation Chamber was created through the House's standing orders: it is thus a subordinate body of the House, and can only be in session while the House itself is in session. When a division vote in the House occurs, members in the Federation Chamber must return to the House to vote.\nThe Federation Chamber is housed in one of the House's committee rooms; the room is customised for this purpose and is laid out to resemble the House chamber.\nDue to the unique role of what was then called the Main Committee, proposals were made to rename the body to avoid confusion with other parliamentary committees, including \"Second Chamber\" and \"Federation Chamber\". The House of Representatives later adopted the latter proposal.\nThe concept of a parallel body to expedite Parliamentary business, based on the Australian Federation Chamber, was mentioned in a 1998 British House of Commons report, which led to the creation of that body's parallel chamber Westminster Hall.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1650 the family moved to Passenheim (Pasym) and there witnessed the brutality and horrors of the Tatar attacks, fighting for the Kingdom of Poland, in southern Prussia. His life was saved by his teacher, who shoved him out the window. Numerous villages in the region were destroyed, but Hartknoch made it to the ducal capital of K\u00f6nigsberg.\nIn K\u00f6nigsberg Hartknoch started studying theology at a Protestant institute. Soon after his parents died and he had to take on jobs. He became a private teacher in Kaunas and then a rector in the Protestant school in Vilnius. He soon returned to K\u00f6nigsberg where books and records interested him in history.\nIn 1679 Hartknoch published a book about Prussian history, \"Old and New Prussia\", first in Latin and then in German, as well as a history of the church in Prussia. The works are accompanied by descriptions and illustrations of people, history, and culture, as well as copper etching illustrations of towns. He received ethnographical information from the priest Matth\u00e4us Pr\u00e4torius.\nHartknoch's work in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kaunas, and Vilnius awoke his interest in their history.

He was Professor of Security Engineering at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge where he was part of the University's security group.\nEducation.\nAnderson was educated at the High School of Glasgow. After leaving school he attended Glasgow University and studied Natural Philosophy. He did not complete his studies there and moved to Cambridge. In 1978, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and natural science from the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Trinity College, Cambridge, and subsequently received a qualification in computer engineering. Anderson worked in the avionics and banking industry before moving back to the University of Cambridge in 1992, to work on his doctorate under the supervision of Roger Needham and start his career as an academic researcher. He received his PhD in 1995.\nResearch and career.\nAnderson was appointed a lecturer at Cambridge in 1995. In addition to teaching at the University of Cambridge, he also taught at the University of Edinburgh.\nAnderson's research interests were in security, cryptology, dependability and technology policy. In cryptography, he designed with Eli Biham the BEAR, LION and Tiger cryptographic primitives, and co-wrote with Biham and Lars Knudsen the block cipher Serpent, one of the finalists in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. He also discovered weaknesses in the FISH cipher and designed the stream cipher Pike.\nAnderson always campaigned for computer security to be studied in a wider social context. Many of his writings emphasised the human, social, and political dimension of security. On online voting, for example, he wrote \"When you move from voting in person to voting at home (whether by post, by phone or over the Internet) it vastly expands the scope for vote buying and coercion\", making the point that it's not just a question of whether the encryption can be cracked.\nIn 1998, Anderson founded the Foundation for Information Policy Research, a think tank and lobbying group on information-technology policy.\nAnderson was also a founder of the UK-Crypto mailing list and the economics of security research domain.\nAnderson was well known among Cambridge academics as an outspoken defender of academic freedoms, intellectual property and other matters of university politics. He was engaged in the \"Campaign for Cambridge Freedoms\" and had been an elected member of Cambridge University Council since 2002. In January 2004, the student newspaper \"Varsity\" declared Anderson to be Cambridge University's \"most powerful person\".\nIn 2002, he became an outspoken critic of trusted computing proposals, in particular Microsoft's Palladium operating system vision.\nAnderson's TCPA FAQ has been characterised by IBM TC researcher David R. Safford as \"full of technical errors\" and of \"presenting speculation as fact.\"\nFor years Anderson argued that by their nature large databases will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. He said that if a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use. This is sometimes known as \"Anderson's Rule\".\nAnderson was the author of several editions of \"Security Engineering\", which was initially published by Wiley in 2001. He was the founder and editor of \"Computer and Communications Security Reviews\".\nAfter the vast global surveillance disclosures leaked by Edward Snowden beginning in June 2013, Anderson suggested one way to begin stamping out the British state's unaccountable involvement in this NSA spying scandal was to entirely end the domestic secret services. Anderson: \"Were I a legislator, I would simply abolish MI5\". Anderson noted the only way this kind of systemic data collection was made possible was through the business models of private industry. The value of information-driven Web companies such as Facebook and Google is built around their ability to gather vast tracts of data. It was something the intelligence agencies would have struggled with alone.\nAnderson was a critic of smart meters, writing that there are various privacy and energy security concerns.\nAwards and honours.\nAnderson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2009. His nomination reads:\nAnderson was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 2009. He was a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge and awarded the BCS Lovelace Medal in 2015. Anderson was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2023.\nPersonal life and death.\nAnderson met his wife, Shireen, while he was working in Johannesburg and they were married in Cambridge in 1992. Shireen Anderson is the coordinator of the Christina Kelly Association, of Churchill College, Cambridge. They have one daughter, Bavani, and four grandchildren.\nAnderson died unexpectedly at home with his family in Cambridge on 28 March 2024, at the age of 67.\n\"Security Engineering\".\nBy agreement with the publisher https://, the third edition of Ross Anderson's book \"Security Engineering\" was made available for download at the Cambridge University archive in November 2024. https://\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its reciprocal quantity is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;electrical conductance, measuring the ease with which an electric current passes. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with mechanical friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (\u03a9), while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S) (formerly called the 'mho' and then represented by \u2127).\nThe resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of electrical insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance and low conductance, while objects made of electrical conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductance. This relationship is quantified by resistivity or conductivity. The nature of a material is not the only factor in resistance and conductance, however; it also depends on the size and shape of an object because these properties are extensive rather than intensive. For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects resist electrical current, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero.\nThe resistance R of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage V across it to current I through it, while the conductance G is the reciprocal:\nformula_1\nFor a wide variety of materials and conditions, V and I are directly proportional to each other, and therefore R and G are constants (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called Ohm's law, and materials that satisfy it are called \"ohmic\" materials.\nIn other cases, such as a transformer, diode, incandescent light bulb or battery, V and I are not directly proportional. The ratio is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a \"chordal resistance\" or \"static resistance\", since it corresponds to the inverse slope of a chord between the origin and an I\u2013V curve. In other situations, the derivative formula_2 may be most useful; this is called the \"differential resistance\".\nIntroduction.\nIn the hydraulic analogy, current flowing through a wire (or resistor) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the voltage drop across the wire is like the pressure drop that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. \nThe voltage drop (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the voltage itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: the pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)\nThe resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:\nGeometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.\nMaterials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, electrons can flow freely and easily through a copper wire, but cannot flow as easily through a steel wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an insulator like rubber, regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and electron configuration, and is quantified by a property called resistivity.\nIn addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see below.\nConductors and resistors.\nSubstances in which electricity can flow are called conductors. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a resistor. Conductors are made of high-conductivity materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.\nOhm's law.\nFor many materials, the current I through the material is proportional to the voltage V applied across it:\nformula_3\nover a wide range of voltages and currents. Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called Ohm's law, and materials which obey it are called \"ohmic\" materials. Examples of ohmic components are wires and resistors. The current\u2013voltage graph of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive slope.\nOther components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm's law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them. These are called \"nonlinear\" or \"non-ohmic\". Examples include diodes and fluorescent lamps.\nRelation to resistivity and conductivity.\nThe resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: what material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance R and conductance G of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the length of the conductor, measured in metres (m), A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in square metres (m2), \u03c3 (sigma) is the electrical conductivity measured in siemens per meter (S\u00b7m\u22121), and \u03c1 (rho) is the electrical resistivity (also called \"specific electrical resistance\") of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are reciprocals: formula_6. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\nThis formula is not exact, as it assumes the current density is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\nAnother situation for which this formula is not exact is with alternating current (AC), because the skin effect inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the \"geometrical\" cross-section is different from the \"effective\" cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the proximity effect. At commercial power frequency, these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as busbars in an electrical substation, or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\nThe resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of teflon is about 1030 times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of \"delocalized\" electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. Semiconductors lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: Electrical resistivity and conductivity. For the case of electrolyte solutions, see the article: Conductivity (electrolytic).\nResistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See below.\nMeasurement.\nAn instrument for measuring resistance is called an ohmmeter. Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use four-terminal sensing.\nStatic and differential resistance.\nMany electrical elements, such as diodes and batteries do not satisfy Ohm's law. These are called \"non-ohmic\" or \"non-linear\", and their current\u2013voltage curves are not straight lines through the origin.\nResistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its operating point. There are two types of resistance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAC circuits.\nImpedance and admittance.\nWhen an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their phases. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a capacitor or inductor, the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90\u00b0 out of phase, see image below). Complex numbers are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:\nformula_7\nwhere:\nThe impedance and admittance may be expressed as complex numbers that can be broken into real and imaginary parts:\nformula_12\nwhere R is resistance, G is conductance, X is reactance, and B is susceptance. These lead to the complex number identities\nformula_13\nwhich are true in all cases, whereas formula_14 is only true in the special cases of either DC or reactance-free current.\nThe complex angle formula_15 is the phase difference between the voltage and current passing through a component with impedance Z. For capacitors and inductors, this angle is exactly -90\u00b0 or +90\u00b0, respectively, and X and B are nonzero. Ideal resistors have an angle of 0\u00b0, since X is zero (and hence B also), and Z and Y reduce to R and G respectively. In general, AC systems are designed to keep the phase angle close to 0\u00b0 as much as possible, since it reduces the reactive power, which does no useful work at a load. In a simple case with an inductive load (causing the phase to increase), a capacitor may be added for compensation at one frequency, since the capacitor's phase shift is negative, bringing the total impedance phase closer to 0\u00b0 again.\nY is the reciprocal of Z (formula_16) for all circuits, just as formula_17 for DC circuits containing only resistors, or AC circuits for which either the reactance or susceptance happens to be zero (X or \"B\" \n 0, respectively) (if one is zero, then for realistic systems both must be zero).\nFrequency dependence.\nA key feature of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent, a phenomenon known as the universal dielectric response. One reason, mentioned above is the skin effect (and the related proximity effect). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see Drude model, deep-level traps, resonant frequency, Kramers\u2013Kronig relations, etc.)\nEnergy dissipation and Joule heating.\nResistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called \"Joule heating\" (after James Prescott Joule), also called \"ohmic heating\" or \"resistive heating\".\nThe dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of transmission losses in power lines. High voltage transmission helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.\nOn the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in electric stoves and other electric heaters (also called \"resistive heaters\"). As another example, incandescent lamps rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows \"white hot\" with thermal radiation (also called incandescence).\nThe formula for Joule heating is:\nformula_18\nwhere P is the power (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, R is the resistance, and I is the current through the resistor.\nDependence on other conditions.\nTemperature dependence.\nNear room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see Electrical resistivity and conductivity.\nAs a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a resistance thermometer or thermistor. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)\nResistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as thermometers: by measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): if a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.\nIf the temperature T does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used:\nformula_19\nwhere formula_20 is called the \"temperature coefficient of resistance\", formula_21 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and formula_22 is the resistance at temperature formula_21. The parameter formula_20 is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, formula_20 is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that formula_20 was measured at with a suffix, such as formula_27, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.\nThe temperature coefficient formula_20 is typically to for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.\nStrain dependence.\nJust as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on strain gauges for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.\nLight illumination dependence.\nSome resistors, particularly those made from semiconductors, exhibit \"photoconductivity\", meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called \"photoresistors\" (or \"light dependent resistors\"). These are a common type of light detector.\nSuperconductivity.\nSuperconductors are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have \"V\" = 0 and \"I\" \u2260 0. This also means there is no joule heating, or in other words no dissipation of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near with liquid helium for most metallic superconductors like niobium\u2013tin alloys, or cooling to temperatures near with liquid nitrogen for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic high temperature superconductors.\nNevertheless, there are many technological applications of superconductivity, including superconducting magnets.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter \u03c1\u00a0(rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-metre (\u03a9\u22c5m). For example, if a solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is , then the resistivity of the material is .\nElectrical conductivity (or specific conductance) is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity. It represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. It is commonly signified by the Greek letter \u03c3\u00a0(sigma), but \u03ba\u00a0(kappa) (especially in electrical engineering) and \u03b3\u00a0(gamma) are sometimes used. The SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per metre (S/m). Resistivity and conductivity are intensive properties of materials, giving the opposition of a standard cube of material to current. Electrical resistance and conductance are corresponding extensive properties that give the opposition of a specific object to electric current.\nDefinition.\nIdeal case.\nIn an ideal case, cross-section and physical composition of the examined material are uniform across the sample, and the electric field and current density are both parallel and constant everywhere. Many resistors and conductors do in fact have a uniform cross section with a uniform flow of electric current, and are made of a single material, so that this is a good model. (See the adjacent diagram.) When this is the case, the resistance of the conductor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, where the electrical resistivity \u03c1\u00a0(Greek: rho) is the constant of proportionality. This is written as:\nformula_1formula_2\nwhere\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe resistivity can be expressed using the SI unit ohm\u00a0metre (\u03a9\u22c5m)\u2014i.e. ohms multiplied by square metres (for the cross-sectional area) then divided by metres (for the length).\nBoth \"resistance\" and \"resistivity\" describe how difficult it is to make electrical current flow through a material, but unlike resistance, resistivity is an intrinsic property and does not depend on geometric properties of a material. This means that all pure copper (Cu) wires (which have not been subjected to distortion of their crystalline structure etc.), irrespective of their shape and size, have the same resistivity, but a long, thin copper wire has a much larger resistance than a thick, short copper wire. Every material has its own characteristic resistivity. For example, rubber has a far larger resistivity than copper.\nIn a hydraulic analogy, passing current through a high-resistivity material is like pushing water through a pipe full of sand\u00a0- while passing current through a low-resistivity material is like pushing water through an empty pipe. If the pipes are the same size and shape, the pipe full of sand has higher resistance to flow. Resistance, however, is not solely determined by the presence or absence of sand. It also depends on the length and width of the pipe: short or wide pipes have lower resistance than narrow or long pipes.\nThe above equation can be transposed to get Pouillet's law (named after Claude Pouillet):\nformula_3The resistance of a given element is proportional to the length, but inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. For example, if A\u00a0= , formula_4\u00a0= (forming a cube with perfectly conductive contacts on opposite faces), then the resistance of this element in ohms is numerically equal to the resistivity of the material it is made of in \u03a9\u22c5m.\nConductivity, \u03c3, is the inverse of resistivity:\nformula_5\nConductivity has SI units of siemens per metre (S/m).\nConductivity, formula_6, is directly proportional to formula_7\nformula_8\nWhere: formula_9 = electron concentration, formula_10 = hole concentration, formula_11 = electron mobility, formula_12 = hole mobility. \nGeneral scalar quantities.\nIf the geometry is more complicated, or if the resistivity varies from point to point within the material, the current and electric field will be functions of position. Then it is necessary to use a more general expression in which the resistivity at a particular point is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the density of the current it creates at that point:\nformula_13\nwhere\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe current density is parallel to the electric field by necessity.\nConductivity is the inverse (reciprocal) of resistivity. Here, it is given by:\nformula_14\nFor example, rubber is a material with large \u03c1 and small \u03c3\u00a0\u2014 because even a very large electric field in rubber makes almost no current flow through it. On the other hand, copper is a material with small \u03c1 and large \u03c3\u00a0\u2014 because even a small electric field pulls a lot of current through it.\nThis expression simplifies to the formula given above under \"ideal case\" when the resistivity is constant in the material and the geometry has a uniform cross-section. In this case, the electric field and current density are constant and parallel.\nTensor resistivity.\nWhen the resistivity of a material has a directional component, the most general definition of resistivity must be used. It starts from the tensor-vector form of Ohm's law, which relates the electric field inside a material to the electric current flow. This equation is completely general, meaning it is valid in all cases, including those mentioned above. However, this definition is the most complicated, so it is only directly used in anisotropic cases, where the more simple definitions cannot be applied. If the material is isotropic, it is safe to ignore the tensor-vector definition, and use a simpler expression instead.\nHere, anisotropic means that the material has different properties in different directions. For example, a crystal of graphite consists microscopically of a stack of sheets, and current flows very easily through each sheet, but much less easily from one sheet to the adjacent one. In such cases, the current does not flow in exactly the same direction as the electric field. Thus, the appropriate equations are generalized to the three-dimensional tensor form:\nformula_15\nwhere the conductivity \u03c3 and resistivity \u03c1 are rank-2 tensors, and electric field E and current density J are vectors. These tensors can be represented by 3\u00d73 matrices, the vectors with 3\u00d71 matrices, with matrix multiplication used on the right side of these equations. In matrix form, the resistivity relation is given by:\nformula_16\nwhere\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEquivalently, resistivity can be given in the more compact Einstein notation:\nformula_17\nIn either case, the resulting expression for each electric field component is:\nformula_18\nSince the choice of the coordinate system is free, the usual convention is to simplify the expression by choosing an x-axis parallel to the current direction, so \"J\"\"y\" = \"J\"\"z\" = 0. This leaves:\nformula_19\nConductivity is defined similarly:\nformula_20\nor\nformula_21\nboth resulting in:\nformula_22\nLooking at the two expressions, formula_23 and formula_24 are the matrix inverse of each other. However, in the most general case, the individual matrix elements are not necessarily reciprocals of one another; for example, \"\u03c3xx\" may not be equal to 1/\"\u03c1xx\". This can be seen in the Hall effect, where formula_25 is nonzero. In the Hall effect, due to rotational invariance about the z-axis, formula_26 and formula_27, so the relation between resistivity and conductivity simplifies to:\nformula_28\nIf the electric field is parallel to the applied current, formula_25 and formula_30 are zero. When they are zero, one number, formula_31, is enough to describe the electrical resistivity. It is then written as simply formula_32, and this reduces to the simpler expression.\nCauses of conductivity.\nElectric current is the ordered movement of electrically-charged particles. Specifically, the relation between current density and charged-particle velocity is governed by the equation formula_33 where formula_34 is the current density, formula_35 is the charge of the carrier, formula_36 is the density of the particles, and formula_37 their drift velocity, a time-averaged measure of their long-term motion. \nBand theory simplified.\nAccording to elementary quantum mechanics, an electron in an atom or crystal can only have certain precise energy levels; energies between these levels are impossible. When a large number of such allowed levels have close-spaced energy values\u2014i.e. have energies that differ only minutely\u2014those close energy levels in combination are called an \"energy band\". There can be many such energy bands in a material, depending on the atomic number of the constituent atoms and their distribution within the crystal.\nThe material's electrons seek to minimize the total energy in the material by settling into low energy states; however, the Pauli exclusion principle means that only one can exist in each such state. So the electrons \"fill up\" the band structure starting from the bottom. The characteristic energy level up to which the electrons have filled is called the Fermi level. The position of the Fermi level with respect to the band structure is very important for electrical conduction: Only electrons in energy levels near or above the Fermi level are free to move within the broader material structure, since the electrons can easily jump among the partially occupied states in that region. In contrast, the low energy states are completely filled with a fixed limit on the number of electrons at all times, and the high energy states are empty of electrons at all times.\nElectric current consists of a flow of electrons. In metals there are many electron energy levels near the Fermi level, so there are many electrons available to move. This is what causes the high electronic conductivity of metals.\nAn important part of band theory is that there may be forbidden bands of energy: energy intervals that contain no energy levels. In insulators and semiconductors, the number of electrons is just the right amount to fill a certain integer number of low energy bands, exactly to the boundary. In this case, the Fermi level falls within a band gap. Since there are no available states near the Fermi level, and the electrons are not freely movable, the electronic conductivity is very low.\nIn metals.\nA metal consists of a lattice of atoms, each with an outer shell of electrons that freely dissociate from their parent atoms and travel through the lattice. This is also known as a positive ionic lattice. This 'sea' of dissociable electrons allows the metal to conduct electric current. When an electrical potential difference (a voltage) is applied across the metal, the resulting electric field causes electrons to drift towards the positive terminal. The actual drift velocity of electrons is typically small, on the order of magnitude of metres per hour. However, due to the sheer number of moving electrons, even a slow drift velocity results in a large current density. The mechanism is similar to transfer of momentum of balls in a Newton's cradle but the rapid propagation of an electric energy along a wire is not due to the mechanical forces, but the propagation of an energy-carrying electromagnetic field guided by the wire.\nMost metals have electrical resistance. In simpler models (non quantum mechanical models) this can be explained by replacing electrons and the crystal lattice by a wave-like structure. When the electron wave travels through the lattice, the waves interfere, which causes resistance. The more regular the lattice is, the less disturbance happens and thus the less resistance. The amount of resistance is thus mainly caused by two factors. First, it is caused by the temperature and thus amount of vibration of the crystal lattice. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, which act as irregularities in the lattice. Second, the purity of the metal is relevant as a mixture of different ions is also an irregularity. The small decrease in conductivity on melting of pure metals is due to the loss of long range crystalline order. The short range order remains and strong correlation between positions of ions results in coherence between waves diffracted by adjacent ions.\nIn semiconductors and insulators.\nIn metals, the Fermi level lies in the conduction band (see Band Theory, above) giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in semiconductors the position of the Fermi level is within the band gap, about halfway between the conduction band minimum (the bottom of the first band of unfilled electron energy levels) and the valence band maximum (the top of the band below the conduction band, of filled electron energy levels). That applies for intrinsic (undoped) semiconductors. This means that at absolute zero temperature, there would be no free conduction electrons, and the resistance is infinite. However, the resistance decreases as the charge carrier density (i.e., without introducing further complications, the density of electrons) in the conduction band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, dopant atoms increase the majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction band or producing holes in the valence band. (A \"hole\" is a position where an electron is missing; such holes can behave in a similar way to electrons.) For both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing dopant density reduces resistance. Hence, highly doped semiconductors behave metallically. At very high temperatures, the contribution of thermally generated carriers dominates over the contribution from dopant atoms, and the resistance decreases exponentially with temperature.\nIn ionic liquids/electrolytes.\nIn electrolytes, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes, but by full atomic species (ions) traveling, each carrying an electrical charge. The resistivity of ionic solutions (electrolytes) varies tremendously with concentration \u2013 while distilled water is almost an insulator, salt water is a reasonable electrical conductor. Conduction in ionic liquids is also controlled by the movement of ions, but here we are talking about molten salts rather than solvated ions. In biological membranes, currents are carried by ionic salts. Small holes in cell membranes, called ion channels, are selective to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.\nThe concentration of ions in a liquid (e.g., in an aqueous solution) depends on the degree of dissociation of the dissolved substance, characterized by a dissociation coefficient formula_38, which is the ratio of the concentration of ions formula_39 to the concentration of molecules of the dissolved substance formula_40:\nformula_41\nThe specific electrical conductivity (formula_6) of a solution is equal to:\nformula_43\nwhere formula_44: module of the ion charge, formula_45 and formula_46: mobility of positively and negatively charged ions, formula_40: concentration of molecules of the dissolved substance, formula_38: the coefficient of dissociation.\nSuperconductivity.\nThe electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In normal (that is, non-superconducting) conductors, such as copper or silver, this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near absolute zero, a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. In a normal conductor, the current is driven by a voltage gradient, whereas in a superconductor, there is no voltage gradient and the current is instead related to the phase gradient of the superconducting order parameter. A consequence of this is that an electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.\nIn a class of superconductors known as type II superconductors, including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of magnetic vortices in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen so that the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\nPlasma.\nPlasmas are very good conductors and electric potentials play an important role.\nThe potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the \"plasma potential\", or \"space potential\". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential generally lies considerably below the plasma potential, due to what is termed a Debye sheath. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of \"quasineutrality\", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (\"n\"e = \u27e8Z\u27e9\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"n\"i), but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that \"double layers\" are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.\nThe magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net charge density. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the Boltzmann relation:\nformula_49\nDifferentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:\nformula_50\nIt is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small. Otherwise, the repulsive electrostatic force dissipates it.\nIn astrophysical plasmas, Debye screening prevents electric fields from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.\nPlasma is often called the \"fourth state of matter\" after solid, liquids and gases. It is distinct from these and other lower-energy states of matter. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:\nResistivity and conductivity of various materials.\nThe degree of semiconductors doping makes a large difference in conductivity. To a point, more doping leads to higher conductivity. The conductivity of a water/aqueous solution is highly dependent on its concentration of dissolved salts and other chemical species that ionize in the solution. Electrical conductivity of water samples is used as an indicator of how salt-free, ion-free, or impurity-free the sample is; the purer the water, the lower the conductivity (the higher the resistivity). Conductivity measurements in water are often reported as \"specific conductance\", relative to the conductivity of pure water at . An EC meter is normally used to measure conductivity in a solution. A rough summary is as follows:\nTable.\nThis table shows the resistivity (\u03c1), conductivity and temperature coefficient of various materials at .\nThe effective temperature coefficient varies with temperature and purity level of the material. The 20\u00a0\u00b0C value is only an approximation when used at other temperatures. For example, the coefficient becomes lower at higher temperatures for copper, and the value 0.00427 is commonly specified at .\nThe extremely low resistivity (high conductivity) of silver is characteristic of metals. George Gamow tidily summed up the nature of the metals' dealings with electrons in his popular science book \"One, Two, Three...Infinity\" (1947):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\nMore technically, the free electron model gives a basic description of electron flow in metals.\nWood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least worse insulator than oven-dry. In any case, a sufficiently high voltage \u2013 such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension power lines \u2013 can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood.\nTemperature dependence.\nLinear approximation.\nThe electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature T does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used:\nformula_51\nwhere formula_38 is called the \"temperature coefficient of resistivity\", formula_53 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and formula_54 is the resistivity at temperature formula_53. The parameter formula_38 is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, formula_38 is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that formula_38 was measured at with a suffix, such as formula_59, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference. When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the linear approximation is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.\nMetals.\nIn general, electrical resistivity of metals increases with temperature. Electron\u2013phonon interactions can play a key role. At high temperatures, the resistance of a metal increases linearly with temperature. As the temperature of a metal is reduced, the temperature dependence of resistivity follows a power law function of temperature. Mathematically the temperature dependence of the resistivity \u03c1 of a metal can be approximated through the Bloch\u2013Gr\u00fcneisen formula:\nformula_60\nwhere formula_61 is the residual resistivity due to defect scattering, A is a constant that depends on the velocity of electrons at the Fermi surface, the Debye radius and the number density of electrons in the metal. formula_62 is the Debye temperature as obtained from resistivity measurements and matches very closely with the values of Debye temperature obtained from specific heat measurements. n is an integer that depends upon the nature of interaction:\nThe Bloch\u2013Gr\u00fcneisen formula is an approximation obtained assuming that the studied metal has spherical Fermi surface inscribed within the first Brillouin zone and a Debye phonon spectrum.\nIf more than one source of scattering is simultaneously present, Matthiessen's rule (first formulated by Augustus Matthiessen in the 1860s) states that the total resistance can be approximated by adding up several different terms, each with the appropriate value of\u00a0n.\nAs the temperature of the metal is sufficiently reduced (so as to 'freeze' all the phonons), the resistivity usually reaches a constant value, known as the residual resistivity. This value depends not only on the type of metal, but on its purity and thermal history. The value of the residual resistivity of a metal is decided by its impurity concentration. Some materials lose all electrical resistivity at sufficiently low temperatures, due to an effect known as superconductivity.\nAn investigation of the low-temperature resistivity of metals was the motivation to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's experiments that led in 1911 to discovery of superconductivity. For details see History of superconductivity.\nWiedemann\u2013Franz law.\nThe Wiedemann\u2013Franz law states that for materials where heat and charge transport is dominated by electrons, the ratio of thermal to electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature:\nformula_63\nwhere formula_64 is the thermal conductivity, formula_65 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_66 is the electron charge, formula_67 is temperature, and formula_6 is the electric conductivity. The ratio on the rhs is called the Lorenz number.\nSemiconductors.\nIn general, intrinsic semiconductor resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. The electrons are bumped to the conduction energy band by thermal energy, where they flow freely, and in doing so leave behind holes in the valence band, which also flow freely. The electric resistance of a typical intrinsic (non doped) semiconductor decreases exponentially with temperature following an Arrhenius model:\nformula_69\nAn even better approximation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a semiconductor is given by the Steinhart\u2013Hart equation:\nformula_70\nwhere A, B and C are the so-called Steinhart\u2013Hart coefficients.\nThis equation is used to calibrate thermistors.\nExtrinsic (doped) semiconductors have a far more complicated temperature profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors. After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers, the resistance starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers (much as in a metal). At higher temperatures, they behave like intrinsic semiconductors as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant compared to the thermally generated carriers.\nIn non-crystalline semiconductors, conduction can occur by charges quantum tunnelling from one localised site to another. This is known as variable range hopping and has the characteristic form of\nformula_71\nwhere n = 2, 3, 4, depending on the dimensionality of the system.\nKondo insulators.\nKondo insulators are materials where the resistivity follows the formula\n formula_72\nwhere formula_73, formula_74, formula_75 and formula_76 are constant parameters, formula_54 the residual resistivity, formula_78 the Fermi liquid contribution, formula_79 a lattice vibrations term and formula_80 the Kondo effect.\nComplex resistivity and conductivity.\nWhen analyzing the response of materials to alternating electric fields (dielectric spectroscopy), in applications such as electrical impedance tomography, it is convenient to replace resistivity with a complex quantity called impedivity (in analogy to electrical impedance). Impedivity is the sum of a real component, the resistivity, and an imaginary component, the reactivity (in analogy to reactance). The magnitude of impedivity is the square root of sum of squares of magnitudes of resistivity and reactivity.\nConversely, in such cases the conductivity must be expressed as a complex number (or even as a matrix of complex numbers, in the case of anisotropic materials) called the \"admittivity\". Admittivity is the sum of a real component called the conductivity and an imaginary component called the susceptivity.\nAn alternative description of the response to alternating currents uses a real (but frequency-dependent) conductivity, along with a real permittivity. The larger the conductivity is, the more quickly the alternating-current signal is absorbed by the material (i.e., the more opaque the material is). For details, see Mathematical descriptions of opacity.\nResistance versus resistivity in complicated geometries.\nEven if the material's resistivity is known, calculating the resistance of something made from it may, in some cases, be much more complicated than the formula formula_81 above. One example is spreading resistance profiling, where the material is inhomogeneous (different resistivity in different places), and the exact paths of current flow are not obvious.\nIn cases like this, the formulas\nformula_82\nmust be replaced with\nformula_83\nwhere E and J are now vector fields. This equation, along with the continuity equation for J and the Poisson's equation for E, form a set of partial differential equations. In special cases, an exact or approximate solution to these equations can be worked out by hand, but for very accurate answers in complex cases, computer methods like finite element analysis may be required.\nResistivity-density product.\nIn some applications where the weight of an item is very important, the product of resistivity and density is more important than absolute low resistivity\u00a0\u2013 it is often possible to make the conductor thicker to make up for a higher resistivity; and then a material with a low resistivity\u2013density product (or equivalently a high conductivity/density ratio) is desirable. For example, for long-distance overhead power lines, aluminium is frequently used rather than copper (Cu) because it is lighter for the same conductance.\nSilver, although it is the least resistive metal known, has a high density and performs similarly to copper by this measure, but is much more expensive. Calcium and the alkali metals have the best resistivity-density products, but are rarely used for conductors due to their high reactivity with water and oxygen, and lack of physical strength. Aluminium is far more stable. Toxicity excludes the choice of beryllium; pure beryllium is also brittle. Thus, aluminium is usually the metal of choice when the weight or cost of a conductor is the driving consideration.\nHistory.\nJohn Walsh and the conductivity of a vacuum.\nIn a 1774 letter to Dutch-born British scientist Jan Ingenhousz, Benjamin Franklin relates an experiment by another British scientist, John Walsh, that purportedly showed this astonishing fact: Although rarified air conducts electricity better than common air, a vacuum does not conduct electricity at all.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mr. Walsh ... has just made a curious Discovery in Electricity. You know we find that in rarify\u2019d Air it would pass more freely, and leap thro\u2019 greater Spaces than in dense Air; and thence it was concluded that in a perfect Vacuum it would pass any distance without the least Obstruction. But having made a perfect Vacuum by means of boil\u2019d Mercury in a long Torricellian bent Tube, its Ends immers\u2019d in Cups full of Mercury, he finds that the Vacuum will not conduct at all, but resists the Passage of the Electric Fluid absolutely.\nHowever, to this statement a note (based on modern knowledge) was added by the editors\u2014at the American Philosophical Society and Yale University\u2014of the webpage hosting the letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We can only assume that something was wrong with Walsh\u2019s findings. ... Although the conductivity of a gas, as it approaches a vacuum, increases up to a point and then decreases, that point is far beyond what the technique described might have been expected to reach. Boiling replaced the air with mercury vapor, which as it cooled created a vacuum that could scarcely have been complete enough to decrease, let alone eliminate, the vapor\u2019s conductivity.\nBarlow's law was published in 1825.\nOhm's law was published in 1827.\nBoth were empirical fits to measured data.\nThe first scientific explanation of why electrons behave in this way is the Drude model, first proposed in 1900.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The history of Hispanic craftsmanship in furniture, tin work, and other mediums also played a role in creating a multicultural tradition of art in the area.\nThe 1898 visit by Bert Geer Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein to Taos was an early step in the creation of the Taos art colony and the Taos Society of Artists. In addition to the society, Mabel Dodge Luhan was instrumental in promoting Taos to artists and writers within her circle.\nIn the early-20th century, modern artists infused the area with a new artistic energy, followed in the 1950s by abstract artists. Today Taos supports more than 80 galleries and three museums. There are a number of organizations that support and promote the work of artists on the Taos Pueblo and in the Taos area.\nHistory.\nTaos Pueblo.\nLocated in a tributary valley off the Rio Grande, Taos Pueblo is the most northern of the New Mexico pueblos. For nearly a millennium, the Taos Indians have lived there. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450\u00a0AD, with some later expansion. The Taos Pueblo is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 people in the Taos pueblo community. Some of them have modern homes near their fields and stay at their homes on the pueblo during cooler weather. There are about 150 people who live at the pueblo year-around. The Taos Pueblo was added as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 as one of the most significant historical cultural landmarks in the world; Other sites include the Taj Mahal, Great Pyramids and the Grand Canyon in the United States.\nTaos Pueblo artists.\nAncient artistic traditions have been manifested in native craft for generations; an important acknowledgement for understanding the inherent aesthetic allure of this area to the Anglo-American artists. Making paintings with oil and watercolor was a new form of art to the Taos Pueblo who traditionally painted objects such as hides or inside buildings, such as on the walls of a kiva, but one embraced by artists such as Albert Looking Elk, Albert Lujan, Juan Mirabal and Juanito Concha. They provided artwork that was realistic of the Native American lifestyle in contrast to the work of Anglo-Americans romantic depictions. Traditional design elements were formalized at the Santa Fe Indian School, defining authentic Native American art.\nJuanita Suazo Dubray, a lifelong resident of Taos Pueblo, is a Native American potter. In 1980, at the age of 50, Dubray began making micaceous pottery, upholding the tradition of her mother and their ancestors. Dubray added an element of sculptural relief with icons of corn, turtles, lizards, and kiva steps in relief; Her original corn design her most recognized symbol. Lori \"Pop Wea\" Tanner (died 1966) was also a noted potter from Taos Pueblo.\nPop Chalee, also known as Merina Lujan and \"Blue Flower\" (1906\u20131993), was the daughter of a man from the Taos Pueblo; her mother was of Swiss descent. In the 1920s she attended the Santa Fe Indian School and in the 1930s Dorothy Dunn's studio of the same school. Multi-talented, Chalee was a muralist and art instructor; she also worked in radio and the film industry.\nHispanic artwork.\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was very expensive to ship furniture to New Mexico. Hispanic carpenters built, with great artistry, cajas (storage chests), harineros (grain chests), trasteros (kitchen cupboards) and other furniture. The work was generally carved and painted brightly.\nTinwork was also made with materials brought from Mexico and sometimes along the Santa Fe Trail. A significant growth in tin work occurred, though, once the railroad opened. At first most of the tin work was in the form of religious, devotional items. By the turn of the 20th century, tinsmiths were creating sconces, lanterns and trinket boxes.\nCommissioned by churches and individuals, artists created sacred images called Santos of Roman Catholicism. Patroci\u00f1o Barela (1900\u20131964) made secular works that greatly influenced contemporary santeros. His work, shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with other artists of the Federal Art Project, was the first Mexican American artist to receive national recognition.\nIn addition to the Taos museums, the Martinez Hacienda, a fortress occupied by Padre Martinez's family in the 19th century, provides examples of the integration of Spanish and Pueblo artistic movements in retablos (santos painted on flat pieces of wood), bultos (santos carved out of wood and sometimes painted), as well as tin work, jewelry, and basketry.\nArt colony.\nTaos Society of Artists.\nBert Geer Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein came to Taos, New Mexico as part of a tour of the western United States, but upon seeing Taos, decided to stay.\nAn article with drawings by Blumenschein about a ceremony at Taos Pueblo appeared in the April 30, 1898, issue of \"Harper's Weekly\".\nWithin a few years other American and European-born artists joined them in Taos: Joseph Henry Sharp, W. Herbert Dunton, E. Irving Couse and Oscar E. Berninghaus. These six artists were the charter members of the Taos Society of Artists.\nThe Taos Society of Artists works heralded the beginning of the Taos art colony, a groundbreaking association of European trained painters that collected around the visually spectacular Taos Pueblo in the Southwestern United States. The founding members fostered the emergence of a major school of American painting. Unlike other 'schools' or styles that emerged around the turn of the 19th century in the United States, the early Taos Colony artists were not united under a single manifesto or aesthetic \"modus\", but equally lured by the stunning and, as yet, foreign environs.\nMabel Dodge Luhan.\nMany artists were drawn to Taos due to the presence of Mabel Dodge Luhan, a wealthy heiress from Buffalo, New York who had run a prominent art salon in Florence, Italy, and Manhattan, New York, before settling in Taos in 1917. After both divorced their spouses, Mabel Dodge married a Pueblo native, Antonio Lujan, and built a house. She spelled her married name \"Luhan\" as it was easier for her friends to pronounce.\nWhile in the Southwest, Luhan carried on the tradition of the European salon in its newest of iterations. For decades, she invited artists, writers, and people from other disciplines to be inspired by Taos and each other. Among them were Ansel Adams, Georgia O'Keeffe, Alfred Stieglitz, Nicolai Fechin, author D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Frieda von Richthofen. Artist Dorothy Brett came to Taos in 1924 with her friends D. H. Lawrence and Frieda von Richthofen and later permanently settled there.\nGeorgia O'Keeffe settled in New Mexico in the Mabel Dodge Luhan era, but mostly kept her distance, to Mabel's annoyance.. She stayed in one of Mabel's houses in Taos in the summer of 1929 with Rebecca Strand, Paul Strand's wife, painting the country around Taos and getting to know the country. According to Calvin Tomkins, in a 1974 interview, \"She rather liked Mabel Dodge Luhan\u2014was amused by her, even when Mabel was at her bullying worst. Mabel and Dorothy Brett, the painter, and Frieda Lawrence, who had settled near Taos after D. H. Lawrence died, in 1930, carried on a running three-cornered feud. They had all idolized Lawrence, and each considered herself in some way his true muse\u2014a situation that reached lunatic heights during their protracted squabble over Lawrence\u2019s ashes. To prevent Mabel from stealing and scattering the ashes (as she claimed Lawrence had wished), Frieda finally had them mixed with a ton of concrete and formed into a block.\" The block remains on the D. H. Lawrence Ranch above Taos.\nAndrew Dasburg.\nParisian born Andrew Dasburg (1887\u20131979) was one of the earliest friends of Luhan to come and stay in Taos. He first came to Taos in 1918, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1921, when he integrated the boxy traditional construction styles in New Mexico into his Cubist art. In Taos, Dasburg became a mentor to a group of artists known as \"Taos Moderns\". A leader in the Cubism movement, his works are in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Denver Art Museum, among others.\nD. H. Lawrence.\nInspired by the area and artists, D. H. Lawrence (1885\u20131930) painted while in Taos, signing his work \"Lorenzo\"; Nine of his paintings are displayed at La Fonda Hotel on the Taos Plaza.\nGeorgia O'Keeffe.\nA friend of D. H. Lawrence, Georgia O'Keeffe (1887\u20131986) began to spend summers with the Lawrences starting in 1930. O'Keeffe's inspiration led Lawrence to discover he had a talent for painting, too. She made iconic, colorful paintings of flowers and bones she collected during her walks through the desert. In 1940, she bought her first home in New Mexico. Her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, preferring to stay in New York, O'Keeffe spent much of the year with him. Upon his death in 1946, O'Keeffe moved permanently to her New Mexico home, in an area known as Ghost Ranch, and later built a home in Abiquiu, New Mexico.\nNicolai Fechin.\nLike Lawrence, Russian artist Nicolai Fechin (1881\u20131955) suffered from tuberculosis and found Taos helpful for managing his health. In 1927, Fechin moved to Taos with his wife and daughter. For a time they lived with Luhan, but soon purchased an adobe home that was renovated into a beautiful, unusual home with Russian wood carvings. The Taos Art Museum is located inside the Fechin House.\nAnsel Adams.\nAnsel Easton Adams (1902\u20131984) was a photographer, best known for his black-and-white photographs of the American West. In 1930, Taos Pueblo, Adams's second portfolio, was published. In New Mexico, he was introduced to notables from Alfred Stieglitz's circle, including painter Georgia O'Keeffe, artist John Marin, and photographer Paul Strand, all of whom created famous works during their stays in the Southwest.\nOther early 20th-century artists.\nCordelia Wilson, an artist from Georgetown, Colorado developed her skills as an artist motivated by latest trends in American realism led by Robert Henri. Her academic training emphasized development of an alla prima technique and painting out of doors, which inspired her to produce bold impasto works quickly. She started making road trips to New Mexico and became friends with painters in the Taos Society of Artists and the Santa Fe art colony. Her numerous expressive oil sketches and en plein air canvases of adobe dwellings and rugged landscapes caught the attention of art dealers.\nMaynard Dixon (1875-1946), a California born artist who specialized in painting South Western landscapes, people and architecture, visited and resided several times in New Mexico and Taos, coming first in 1900 with the writer Charles Lummis and later in 1931 in Taos with his wife the photographer Dorothea Lange. He produced dozens of drawings and painting during these visits and stays, while declining to join the Taos Society of Artists to which he had been invited by Ernest Blumenschein.\nRebecca Salsbury James (1891\u20131968) was largely a self-taught artist, although, after coming to Taos she was influenced by friend, Georgia O'Keeffe. She is most known for her work with reverse oils on glass and also worked in oils, pastels and a Spanish folk art form, colcha embroidery.\nOuray Meyers, a Taos artist, is the son of Ralph Meyers who was an artist, writer, and trader who was good friends with members of the Taos Society of Artists, such as Joseph Henry Sharp and W. Herbert Dunton; He was also a friend of Leon Gaspard, Nicolai Fechin, Dorothy Brett, and Georgia O'Keeffe. As a boy, Ralph Meyers met the artists who often visited his parents\u2019 home. Meyers developed his own unique style, influenced by the early Taos painters.\nIn 1923, Akseli Gallen-Kallela departed for the US to organize an exhibition at the Chicago Art Institute and retrieve his works, which had been lost there since the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. He successfully located most of them and showcased them in the exhibition. During his time in the country, he painted landscapes and portraits, and he also traveled around extensively. Homesick, he was joined by his wife and daughter in 1924. They spent some time in the artist colony in Taos, New Mexico, before continuing their travels and ultimately returning to Finland in the spring of 1926.\nPostwar modernism.\nTaos Moderns.\nIn the 1940s a group of artists, some of whom had studied contemporary European and American modernist art under the G.I. bill, came to Taos. Arriving from cities like New York and San Francisco that were centers for the forms of abstract painting that emerged after World War II, they transformed Taos into a hotbed of contemporary art. These artists became known as the \"Taos Moderns\" and included Thomas Benrimo, Emil Bisttram, Edward Corbett, Joseph Glasco, R.C. Ellis, Cliff Harmon, Janet Lippincott, Ward Lockwood, Louis Leon Ribak, Beatrice Mandelman, Agnes Martin, Robert Ray, Earl Stroh, and Clay Spohn. Other visiting artists include Richard Diebenkorn, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Clyfford Still, and Morris Graves. Andrew Dasburg already came to Taos and was a mentor to many of the new artists, and his own works also evolved towards a more abstract expressionist style.\nLike earlier artists, they portrayed the colorful New Mexican landscape and cultural influences, such as the \"timelessness they perceived in Puebloan culture and the deep connection to the land they noted in the everyday life of both Native Americans and Hispanics influence experimentation and innovation in their own art.\" Rather than capturing realist images of people and the landscape, they sought to capture the true meaning of their subjects.\nOther postwar artists.\nOther postwar artists such as R. C. Gorman and Bill Rane also made Taos their home.\nR. C. Gorman (1931\u20132005) was an internationally renowned artist of the Navajo Nation, sometimes called the \"Picasso\" of the American Indian Arts. Even so, he was not accepted by the entire Taos art colony. Gorman opened \"The Navajo Gallery\" in 1968 on historic Ledoux Street, the first art gallery owned by a Native American in the United States. It contained a large body of his work and those of some local Taos artists. Gorman was a collector of art, such as works by European masters Picasso and Chagall, and local artists, such as Bill Rane, whose work Gorman identified as his favorite of the artist colony.\nBill Rane (1927 - 2005) was an artist and Taos gallery owner. His historic Taos gallery is maintained by his widow, Judith Rane. Bill Rane was born in Oregon, grew up in Idaho, and studied art and literature at San Francisco State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Rane lived and worked in the Bay Area of California until he moved to Taos, where he lived until his death in 2005.\nOrganizations.\nTaos Art Association.\nIn the 1950s a group of Taos artists decided to form the Taos Art Association (TAA). They purchased the Manby estate and turned the mansion into art galleries and in the gardens an outdoor community theater. In 2000, the Taos Art Association (TAA) became the Taos Center for the Arts (TCA). It is the oldest non-profit arts organization in the state of New Mexico.\nTaos Artist Organization.\nTaos Artist Organization is a group of 140+ artists living in Taos and working in a variety of creative media.\nTaos Gallery Association.\nTaos has over 80 privately owned art galleries.\nTaos Pueblo artists.\nContemporary native artists of Taos Pueblo create handcrafted goods using methods passed down through generations of family artisans. Modern interpretation of traditional art is reflected in their sculpture, painting and jewelry. For centuries the Taos pueblo potters have been creating micaceous pottery; now, the pottery is made with a high polish. Also produced on the pueblo are tanned buckskin moccasins and drums.\nMuseums.\nHarwood Museum of Art.\nThe Harwood Museum of Art in Taos has a permanent collection of over 1,700 works of art and 17,000 photographic images. The collection of works from the 19th century to the present reflect the multicultural heritages and influences of the Taos artistic community. The categories of works include: Hispanic, Taos Society of Artists, Taos Moderns, Contemporary, and Prints, Drawings and Photographs.\nMillicent Rogers Museum.\nThe Millicent Rogers Museum is a collection of items of southwestern Indian culture. Millicent Rogers was instrumental in the promotion of the Native American culture. The collections include weavings, kachinas, pottery, baskets, tin work, and contemporary art. In the early 1980s the museum held works of the Hispanic art movement, the first major cultural organization in New Mexico to do so. Millicent's mother, Mary B. Rogers, was the benefactoress for much of the Pueblo Indian works.\nPaintings by Pueblo artists Albert Looking Elk (Martinez), Albert Lujan, Juan Mirabal, Juanito Concha, and the works of other Pueblo artists are included in the Museum's collection.\nTaos Art Museum.\nThe Taos Art Museum at Fechin House presides over a collection including paintings by full and associate members of the Taos Society of Artists, various Taos Moderns, Nicolai Fechin and assorted other Taos artists. It is housed in Fechin's former home and studio. Exhibitions in Fechin's studio feature contemporary artists working in Taos, while temporary exhibits in the historic home highlight artists from the region's rich creative past.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Blumenschein", "text": "American painter (1874\u20131960)\nErnest Leonard Blumenschein (May 26, 1874 \u2013 June 6, 1960) was an American artist and founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He is noted for paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico and the American Southwest.\nEarly life and education.\nErnest Blumenschein was born on May 26, 1874, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, near fellow German immigrant families. In 1877, his father accepted a position as director of the Dayton Philharmonic in Ohio, where Blumenschein grew up. When he finished high school, Blumenschein received a scholarship to study violin at the College of Music of Cincinnati.\nWhile in Cincinnati, he also attended an illustration course from Fernand Lungren at the Cincinnati Art Academy, causing him to change his studies from music to art. He moved to New York City in 1892, studying at the Art Students League of New York. Attracted by the idea of studying art in Europe, he enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris in 1894. There he met and became friends with Bert Phillips and the older and more experienced artist Joseph Henry Sharp, who told the two younger artists about his 1893 visit to Taos, New Mexico.\nCareer.\nBlumenschein returned to New York in 1896, to work as an illustrator in a studio shared with Bert Phillips. In early 1898, he took an assignment that required him to travel to Arizona and New Mexico. That Spring, he convinced Phillips to join him on a second journey to the American West. Their first stop was Denver, Colorado, where they bought art and camping supplies, a wagon, horses and a revolver. Thus equipped, they set out with the intention of reaching Mexico.\nIn northern New Mexico, the rough road caused a wagon wheel to break. Blumenschein brought the wheel to be repaired in nearby Taos, leaving Phillips alone with the wagon. When Blumenschein returned three days later with the repaired wheel, they continued to Taos, where they sold their horse and equipage, set up a studio and began to paint.\nBlumenschein stayed in Taos for three months, returning to New York to resume his career as an illustrator of popular magazines and books (including two short stories by Jack London), while Phillips remained in Taos. Blumenschein returned twice to Paris to pursue further studies at Acad\u00e9mie Julian: once in 1899 and again from 1902 to 1909. During the latter stay, he met and married artist Mary Shepard Greene.\nThe couple returned to New York in 1909, where they worked as an illustration team. Blumenschein also took a teaching position at his alma mater, the Art Students League of New York.\nFrom 1910, he spent his summers in Taos. In 1915, he became a co-founder of the Taos Society of Artists, together with his friends Bert Phillips, Joseph Henry Sharp, and three other artists. He finally settled permanently in Taos in 1919. From 1920 to 1921 he served as president of the Society. In 1923, he refused to accept the position of secretary of the Society, giving his commitment to an office of \"The New Mexico Painters\", another group he had helped form, as his reason for the refusal. The other members of the Society refused to accept his excuse, and after a heated argument, Blumenschein resigned from the Society.\nThe style of painting of the Taos painters was to decisively influence the perceptions that the wider world came to have of the American Southwest, specifically of the Pueblo and Navajo Indian peoples.\nDuring World War I, Blumenschein led a national effort to produce range-finder paintings used to help train military gunners.\nHonors and awards.\nIn 1910, Blumenschein was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1927. In 1947 he was awarded an Honorary Master of Arts from University of New Mexico and the following year he was named Honorary Fellow in Fine Arts by the School of American Research.\nCollections.\nPaintings by Blumenschein are held in the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, the Taos Art Museum and Fechin House, the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, and the El Paso Art Museum in El Paso, Texas.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61588", "revid": "7178531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61588", "title": "King Baudouin Stadium", "text": "Stadium in Brussels, Belgium\n \n}} Heysel/Heizel and Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn\nThe King Baudouin Stadium ( ; ) is a sports ground in Brussels, Belgium. Located in the north-western district of the City of Brussels, it was built to embellish the Heysel/Heizel Plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition. It was inaugurated on 23 August 1930, with Crown Prince Leopold attending the opening ceremony. The stadium hosted 70,000 at the time. Its name honours King Baudouin, Leopold's successor as King of the Belgians from 1951 to his death in 1993.\nThe stadium is located at 135/2, /, on the border of the Bruparck entertainment park (with the Atomium, Mini-Europe miniature park and Kinepolis cinema). It can be accessed from the metro stations Heysel/Heizel and Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn on line 6.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first version of the King Baudouin Stadium was built in 1929\u201330 by the architect Joseph Van Neck, also chief architect of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition, in a classical modernist style. Its original name was the Jubilee Stadium (, ) because it was inaugurated as part of the centenary celebrations of the Belgian Revolution, with an unofficial Belgium\u2013Netherlands football match.\nIn 1946, the stadium was stripped of the wood of its cycling track, and was renamed the Heysel Stadium (, ), after the neighbourhood in which it is located. In 1971, a tartan track was installed allowing the organisation of athletics competitions. Three years later, in 1974, a new lighting system was installed.\nThe Heysel Stadium hosted European Cup finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985 and Cup Winners' Cup finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 69,000 in 1958.\nMay 1985 disaster.\nDespite its status as Belgium's national stadium, the Heysel Stadium was not well maintained. The stadium's poor condition manifested itself at the 1985 European Cup Final. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. Additionally, the only escape route led upward, and there were only three gates on each short side\u2013nowhere near enough for the 22,000 people standing on the terraces on either side.\nThe stadium's inadequacies had been well known for some time. When Arsenal played there in the early 1980s, its supporters ridiculed it as a \"dump.\" Indeed, the presidents of the two 1985 European finalists, Juventus and Liverpool, had concluded that Heysel was in no condition to host a European Final, especially one featuring two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe at the time. They urged UEFA to move the match to another ground, to no avail. It later emerged that UEFA had only spent half an hour inspecting the stadium.\nOn 29 May 1985, the Heysel Stadium disaster occurred, resulting in the deaths of 39 Juventus spectators in a crowd disorder caused by Liverpool fans before the match. Despite the disaster, the stadium continued to be used for Belgium international games from 1986 to 1990 with only minimal improvements made following the disaster. This was in part because the government had already drawn up plans to remodel the stadium into a 35,000-seat facility. Finally, in 1990, UEFA forced the issue by barring Belgium from hosting a European Final until at least 2000. It also continued to host track and field events and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year.\nModernisations.\nIn 1995, a decade after the disaster, the ground was rebuilt at a cost of BEF 1,500 million (around \u20ac37/$50 million in 1995), and at this time renamed the King Baudouin Stadium, after the Belgian monarch who had died two years previously. All that remains of the old stadium is a renovated gateway near the main entrance. The new structure combined the football ground with a running track and facilities for field events. It was re-opened on 23 August 1995 as the home of the Belgium national football team and is the largest stadium in Belgium; it can seat 50,093 spectators. The remodelled stadium hosted the 1996 European Cup Winners Cup final, as well as the opening game for Euro 2000.\nOn 26 May 2006, the Belgian Football Association decided not to use the King Baudouin Stadium anymore for the national team home matches and for the Cup final, because the gates of stand one were too narrow and the stadium was deemed unsafe. The next match of the national team was thus held at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. The City of Brussels complained that contrary to these claims the stadium was safe, and this complaint was upheld in court. On 6 October 2006, the Belgian Football Association met with representatives of the City of Brussels and they agreed to renew the contract and extend it to 30 June 2008.\nIn March 2019, the Belgian football association announced plans for a new redevelopment of the King Baudouin Stadium. The stadium would be rebuilt to a reduced capacity of 40,000 spectators and renamed to the Golden Generation Arena with a prospective completion date of 2022. That idea was quietly discarded. An architectural firm has never been appointed, an environmental study ordered or a client sought. From the politicians, who were said to be positive about the idea across party lines in the beginning, hardly anything is moving.\nSporting events.\nAssociation football.\nMajor international football matches have taken place in the King Baudouin Stadium: the finals of the European Champion Clubs' Cup in 1958, 1966, 1974 and 1985, those of the Cup of Cups in 1964, 1976, 1980 and 1996, as well as that of the European Championships in 1972 between West Germany and the USSR (3\u20130).\nThe stadium hosted five matches of the UEFA Euro 2000, organised by Belgium and the Netherlands, including the inaugural match between Belgium and Sweden (2\u20131) on 10 June, and the semi-final between Portugal and France (1\u20132) on 28 June.\nUEFA Euro 2000 matches:\nOn 18 February 2021, the Belgian women's team played its first official match there. This was a friendly match against the Netherlands (1\u20136) played as part of the promotion of the triple bid to host the Women's Football World Cup, the third country being Germany. This choice was explained by the work carried out at the Eneco Stadium (where the Red Flames usually play) during this period.\nCycling.\nThe UCI Track Cycling World Championships were organized in the Heysel stadium in 1930 and 1935.\nThe stadium has also been used for road cycling. For instance, stage 2 of both the 1949 and the 1960 Tour de France finished in the Heysel stadion.\nRugby union.\nOn 25 August 2007, Belgium played Argentina in rugby union as part of Argentina's 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations. Argentina defeated Belgium 36\u20138.\nThe stadium was scheduled to witness a rugby union milestone on 19 December 2009, when the Parisian club Stade Fran\u00e7ais planned to take their Heineken Cup home match against Irish club Ulster to the stadium in a match that had sold more than 30,000 tickets. However, heavy snowfall in Brussels on the intended matchday forced the cancellation of what would have been the first Heineken Cup match held in Belgium; the fixture was instead played the following day in Paris.\nThe stadium had another shot at hosting a Heineken Cup match in 2012. On 20 October 2012, English club Saracens took their Heineken Cup pool match against Racing M\u00e9tro to Brussels.\nTennis.\nOn 8 July 2010, the stadium played host to the Best of Belgium gala which featured a tennis match originally scheduled to be between Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. Unfortunately Henin had to pull out and Serena Williams replaced her as the match was played in front of the largest crowd ever for a single match, beating the attendance set at the Battle of the Sexes.\nConcerts.\nEvery year, it hosts major sporting events such as the national football team's matches, the Belgian Football Cup final, the prestigious Van Damme Memorial and more. It has also showcased concerts by some of the world's greatest artists, including the Rolling Stones, U2, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, C\u00e9line Dion, Johnny Hallyday, Robbie Williams, Genesis, Bruce Springsteen, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Rammstein and many more.\nHeysel Stadium Silver Coin.\nTo celebrate the 75th anniversary of the stadium, the Belgian State released a commemorative coin: the \u20ac10 75 years of Heysel Stadium commemorative coin. The obverse depicts an image of a footballer with the stadium in the background. The flags of Belgium and the Netherlands can be seen on top of the stadium as well as the year that the stadium was built.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to resources, as well as what operations are allowed on given resources. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, \nImplementations.\nMany kinds of operating systems implement ACLs or have a historical implementation; the first implementation of ACLs was in the filesystem of Multics in 1965.\nFilesystem ACLs.\nA filesystem ACL is a data structure (usually a table) containing entries that specify individual user or group rights to specific system objects such as programs, processes, or files. These entries are known as access-control entries (ACEs) in the Microsoft Windows NT, OpenVMS, and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Solaris. Each accessible object contains an identifier to its ACL. The privileges or permissions determine specific access rights, such as whether a user can read from, write to, or execute an object. In some implementations, an ACE can control whether or not a user, or group of users, may alter the ACL on an object.\nOne of the first operating systems to provide filesystem ACLs was Multics. PRIMOS featured ACLs at least as early as 1984.\nIn the 1990s the ACL and role-based access control (RBAC) models were extensively tested and used to administer file permissions.\nPOSIX ACL.\nPOSIX 1003.1e/1003.2c working group made an effort to standardize ACLs, resulting in what is now known as \"POSIX.1e ACL\" or simply \"POSIX ACL\". The POSIX.1e/POSIX.2c drafts were withdrawn in 1997 due to participants losing interest for funding, flatulence and the project and turning to more powerful alternatives such as NFSv4 ACL. As of \u00a02019[ [update]], no live sources of the draft could be found on the Internet, but it can still be found in the Internet Archive.\nMost of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux since 2.5.46 or November 2002, FreeBSD, or Solaris) support POSIX.1e ACLs (not necessarily draft\u00a017). ACLs are usually stored in the extended attributes of a file on these systems.\nNFSv4 ACL.\nNFSv4 ACLs are much more powerful than POSIX draft ACLs. Unlike draft POSIX ACLs, NFSv4 ACLs are defined by an actually published standard, as part of the Network File System.\nNFSv4 ACLs are supported by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Examples include AIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X beginning with version 10.4 (\"Tiger\"), or Solaris with ZFS filesystem, support NFSv4 ACLs, which are part of the NFSv4 standard. There are two experimental implementations of NFSv4 ACLs for Linux: NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext3 filesystem and the more recent Richacls, which brings NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext4 filesystem. As with POSIX ACLs, NFSv4 ACLs are usually stored as extended attributes on Unix-like systems.\nNFSv4 ACLs are organized nearly identically to the Windows\u00a0NT ACLs used in NTFS. NFSv4.1 ACLs are a superset of both NT ACLs and POSIX draft ACLs. Samba supports saving the NT ACLs of SMB-shared files in many ways, one of which is as NFSv4-encoded ACLs.\nActive Directory ACLs.\nMicrosoft's Active Directory service implements an LDAP server that stores and disseminates configuration information about users and computers in a domain. Active Directory extends the LDAP specification by adding the same type of access-control list mechanism as Windows\u00a0NT uses for the NTFS filesystem. Windows\u00a02000 then extended the syntax for access-control entries such that they could not only grant or deny access to entire LDAP objects, but also to individual attributes within these objects.\nNetworking ACLs.\nOn some types of proprietary computer hardware (in particular, routers and switches), an access-control list provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer\u00a03, each with a list of hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure access-control lists based on network domain names, this is a questionable idea because individual TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently, the device enforcing the access-control list must separately resolve names to numeric addresses. This presents an additional attack surface for an attacker who is seeking to compromise security of the system which the access-control list is protecting. Both individual servers and routers can have network ACLs. Access-control lists can generally be configured to control both inbound and outbound traffic, and in this context they are similar to firewalls. Like firewalls, ACLs could be subject to security regulations and standards such as PCI\u00a0DSS.\nSQL implementations.\nACL algorithms have been ported to SQL and to relational database systems. Many \"modern\" (2000s and 2010s) SQL-based systems, like enterprise resource planning and content management systems, have used ACL models in their administration modules.\nSchema-indexed ACLs.\nIn 2024, schema-indexed ACL models emerged as a lightweight alternative to traditional JSON-based permission storage. One notable proposal introduced the idea of storing only the indexes of allowed operations, rather than full permission trees. This technique, later formalized as \"SCode ACL\", allows compact encoding of access rights (e.g., `\"0 2 5\"`) based on a predefined flattened schema, making it particularly efficient for use in stateless systems such as JWT tokens or session cookies. The approach gained early traction in developer communities for its minimalism and performance, and has since been adopted in both small-scale and production-grade systems.\nComparing with RBAC.\nThe main alternative to the ACL model is the role-based access-control (RBAC) model. A \"minimal RBAC model\", \"RBACm\", can be compared with an ACL mechanism, \"ACLg\", where only groups are permitted as entries in the ACL. Barkley (1997) showed that \"RBACm\" and \"ACLg\" are equivalent.\nIn modern SQL implementations, ACLs also manage groups and inheritance in a hierarchy of groups. So \"modern ACLs\" can express all that RBAC express and are notably powerful (compared to \"old ACLs\") in their ability to express access-control policy in terms of the way in which administrators view organizations.\nFor data interchange, and for \"high-level comparisons\", ACL data can be translated to XACML.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the founder and editor-in-chief of \"The American Spectator\" and writes with the byline \"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.\"\nBackground.\nTyrrell was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised Roman Catholic. In 1961, he graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois.\nHe attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he was on the swim team under coach James \"Doc\" Counsilman. While at Indiana University, he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi, living in a chapter house where Steve Tesich resided. He also has a master's degree in American Diplomatic History.\nCareer.\nArkansas Project.\nTyrrell was one of those behind the Arkansas Project, financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, to use the \"Spectator\" to damage Bill Clinton\u2019s reputation. He detailed the project's purposes and accomplishments in his 2007 book \"The Clinton Crack-Up: The Boy President's Life after the White House\".\nForced sale.\nIn 2000, government investigations of \"The American Spectator\" caused Tyrrell to sell the magazine to venture capitalist George Gilder. In 2003, Gilder, having a series of financial and legal setbacks, resold the magazine back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the organization under which the magazine was originally started, for a dollar. The magazine was initially called \"The Alternative\". The name of the owner was changed to the American Spectator Foundation. The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, DC, area. Later that year, former book publisher Alfred S. Regnery became the magazine's publisher. By 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000.\n1984 media appearance.\nA noted political commentator, Tyrrell appeared on a 1984 episode of \"Firing Line\" with William F. Buckley Jr., in which he debated with Christopher Hitchens the premise that the liberal movement was a failure, as asserted in Tyrrell's book \"The Liberal Crack-up\".\nCriticisms of homosexuality.\nTyrrell was quoted in a 1994 article by \"New York Times\" contributor Dinitia Smith saying that homosexuals are bringing about \"an end to community,\" and \"AIDS is lethal, but they're forever trying to magnify a sensible point out of proportion. Heterosexual cases are practically nonexistent. The latest studies show that only 2 to 3 percent of Americans are homosexuals. Kinsey was wrong in saying it was 10 percent. There are thousands of years of moral teaching suggesting homosexuality is wrong.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn 1972, Tyrrell married first wife Judy Mathews, with whom he had three children; they divorced in 1988. In 1998, Tyrrell married Jeanne M. Hauch at Holy Rosary Church, Washington, D.C.\nTyrrell is a practicing Catholic. He obtained a canonical annulment of his first marriage before his present union.\nHe served on the Board of Selectors of the Jefferson Awards Foundation.\nTyrrell is the great-great-grandson of Patrick D. Tyrrell, an immigrant from Ireland and a detective in the United States Secret Service in the 1870s, involved in foiling the plot to steal the body of Abraham Lincoln in 1876.\nWorks.\nTyrrell has written for \"Time\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", the \"London Spectator\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The Washington Times\".

{"id": "61593", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61593", "title": "Echinococcosis", "text": "Parasitic disease of tapeworms of the Echinococcus type\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nEchinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the \"Echinococcus\" type. The two main types of the disease are \"cystic echinococcosis\" and \"alveolar echinococcosis\". Less common forms include \"polycystic echinococcosis\" and \"unicystic echinococcosis\".\nThe disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size. \"Alveolar\" disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected, the patient may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, along with yellow-toned skin discoloration from developed jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and coughing.\nThe infection is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is ingested or by close contact with an infected animal. The eggs are released in the stool of meat-eating animals that are infected by the parasite. Commonly infected animals include dogs, foxes, and wolves. For these animals to become infected they must eat the organs of an animal that contains the cysts such as sheep or rodents. The type of disease that occurs in human patients depends on the type of \"Echinococcus\" causing the infection. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasound though computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. Blood tests looking for antibodies against the parasite may be helpful as may biopsy.\nPrevention of cystic disease is by treating dogs that may carry the disease and vaccination of sheep. Treatment is often difficult. The cystic disease may be drained through the skin, followed by medication. Sometimes this type of disease is just watched. The \"alveolar\" form often requires surgical intervention, followed by medications. The medication used is albendazole, which may be needed for years. The \"alveolar\" disease may result in death.\nThe disease occurs in most areas of the world and currently affects about one million people. In some areas of South America, Africa, and Asia, up to 10% of certain populations are affected. In 2015, the cystic form caused about 1,200 deaths; down from 2,000 in 1990. The economic cost of the disease is estimated to be around US$3 billion a year. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and belongs to the group of diseases known as helminthiases (worm infections). It can affect other animals such as pigs, cows and horses.\nTerminology used in this field is crucial since echinococcosis requires the involvement of specialists from nearly all disciplines. In 2020, an international effort of scientists, from 16 countries, led to a detailed consensus on terms to be used or rejected for the genetics, epidemiology, biology, immunology, and clinical aspects of echinococcosis.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIn the human manifestation of the disease, \"E. granulosus\", \"E. multilocularis\", \"E. oligarthrus\" and \"E. vogeli\" is localized in the liver (in 75% of cases), the lungs (in 5\u201315% of cases), and other organs in the body such as the spleen, brain, heart, and kidneys (in 10\u201320% of cases). In people who are infected with \"E. granulosus\" and therefore have cystic echinococcosis, the disease develops as a slow-growing mass in the body. These slow-growing masses, often called cysts, are also found in people who are infected with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis.\nThe cysts found in those with cystic echinococcosis are usually filled with a clear fluid called hydatid fluid, are spherical, typically consist of one compartment, and are usually only found in one area of the body. While the cysts found in those with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are similar to those found in those with cystic echinococcosis, the alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis cysts usually have multiple compartments and have infiltrative as opposed to expansive growth.\nDepending on the location of the cyst in the body, the person could be asymptomatic even though the cysts have grown to be very large or be symptomatic even if the cysts are tiny. If the person is symptomatic, the symptoms will depend largely on where the cysts are located. For instance, if the person has cysts in the lungs and is symptomatic, they will have a cough, shortness of breath, and/or pain in the chest.\nOn the other hand, if the person has cysts in the liver and is symptomatic, they will experience abdominal pain, abnormal abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly with an abdominal mass, jaundice, fever, and/or anaphylactic reaction. In addition, if the cysts were to rupture while in the body, whether during surgical extraction of the cysts or by trauma to the body, the person would most likely go into anaphylactic shock and have high fever, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling) of the lips and eyelids, dyspnea, stridor, and rhinorrhea.\nUnlike intermediate hosts, definitive hosts are usually not hurt very much by the infection. Sometimes, a lack of certain vitamins and minerals can be caused in the host by the very high demand of the parasite.\nThe incubation period for all species of \"Echinococcus\" can be months to years or even decades. It largely depends on the location of the cyst in the body and how fast the cyst is growing.\nCause.\nLike many other parasite infections, the course of \"Echinococcus\" infection is complex. The worm has a life cycle that requires definitive hosts and intermediate hosts. Definitive hosts are normally carnivores such as dogs, while intermediate hosts are usually herbivores such as sheep and cattle. Humans function as accidental\nhosts, because they are usually a dead end for the parasitic infection cycle, unless eaten by dogs or wolves after death.\nLife cycle.\nAn adult worm resides in the small intestine of a definitive host. A single gravid proglottid releases eggs that are passed in the feces of the definitive host. The egg is then ingested by an intermediate host. The egg then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host and releases an oncosphere that penetrates the intestinal wall and moves through the circulatory system into different organs, in particular the liver and lungs. Once it has invaded these organs, the oncosphere develops into a cyst. The cyst then slowly enlarges, creating protoscolices (juvenile scolices), and daughter cysts within the cyst. The definitive host then becomes infected after ingesting the cyst-containing organs of the infected intermediate host. After ingestion, the protoscolices attach to the intestine. They then develop into adult worms and the cycle starts all over again.\nEggs.\n\"Echinococcus\" eggs contain an embryo that is called an oncosphere or hexacanth. The name of this embryo stems from the fact that these embryos have six hooklets. The eggs are passed through the feces of the definitive host and it is the ingestion of these eggs that leads to infection in the intermediate host.\nLarval/hydatid cyst stage.\nFrom the embryo released from an egg develops a \"hydatid cyst\", which grows to about 5\u201310\u00a0cm within the first year and can survive within organs for years. Cysts sometimes grow to be so large that by the end of several years or even decades, they can contain several liters of fluid. Once a cyst has reached a diameter of 1\u00a0cm, its wall differentiates into a thick outer, non-cellular membrane, which covers the thin germinal epithelium. From this epithelium, cells begin to grow within the cyst. These cells then become vacuolated and are known as brood capsules, which are the parts of the parasite from which protoscolices bud. Often, daughter cysts also form within cysts.\nAdult worm.\n\"Echinococcus\" adult worms develop from protoscolices and are typically 6\u00a0mm or less in length and have a scolex, neck, and typically three proglottids, one of which is immature, another of which is mature and the third of which is gravid (or containing eggs). The scolex of the adult worm contains four suckers and a rostellum that has about 25\u201350 hooks.\nMorphological differences.\nThe major morphological difference among different species of \"Echinococcus\" is the length of the tapeworm. \"E. granulosus\" is approximately 2 to 7\u00a0mm while \"E. multilocularis\" is often smaller and is 4\u00a0mm or less. On the other hand, \"E. vogeli\" is found to be up to 5.6\u00a0mm long and \"E. oligarthrus\" is found to be up to 2.9\u00a0mm long. In addition to the difference in length, there are also differences in the hydatid cysts of the different species. For instance, in \"E. multilocularis\", the cysts have an ultra thin limiting membrane and the germinal epithelium may bud externally. Furthermore, \"E. granulosus\" cysts are unilocular and full of fluid while \"E. multilocularis\" cysts contain little fluid and are multilocular. For \"E. vogeli\", its hydatid cysts are large and are polycystic since the germinal membrane of the hydatid cyst proliferates both inward, to create septa that divide the hydatid into sections, and outward, to create new cysts. Like \"E. granulosus\" cysts, \"E. vogeli\" cysts are filled with fluid.\nTransmission.\nAs one can see from the life cycles illustrated above, all disease-causing species of \"Echinococcus\" are transmitted to intermediate hosts via the ingestion of eggs and are transmitted to definitive hosts by eating infected, cyst-containing organs. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts that become infected by handling soil, dirt, or animal hair that contains eggs.\nWhile there are no biological or mechanical vectors for the adult or larval form of any \"Echinococcus\" species, coprophagic flies, carrion birds and arthropods can act as mechanical vectors for the eggs.\nAberrant cases.\nThere are a few aberrant cases in which carnivores play the role of the intermediate hosts. Examples are domestic cats with hydatid cysts of \"E. granulosus.\"\nDiagnosis.\nClassification.\nThe most common form found in humans is cystic echinococcosis (also known as unilocular echinococcosis), which is caused by \"Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato\". The second most common form is alveolar echinococcosis (also known as alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolar hydatid disease, alveolococcosis, multilocular echinococcosis, \"small fox tapeworm\"), which is caused by \"Echinococcus multilocularis\" and the third is polycystic echinococcosis (also known as human polycystic hydatid disease, neotropical echinococcosis), which is caused by \"Echinococcus vogeli\" and very rarely, \"Echinococcus oligarthrus\". Alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are rarely diagnosed in humans and are not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis, but polycystic echinococcosis is relatively new on the medical scene and is often left out of conversations dealing with echinococcosis, and alveolar echinococcosis is a serious disease that has a significantly high fatality rate, and may have the potential to become an emerging disease in many countries.\nCystic.\nA formal diagnosis of any type of echinococcosis requires a combination of tools that involve imaging techniques, histopathology, or nucleic acid detection and serology. For cystic echinococcosis diagnosis, imaging is the main method\u2014while serology tests (such as indirect hemagglutination, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), immunoblots, or latex agglutination) that use antigens specific for \"E. granulosus\" verify the imaging results. The imaging technique of choice for cystic echinococcosis is ultrasonography, since it is not only able to visualize the cysts in the body's organs, but it is also inexpensive, non-invasive and gives instant results. In addition to ultrasonography, both MRI and CT scans can and are often used although an MRI is often preferred to CT scans when diagnosing cystic echinococcosis since it gives better visualization of liquid areas within the tissue.\nAlveolar.\nAs with cystic echinococcosis, ultrasonography is the imaging technique of choice for alveolar echinococcosis and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans can detect the largest number of lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of alveolar echinococcosis. MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for \"E. multilocularis\" antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also important to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis than for cystic echinococcosis since they tend to be more reliable for alveolar echinococcosis since more antigens specific for \"E. multilocularis\" are available. In addition to imaging and serology, identification of \"E. multilocularis\" infection via PCR or a histological examination of a tissue biopsy from the person is another way to diagnose alveolar echinococcosis.\nPolycystic.\nSimilar to the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis and cystic echinococcosis, the diagnosis of polycystic echinococcosis uses imaging techniques, in particular ultrasonography and CT scans, to detect polycystic structures within the person's body. However, imaging is not the preferred method of diagnosis since the method that is currently considered the standard is the isolation of protoscoleces during surgery or after the person's death, and the identification of definitive features of \"E. oligarthrus\" and \"E. vogeli\" in these isolated protoscoleces. This is the main way that PE is diagnosed, but some current studies show that PCR may identify \"E. oligarthrus\" and \"E. vogeli\" in people's tissues. The only drawback of using PCR to diagnose polycystic echinococcosis is that there aren't many genetic sequences that can be used for PCR that are specific only \"E. oligarthrus\" or \"E. vogeli\".\nPrevention.\nCystic echinococcosis.\nSeveral different strategies are currently being used to prevent and control cystic echinococcosis (CE). Most of these various methods try to prevent and control CE by targeting the major risk factors for the disease and the way it is transmitted. For instance, health education programs focused on cystic echinococcosis and its agents, and improved water sanitation attempt to target poor education and poor drinking water sources, which are both risk factors for contracting echinococcosis. Furthermore, since humans often come into contact with \"Echinococcus\" eggs via touching contaminated soil, animal feces and animal hair, another prevention strategy is improved hygiene. In addition to targeting risk factors and transmission, control and prevention strategies of cystic echinococcosis also aim at intervening at certain points of the parasite's life cycle, in particular, the infection of hosts (especially dogs) that reside with or near humans. For example, many countries endemic to echinococcosis have researched programs geared at de-worming dogs and vaccinating dogs and other livestock, such as sheep, that also act as hosts for \"E. granulosus\".\nProper disposal of carcasses and offal after home slaughter is difficult in poor and remote communities and therefore dogs readily have access to offal from livestock, thus completing the parasite cycle of \"Echinococcus granulosus\" and putting communities at risk of cystic echinococcosis. Boiling livers and lungs that contain hydatid cysts for 30 minutes has been proposed as a simple, efficient, and energy- and time-saving way to kill the infectious larvae.\nAlveolar echinococcosis.\nSeveral strategies are geared towards the prevention and control of alveolar echinococcosis\u2014most of which are similar to those for cystic echinococcosis. For instance, health education programs, improved water sanitation, improved hygiene, and de-worming of hosts (particularly red foxes) are all effective in preventing and controlling the spread of alveolar echinococcosis. Unlike cystic echinococcosis, however, where there is a vaccine against \"E. granulosus\", there is currently no canidae or livestock vaccine against \"E. multilocularis\".\nPolycystic echinococcosis.\nWhile several control and prevention strategies deal with cystic and alveolar echinococcosis, there are few methods to control and prevent polycystic echinococcosis. This is probably because polycystic echinococcosis is restricted to Central and South America and the way that humans become accidental hosts of \"E. oligarthrus\" and \"E. vogeli\" is still not completely understood.\nHuman vaccines.\nCurrently, there are no human vaccines against any form of echinococcosis. However, studies are being conducted that are looking at possible vaccine candidates for an effective human vaccine against echinococcosis.\nTreatment.\nCystic.\nA number of therapy options are presently available. Treatment with albendazole, whether combined or not with praziquantel, is useful for smaller, uncomplicated cysts (&lt; 5\u00a0cm). Only 30% of cysts disappear with medical treatment alone. Albendazole is preferred twice a day for 1\u20135 months. An alternative to albendazole is mebendazole for at least 3 to 6 months.\nSurgery is indicated for bigger liver cysts (&gt; 10 cm), cysts at risk of rupture and/or complicated cysts. A laparoscopic approach provides excellent cure rates with minimal morbidity and mortality. The radical technique (total cystopericystectomy) is preferable because of its lower risk for postoperative abdominal infection, biliary fistula, and overall morbidity. Conservative techniques are appropriate in endemic areas where surgery is performed by nonspecialist surgeons.\nPAIR (puncture-aspiration-injection-reaspiration) is an innovative technique representing an alternative to surgery. PAIR is a minimally invasive procedure that involves three steps: puncture and needle aspiration of the cyst, injection of a scolicidal solution for 20\u201330 min, and cyst-re-aspiration and final irrigation. People who undergo PAIR typically take albendazole or mebendazole from 7 days before the procedure until 28 days after the procedure. It is indicated for inoperable cases and/or patients who reject surgery, for recurrence after surgery, and lack of response to medical treatment. There have been several studies that suggest that PAIR with medical therapy is more effective than surgery in terms of disease recurrence, and morbidity and mortality.\nThere is currently research and studies looking at new treatments involving percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA) of the germinal layer in the cyst using a radiofrequency ablation device. This form of treatment is still relatively new and requires much more testing before being widely used.\nAlveolar.\nFor alveolar echinococcosis, surgical removal of cysts combined with chemotherapy (using albendazole and/or mebendazole) for up to two years after surgery is the only sure way to completely cure the disease. However, in inoperable cases, chemotherapy by itself can also be used. In treatment using just chemotherapy, one could use either mebendazole in three doses or albendazole in two doses. Since chemotherapy on its own is not guaranteed to be completely rid of the disease, people are often kept on the drugs for extended periods (i.e. more than 6 months, years). In addition to surgery and chemotherapy, liver transplants are being looked into as a form of treatment for alveolar echinococcosis although it is seen as incredibly risky since it often leads to echinococcosis re-infection in the person afterwards.\nPolycystic.\nSince polycystic echinococcosis is constrained to such a particular area of the world and is not well described or found in many people, treatment of polycystic echinococcosis is less defined than that of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis. While surgical removal of cysts was the treatment of choice for the previous two types of echinococcosis, chemotherapy is the recommended treatment approach for polycystic echinococcosis. While albendazole is the preferred drug, mebendazole can also be used if the treatment is to be for an extended period. Only if chemotherapy fails or if the lesions are very small is surgery advised.\nEpidemiology.\nRegions.\nVery few countries are considered to be completely free of \"E. granulosus\". Areas of the world where there is a high rate of infection often coincide with rural, grazing areas where dogs can ingest organs from infected animals.\n\"E. multilocularis\" mainly occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, including central Europe and the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. However, its distribution was not always like this. For instance, until the end of the 1980s, \"E. multilocularis\" endemic areas in Europe were known to exist only in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. But during the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a shift in the distribution of \"E. multilocularis\" as the infection rate of foxes escalated in certain parts of France and Germany.\nAs a result, several new endemic areas were found in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and surrounding countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Italy. There is also evidence showing that the Baltic Countries are endemic areas.\nWhile alveolar echinococcosis is not extremely common, it is believed that in the coming years, it will be an emerging or re-emerging disease in certain countries as a result of \"E. multilocularis\"' ability to spread.\nUnlike the previous two species of \"Echinococcus\", \"E. vogeli\" and \"E. oligarthrus\" are limited to Central and South America. Furthermore, infections by \"E. vogeli\" and \"E. oligarthrus\" (polycystic echinococcosis) are considered to be the rarest form of echinococcosis.\nDeaths.\nAs of 2010, it caused about 1,200 deaths, down from 2,000 in 1990.\nHistory.\nEchinococcosis is a disease that has been recognized by humans for centuries. There has been mention of it in the Talmud. It was also recognized by ancient scholars such as Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen and Rhazes. The recommended treatments were based on herbs like \"thymus vulgaris\" and raw garlic. Although echinococcosis has been well known for the past two thousand years, it was not until the past couple of hundred years that real progress was made in determining and describing its parasitic origin. The first step towards figuring out the cause of echinococcosis occurred during the 17th century when Francesco Redi illustrated that the hydatid cysts of echinococcosis were of \"animal\" origin. Then, in 1766, Pierre Simon Pallas predicted that these hydatid cysts found in infected humans were larval stages of tapeworms.\nA few decades afterward, in 1782, Goeze accurately described the cysts and the tapeworm heads, while in 1786 \"E. granulosus\" was accurately described by Batsch. Half a century later, during the 1850s, Karl von Siebold showed through a series of experiments that \"Echinococcus\" cysts do cause adult tapeworms in dogs. Shortly after this, in 1863, \"E. multilocularis\" was identified by Rudolf Leuckart. Then, during the early to mid-1900s, the more distinct features of \"E. granulosus\" and \"E. multilocularis\", their life cycles, and how they cause disease were more fully described as more and more people began researching and performing experiments and studies. While \"E. granulosus\" and \"E. multilocularis\" were both linked to human echinococcosis before or shortly after the 20th century, it was not until the mid-1900s that \"E. oligarthrus\" and \"E. vogeli\" were identified as and shown as being causes of human echinococcosis.\nTwo calcified objects recovered from a 3rd- to 4th-century grave of an adolescent in Amiens (Northern France) were interpreted as probable hydatid cysts. A study of remains from two 8,000-year-old cemeteries in Siberia showed the presence of echinococcosis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's novel \"The Lord of the Rings\". He was the 26th ruling Steward of Gondor, dying by suicide in the besieged city of Minas Tirith during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\nDenethor is depicted as embittered and despairing as the forces of Mordor close in on Gondor. Critics have noted the contrast between Denethor and both Th\u00e9oden, the good king of Rohan, and Aragorn, the true king of Gondor. Others have likened Denethor to Shakespeare's King Lear, both rulers falling into dangerous despair.\nIn \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, Peter Jackson chose to depict Denethor, played by John Noble, as greedy and self-indulgent, quite unlike Tolkien's powerful leader.\nFictional biography.\nIn Tolkien's Middle-earth, Denethor is the first son and third child of Ecthelion II, a Steward of Gondor. He marries Finduilas, daughter of Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth. She gives birth to two sons, Boromir and Faramir, but dies when they are ten and five years old, respectively. Denethor never remarries, and becomes grimmer and more silent than before. He is a man of great will, foresight, and strength, but also overconfident. Gandalf describes him as \"proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power [than Th\u00e9oden of Rohan], though he is not called a king.\" Gandalf further comments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnlike Saruman, Denethor is too strong to be corrupted directly by Sauron. He begins secretly using a \"palant\u00edr\" to probe Sauron's strength, incorrectly insisting he can control it. The effort ages him quickly, and the impression of Sauron's overwhelming force that he gains from the \"palant\u00edr\" depresses him greatly, as Sauron biases what Denethor sees. Boromir's death depresses Denethor further. Nonetheless he continues to fight Sauron until the forces of Mordor arrive at the gates of Minas Tirith, at which point he loses all hope. In the published essay on the \"palant\u00edri\", Tolkien wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He [Denethor] must have guessed that the Ithil-stone [Sauron's \"palant\u00edr\"] was in evil hands, and risked contact with it, trusting his strength. His trust was not entirely unjustified. Sauron failed to dominate him and could only influence him by deceits.\nSaruman fell under the domination of Sauron... [while] Denethor remained steadfast in his rejection of Sauron, but was made to believe that his defeat was inevitable, and so fell into despair. The reasons for this difference were no doubt that in the first place Denethor was a man of great strength of will and maintained the integrity of his personality until the final blow of the (apparently) mortal wound of his only surviving son.\nAs invasion becomes certain, Denethor orders the warning beacons of Gondor to be lit, and summons forces from Gondor's provinces and from Rohan, while the people of Minas Tirith are sent away to safety. Denethor orders his son Faramir to take his men to defend the river crossing at Osgiliath and the great wall of the \"Rammas Echor\". Faramir is wounded, apparently mortally; his body is carried back to the city.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n 'Hope on then!' laughed Denethor. 'Do I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne, north, south, or west... So! With the left hand thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with the right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me. But I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not be thy tool! I am Steward of the House of Anarion. I will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart. Even were his claim proved to me, still he comes but of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a one, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity.'\nDenethor, grief-struck by the apparent loss of his son, orders his servants to burn him alive on a funeral pyre prepared for himself and Faramir in Rath D\u00ednen. He breaks the white rod of his office over his knee, casting the pieces into the flames. He lies down on the pyre and so dies, clasping the \"palant\u00edr\" in his hands. Faramir is saved from the flames by Gandalf.\nAnalysis.\nCharacter flaws.\nDenethor's madness and despair has been compared to that of Shakespeare's King Lear. Both men are first outraged when their children (Faramir and Cordelia, respectively) refuse to aid them, but then grieve upon their children's death \u2013 which is only perceived in the case of Faramir. According to Michael D. C. Drout, both Denethor and Lear \"despair of God's mercy\", something extremely dangerous in a leader who has to defend his realm. Sauron drives Denethor to suicide by showing him in the Palant\u00edr the Black Fleet approaching Gondor, while concealing the fact that the ships are carrying Aragorn's troops, coming to Gondor's rescue. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that this forms part of a pattern around the use of the Palant\u00edr, that one should not try to see the future but should trust in one's luck and make one's own mind up, courageously facing one's duty in each situation. The medievalist Elizabeth Solopova comments that unlike Aragorn, Denethor is incapable of displaying what Tolkien in \"\" called \"northern courage\", namely, the spirit to carry on in the face of certain defeat and death. Alex Davis, in the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", writes that many critics have examined his fall and corrupted leadership, whereas Richard Purtill identifies Denethor's pride and egoism, a man who considers Gondor his property.\nDenethor vs Th\u00e9oden.\nThe Tolkien scholar Jane Chance contrasts Denethor both with another \"Germanic king\", Th\u00e9oden, and with the \"true king\" of Gondor, Aragorn. In Chance's view, Theoden represents good, Denethor evil; she notes that their names are almost anagrams, and that where Theoden welcomes the Hobbit Merry Brandybuck into his service with loving friendship, Denethor accepts Merry's friend Pippin Took with a harsh contract of fealty. Chance writes that Tolkien further sets both Theoden and Denethor against the \"Christian lord\" Aragorn. In her opinion, Denethor \"fails as a father, a master, a steward, and a rational man,\" giving in to despair, whereas Aragorn is brave in battle and gentle with his people, and has the Christlike attribute of healing.\nShippey makes the same comparison, extending it to numerous elements of the two Men's stories, writing that Th\u00e9oden lives by a theory of Northern courage, and dies through Denethor's despair.\nAdaptations.\nEarly versions.\nDenethor was voiced by William Conrad in Rankin/Bass's 1980 animated adaptation of \"The Return of the King\", and by Peter Vaughan in BBC Radio's 1981 serialization.\nPeter Jackson's films.\nDenethor is played by John Noble in Peter Jackson's film \"\". The film portrays Denethor far more negatively than the novel. Tolkien calls Denethor\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShippey commented that where Tolkien's Denethor is a cold ruler doing his best for his country, Jackson's is made to look greedy and self-indulgent; Shippey calls the scene where he gobbles a meal, while his son Faramir has been sent out in a hopeless fight, a \"blatant [use] of cinematic suggestion\".\n\"Christianity Today\" wrote that the films \"missed the moral and religious depths\" of the book, such as when they turned \"the awful subtlety and complexity of evil\" into something trivially obvious. It gave as an instance the caricaturing of the powerful Steward of Gondor, Denethor as \"a snarling and drooling oaf rather than a noble pessimist\".\nDaniel Timmons writes in the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" that Jackson characterizes Denethor and others in a way \"far from Tolkien's text\", but that the film version successfully \"dramatizes the insidious temptation to evil\", and that through \"the falls of Saruman, Denethor, and Sauron, we see the bitter fruits of the lust for power and its corrupting influence.\"\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61599", "revid": "232617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61599", "title": "Boromir", "text": "Fictional character in The Lord of the Rings\nBoromir is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He appears in the first two volumes of \"The Lord of the Rings\" (\"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"The Two Towers\"), and is mentioned in the last volume, \"The Return of the King\". He was the heir apparent of Denethor II (the 26th Steward of Gondor) and the elder brother of Faramir. In the course of the story Boromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring.\nBoromir is portrayed as a noble character who believed passionately in the greatness of his kingdom and fought indomitably for it. His great stamina and physical strength, together with a forceful and commanding personality, made him a widely admired commander in Gondor's army and the favourite of his father Denethor. As a member of the Fellowship, his desperation to save his country ultimately drove him to betray his companions and attempt to seize the Ring, but he was redeemed by his repentance and brave last stand.\nCommentators have remarked on Boromir's vainglory and desire for the Ring. They have compared him both to other proud Tolkien characters such as F\u00ebanor and T\u00farin Turambar, and to medieval heroes like Roland, who also blew a horn in battle and was killed in the wilderness. His boat-funeral, too, has been likened to Scyld Scefing's ship-burial in \"Beowulf\".\nBoromir appears in animated and live-action films of \"Lord of the Rings\", and in radio and television versions.\nAppearances.\nBoromir is the son of Denethor II and Lady Finduilas of Dol Amroth. He has a younger brother Faramir. A year after Faramir was born their father became the ruling Steward of Gondor, and Boromir became heir apparent, inheriting the Horn of Gondor. When Boromir's mother Finduilas dies, he is only 10.\nDenethor always favours Boromir over Faramir; he loves Boromir \"too much, perhaps; the more so because they were unlike\".\nIn response to prophetic dreams that come to Faramir and later to himself, Boromir claims the quest of riding to Rivendell. His journey lasts a hundred and eleven days, and he travels through \"roads forgotten\" to reach Rivendell, though, as he says, \"few knew where it lay\". Boromir loses his horse while crossing the Greyflood and travels the rest of the way on foot.\n\"The Fellowship of the Ring\".\nIn \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", Boromir arrives at Rivendell just as the Council of Elrond is commencing. There he tells of Gondor's attempts to keep the power of Mordor at bay. He tries to persuade the council to let him take the One Ring to defend Gondor, but is told that it would corrupt and destroy its user, and alert Sauron to its presence. He accepts this for the moment. He agrees to accompany Aragorn to Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith, and since their path lies with the Fellowship for the first part of the journey, he pledges to protect the Ring-bearer, Frodo.\nBoromir accompanies the Fellowship south from Rivendell. Before departing, he sounds the Horn of Gondor, saying he \"would not go forth like a thief into the night\". On the journey south, he questions the wisdom of their leader Gandalf. On the Fellowship's attempt to pass over the Misty Mountains, he advises that firewood be collected before the attempt to climb Caradhras, saving them from freezing in a blizzard. In the retreat from Caradhras, Boromir proves his strength as he and Aragorn force a way through shoulder-high snowbanks back down the mountain.\nThe Fellowship then pass under the mountains through the caverns of Moria where Gandalf is killed, and Aragorn becomes their guide. At the borders of the Elven realm of Lothl\u00f3rien, Boromir is unnerved by the thought of entering, pleading with Aragorn to find another way \"though it led through a hedge of swords\"; he cites stories of elvish witchcraft, and the \"strange paths\" they had already taken which had caused Gandalf's death. Once in L\u00f3rien, Boromir is greatly disturbed by Galadriel's testing of his mind, telling Aragorn \"not to be too sure of this lady and her purposes\". On parting, Galadriel gives Boromir a golden belt and an Elven-cloak.\nBoromir had always planned to go to Minas Tirith, and despite the consensus reached at Rivendell that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, he urges the Fellowship to accompany him to Minas Tirith before going on to Mordor. As Frodo ponders his course from Parth Galen, Boromir privately urges him to use the Ring in Gondor's defence, rather than to \"throw it away\". Finally, he succumbs to the temptation to take the Ring for himself, justifying this by his duty to his people and his belief in his own integrity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter seeing that Frodo is unconvinced, Boromir half begs, half commands him to at least lend the Ring, and when Frodo still refuses, Boromir leaps to seize it. Frodo vanishes by putting on the Ring and flees, intending to continue the quest alone. Boromir, realizing his betrayal, immediately repents of his actions and weeps. Searching unsuccessfully for Frodo, he tells the Fellowship of Frodo's disappearance, though not of his own misdeeds. The hobbits in a frenzy scatter to look for Frodo. Aragorn, suspecting Boromir's part in Frodo's flight, orders him to follow and protect Merry and Pippin. The Fellowship is attacked by a band of orcs.\n\"The Two Towers\".\nFighting to defend Merry and Pippin, Boromir is mortally wounded by orc-arrows. In Pippin's words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBlasts from Boromir's horn alert Aragorn, but he comes too late to prevent the hobbits' capture. As Boromir lies dying, he remorsefully confesses to attempting to take the Ring from Frodo. He urges Aragorn to save Minas Tirith, as he himself has failed. Aragorn reassures him that he has not failed, that indeed \"few have gained such a victory\". Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas place Boromir's body in one of their Elven boats, with his sword, belt, cloak, broken horn, and the weapons of his slain foes about him. They set the boat adrift in the river toward the Falls of Rauros, singing a lament for his funeral.\nThree days later, Faramir, to his and their father's great grief, see the boat bearing his dead brother floating down the River.\nNames and titles.\nBoromir is the son and heir apparent of Denethor, the ruling Steward of Gondor. Appendix A calls him \"Captain of the White Tower\", while Faramir called him \"High Warden of the White Tower\" and \"our Captain-General\".\n\"Boromir\" was described by Tolkien as a name \"of mixed form\"; it combines Sindarin \"bor(on)-\" 'steadfast' and Quenya \"m\u00edre\" 'jewel'. But the Stewards of Gondor also often bore names \"remembered in the songs and histories of the First Age\", regardless of meaning, and the name \"Boromir\" did appear during the First Age in \"The Silmarillion\". The eleventh steward of Gondor, Denethor I, had as well a son called Boromir who was described as a great warrior. This might have been an inspiration for Denethor II to name his first son.\nAnalysis.\nMorality.\nBoromir's desire for the Ring has been described as well-intentioned but uninformed by the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a belief that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. Boromir's hubris makes him prey to the malign power of the Ring, and he seals his own doom when he attacks Frodo to seize it. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, in a manner similar to Virgil's character Turnus. He speaks of using the Ring in the service of Gondor, but his talk of \"strength in a just cause\" indicates, writes the Tolkien critic Tom Shippey, only how matters would begin. He comments that Boromir never quite says \"the end justifies the means\", though the thought makes his corrupted behaviour entirely believable.\nIn Christian terms, Boromir atones for his assault on Frodo by single-handedly but vainly defending Merry and Pippin from orcs, which illustrates the Catholic theme of the importance of good intention, especially at the point of death. This is clear from Gandalf's statement: \"But he [Boromir] escaped in the end... It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir's sake.\"\nBoromir has been likened to other Tolkien characters such as F\u00ebanor or T\u00farin Turambar who display vainglorious excess, a trait in leaders that Tolkien despised. The character of Boromir has been compared to the legendary medieval hero Roland. Both blow a horn in the distress of battle and both are eventually killed in the wilderness while defending their companions, although Roland is portrayed as blameless and heroic throughout. Further, Roland's death gives the appearance of signalling the end of the ruling dynasty.\nBoat-funeral.\nThe ship-burials of the seafaring Numenoreans in \"The Lost Road and Other Writings\" have been compared to those of the Viking age as described in the \"Prose Edda\" and in the Old English poem \"Beowulf\"; Boromir is similarly given a boat-funeral. As with Scyld Scefing's funeral ship in \"Beowulf\", no-one knows where the boat goes to in the end, but for Tolkien the suggestion that it goes to a mysterious land in the uttermost West was fascinating, and he developed it at length in \"The Lost Road\".\nPortrayal in adaptations.\nIn both Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film and in the subsequent BBC Radio serial, Boromir is played by Michael Graham Cox. \nBoromir is played by Carl-Kristian Rundman in the 1993 Finnish miniseries \"Hobitit\".\nIn Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, Boromir is played by Sean Bean. His line \"One does not simply walk into Mordor\" became famous enough for Bean to comment that the \"one does not simply\" meme (with variant endings) would \"probably be my unintended legacy\". In a departure from the structure of Tolkien's book, Boromir's death is shown at the end of \"\" (2001), instead of being related at the beginning of \"The Two Towers\".\nIn \"\" (2002), Boromir appears in the theatrical version only briefly during the beginning flashback sequence of Gandalf's fight with the Balrog in Moria. The Extended Edition adds two additional flashbacks: first when Faramir remembers finding Boromir's body and his cloven horn in the elven boat washed up on shore; and in longer flashback (the only scene of the film trilogy where Boromir and Faramir are seen speaking to each other), after Boromir's victory in Osgiliath and before his departure for Rivendell. The two brothers are seen celebrating and laughing before their father interrupts, asking him to go to Rivendell to seek the One Ring. Here Boromir apparently knows that \"Isildur's Bane\" is the One Ring, and he is chosen by his father, despite his reluctance to go, in response to a summons from Elrond.\nIn \"\" (2003), Boromir appears in the theatrical version during a brief flashback as Pippin remembers his heroic self-sacrifice. In the Extended Edition of the film, Boromir appears briefly when Denethor looks at Faramir and imagines for a moment that he sees Boromir walking towards him, smiling.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The form also lacks punctuation, diacritics, or distinguished letter case. \nIn the West, the oldest Greek and Latin inscriptions used word dividers to separate words in sentences; however, Classical Greek and late Classical Latin both employed as the norm. The \"scriptio continua\" is also known as Latin skeleton script.\nHistory.\nAlthough is evidenced in most Classic Greek and Classic Latin manuscripts, different writing styles are depicted in documents that date back even further. Classical Latin often used the interpunct, especially in monuments and inscriptions.\nThe earliest texts in Classical Greek that used the Greek alphabet, as opposed to Linear B, were formatted in a constant string of capital letters from right to left. Later, that evolved to boustrophedon, which included lines written in alternating directions.\nThe Latin language and the related Italic languages first came to be written using alphabetic scripts adapted from the Etruscan alphabet (itself ultimately derived from the Greek alphabet). Initially, Latin texts commonly marked word divisions by points, but later on the Romans came to follow the Greek practice of .\nBefore and after the advent of the codex, Latin and Greek script was written on scrolls by slave scribes. The role of the scribes was to simply record everything they heard to create documentation. Because speech is continuous, there was no need to add spaces. Typically, the reader of the text was a trained performer, who would have already memorised the content and breaks of the script. During the reading performances, the scroll acted as a cue sheet and therefore did not require in-depth reading.\nThe lack of word parsing forced the reader to distinguish elements of the script without a visual aid, but it also presented the reader with more freedom to interpret the text. The reader had the liberty to insert pauses and dictate tone, which made the act of reading a significantly more subjective activity than it is today. However, the lack of spacing also led to some ambiguity because a minor discrepancy in word parsing could give the text a different meaning. For example, a phrase written in as may be interpreted as , meaning 'a people gathered from Troy', or , 'a people gathered for exile'. Thus, readers had to be much more cognisant of the context to which the text referred.\nDecline.\nOver time, the current system of rapid silent reading for information replaced the older, slower, and more dramatic performance-based reading, and word dividers and punctuation became more beneficial to text. Though paleographers disagree about the chronological decline of throughout the world, it is generally accepted that the addition of spaces first appeared in Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels from the seventh and eighth centuries. Subsequently, an increasing number of European texts adopted conventional spacing, and within the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all European texts were written with word separation.\nWhen word separation became the standard system, it was seen as a simplification of Roman culture because it undermined the metric and rhythmic fluency generated through . In contrast, paleographers today identify the extinction of as a critical factor in augmenting the widespread absorption of knowledge in the pre-Modern Era. By saving the reader the taxing process of interpreting pauses and breaks, the inclusion of spaces enables the brain to comprehend written text more rapidly. Furthermore, the brain has a greater capacity to profoundly synthesize text and commit a greater portion of information to memory.\n is still in use in Thai script, other Southeast Asian abugidas: (Burmese, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese script), and in languages that use Chinese characters (Chinese and Japanese). However, modern vernacular Chinese differentiates itself from ancient through its use of punctuation, although this method of separation was borrowed from the West only in the 19th and 20th centuries. Before this, the only forms of punctuation found in Chinese writings were marks to denote quotes, proper nouns, and emphasis. Modern Tibetic languages also employ a form of ; while they punctuate syllables, they do not use spacing between units of meaning.\nExamples.\nLatin text.\nLatin text in with typical capital letters, taken from Cicero's \"De finibus bonorum et malorum\":\nWhich in modern punctuation is:\nWith ancient Latin punctuation is: \nGreek text.\nGreek text in with typical capital letters, taken from Hesiod's \"Theogony\":\nWhich in modern punctuation is:\nHebrew text.\nHebrew text is well known for lacking punctuation for many centuries. Modern versions of the language gradually amended those features.\nRunic text.\nThe entire Swedish R\u00f6k runestone is written in , which poses problems for scholars attempting to translate it. One example is a phrase repeated several times, . Interpretations proposed include 'let us say the memory to Yggr', 'let us say the folk-memory', and 'let us say to the group of young men'.\nModern Latin script.\nA form of has become common in internet e-mail addresses and domain names where, because the \"space\" character is invalid, the address for a website for \"Example Fake Website\" is written as codice_1 \u2013 without spaces between the separate words. However, the \"underscore\" or \"dash\" characters are often used as stand-ins for the \"space\" character when its use would be invalid and their use would not be.\nAs another example, so-called camel case\u2014in which the first letter of each word is capitalized\u2014has become part of the culture of many computer programming languages. In this context, names of variables and subroutines as well as other identifiers are rendered easier to read, as in codice_2. Camel case can also eliminate ambiguity: codice_3 might name a table of characters, whereas codice_4 could ask or answer the question, \"Can (something) be charted?\"\nChinese language.\nChinese does not encounter the problem of incorporating spaces into text because, unlike most writing systems, Chinese characters represent morphemes and not phonemes. Chinese is therefore readable without spaces.\nWestern punctuation was first used in China in the 20th century as a result of interaction with Western culture.\nHowever, sentences can still be ambiguous due to a lack of punctuation and/or word breaks. One Chinese joke concerns a contract between a landlord and a poor scholar, which was written without punctuation and thus was interpreted in two different ways:\nJapanese script.\nJapanese implements extensive use of Chinese characters\u2014called kanji in Japanese. However, due to the radical differences between the Chinese and Japanese languages, writing Japanese exclusively in kanji would make it extremely difficult to read. This can be seen in texts that predate the modern kana system, in which Japanese was written entirely in kanji and , the latter of which are written solely to indicate a word's pronunciation as opposed to its meaning. For that reason, different syllabary systems called kana were developed to differentiate phonetic graphemes from ideographic ones.\nModern Japanese is typically written using three different types of graphemes, the first being kanji and the latter two being kana systems, the cursive hiragana and the angular katakana. While spaces are not normally used in writing, boundaries between words are often quickly perceived by Japanese speakers since kana are usually visually distinct from kanji. Japanese speakers also know that certain words, morphemes, and parts of speech are typically written using one of the three systems. Kanji is typically used for words of Japanese and Chinese origin as well as content words (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Hiragana is typically used for native Japanese words, as well as commonly known words, phrases, and grammatical particles, as well as inflections of content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Katakana is typically used for loanwords from languages other than Chinese, onomatopoeia, and emphasized words.\nLike Chinese, Japanese lacked any sort of punctuation until interaction with Western civilizations became more common. Punctuation was adopted during the Meiji period.\nThai script.\nModern Thai script, which was said to have been created by King Ram Khamhaeng in 1283, does not contain any spaces between words. Spaces indicate only the clear endings of clauses or sentences.\nBelow is a sample sentence of Thai written first without spaces between words (with Thai romanization in parentheses), second in Thai with spaces between words (also with Thai romanization in parentheses), and then finally translated into English.\nFor example, \"\u0e43\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e21\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e35\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\" (pronounced \"nai nam mi pla nai na mi khao\", meaning \"In the water there are fish; in the paddy fields there is rice.\") can also be written as \"\u0e43\u0e19 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e33 \u0e21\u0e35 \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32 \u0e43\u0e19 \u0e19\u0e32 \u0e21\u0e35 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\".\nJavanese script.\nThis example shows the first line of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Javanese script, and a case of the text being divided, as in some modern writing, by spaces and dash signs, which look different. \nBecause of the absence of space, in computer typography, the line-break have to be inserted manually, otherwise a long sentence will not break into new lines. Some computer input methods have put zero-width space instead for word break, which would then break the long sentences into multiple lanes, but the drawback of that method is it will not render the writing correctly.\nArabic script.\nBefore typewriters, computers and smartphones changed the way of writing, Arabic was written continuously. That is easy because 22 letters in Arabic have final, medial and initial forms, which is comparable to the initial capital form for the Latin alphabet since the Renaissance. Six or seven letters in Arabic have only a final form (namely , , , , and , as well as ) and whenever they occur in a word they are followed by space that was originally as wide as the space between words, creating a clear visual break. There was no hyphenation either. In the early Quranic manuscripts, all diacritics in the Arabic script were also omitted because pointing or other diacritics did not exist in the Arabic script until the early 2nd millennium, and this form is called \"rasm\". Rasm is also written continuously without spacing. In all early manuscripts, words were finished on the next line or, in many Quranic manuscripts, even on the next page. The letter hamza is the only letter of the Arabic alphabet that lacks a final, initial or medial form, only its alone or isolated form, as it is an unlinked letter.\nPunjabi (Gurmukhi) script.\nBefore the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Gurbani and other Sikh scriptures were written in the traditional method of writing the Gurmukhi script known as \"lariv\u0101r\" where there were no spacing between words in the texts (interpuncts in the form of a dot were used by some to differentiate between words, such as by Guru Arjan). This is opposed to the comparatively more recent method of writing in Gurmukhi known as \"pad ched\", which breaks the words by inserting spacing between them.\nNumbers.\nBefore the invention of delimiters and other punctuation to set off groups of three digits in numbers above four digits, large numbers (e.g. numbers greater than 999) were written continuously. As of now, only numbers with fewer than four digits are written with no delimiter or other punctuation. This manner is somewhat similar how to separate a word in a sentence.\nWhile numbers up to four digits are recommended for separating three digits, there are some of them are not. These include most Slavic languages, Spanish, Hungarian and Swiss German. These languages do not use a delimiter to separate numbers in four digits. English sometimes follows this practice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61603", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61603", "title": "Gondor", "text": "Fictional kingdom in Tolkien's Middle-earth\nGondor is a fictional kingdom in J. R. R. Tolkien's writings, described as the greatest realm of Men in the west of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. The third volume of \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Return of the King\", is largely concerned with the events in Gondor during the War of the Ring and with the restoration of the realm afterward. The history of the kingdom is outlined in the appendices of the book.\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion, exiles from the downfallen island kingdom of N\u00famenor. Along with Arnor in the north, Gondor, the South-kingdom, served as a last stronghold of the Men of the West. After an early period of growth, Gondor gradually declined as the Third Age progressed, being continually weakened by internal strife and conflict with the allies of the Dark Lord Sauron. By the time of the War of the Ring, the throne of Gondor is empty, though its principalities and fiefdoms still pay deference to the absent king by showing their loyalty to the Stewards of Gondor. The kingdom's ascendancy is restored only with Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn as king.\nBased upon early conceptions, the history and geography of Gondor were developed in stages as Tolkien extended his legendarium while writing \"The Lord of the Rings\". Critics have noted the contrast between the cultured but lifeless Stewards of Gondor, and the simple but vigorous leaders of the Kingdom of Rohan, modelled on Tolkien's favoured Anglo-Saxons. Scholars have noted parallels between Gondor and the Normans, Ancient Rome, the Vikings, the Goths, the Langobards, and the Byzantine Empire.\nLiterature.\nIn-fiction etymology.\nTolkien intended the name \"Gondor\" to be Sindarin for \"Stone-land\". This is echoed in the text of \"The Lord of the Rings\" by the name for Gondor among the Rohirrim, Stoningland. Tolkien's early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours. This view is supported by the Dr\u00faedain terms for Gondorians and Minas Tirith\u2014Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city. Tolkien denied that the name \"Gondor\" had been inspired by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of Gondar, stating that the root \"Ond\" went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning \"ond\" (\"stone\") as one of only two words known of the pre-Celtic languages of Britain. Gondor is also called the South-kingdom or Southern Realm, and together with Arnor as the N\u00famen\u00f3rean Realms in Exile. Researchers Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull have proposed a Quenya translation of \"Gondor\": \"Ondon\u00f3r\u00eb\".\nThe Men of Gondor are nicknamed \"Tarks\" (from Quenya \"tarkil\" \"High Man\", N\u00famen\u00f3rean) by the orcs of Mordor.\nFictional geography.\nCountry.\n \nGondor's geography is illustrated in the maps for \"The Lord of the Rings\" made by Christopher Tolkien on the basis of his father's sketches, and geographical accounts in \"The Rivers and Beacon-Hills of Gondor\", \"Cirion and Eorl\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\". Gondor lies in the west of Middle-earth, on the northern shores of Anfalas and the Bay of Belfalas with the great port of Pelargir near the river Anduin's delta in the fertile and populous region of Lebennin, stretching up to the White Mountains (Sindarin: \"Ered Nimrais\", \"Mountains of White Horns\"). Near the mouths of Anduin was the island of Tolfalas.\nTo the north-west of Gondor lies Arnor; to the north, Gondor is bordered by Wilderland and Rohan; to the north-east, by Rh\u00fbn; to the east, across the great river Anduin and the province of Ithilien, by Mordor; to the south, by the deserts of northern Harad. To the west lies the Great Sea.\n The wide land to the west of Rohan was Enedwaith; in some of Tolkien's writings it is part of Gondor, in others not.\nThe hot and dry region of South Gondor, or Harondor was by the time of the War of the Ring \"a debatable and desert land\", contested by the men of Harad.\nThe region of Lamedon and the uplands of the prosperous Morthond, with the desolate Hill of Erech, lay to the south of the White Mountains, while the populous valleys of Lossarnach were just south of Minas Tirith. The city's port was also a few miles south at Harlond, where the great river Anduin made its closest approach to Minas Tirith. Ringl\u00f3 Vale lay between Lamedon and Lebennin.\nThe region of Calenardhon lay to the north of the White Mountains; it was granted independence as the kingdom of Rohan. To the northeast, the river Anduin enters the hills of the Emyn Muil and passes the Sarn Gebir, dangerous straits, above a large river-lake, Nen Hithoel. Its entrance was once the northern border of Gondor, and is marked by the Gates of Argonath, an enormous pair of kingly statues, as a warning to trespassers. At the southern end of the lake are the hills of Amon Hen (the Hill of Seeing) and Amon Lhaw (the Hill of Hearing) on the west and east shores; below Amon Hen is the lawn of Parth Galen, where the Fellowship disembarked and was then broken, with the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the death of Boromir. Between the two hills is a rocky islet, Tol Brandir, which partly dams the river; just below it is an enormous waterfall, the Falls of Rauros, over which Boromir's funeral-boat is sent. Further down the river are the hills of Emyn Arnen.\nCapital, Minas Tirith.\nThe capital of Gondor at the end of the Third Age, Minas Tirith (Sindarin: \"Tower of Guard\"), lay at the eastern end of the White Mountains, built around a shoulder of Mount Mindolluin. The city had seven walls: each held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next. The city was surrounded by the Pelennor, an area of farmlands ringed by a wall. Inside the seventh wall was the Citadel, topped by the White Tower. Behind the tower, reached from the sixth level, was a saddle leading to the necropolis of the Kings and Stewards, with a street of tombs, Rath D\u00ednen.\nWithin the Court of the Fountain stood the White Tree, the symbol of Gondor. It was dry throughout the centuries that Gondor was ruled by the Stewards; Aragorn brought a sapling of the White Tree into the city on his return as King. John Garth writes that the White Tree has been likened to the Dry Tree of the 14th century \"Travels of Sir John Mandeville\". The tale runs that the Dry Tree had been dry since the crucifixion of Christ, but that it would flower afresh when \"a prince of the west side of the world should sing a mass beneath it\".\nTolkien's map-notes for the illustrator Pauline Baynes indicate that the city had the latitude of Ravenna, an Italian city on the Adriatic Sea, though it lay \"900 miles east of Hobbiton more near Belgrade\". The Warning beacons of Gondor were atop a line of foothills running back west from Minas Tirith towards Rohan.\nDol Amroth.\nDol Amroth (Sindarin: \"the Hill of Amroth\") was a fortress-city on a peninsula jutting westward into the Bay of Belfalas, on Gondor's southern shore. It is also the name of the port city, one of the five great cities of Gondor, and the seat of the principality of the same name, founded by prince Galador. The whimsical poem \"The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon\" in \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" tells how the Man in the Moon fell one night into \"the windy Bay of Bel\"; his fall is marked by the tolling of a bell in the Seaward Tower (\"Tirith Aear\") of Dol Amroth, and he recovers at an inn in the city.\nIts ruler, the Prince of Dol Amroth, is subject to the sovereignty of Gondor. The principality's boundaries are not explicitly defined, though the Prince ruled Belfalas as a fief, as well as an area to the east on the map labelled Dor-en-Ernil (\"The Land of the Prince\"). Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth in \"The Return of the King\", was linked by marriage both to the Stewards of Gondor and to the Kings of Rohan. He was the brother of Lady Finduilas and uncle to her sons Boromir and Faramir; a kinsman of Th\u00e9oden; and the father of \u00c9omer's wife Loth\u00edriel. Imrahil played a major part in the defence of Minas Tirith; the soldiers whom Imrahil led to Minas Tirith formed the largest contingent from the hinterland to the defence of the city. They marched under a banner \"silver upon blue\", bearing \"a white ship like a swan upon blue water\".\nSome like Finduilas are of N\u00famen\u00f3rean descent, and still speak the Elvish language. Tolkien wrote about the city's protective sea-walls and described Belfalas as a \"great fief\". Prince Imrahil's castle is by the sea; Tolkien described him as \"of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes\". Local tradition claimed that the line's forefather, Imraz\u00f4r the N\u00famen\u00f3rean had married an Elf, though the line remained mortal.\nFictional history.\nPre-N\u00famen\u00f3rean.\nThe first people in the region were the Dr\u00faedain, a hunter-gatherer group of Men who arrive in the First Age. They were pushed aside by later settlers and came to live in the pine-woods of the Druadan Forest by the north-eastern White Mountains. \nThe next people settled in the White Mountains, and became known as the Men of the Mountains. They built a subterranean complex at Dunharrow, later known as the Paths of the Dead, which extended through the mountain-range from north to south. They became subject to Sauron in the Dark Years. Fragments of pre-N\u00famen\u00f3rean languages survive in later ages in place-names such as \"Erech\", \"Arnach\", and \"Umbar\".\nN\u00famen\u00f3rean kingdom.\nThe shorelands of Gondor were widely colonized by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans from the middle of the Second Age, especially by Elf-friends loyal to Elendil. His sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion landed in Gondor after the drowning of N\u00famenor, and co-founded the Kingdom of Gondor. Isildur brought with him a seedling of Nimloth (Sindarin: \"nim\", \"white\" and \"loth\", \"blossom\") the Fair, the white tree from N\u00famenor. This tree and its descendants came to be called the White Tree of Gondor, and appears on the kingdom's coat of arms. Elendil, who founded the Kingdom of Arnor to the north, was held to be the High King of all the lands of the D\u00fanedain. Isildur established the city of Minas Ithil (Sindarin: \"Tower of the Moon\") while An\u00e1rion established the city of Minas Anor (Sindarin: \"Tower of the Sun\").\nSauron survived the destruction of N\u00famenor and secretly returned to his realm of Mordor, soon launching a war against the N\u00famen\u00f3rean kingdoms. He captured Minas Ithil, but Isildur escaped by ship to Arnor; meanwhile, An\u00e1rion was able to defend Osgiliath. Elendil and the Elven-king Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together with Isildur and An\u00e1rion, they besieged and defeated Mordor. Sauron was overthrown; but the One Ring that Isildur took from him was not destroyed, and thus Sauron continued to exist.\nBoth Elendil and An\u00e1rion were killed in the war, so Isildur conferred rule of Gondor upon An\u00e1rion's son Meneldil, retaining suzerainty over Gondor as High King of the D\u00fanedain. Isildur and his three elder sons were ambushed and killed by Orcs in the Gladden Fields. Isildur's remaining son Valandil did not attempt to claim his father's place as Gondor's monarch; the kingdom was ruled solely by Meneldil and his descendants until their line died out.\nThird Age, under the Stewards.\nDuring the early years of the Third Age, Gondor was victorious and wealthy, and kept a careful watch on Mordor, but the peace ended with Easterling invasions. Gondor established a powerful navy and captured the southern port of Umbar from the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans, becoming rich.\nAs time went by, Gondor neglected the watch on Mordor. A civil war gave Umbar the opportunity to declare independence. The kings of Harad grew stronger, leading to fighting in the south. With a Great Plague the population began a steep decline. The capital was moved from Osgiliath to the less affected Minas Anor, and evil creatures returned to the mountains bordering Mordor. There was war with the Wainriders, a confederation of Easterling tribes, and Gondor lost its line of kings. The Ringwraiths captured and occupied Minas Ithil which became Minas Morgul, \"the Tower of Black Sorcery\". At this time Minas Anor was renamed to Minas Tirith, in constant watch of its now defiled twin city.\nWithout kings, Gondor was ruled by Stewards for many generations, father to son; despite their exercise of power and hereditary status, they were never accepted as Kings, nor did they sit on the high throne. The badge of office of the Stewards is a white rod.\nFaramir reports that Boromir as a boy had asked his father Denethor how many centuries it would take for a steward to become a king. Denethor replied \"Few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty. In Gondor ten thousand years would not suffice.\" Shippey reads this as a reproach to Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", noting that in Scotland, and in Britain, a Stewart/Steward like James I of England (James VI of Scotland) could metamorphose into a king. \nAfter attacks by evil forces, the province of Ithilien and the city of Osgiliath were abandoned. Late in the Third Age, the forces of Gondor, led by Aragorn (under the alias Thorongil) attacked Umbar and destroyed the Corsair fleet, allowing Ecthelion II to devote his attention to Mordor.\nWar of the Ring and restoration.\nDenethor sent his son Boromir to Rivendell for advice as war loomed. There, Boromir attended the Council of Elrond, saw the One Ring, and suggested it be used as a weapon to save Gondor. Elrond rebuked him, explaining the danger of such use, and instead, the hobbit Frodo was made ring-bearer, and a Fellowship, including Boromir, was sent on a quest to destroy the Ring. \nGrowing in strength, Sauron attacked Osgiliath, forcing the defenders to leave, destroying the last bridge across the Anduin behind them. Minas Tirith then faced direct land attack from Mordor, combined with naval attack by the Corsairs of Umbar. The hobbits Frodo and Sam travelled through Ithilien, and were captured by Faramir, Boromir's brother, who held them at the hidden cave of Henneth Ann\u00fbn, but helped them to continue their quest. Aragorn summoned the Dead of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing men from the southern provinces of Gondor such as Dol Amroth to come to the aid of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Great Gate was breached by Sauron's forces led by the Witch-king of Angmar. He spoke \"words of power\" as the battering ram named Grond attacked the Great Gate; it burst asunder as if \"stricken by some blasting spell\", with \"a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground\". The Witch-king rode through the Gate where Gandalf awaited him, but left shortly afterwards to meet the Riders of Rohan in battle. Gondor, with the support of Rohirrim as cavalry, repelled the invasion by Mordor. Following the death of Denethor and the incapacity of Faramir, Prince Imrahil became the effective lord of Gondor.\nWhen Imrahil declined to send the entirety of Gondor's army against Mordor, Aragorn led a smaller army to the Black Gate of Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo's quest. Sauron encircled the army at the Battle of the Morannon, but the hobbits succeeded, defeating Sauron and bringing the war and the Third Age to an end. The Great Gate was rebuilt with \"mithril\" and steel by Gimli and Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain. Aragorn's coronation was held on the Gateway, where he was pronounced King Elessar of both Gondor and Arnor, the sister kingdom in the north.\nConcept and creation.\nWriting.\nTolkien's original thoughts about the later ages of Middle-earth are outlined in his first, mid-1930s, sketches for the legend of N\u00famenor; these already contain a semblance of Gondor. The appendices to \"The Lord of the Rings\" were brought to a finished state in 1953\u201354, but a decade later, during preparations for the release of the Second Edition, Tolkien elaborated the events that had led to Gondor's civil war, introducing the regency of R\u00f3mendacil II. The final development of the history and geography of Gondor took place around 1970, in the last years of Tolkien's life, when he invented justifications for the place-names and wrote full narratives for the stories of Isildur's death and of the battles with the Wainriders and the Balchoth (published in \"Unfinished Tales\").\nIn-universe.\nTolkien describes an early population of elves in the Dol Amroth region, writing many accounts of its early history. In one version, a haven and a small settlement were founded in the First Age by seafaring Sindar from the west havens of Beleriand who fled in three small ships when the power of Morgoth overwhelmed the Eldar; the Sindar were joined later by Silvan Elves who came down Anduin seeking the sea. Another account states that the haven was established in the Second Age by Sindarin Elves from Lindon, who learned the craft of shipbuilding at the Grey Havens and then settled at the mouth of the Morthond. Other accounts say that Silvan Elves accompanied Galadriel from Lothl\u00f3rien to this region after the defeat of Sauron at Eriador in the middle of the Second Age, or that Amroth ruled among the Nandorin Elves here in the Second Age. Elves continued to live there well into the Third Age, until the last ship departed from Edhellond for the Undying Lands. Amroth, King of Lothl\u00f3rien from the beginning of the Third Age, left his realm behind in search of his beloved Nimrodel, a Nandorin who had fled from the horror unleashed by the Dwarves in Moria. He waited for her at Edhellond, for their final voyage together into the West. But Nimrodel, who loved Middle-earth as much as she did Amroth, failed to join him. When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her, and drowned in the bay. Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf and one of the companions of Nimrodel, is said to have become the foremother of the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth.\nAccording to an alternate account about the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth cited in \"Unfinished Tales\", they were descendants of a family of the Faithful from N\u00famenor who had ruled over the land of Belfalas since the Second Age, before N\u00famenor was destroyed. This family of N\u00famen\u00f3reans were akin to the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb, and thus related to Elendil and descended from the House of Elros. After the Downfall of N\u00famenor, they were created the \"Prince of Belfalas\" by Elendil. \"Unfinished Tales\" provides an account of \"Adrahil of Dol Amroth\" who fought under King Ondoher of Gondor against the Wainriders.\nThe critic Tom Shippey compares Tolkien's characterisation of Gondor with that of Rohan. He notes that men from the two countries meet or behave in contrasting ways several times in \"The Lord of the Rings\": when \u00c9omer and his Riders of Rohan twice meet Aragorn's party in the Mark, and when Faramir and his men imprison Frodo and Sam at Henneth Annun in Ithilien. Shippey notes that while \u00c9omer is \"compulsively truculent\", Faramir is courteous, urbane, civilised: the people of Gondor are self-assured, and their culture is higher than that of Rohan. The same is seen, Shippey argues, in the comparison between the mead hall of Meduseld in Rohan, and the great hall of Minas Tirith in Gondor. Meduseld is simple, but brought to life by tapestries, a colourful stone floor, and the vivid picture of the rider, his bright hair streaming in the wind, blowing his horn. The Steward Denethor's hall is large and solemn, but dead, colourless, in cold stone. Rohan is, Shippey suggests, the \"bit that Tolkien knew best\", Anglo-Saxon, full of vigour; Gondor is \"a kind of Rome\", over-subtle, selfish, calculating.\nThe critic Jane Chance Nitzsche contrasts the \"good and bad Germanic lords Th\u00e9oden and Denethor\", noting that their names are almost anagrams. She writes that both men receive the allegiance of a hobbit, but very differently: Denethor, Steward of Gondor, undervalues Pippin because he is small, and binds him with a formal oath, whereas Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, treats Merry with love, which the hobbit responds to.\nIn his analysis of the historical lore of N\u00famenor, Michael N. Stanton said close affinities are demonstrated between Elves and the descendants of Men of the West, not only in terms of blood heritage but also in \"moral probity and nobility of demeanor\", which gradually weakened over time due to \"time, forgetfulness, and, in no small part, the machinations of Sauron\". The cultural ties between the Men of Gondor and Elves are reflected in the names of certain characters: for instance, Finduilas of Dol Amroth (the wife of Denethor and the sister of Prince Imrahil) shares her name with an Elf princess of the First Age.\nLeslie A. Donovan, in \"A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien\", compares the siege of Gondor with the alliance of Elves and Men in their fight against Morgoth and other co-operative ventures in \"The Silmarillion\", making the point that none of these would have succeeded without collaboration; further that one such success comes from another shared effort, as when the Rohirrim were only able to come to the aid of Gondor because of the joint efforts of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn; and that they in turn collaborated with the oathbreakers from the Paths of the Dead.\nInfluences.\nSandra Ballif Straubhaar, a scholar of Germanic studies, notes in \"The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" that readers have debated the real-world prototypes of Gondor. She writes that like the Normans, their founders the N\u00famen\u00f3reans arrived \"from across the sea\", and that Prince Imrahil's armour with a \"burnished vambrace\" recalls late-medieval plate armour. Against this theory, she notes Tolkien's direction of readers to Egypt and Byzantium. Recalling that Tolkien located Minas Tirith at the latitude of Florence, she states that \"the most striking similarities\" are with ancient Rome. She identifies several parallels: Aeneas, from Troy, and Elendil, from N\u00famenor, both survive the destruction of their home countries; the brothers Romulus and Remus found Rome, while the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion found the N\u00famen\u00f3rean kingdoms in Middle-earth; and both Gondor and Rome experienced centuries of \"decadence and decline\".\nDimitra Fimi, a scholar of fantasy and children's literature, draws a parallel between the seafaring N\u00famen\u00f3reans and the Vikings of the Norse world, noting that in \"The Lost Road and Other Writings\", Tolkien describes their ship-burials, matching those in \"Beowulf\" and the \"Prose Edda\". She notes that Boromir is given a boat-funeral in \"The Two Towers\". Fimi further compares the helmet and crown of Gondor with the romanticised \"headgear of the Valkyries\", despite Tolkien's denial of a connection with Wagner's \"Ring\" cycle, noting the \"likeness of the wings of a sea-bird\" in his description of Aragorn's coronation, and his drawing of the crown in an unused dust jacket design.\nThe classical scholar Miryam Libr\u00e1n-Moreno writes that Tolkien drew heavily on the general history of the Goths, Langobards and the Byzantine Empire, and their mutual struggle. Historical names from these peoples were used in drafts or the final concept of the internal history of Gondor, such as Vidumavi, wife of king Valacar (in Gothic). The Byzantine Empire and Gondor were both, in Libr\u00e1n-Moreno's view, only echoes of older states (the Roman Empire and the unified kingdom of Elendil), yet each proved to be stronger than their sister-kingdoms (the Western Roman Empire and Arnor, respectively). Both realms were threatened by powerful eastern and southern enemies: the Byzantines by the Persians and the Muslim armies of the Arabs and the Turks, as well as the Langobards and Goths; Gondor by the Easterlings, the Haradrim, and the hordes of Sauron. Both realms were in decline at the time of a final, all-out siege from the East; however, Minas Tirith survived the siege whereas Constantinople did not. In a 1951 letter, Tolkien himself wrote about \"the Byzantine City of Minas Tirith.\"\nTolkien visited the Malvern Hills with C. S. Lewis, and recorded excerpts from \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" in Malvern in 1952, at George Sayer's home. Sayer wrote that Tolkien relived the book as they walked, comparing the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nGondor, as it appeared in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", has been compared to the Byzantine Empire. The production team noted this in DVD commentary, explaining their decision to include Byzantine domes into Minas Tirith's architecture and to have civilians wear Byzantine-styled clothing. However, the appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited tidal island and abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, France. In the films, the towers of the city, designed by the artist Alan Lee, are equipped with trebuchets. The film critic Roger Ebert called the films' interpretation of Minas Tirith a \"spectacular achievement\", and compared it to the Emerald City from \"The Wizard of Oz\". He praised the filmmakers' ability to blend digital and real sets.\nGames.\nThe setting of Minas Tirith has appeared in video game adaptations of \"The Lord of the Rings\", such as the 2003 video game \"\" where it is directly modelled on Jackson's film adaptation.\nSeveral locations in Gondor were featured in the 1982 role-playing game \"Middle-earth Role Playing\" game and its expansions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61604", "revid": "1312305294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61604", "title": "Tradescantia", "text": "Genus of plants\nTradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.\n\"Tradescantia\" grow , and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.\nThe genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.\nDescription.\n\"Tradescantia\" are herbaceous perennials and include both climbing and trailing species, reaching in height. The stems are usually succulent or semi-succulent, and the leaves are sometimes semi-succulent. The leaves are long, thin and blade-like to lanceolate, from . The flowers can be white, pink, purple or blue, with three petals and six yellow anthers (or rarely, four petals and eight anthers). The sap is mucilaginous and clear. \nA number of species have flowers that last for only a day, opening in the morning and closing by the evening.\nEtymology.\nThe scientific name of the genus chosen by Carl Linnaeus honours the English naturalists and explorers John Tradescant the Elder (c. 1570s \u2013 1638) and John Tradescant the Younger (1608\u20131662), who introduced many new plants to English gardens. Tradescant the Younger visited the new colony of Virginia in 1637 (and possibly twice more in later years). From there, the type species, \"Tradescantia virginiana\", was brought to England in 1629.\nPlants of the genus are called by many common names, varying by region and country. The name \"inchplant\" is thought to describe the plant's fast growth, or the fact that leaves are an inch apart on the stem. \"Spiderwort\" refers to the sap which dries into web-like threads when a stem is cut. The name \"dayflower\", shared with other members of the Commelinaceae family, refers to the flowers which open and close within a single day.\nThe controversial name \"wandering Jew\" originates from the Christian myth of the Wandering Jew, condemned to wander the earth for taunting Jesus on the way to his crucifixion. In recent years there have been efforts to stop using this and other potentially offensive common names, in favour of alternatives such as \"wandering dude\" or \"wandering willie\".\nIn Spanish, \"Tradescantia\" plants are sometimes referred to as \"flor de Santa Luc\u00eda\" (Saint Lucy's flower), in reference to the Saint's reputation as the patron saint of sight, and the use of the juice of the plant as eye drops to relieve congestion.\nTaxonomy.\nSubdivisions and species.\nThe number of species and infrageneric taxa has changed throughout history. The first major classification proposed by Hunt (1980) included 60 species divided into eight sections, with one section divided into a further four series. Hunt's 1986 revision united several small genera with \"Tradescantia\" as sections, resulting in a total of twelve sections comprising 68 species, and this infrageneric classification was accepted for several decades.\nA recent study by Pellegrini (2017) proposed a new classification based on recent morphological research, dividing the genus into five subgenera. As of December 2023, The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew recognises 86 species.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe first species described, the Virginia spiderwort, \"T. virginiana\", is native to the eastern United States from Maine to Alabama, and Canada in southern Ontario. Virginia spiderwort was introduced to Europe in 1629, where it is cultivated as a garden flower.\nThe natural range of the genus as a whole spans nearly the entire length and width of mainland North America, from Canada through Mexico and Central America, and thrives in a great diversity of temperate and tropical habitats. It is frequently found in thinly wooded deciduous forests, plains, prairies, and healthy fields, often alongside other native wildflowers.\nConservation.\nThe western spiderwort \"T. occidentalis\" is listed as an endangered species in Canada, where the northernmost populations of the species are found at a few sites in southern Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta; it is more common further south in the United States to Texas and Arizona.\nCultivation.\nSpiderworts are popular in Europe and North America as ornamental plants. Temperate species are grown as hardy garden perennials, while tropical species such as \"T. zebrina\" and \"T. spathacea\" are used as house plants. Their popularity and easy spreading nature has led to some species being considered serious weeds in certain places (see below).\nMost cold-hardy garden plants belong to the Andersoniana Group (often referred to with the invalid name \"Tradescantia\" \u00d7 \"andersoniana\"). This is a group of interspecific hybrids developed from \"Tradescantia virginiana\", \"T. ohiensis\", and \"T. subaspera\", which have overlapping ranges within continental North America. These plants are clump-forming herbaceous perennials, with individual cultivars mainly differing in flower colour. \nA wide range of tender tropical species are cultivated as houseplants or outdoor annuals in temperate locations, including \"Tradescantia zebrina\", \"T. fluminensis\", \"T. spathacea\", \"T. sillamontana\", and \"T. pallida\". They are typically grown for their foliage, and many have colourful variegated patterns of silver, purple, green, pink, and gold. \nCultivars.\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\nThe International Society for Horticultural Science appointed Tradescantia Hub as an International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA) for \"Tradescantia\" in 2022. As an ICR authority, the Hub is responsible for recording and maintaining a checklist of the correct names for all cultivars in the genus.\nWeeds.\nDue to its ready propagation from stem fragments and its domination of the ground layer in many forest environments, \"T. fluminensis\" has become a major environmental weed in Australia, New Zealand and the southern United States. Other species considered invasive weeds in certain places include \"T. pallida\", \"T. spathacea\", and \"T. zebrina\".\nToxicity.\nSome members of the genus \"Tradescantia\" may cause allergic reactions in pets (especially cats and dogs) characterised by red, itchy skin. Notable culprits include \"T. albiflora\" (scurvy weed), \"T. spathacea\" (Moses in the cradle), and \"T. pallida\" (purple heart).\nUses.\nNative Americans used \"T. virginiana\" to treat a number of conditions, including stomachache. It was also used as a food source. The cells of the stamen hairs of some \"Tradescantia\" are colored blue, but when exposed to sources of ionizing radiation such as gamma rays or pollutants like sulphur dioxide from industries, the cells mutate and change color to pink; they are one of the few tissues known to serve as an effective bioassay for ambient radiation levels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61610", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61610", "title": "Burden of proof (law)", "text": "Obligation on a party to prove their case\nIn a legal dispute, one party has the burden of proof to show that they are correct, while the other party has no such burden and is presumed to be correct. The burden of proof requires a party to produce evidence to establish the truth of facts needed to satisfy all the required legal elements of the dispute. It is also known as the onus of proof.\nThe burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim \"semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit\", a translation of which is: \"the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\" In civil suits, for example, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof that the defendant's action or inaction caused injury to the plaintiff, and the defendant bears the burden of proving an affirmative defense. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor for criminal cases, and the defendant is presumed innocent. If the claimant fails to discharge the burden of proof to prove their case, the claim will be dismissed.\nDefinition.\nA \"burden of proof\" is a party's duty to prove a disputed assertion or charge, and includes the burden of production (providing enough evidence on an issue so that the trier-of-fact decides it rather than in a peremptory ruling like a directed verdict) and the burden of persuasion (standard of proof such as preponderance of the evidence).\nA \"burden of persuasion\" or \"risk of non-persuasion\" is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding. Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the presumption of innocence in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for affirmative defenses in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.\nThe burden of persuasion should not be confused with the evidential burden, or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence) which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.\nThere is no burden of proof with regard to motive or animus in criminal cases in the United States. The intent surrounding an offense is nevertheless crucial to the elements of the offense in a first-degree-murder conviction. This brings up the ethical dilemma of whether or not a death sentence should be imposed when the defendant's motives or intentions are the contingent factors in sentencing. However, in some cases such as defamation suits with a public figure as the defamed party, the public figure must prove actual malice.\nStandards of proof in the United States.\nBurden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any affirmative facts in defense. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.\nLegal standards for burden of proof.\nSome evidence.\nPer \"Superintendent v. Hill\" (1985), in order to take away a prisoner's good conduct time for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have \"some evidence\", i.e., \"a modicum of evidence\"; however, the sentencing judge is under no obligation to adhere to good/work time constraints, nor are they required to credit time served.\nReasonable indications.\n\"Reasonable indication (also known as reasonable suspicion) is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere 'hunch' is insufficient.\"\nThe reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.\nReasonable suspicion.\nReasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a \"brief\" investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. This stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often probable cause) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In \"Terry v. Ohio\", 392 U.S. https:// (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or \"hunch\" is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.\nAn investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what they perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about their business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete, and may give rise to the level of probable cause.\nReasonable to believe.\nIn \"Arizona v. Gant\" (2009), the United States Supreme Court arguably defined a new standard, that of \"reasonable to believe\". This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled \"New York v. Belton\" (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect's arrest only where it is \"reasonable to believe\" that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.\nThere is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the \"reasonable suspicion\" of the \"Terry\" stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.\nProbable cause.\nProbable cause is a higher standard of proof than reasonable suspicion, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is unreasonable. It is also used by grand juries to determine whether to issue an indictment. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement remedy.\nIn the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"United States v. Sokolow\", 490 U.S. https:// (1989), determined that probable cause requires \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\". The primary issue was whether Drug Enforcement Administration agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts have traditionally interpreted the idea of \"a fair probability\" as meaning whether a fair-minded evaluator would have reason to find it more likely than not that a fact (or ultimate fact) is true, which is quantified as a 51% certainty standard (using whole numbers as the increment of measurement). Some courts and scholars have suggested probable cause could, in some circumstances, allow for a fact to be established as true to a standard of less than 51%, but as of August 2019, the United States Supreme Court has never ruled that the quantification of probable cause is anything less than 51%. Probable cause can be contrasted with \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" which requires a police officer to have an unquantified amount of certainty the courts say is well below 51% before briefly detaining a suspect (without consent) to pat them down and attempt to question them. The \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard, used by criminal juries in the United States to determine guilt for a crime, also contrasts with probable cause which courts hold requires an unquantified level of proof well above that of probable cause's 51%. Though it is beyond the scope of this topic, when courts review whether 51% probable cause certainty was a reasonable judgment, the legal inquiry is different for police officers in the field than it would be for grand jurors. In \"Franks v. Delaware\" (1978), the U.S. Supreme Court held that probable cause requires that there not be \"reckless disregard for the truth\" of the facts asserted.\nExamples of a police officer's truth-certainty standards in the field and their practical consequences are offered below:\nSome credible evidence.\nSome credible evidence is one of the least demanding standards of proof. This proof standard is often used in administrative law settings and in some states to initiate Child Protective Services (CPS) proceedings. This proof standard is used where short-term intervention is needed urgently, such as when a child is arguably in immediate danger from a parent or guardian. The \"some credible evidence\" standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of \"probable cause\" used in \"ex parte\" threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see \"Valmonte v. Bane,\" 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the \"some credible evidence\" standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.\nPreponderance of the evidence.\nPreponderance of the evidence (American English), also known as balance of probabilities (British English), is the standard required in civil cases, including family court determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act, and in child custody determinations between parties having equal legal rights respecting a child. It is also the standard of proof by which the defendant must prove affirmative defenses or mitigating circumstances in civil or criminal court in the United States. In civil courts, aggravating circumstances also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as in criminal court).\nThe standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. Another high-level way of interpreting that is that the plaintiff's case (evidence) be 51% likely. A more precise statement is that \"the weight [of the evidence, including in calculating such a percentage] is determined not by the amount of evidence, but by its quality.\" The author goes on to affirm that preponderance is \"merely enough to tip the scales\" towards one party; however, that tilt need only be so slight as the weight of a \"feather.\" Until 1970, it was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States. Compared to the criminal standard of \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the preponderance of the evidence standard is \"a somewhat easier standard to meet.\"\nPreponderance of the evidence is also the standard of proof used in United States administrative law. In at least one case, there is a statutory definition of the standard.\nWhile there is no federal definition, such as by definition of the courts or by statute applicable to all cases, The Merit Systems Protection Board's has codified their definition at 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2). MSPB defines the standard as \"The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue.\" One author highlights the phrase \"more likely to be true than untrue\" as the critical component of the definition.\nFrom 2013 to 2020, the Department of Education required schools to use a preponderance of evidence standard in evaluating sexual assault claims.\nClear and convincing evidence.\nClear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than \"preponderance of the evidence\", but less than \"beyond reasonable doubt\". It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in civil and certain criminal procedure in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking \"habeas corpus\" relief from capital punishment must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence. New York State uses this standard when a court must determine whether to involuntarily hospitalize a mentally ill patient or to issue an Assisted Outpatient Treatment Order. This standard was also codified by the United States Supreme Court in all mental health civil commitment cases.\nThis standard is used in many types of equity cases, including paternity, persons in need of supervision, child custody, the probate of both wills and living wills, petitions to remove a person from life support (\"right to die\" cases), mental hygiene and involuntary hospitalizations, and many similar cases.\nClear and convincing evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's stand-your-ground law. Once raised by the defense, the state must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, showing that the statutory prerequisites have not been met, and then request that the court deny a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from clear and convincing evidence whether to grant immunity. This is a lower burden than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial, but higher than the \"probable cause\" threshold generally required for indictment.\nClear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions (i.e. preponderance of the evidence), which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.\nThis standard is also known as \"clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence\"; \"clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence\", and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists. For example, this is the standard or quantum of evidence use to probate a last will and testament.\nBeyond reasonable doubt.\nThis is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in juvenile delinquency proceedings, criminal proceedings, and when considering aggravating circumstances in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.\nProof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.\nIf the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.\nThe term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no \"reasonable\" doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, \"i.e.\", when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.\nThe main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty or even in their death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.\nAnother noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is LPS conservatorship.\nStandards of proof in the United Kingdom.\nIn the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England and Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.\nThe civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to drunk in charge that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence).\nPrior to the decision of the House of Lords in \"Re B (A Child)\" [2008] UKHL 35, there had been some confusion \u2013 even at the Court of Appeal \u2013 as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the 'heightened standard'. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges about making decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. Baroness Hale said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;70. ... Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.\n72. ... there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent's Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions' enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.\nThe task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognize that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains 'the balance of probabilities'.\nIn competition law cases, the standard of proof is the civil standard (\"beyond reasonable doubt\") subject, because of the financial penalties involved, to a heightened requirement that strong and compelling evidence commensurate with the seriousness of the case against an alleged offender must be found.\nStandards of proof in Australia.\nIn Australia, two standards of proof are applied at common law: the criminal standard and the civil standard. It is possible for other standards of proof to be applied where required by law.\nCriminal standard.\nThe criminal standard in Australia is 'beyond reasonable doubt'. An offence against a Commonwealth law, with a term of imprisonment in excess of 12 months is an indictable offence and is constitutionally required to be tried before jury of 12 people. Offences that do not carry a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months are called summary offences. Some offences (with a term of imprisonment less than 10 years) may be heard by a court of summary jurisdiction with the consent of all parties; however the court may not impose a sentence greater than 12 months. Juries are required to make findings of guilt beyond reasonable doubt for criminal matters. \nThe Australian constitution does not expressly provide that criminal trials must be fair, nor does it set out the elements of a fair trial, but it may by implication protect other attributes. The Australian Law Reform Commission has stated that the High Court has moved toward entrenching procedural fairness as a constitutional right, but has not yet done so. If it did so, this would have the potential to constitutionalise the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard in criminal proceedings.\nState offences are not subject to the constitution's section 80 requirement for a jury. However, the case of \"Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales\" constrains the way that State courts may operate during criminal trials per the \"Kable\" doctrine.\nCivil standard.\nIn Australia, the civil standard is termed the \"balance of probabilities\". In Australia, the balance of probabilities involves considerations that the evidence required to establish a fact at the civil standard will vary with the seriousness of what is being alleged. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales has noted that a similar approach is taken in Canada; but the United Kingdom the evidential requirements of the civil standard of proof do not vary with the seriousness of an allegation.\nThe case law that establishes this is \"Briginshaw v Briginshaw\". The case has since been incorporated into the uniform evidence law. The \"Briginshaw\" principle was articulated by Dixon in that case in these terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters \"reasonable satisfaction\" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. Everyone must feel that, when, for instance, the issue is on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory conclusion may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any sound and prudent judgment if the question was whether some act had been done involving grave moral delinquency\nThe \"Briginshaw\" principle is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \"Briginshaw\" standard of proof; in \"Qantas Airways Limited v. Gama\" Justices French and Jacobson stated the \"Briginshaw test does not create any third standard of proof between the civil and the criminal.\"\nIn the High Court case of \"G v. H\", Justices Deane, Dawson and Gaudron stated \"Not every case involves issues of importance and gravity in the \"Briginshaw v. Briginshaw\" sense. The need to proceed with caution is clear if, for example, there is an allegation of fraud or an allegation of criminal or moral wrongdoing.\"\nAn example of the \"Briginshaw\" principle applied in practice is the case of \"Roberts-Smith v Fairfax Media\", a defamation case where, due to the gravity of the allegations, Fairfax Media was required to rely on stronger proof than in the context of a normal allegation to win their case.para 226 In the end, despite the high burden of proof required, Fairfax won the trial, with Besanko ruling that it was proven he \"broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement and is therefore a criminal\".para 11\nMelbourne Law School professor Jeremy Gans has noted that for particularly serious allegations, such as sexual assault, \"It's hard to see how the \"Briginshaw\" principle is much different to beyond reasonable doubt\". The decision has also been noted for affecting the ability of litigants to seek redress in anti-discrimination lawsuits, due to the seriousness of such allegations.\nOther standards for presenting cases or defenses.\nAir of reality.\nThe \"air of reality\" is a standard of proof used in Canada to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an \"air of reality\". Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a \"prima facie\" case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an affirmative defense, such as the insanity defense. This is similar to the concept of summary judgment in the United States, though not identical.\nEvidentiary standards of proof.\nDepending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest. For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).\nExamples.\nCriminal law.\nCriminal cases usually place the burden of proof on the prosecutor (expressed in the Latin brocard , \"the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies\"). This principle is known as the presumption of innocence, and is summed up with \"innocent until proven guilty\", but is not upheld in all legal systems or jurisdictions. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.\nThe presumption of innocence means three things:\nFor example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.\nHowever, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some \"exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification\" in their defence in a summary trial, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle can raise the defense that there was no likelihood of their driving while drunk. The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was unfit to drive through drink and was in charge of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove being in charge, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that they were not likely to drive.\nIn 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The House of Lords held that:\nIn some cases, there is a reverse onus on the accused. A typical example is that of a hit-and-run charge prosecuted under the Canadian Criminal Code. The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offense.\nCivil law.\nIn civil law cases, such as a dispute over a contract or a claim about an accidental injury, the burden of proof usually requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought. This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover.\nThis rule is not absolute in civil lawsuits; unlike with criminal offenses, laws may establish a different burden of proof, or the burden in an individual case may be reversed as a matter of fairness. For example, if a bank or government agency has a legal duty to keep certain records, and a lawsuit alleges that the proper records were not kept, then the plaintiff may not be required to prove a negative; instead, the respondent could be required to prove to the court that the records were kept.\nCivil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIn \"Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1\", the United States Supreme Court stated: \"There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations'.\" For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In \"Keyes\", the Supreme Court held that if \"school authorities have been found to have practiced purposeful segregation in part of a school system\", the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.\nIn \"Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries\", the Supreme Court explained that \"burden of proof\" is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens: the \"burden of persuasion\", and the \"burden of production\".\nThe Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in \"Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast\". The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will \"begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims\". In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, \"McCormick on Evidence\" \u00a7 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized \"The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. ... Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. ... [Nonetheless,] [a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of 136,087 (as of 2021 census), Bac\u0103u is the 14th largest city in Romania. The city is situated in the historical region of Moldavia, at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and on the Bistri\u021ba River (which meets the Siret River about to the south of Bac\u0103u). The Ghime\u0219 Pass links Bac\u0103u to the region of Transylvania.\nEtymology.\nThe town's name, which features in Old Church Slavonic documents as \"Bako\", \"Bakova\" or \"Bakovia\", comes most probably from a personal name of Hungarian origin. Men bearing the name Bak\u00f3 or Bako are documented in medieval Transylvania and in 15th-century Bulgaria, but according to Victor Spinei the name itself is of Turkic\u00a0\u2013 most probably of Cuman or Pecheneg\u00a0\u2013 origin. Nicolae Iorga believes that the city's name is of Hungarian origin (as Adjud and Sascut). Another theory suggests that the town's name has a Slavic origin, pointing to the Proto-Slavic word \"byk\", meaning \"ox\" or \"bull\", the region being very suitable for raising cattle; the term, rendered into Romanian alphabet as \"b\u00e2c\", was probably the origin of \"B\u00e2c\u0103u\". In German it is known as \"Bakau\", in Hungarian as \"B\u00e1k\u00f3\" and in Turkish as \"Baka\".\nHistory.\nSimilarly to most urban centers in Moldavia, Bac\u0103u emerged on a ford that allowed water passage. There is archaeological evidence of human settlement in the centre of Bac\u0103u (near ) dating from the 6th and the 7th centuries; these settlements were placed over older settlements from the 4th and the 5th centuries. A number of vessels found here are ornamented with crosses, hinting that the inhabitants were Christians. Pechenegs and Cumans controlled the Bistri\u021ba valley during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries. Colonists played a significant role in the development of the town. Archaeological finds, some surface or semi-buried dwellings from the second half of the 15th\u00a0century, suggest that Hungarians started to settle in the region after 1345\u20131347 when the territory was under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. They mainly occupied the flat banks of the river Bistri\u021ba. Discoveries of a type of 14th-century grey ceramic that has also been found in Northern Europe also suggests the presence of German colonists from the north. Originally the town focused around the Roman Catholic community that settled near a regular local market frequented by the population of the region on the lower reaches of the river.\nThe town was first mentioned in 1408 when Prince Alexander the Good of Moldavia (1400\u20131432) listed the customs points in the principality in his privilege for Polish merchants. The customs house in the town is mentioned in Old Church Slavonic as \"krainee m\u00eeto\" (\"the customs house by the edge\") in the document which may indicate that it was the last customs stop before Moldavia's border with Wallachia. \nAn undated document reveals that the \"\u0219oltuz\" in Bac\u0103u, that is the head of the town elected by its inhabitants, had the right to sentence felons to death, at least for robberies, which hints to an extended privilege, similar to the ones that royal towns in the Kingdom of Hungary enjoyed. Thus this right may have been granted to the community when the territory was under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. The seal of Bac\u0103u was oval which is exceptional in Moldavia where the seals of other towns were round.\nAlexander the Good donated the wax collected as part of the tax payable by the town to the nearby Eastern Orthodox Bistri\u021ba Monastery. It was most probably his first wife named Margaret who founded the Franciscan Church of the Holy Virgin in Bac\u0103u. But the main Catholic church in the town was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. A letter written by John of Rya, the Catholic bishop of Baia refers to Bac\u0103u as a \"civitas\" which implies the existence of a Catholic bishopric in the town at that time. The letter also reveals that Hussite immigrants who had undergone persecutions in Bohemia, Moravia, or Hungary were settled in the town and granted privileges by Alexander the Good.\nThe monastery of Bistri\u021ba was also granted the income from the customs house of Bac\u0103u in 1439. In 1435 Stephen II of Moldavia (1433\u20131435, 1436\u20131447) requested the town's judges not to hinder the merchants of Bra\u0219ov, an important center of the Transylvanian Saxons in their movement.\nFrom the 15th\u00a0century \"ungureni\", that is Romanians from Transylvania began to populate the area north of the marketplace where they would erect an Orthodox church after 1500. A small residence of the princes of Moldova was built in the town in the first half of the 15th\u00a0century. It was rebuilt and extended under Stephen III the Great of Moldavia (1457\u20131504) who also erected an Orthodox church within it. But the rulers soon began to donate the neighboring villages that had thereto supplied their local household to monasteries or noblemen. Thus the local princely residence was abandoned after 1500.\nThe town was invaded and destroyed more than one time in the 15th and 16th centuries. For example, in 1467 King Matthias I of Hungary during his expedition against Stephen the Great set fire to all towns, among them Bac\u0103u in his path. The customs records of Bra\u0219ov shows that few merchants from Bac\u0103u crossed the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania after 1500, and their merchandise had no particularly high value which suggests that the town was declining in this period.\nThe Catholic bishop of Arge\u0219 whose see in Wallachia had been destroyed by the Tatars moved to Bac\u0103u in 1597. From the early 17th\u00a0century the bishops of Bac\u0103u were Polish priests who did not reside in the town, but in the Kingdom of Poland. They only travelled time to time to their see in order to collect the tithes.\nAccording to Archbishop Marco Bandini's report of the canonical visitation of 1646, the \"\u0219oltuz\" in Bac\u0103u was elected among Hungarians one year, and another, among Romanians. The names of most of 12 inhabitants of the town recorded in 1655 also indicate that Hungarians still formed their majority group. In 1670 Archbishop Petrus Parceviop c, the apostolic vicar of Moldavia concluded an agreement with the head of the Franciscan Province of Transylvania on the return of the Bac\u0103u monastery to them in order to ensure the spiritual welfare of the local Hungarian community. But the Polish bishop protested against the agreement and the Holy See also refused to ratify it.\nDue to the frequent invasions by foreign armies and plundering by the Tatars in the 17th century, many of its Catholic inhabitants abandoned Bac\u0103u and took refuge in Transylvania. But in 1851 the Catholic congregation in the town still spoke, sang, and prayed in Hungarian.\nThe first paper mill in Moldavia was established in the town in 1851. The town was declared a municipality in 1968.\nClimate.\nBac\u0103u has a type of continental climate that falls short of permanent winter snow cover due days averaging above freezing. Winters are also quite dry in the area. Summers are quite rainy due to convection and temperatures are often hot due to its inland location. Due to its mid-latitude location surrounded by a vast landmass, Bac\u0103u has a large temperature amplitude by European standards. Since 1980, a record heat of and a record cold of have been measured, which is a net difference of .\nPolitics.\nThe local authority in the city is split between the Mayor and the Local Council. Between 1950 and 1968 the city was governed by the Sfatul popular (People's Council). It replaced the local Provisional Committee (), which functioned from 1948 to 1950, based on the Law of the People's Councils, no. 17/1949.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2021 census data, Bac\u0103u has a population of 136,087, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.\nAt the 2011 census, Bac\u0103u had a population of 144,307, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census. The ethnic makeup was as follows:\nThe Bac\u0103u metropolitan area, a project for the creation of an administrative unit to integrate Bac\u0103u with the nearby communes, would have a population of some 190,000.\nTransportation.\nThe city is about North of Bucharest. It is served by George Enescu International Airport, located at , which provides direct links with the Romanian capital, Bucharest, and with several cities in Europe. Bac\u0103u air traffic control centre is one of Europe's busiest, as it handles transiting flights between the Middle and Near East and South Asia to Europe and across the Atlantic.\nThe Bac\u0103u railway station (\"Gara Bac\u0103u\") is one of the busiest in Romania; it has access to the Romanian railway main trunk number 500. Thus the city is connected to the main Romanian cities; the railway station is an important transit stop for international trains from Ukraine, Russia, and Bulgaria.\nThe city has access to the DN2 road (E85) that links it to the Romanian capital, Bucharest (to the South) and the cities of Suceava and Ia\u0219i (to the North). The European route E574/DN11 is an important access road to Transylvania and the city of Bra\u0219ov. The city is also located at the intersection of several national roads of secondary importance, and will be served in the future by the A7 motorway running from the border with Ukraine at Siret to Ploie\u0219ti (junction with A3). As of 2020, this motorway intersects with the Bac\u0103u bypass (\"Centura Bac\u0103u\").\nCulture.\nBac\u0103u has a public university and several colleges. Two major Romanian poets, George Bacovia and Vasile Alecsandri were born here. The \"Mihail Jora\" Athenaeum and a Philharmonic Orchestra are located here, as well as the \"G. Bacovia\" Dramatic Theater and a Puppet Theater. Around Christmas every year, a Festival of Moldavian Winter Traditions takes place, reuniting folk artists from all the surrounding regions. The exhibition \"Saloanele Moldovei\" and the International Painting Camp at Tescani, near Bac\u0103u, reunite important plastic artists from Romania and from abroad.\nThe local History Museum, part of the Museum Complex \"Iulian Antonescu\" has an important collection of antique objects from ancient Dacia. The city also has an astronomical observatory, The Victor Anestin Astronomical Observatory.\nJewish community.\nThe 1772-1774 Census registered 5 Jewish families, the 1820 Census registered 108 families. The 1852 Census registered 504 Jewish inhabitants. The 1930 Census registered 9424 Jewish inhabitants. The first mentions about Jewish inhabitants are from the beginning of the 18th century. The Register of Chevra Kadisha begins with the year 1774. The first leader of the Community is mentioned in 1794. The community was officially recognized in 1857.\nBefore World War I, the number of Jews was almost equal to that of Romanians in Bac\u0103u. According to the 1930 census, after some of the village population was in town, Bac\u0103u had 19,421 who have declared are Romanian, 9,424 declared Jews, 822 Hungarians and 406 German.\nThe first synagogue would be built in Bac\u0103u in 1820. In 1841 Jews who observe the Chabad Hasidic movement built another Sinagoga. In 1864 there were 14 functioning synagogues in Bac\u0103u. Among the most notable being Synagogue Burah Volf, Furriers Synagogue, Synagogue Alter Ionas and tanners. \"In 1880, in Bac\u0103u we had 21 synagogues and prayer houses. In 1916 we were active following synagogues Froim Aizic, Alter Leib, Itzik Leib Brill, Lipscani, the Tailors Young, coachmen, Shoemakers Synagogue, Cerealista, masonry, Rabbi Israel Synagogue, \"Brotherhood of Zion\" Snap Synagogue Saima Cofler itself and Der Mariesches SIL.\nAfter World War I, some synagogues were closed and others were razed. Some carried the names of rabbis deceased or people in life who had influence on the community: synagogue Wisman, synagogue Gaon Be\u021bael Safran, synagogue Rabbi Blane, synagogue David Her\u0219covici, synagogue Filderman, the synagogue rabbi Wahramn, and synagogue Rabbi Lan.\nIn December 2015, the new headquarters of the Jewish community was opened at 2 Erou Costel Marius Hasan St.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns/Sister cities.\nBac\u0103u is twinned with:\nSports.\nAthletics\nBadminton\nBasketball\nBoxing\nBridge\nFootball\nGymnastics\nTeam Handball\nJudo\nKarate\nFights\nModelism\nSwimming\nTennis\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was introduced in October 1988 as the company's first and flagship product, at a price of US$, aimed at the higher-education market. It was designed around the Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 floating-point coprocessor, with a clock speed of 25 MHz. Its NeXTSTEP operating system is based on the Mach microkernel and BSD-derived Unix, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end. According to the Science Museum Group, \"The enclosure consists of a 1-foot (304.8 mm) die-cast magnesium cube-shaped black case, which led to the machine being informally referred to as 'The Cube'.\"\nThe NeXT Computer was renamed NeXTcube in a later upgrade. The NeXTstation, a more affordable version of the NeXTcube, was released in 1990.\nLaunch.\nThe NeXT Computer was launched in October 1988 at a lavish invitation-only event, \"NeXT Introduction \u2013 the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education\" at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The next day, selected educators and software developers were invited to attend\u2014for a $100 registration fee\u2014the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at an event called \"The NeXT Day\" at the San Francisco Hilton. It gave those interested in developing NeXT software an insight into the system's software architecture and object-oriented programming. Steve Jobs was the luncheon's speaker.\nReception.\nIn 1989, \"BYTE\" magazine listed the NeXT Computer among the \"Excellence\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it showed \"what can be done when a personal computer is designed as a system, and not a collection of hardware elements\". Citing as \"truly innovative\" the optical drive, DSP and object-oriented programming environment, it concluded that \"the NeXT Computer is worth every penny of its $6,500 market price\". The workstation was not a significant commercial success, failing to reach the high-volume sales of the Apple II, Commodore 64, Mac, or IBM PC compatibles. This was mainly blamed on the computer's substantial price, and the fact that there was not a great demand for the system outside of the higher-education market. Next Computers were mainly sold to universities, financial institutions, and government agencies.\nLegacy.\nA NeXT Computer and its object-oriented development tools and libraries were used by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN to develop the world's first web server (CERN httpd) and web browser (WorldWideWeb).\nThe NeXT platform was used by Jesse Tayler at Paget Press to develop the first electronic app store, called the Electronic AppWrapper, in the early 1990s. Issue #3 was first demonstrated to Steve Jobs at NeXTWorld Expo 1993.\nPioneering PC games \"Doom\", \"Doom II\", and \"Quake\" (with respective level editors) were developed by id Software on NeXT machines. \"Doom\" engine games such as \"Heretic\", \"\", and \"Strife\" were also developed on NeXT hardware using id's tools.\nNeXT technology provisioned the first online food delivery system called CyberSlice, using GIS based geolocation, on which Steve Jobs performed the first online order of pizza with tomato and basil. CyberSlice was curated into the Inventions of the 20th Century, Computer Science at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In accordance with his title, he is regarded as the (first among equals) in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and as a spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide.\nBartholomew was born in the village of Agios Theodoros (officially called Zeytinlik\u00f6y) on the island of Imbros (later renamed G\u00f6k\u00e7eada by the Turkish government). After his graduation, he held a position at the Patriarchal Theological Seminary of Halki, where he was ordained a priest. Later, he served as Metropolis of Philadelphia and Chalcedon and he became a member of the Holy Synod as well as other committees, prior to his enthronement as Patriarch.\nBartholomew's tenure has been characterized by intra-Orthodox cooperation and intra-Christian and inter-religious dialogue, such as formal visits to Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, and Muslim leaders previously visited by a patriarch. He has exchanged numerous invitations with church and state dignitaries. His efforts to promote religious freedom and human rights, his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among the world's religions, as well as his efforts to promote ecology and the protection of the environment, have been widely noted, and these endeavors have earned him the title \"The Green Patriarch\". \nAmong his many international positions, he currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute. In 2018, the Moscow Patriarchate broke communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a result of disputes over his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\nEarly life and background.\nDimitrios Arhondonis was born in the village of Agioi Theodoroi on the island of Imbros (now G\u00f6k\u00e7eada, Turkey), son of Christos and Meropi Archod\u00f3nis (n\u00e9e Skarlatos), both of Greek descent. He was the fourth and last child and as a boy helped his father in his coffee shop that also doubled as a barber's.\nHe began his studies at Imbro and went on to attend the Zografeion Lyceum high school in Istanbul, then entered the Theological School of Halki on the island of that name (Turkish: Heybeliada), in the Sea of Marmara. There he gained a doctorate in theology. On 13 August 1961, he was ordained deacon and in the years 1961\u20131963 completed military service in the Turkish army with the rank of sublieutenant. Following this, from 1963 to 1968, with a study bourse from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, he gained diplomas in postgraduate specialization at the Oriental Institute of the Gregorian University in Rome, the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey (Switzerland) and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Subsequently, he gained a doctorate from Rome's Gregorian University with a thesis regarding the codification of the canons and canonical decrees in the Orthodox Church, perfecting also in these years his knowledge of Latin, Italian, French, English, and German.\nPatriarchate.\nAs Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew has been particularly active internationally. One of his first focuses has been on rebuilding the once persecuted Eastern Orthodox churches of the former Eastern Bloc following the fall of Communism there in 1990. As part of this effort, he has worked to strengthen ties among the various national churches and patriarchates of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He has also continued the reconciliation dialogue with the Catholic Church started by his predecessors and initiated dialogue with other faiths, including other Christian Churches, Muslims, and Jews.\nEnvironmentalism.\nHe has also gained a reputation as a prominent environmentalist, putting the support of the Ecumenical Patriarchate behind various international environmental causes. This has earned him the nicknames of \"the Green Patriarch\" and \"the Green Pope\", and in 2002 he was honored with the Sophie Prize for his contribution to environmentalism. He has also been honoured with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award which may be bestowed by the Legislative Branch of the United States government.\nTurkey.\nIn an interview published on 19 November 2006 in the daily newspaper \"Sabah\", Bartholomew addressed the issues of religious freedom and the then upcoming papal trip of Pope Benedict XVI to Turkey. He also referred to the closing of the Halki seminary by saying: \"As Turkish citizens, we pay taxes. We serve in the military. We vote. As citizens we do everything. We want the same rights. But it does not happen... If Muslims want to study theology, there are 24 theology faculties. Where are we going to study?\" He also addressed the issue of his ecumenical title and it not being accepted by the Turkish government: \"We've had this title since the 6th century... The word ecumenical has no political content. [...] This title is the only thing that I insist on. I will never renounce this title\".\nEcumenical dialogue.\nDuring his trip to Turkey in November 2006, Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Istanbul on the invitation of Bartholomew. The pope participated in the feast day services of St. Andrew the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. This was the third official visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate by a pope (the first being by Paul VI in 1967, and the second by John Paul II in 1979). He attended the papal inauguration of Pope Francis on 19 March 2013, paving the way for better Catholic\u2013Orthodox relations. It was the first time that the spiritual head of Eastern Orthodox Christians had attended a papal inauguration since the Great Schism in 1054. After, he invited Pope Francis to travel with him to the Holy Land in 2014 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the embrace between Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople and Pope Paul VI. Pope Francis was also invited to the Patriarchate for the feast day of Saint Andrew (30 November).\nIt was after more than two decades as Ecumenical Patriarch, that Bartholomew was the target of an assassination plot which was planned to take place on 29 May 2013. One suspect was arrested and there is an ongoing search for two others.\nSupport of refugees, reunification and peace.\nOn 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Pope Francis and Archbishop Hieronymus II, the Moria Refugee Camp in the island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. In December 2018, he visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone (KDZ) and prayed for permanent peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula.\nAutocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\nIn October 2018 the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate agreed to grant autocephaly (self-governing) to the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and to revoke the legal binding of the letter of 1686 which led to the Russian Orthodox Church establishing jurisdiction over the all of Rus's Church (including those located within borders of current Ukraine) and to lift the excommunications which affected clergy and faithful of two then unrecognized Orthodox churches in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP). In response to revoking a legal binding letter, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was cutting ties of communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which marked the beginning of the 2018 Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism.\nOn 5 January 2019, Bartholomew granted autocephaly to the newly founded Orthodox Church of Ukraine by Canonical act.\nPossession of Vatican Saint Peter Bone Fragments.\nOn 2 July 2019, it was announced that Pope Francis had given Bartholomew possession of nine bone fragments believed to belong to Saint Peter and which were publicly displayed by Pope Francis in November 2013 during a Vatican \"Year of Faith\" Mass. Bartholomew, who also gained possession of the bronze reliquary in which they are displayed, described the Pope's gesture as \"brave and bold\".\nMacedonian Orthodox Church.\nIn 2022, the Ecumenical Patriarchate accepted the Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Archdiocese of Ohrid into communion, recognizing North Macedonia as a canonical jurisdiction.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine.\nBartholomew has criticised both the Russian state and the Russian church for the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a crime of aggression and saying that it has caused enormous suffering both to the Ukrainian and the Russian people. In Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's opinion he says \"This is the theology that the sister Church of Russia began to teach, trying to justify an unjust, unholy, unprovoked, diabolical war against a sovereign and independent country \u2013 Ukraine\".\nDistinctions.\nAcademic.\nHe received an honorary doctorate from the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea on 23 June 2005.\nIn October 2009, he received an honorary doctorate from Fordham University in the United States.\nHe received an honorary PhD. from The Hebrew University in Jerusalem on 6 December 2017.\nIn December 2018, he received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in Ukraine.\nIn October 2021, he received an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame in the United States.\nOn 6 October 2024, Patriarch Bartholomew received a Doctor of Divinity \"honoris causa\" from The University of Notre Dame Australia in recognition of his inspiring work to unify contemporary society.\nOther.\nIn 1997, Bartholomew received the Congressional Gold Medal. The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards given by the United States.\nIn 2002, he received the Sophie Prize for his work on the environment.\nIn April 2008, he was included on the \"Time\" 100 most influential people in the world list. On 13 March 2007, the third anniversary of the death of Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig, Bartholomew was awarded in Vienna's St. Stephen Cathedral the \"Cardinal K\u00f6nig Prize\" from the Foundation \"Communio et Progressio\".\nIn 2012, he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship.\nOn 3 December 2013, he received the Global Thinkers Forum 2013 Award for Excellence in Peace and Collaboration.\nIn 2019, he received the Plaque of St. Erik from the Archbishop of Church of Sweden, for promoting religious freedom, calling attention to the needs of refugees and care for creation.\nOn 1 November 2021, Bartholomew received the Human Dignity Award from the American Jewish Committee (AJC), a global Jewish advocacy organization. The AJC honor recognizes Bartholomew's singular care for humanity and the environment, exceptional commitment to interreligious coexistence, and indispensable advancement of Orthodox-Jewish relations.\nIn October 2022, he was one of the first faith leaders to have an audience with King Charles III.\nOn 17 March 2025, the Institut de France's Academy of Moral and Political Sciences elected him a Foreign Associate Member, giving him a chair formerly held by Pope Benedict XVI.\nOn 10 April 2025, he was awarded the Templeton Prize for \"his pioneering efforts to bridge scientific and spiritual understandings of humanity\u2019s relationship with the natural world, bringing together people of different faiths to heed a call for stewardship of creation.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its main purposes are the rasterization of documents in these language, the display or printing of document pages, and conversion between PostScript and PDF files.\nFeatures.\nGhostscript can be used as a raster image processor (RIP) for raster computer printers\u2014for instance, as an input filter of line printer daemon\u2014or as the RIP engine behind PostScript and PDF viewers. It can also be used as a file format converter, such as PostScript to PDF converter. The codice_1 conversion program comes with the Ghostscript distribution.\nGhostscript can also serve as the back-end for PDF to raster image (png, tiff, jpeg, etc.) converter; this is often combined with a PostScript printer driver in \"virtual printer\" PDF creators. As it takes the form of a language interpreter, Ghostscript can also be used as a general purpose programming environment.\nGhostscript has been ported to many operating systems, including Unix-like systems, classic Mac OS, OpenVMS, Microsoft Windows, Plan 9, MS-DOS, FreeDOS, OS/2, ArcaOS, Atari TOS, RISC OS and AmigaOS.\nHistory.\nGhostscript was originally written by L. Peter Deutsch for the GNU Project, and released under the GNU General Public License in 1988. At the time of the initial release there was a similar commercial software product named GoScript from LaserGo. Later, Deutsch formed \"Aladdin Enterprises\" to dual-license Ghostscript also under a proprietary license with an own development fork: \"Aladdin Ghostscript\" under the Aladdin Free Public License (which, despite the name, is not a free software license, as it forbids commercial distribution) and \"GNU Ghostscript\" distributed with the \"GNU General Public License\". With version 8.54 in 2006, both development branches were merged again, and dual-licensed releases were still provided.\nGhostscript is currently owned by Artifex Software and maintained by Artifex Software employees and the worldwide user community. According to Artifex, as of version 9.03, the commercial version of Ghostscript can no longer be freely distributed for commercial purposes without purchasing a license, though the (A)GPL variant allows commercial distribution provided all code using it is released under the (A)GPL.\nIn February 2013, with version 9.07, Ghostscript changed its license from GPLv3 to GNU AGPL. which raised license compatibility questions, for example by Debian.\nStarting with release 9.55.0 Ghostscript has two built-in PDF interpreters. Until spring 2022, up to Ghostscript version 9.56.1, the default PDF interpreters implementation itself was coded in PostScript. The new default PDF interpreter has been rewritten in C entirely, and is faster and more secure than its predecessor, while its interface and graphics library have not changed. Scripting the new C written PDF interpreter from PostScript is still possible.\nFree fonts.\nThere are several sets of free fonts supplied for Ghostscript, intended to be metrically compatible with common fonts attached with the PostScript standard. These include:\nThe Ghostscript fonts were developed in the PostScript Type 1 format but have been converted into the TrueType format. As a result, a user can install and use the Ghostscript fonts via most modern software. Furthermore, the Ghostscript fonts are used as parts of various open source applications, e.g., the Linux version of GIMP depends on Graphviz which in turn depends on the Ghostscript fonts. Finally, multiple open source font projects used glyphs from the Ghostscript fonts, e.g., the Latin characters of GNU FreeFont are based on Nimbus Mono L, Nimbus Roman No9 L, and Nimbus Sans L. The TeX Gyre fonts are also based on 8 out of the 10 original Ghostscript typeface families. The Garamond font has additionally been improved upon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It runs the full width of the island of Manhattan, from FDR Drive along the East River in the east to the West Side Highway along the Hudson River in the west. The street is divided into west and east sections by Broadway.\nHouston Street generally serves as the boundary between neighborhoods on the East Side of Manhattan\u2014Alphabet City, the East Village, NoHo, Greenwich Village, and the West Village to the north; and the Lower East Side, most of the Bowery, Nolita, and SoHo to the south. The numeric street-naming grid in Manhattan, created as part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, begins immediately north of Houston Street with 1st Street at Avenue A.\nThe street's name is pronounced \" (), in contrast to the city of Houston, Texas, whose name is pronounced \" (). The street was named for William Houstoun, whose surname was pronounced \"\", while the city was named for Sam Houston.\nDescription.\nAt its east end, Houston Street meets FDR Drive in an interchange at East River Park. West of FDR Drive, it intersects with Avenue D. Further west, other streets, including First Avenue, the Bowery, Lafayette Street and Broadway, intersect Houston Street. The Broadway intersection is the division point between East Houston Street and West Houston Street. Sixth Avenue intersects Houston Street at a curve in the road in Greenwich Village. East of Sixth Avenue, Houston street is bidirectional and separated by a median; west of Sixth, the street is narrower and unidirectional westbound. West Houston Street terminates at an intersection with West Street near Pier 40 on the Hudson River.\nHistory.\nHouston Street is named for William Houstoun, who was a delegate from the state of Georgia to the Continental Congress from 1784 through 1786 and to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The street was christened by Nicholas Bayard (b. 1736), whose daughter, Mary, was married to Houstoun in 1788. The couple met while Houstoun, a member of an ancient and aristocratic Scottish family, was serving in the Congress. Bayard cut the street through a tract he owned in the vicinity of Canal Street in which he lived, and the city later extended it to include North Street, the northern border of New York's east side at the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe current spelling of the name is a corruption: the street appears as \"Houstoun\" in the city's Common Council minutes for 1808 and the official map drawn in 1811 to establish the street grid that is still current. In those years, the Texas hero Sam Houston, for whom the street is sometimes incorrectly said to have been named, was an unknown teenager in Tennessee. Also mistaken is the explanation that the name derives from the Dutch words \"huis\" for \"house\" and \"tuin\" for \"garden.\" The narrow, westernmost stretch of the current Houston Street, from Sixth Avenue to the West Side Highway, was known as \"Hammersley Street\" (also spelled \"Hamersly Street\") until the middle 19th century, and was inside Greenwich Village. It later came to be regarded as the Village's southern boundary.\nIn 1891, Nikola Tesla established his laboratory on Houston Street. Much of Tesla's research was lost in an 1895 fire.\nThe street, originally narrow, was markedly widened from Sixth Avenue to Essex Street in the early 1930s during construction of the Independent Subway System's Sixth Avenue Line. The street widening involved demolition of buildings on both sides of the street, resulting in numerous small, empty lots. Although some of these lots have been redeveloped, many of them are now used by vendors, and some have been turned into playgrounds and, more recently, community gardens.\nLower Manhattan's SoHo district takes its name from an acronym for \"South of Houston\", as the street serves as SoHo's northern boundary; another, narrower neighborhood north of Houston Street is correspondingly called NoHo.\nIn 1971, Houston Street became the southernmost street in Manhattan to extend between both the Hudson and East Rivers, when the World Trade Center was constructed and deprived Fulton Street of that title. With the reconstruction of the World Trade Center, Fulton Street was extended past Church Street to West Street, but is closed off to vehicular traffic west of Church Street.\nA reconstruction project rebuilt parts of the street between 2005 and 2018.\nTransportation.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Houston Street is served by the New York City Bus route from Columbia to Washington Streets westbound, and from 6th Avenue to the FDR Drive eastbound. The bus route itself had replaced an earlier streetcar line, which is now the between Avenues A and C. Additional service is provided by the eastbound east of Avenue D and the downtown from Second Avenue to Allen Street. The does not make any stops on Houston Street.\nA portion of the New York City Subway's IND Sixth Avenue Line runs under Houston Street, between Sixth Avenue to just before Avenue A; there are stations at Second Avenue ( F and &lt;F&gt;\u200btrains) and Broadway \u2013 Lafayette Street ( B , \u200b D , \u200b F , &lt;F&gt;, and \u200b M trains). Additionally, there is a station at Seventh Avenue, for the Houston Street ( 1 and \u200b 2 trains). The Bleecker Street station ( 4 , \u200b 6 , and &lt;6&gt;trains) has station entrances on the north side of Houston Street, due to its connection with the Broadway \u2013 Lafayette Street station as part of a larger station complex.\nExit 5 on the FDR Drive is on Houston Street. The street also connects directly with the West Side Highway; however, by then, Houston Street is westbound-only.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61622", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61622", "title": "List of architectural styles", "text": " \nAn architectural style is characterised by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as form, method of construction, building materials, and regional character. Most architecture can be classified as a chronology of styles which change over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.\nStyles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of architectural history. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through colonialism, either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, classicism has been revived many times and found new life as neoclassicism. Each time it is revived, it is different.\nVernacular architecture, or simply the vernacular, unlike traditional architecture is not designed by architects. It represents a native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As construction technology developed, vernacular styles have often become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.\nChronology of styles.\nPrehistoric.\nEarly civilizations developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.\nMediterranean and Middle-East civilizations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAncient Asian.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClassical Antiquity.\nThe architecture of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, derived from the ancient Mediterranean civilizations such as at Knossos on Crete. They developed highly refined systems for proportions and style, using mathematics and geometry.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe European Early Middle Ages are generally taken to run from the end of the Roman Empire, around 400 AD, to around 1000 AD. During this period, Christianity made a significant impact on European culture.\nMedieval Europe.\nThe dominance of the Church over everyday life was expressed in grand spiritual designs which emphasized piety and sobriety. The Romanesque style was simple and austere. The Gothic style heightened the effect with heavenly spires, pointed arches and religious carvings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAsian architecture During its Late classical and medieval ages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEarly Modern Period and European Colonialism.\n1425\u20131660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God. The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLate Modern Period and the Industrial Revolution.\nNeoclassicism.\n1720\u20131837 and onward. A time often depicted as a rural idyll by the great painters, but in fact was a hive of early industrial activity, with small kilns and workshops springing up wherever materials could be mined or manufactured. After the Renaissance, neoclassical forms were developed and refined into new styles for public buildings and the gentry.\nNew Cooperism\nRevivalism and Orientalism.\nLate 19th and early 20th centuries. The Victorian Era was a time of giant leaps forward in technology and society, such as iron bridges, aqueducts, sewer systems, roads, canals, trains, and factories. As engineers, inventors, and businessmen they reshaped much of the British Empire, including the UK, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and influenced Europe and the United States. Architecturally, they were revivalists who modified old styles to suit new purposes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReactions to the Industrial Revolution.\nIndustrial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nModernism and other styles contemporary with modernism.\n1880 onwards.

{"id": "61625", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61625", "title": "Halftone", "text": "Printing process\nHalftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous-tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size or in spacing, thus generating a gradient-like effect. \"Halftone\" can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.\nWhere continuous-tone imagery contains an infinite range of colors or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (pulse-width modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation) or both. This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: when the halftone dots are small, the human eye interprets the patterned areas as if they were smooth tones. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of continuous tones. For details, see film grain.\nJust as color photography evolved with the addition of filters and film layers, color printing is made possible by repeating the halftone process for each subtractive color \u2013 most commonly using what is called the \"CMYK color model\". The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create another optical effect: full-color imagery. Since the location of the individual dots cannot be determined exactly, the dots partially overlap leading to a combination of additive and subtractive color mixing called \"autotypical color mixing\".\nHistory.\nWhile early mechanical printing processes (most notably the Woodburytype, patented in 1864) could imitate the tone and subtle details of a photograph, expense and practicality prohibited their use in mass commercial printing that used relief printing.\nBefore the development of halftone printing, most pictures in newspapers used woodcut or wood-engraving techniques utilising hand-carved blocks of wood that, while they were often copied from photographs, resembled hand-drawn sketches. Commercial printers wanted a practical way to realistically reproduce photographs onto the printed page, but most common mechanical printing processes can only print areas of ink or leave blank areas on the paper and not a photographic range of tones; only black (or coloured) ink, or nothing. The half-tone process overcame these limitations and became the staple of the book, newspaper and other periodical industry.\nWilliam Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877) is credited with the idea of halftone printing. In an 1852 patent he suggested using \"photographic screens or veils\" in connection with a photographic intaglio process.\nSeveral different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades. William Leggo produced an early version with his leggotype while working for the \"Canadian Illustrated News\". The first printed halftone photograph was an image of Prince Arthur published on October 30, 1869. The \"New York Daily Graphic\" would later publish \"the first reproduction of a photograph with a full tonal range in a newspaper\" on March 4, 1880 (entitled \"A Scene in Shantytown\") with a crude halftone screen.\nFrederic Ives of Philadelphia patented the first truly successful commercial method in 1881. Although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes, he did not make use of a screen. In 1882, the German Georg Meisenbach patented the \"autotype\" halftone process in Germany which he named . His invention was based on the previous ideas of A. J. Berchtold\nand J. W. Swan. He used single-lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve any commercial success with relief halftones.\nShortly afterwards, Ives, this time in collaboration with Louis and Max Levy, improved the process further with the invention and commercial production of quality cross-lined screens.\nThe relief halftone process proved almost immediately to be a success. The use of halftone blocks in popular journals became regular during the early 1890s.\nThe development of halftone printing methods for lithography appears to have followed a largely independent path. In the 1860s, A. Hoen &amp; Co. focused on methods allowing artists to manipulate the tones of hand-worked printing stones. By the 1880s, Hoen was working on halftone methods that could be used in conjunction with either hand-worked or photolithographic stones.\nHalftone photographic screening.\nPrior to digitised images, special photographic techniques were developed to break grayscale images down into discrete points. The earliest of these was \"screening\" where a coarse-woven fabric screen was suspended before the camera plate to be exposed, breaking the incoming light into a pattern of dots via a combination of interruption and diffraction effects. The photographic plate could then be developed using photo-etching techniques to create a printing plate.\nOther techniques used a \"screen\" consisting of parallel bars (a Ronchi ruling), which was then combined with a second exposure with the same screen oriented at another angle. Another method was to expose through a screen-plate with crossing lines etched into the surface. Later, either photographic contact screens were used, or sometimes no screen at all, exposing directly on a lithographic (extremely high contrast) film with a pre-exposed halftone pattern.\nTraditional halftoning.\nResolution of halftone screens.\nThe resolution of a halftone screen is measured in lines per inch (lpi). This is the number of lines of dots in one inch, measured parallel with the screen's angle. Known as the screen ruling, the resolution of a screen is written either with the suffix lpi or a hash mark; for example, \"150 lpi\" or \"150#\".\nThe higher the pixel resolution of a source file, the greater the detail that can be reproduced. However, such increase also requires a corresponding increase in screen ruling or the output will suffer from posterization. Therefore, file resolution is matched to the output resolution. The dots cannot easily be seen by the naked eye, but can be discerned through a microscope or a magnifying glass.\nMultiple screens and color halftoning.\nWhen different screens are combined, a number of distracting visual effects can occur, including the edges being overly emphasized, as well as a moir\u00e9 pattern. This problem can be reduced by rotating the screens in relation to each other. This \"screen angle\" is another common measurement used in printing, measured in degrees clockwise from a line running to the left (9 o'clock is zero degrees). These angles are optimized to avoid patterns and reduce overlap, which can cause colors to look dimmer.\nHalftoning is also commonly used for printing color pictures. The general idea is the same, by varying the density of the four secondary printing colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (abbreviation CMYK), any particular shade can be reproduced.\nIn this case there is an additional problem that can occur. In the simple case, one could create a halftone using the same techniques used for printing shades of grey, but in this case the different printing colors have to remain physically close to each other to fool the eye into thinking they are a single color. To do this the industry has standardized on a set of known angles, which result in the dots forming into small circles or rosettes.\nDot shapes.\nThough round dots are the most commonly used, many dot types are available, each having its own characteristics. They can be used simultaneously to avoid the moir\u00e9 effect. Generally, the preferred dot shape is also dependent on the printing method or the printing plate.\nDigital halftoning.\nDigital halftoning has been replacing photographic halftoning since the 1970s when \"electronic dot generators\" were developed for the film recorder units linked to color drum scanners made by companies such as Crosfield Electronics, Hell, and Linotype-Paul.\nIn the 1980s, halftoning became available in the new generation of imagesetter film and paper recorders that had been developed from earlier \"laser typesetters\". Unlike pure scanners or pure typesetters, imagesetters could generate all the elements in a page including type, photographs, and other graphic objects. Early examples were the widely used Linotype Linotronic 300 and 100 introduced in 1984, which were also the first to offer PostScript RIPs in 1985.\nEarly laser printers from the late 1970s onward could also generate halftones but their original 300 dpi resolution limited the screen ruling to about 65 lpi. This was improved as higher resolutions of 600 dpi and above, and dithering techniques, were introduced.\nAll halftoning uses a high-frequency/low-frequency dichotomy. In photographic halftoning, the low-frequency attribute is a local area of the output image designated a halftone cell. Each equal-sized cell relates to a corresponding area (size and location) of the continuous-tone input image. Within each cell, the high-frequency attribute is a centered variable-sized halftone dot composed of ink or toner. The ratio of the inked area to the non-inked area of the output cell corresponds to the luminance or graylevel of the input cell. From a suitable distance, the human eye averages both the high-frequency apparent gray level approximated by the ratio within the cell and the low-frequency apparent changes in gray level between adjacent equally spaced cells and centered dots.\nDigital halftoning uses a raster image or bitmap within which each monochrome picture element or pixel may be on or off, ink or no ink. Consequently, to emulate the photographic halftone cell, the digital halftone cell must contain groups of monochrome pixels within the same-sized cell area. The fixed location and size of these monochrome pixels compromises the high-frequency/low-frequency dichotomy of the photographic halftone method. Clustered multi-pixel dots cannot \"grow\" incrementally but in jumps of one whole pixel. In addition, the placement of that pixel is slightly off-center. To minimize this compromise, the digital halftone monochrome pixels must be quite small, numbering from 600 to 2,540, or more, pixels per inch. However, digital image processing has also enabled more sophisticated dithering algorithms to decide which pixels to turn black or white, some of which yield better results than digital halftoning. Digital halftoning based on some modern image processing tools such as nonlinear diffusion and stochastic flipping has also been proposed recently.\nModulation.\nThe most common method of creating screens, amplitude modulation, produces a regular grid of dots that vary in size. The other method of creating screens, frequency modulation, is used in a process also known as stochastic screening. Both modulation methods are named by analogy with the use of the terms in telecommunications.\nInverse halftoning.\nInverse halftoning or descreening is the process of reconstructing high-quality continuous-tone images from the halftone version. Inverse halftoning is an ill-posed problem because different source images can produce the same halftone image. Consequently, one halftone image has multiple plausible reconstructions. Additionally, information like tones and details are discarded during halftoning and thus irrecoverably lost. Due to the variety of different halftone patterns, it is not always obvious which algorithm to use for the best quality.\nThere are many situations where reconstruction is desired. For artists, it is a challenging task to edit halftone images. Even simple modifications like altering the brightness usually work by changing the color tones. In halftone images, this additionally requires preservation of the regular pattern. The same applies to more complex tools like retouching. Many other image processing techniques are designed to operate on continuous-tone images. For example, image compression algorithms are more efficient for those images. Another reason is the visual aspect since halftoning degrades the quality of an image. Sudden tone changes of the original image are removed due to the limited tone variations in halftoned images. It can also introduce distortions and visual effects like moir\u00e9 patterns. Especially when printed on newspaper, the halftone pattern becomes more visible due to the paper properties. By scanning and reprinting these images moir\u00e9 patterns are emphasized. Thus, reconstructing them before reprinting is important to provide a reasonable quality.\nSpatial and frequency filtering.\nThe main steps of the procedure are the removal of halftone patterns and reconstruction of tone changes. In the end, it may be necessary to recover details to improve image quality. There are many halftoning algorithms which can be mostly classified into the categories ordered dithering, error diffusion, and optimization-based methods. It is important to choose a proper descreening strategy since they generate different patterns and most of the inverse halftoning algorithms are designed for a particular type of pattern. Time is another selection criteria because many algorithms are iterative and therefore rather slow.\nThe most straightforward way to remove the halftone patterns is the application of a low-pass filter either in spatial or frequency domain. A simple example is a Gaussian filter. It discards the high-frequency information which blurs the image and simultaneously reduces the halftone pattern. This is similar to the blurring effect of our eyes when viewing a halftone image. In any case, it is important to pick a proper bandwidth. A too-limited bandwidth blurs edges out, while a high bandwidth produces a noisy image because it does not remove the pattern completely. Due to this trade-off, it is not able to reconstruct reasonable edge information.\nFurther improvements can be achieved with edge enhancement. Decomposing the halftone image into its wavelet representation allows to pick information from different frequency bands. Edges are usually consisting of highpass energy. By using the extracted highpass information, it is possible to treat areas around edges differently to emphasize them while keeping lowpass information among smooth regions.\nOptimization-based filtering.\nAnother possibility for inverse halftoning is the usage of machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks. These learning-based approaches can find the descreening technique that gets as close as possible to the perfect one. The idea is to use different strategies depending on the actual halftone image. Even for different content within the same image, the strategy should be varied. Convolutional neural networks are well-suited for tasks like object detection which allows a category based descreening. Additionally, they can do edge detection to enhance the details around edge areas. The results can be further improved by generative adversarial networks. This type of network can artificially generate content and recover lost details. However, these methods are limited by the quality and completeness of the used training data. Unseen halftoning patterns which were not represented in the training data are rather hard to remove. Additionally, the learning process can take some time. By contrast, computing the inverse halftoning image is fast compared to other iterative methods because it requires only a single computational step.\nLookup table.\nUnlike other approaches, the lookup table method does not involve any filtering. It works by computing a distribution of the neighborhood for every pixel in the halftone image. The lookup table provides a continuous-tone value for a given pixel and its distribution. The corresponding lookup table is obtained before using histograms of halftone images and their corresponding originals. The histograms provide the distribution before and after halftoning and make it possible to approximate the continuous-tone value for a specific distribution in the halftone image. For this approach, the halftoning strategy has to be known in advance for choosing a proper lookup table. Additionally, the table needs to be recomputed for every new halftoning pattern. Generating the descreened image is fast compared to iterative methods because it requires a lookup per pixel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born at Bagnols in Languedoc, France. According to Abraham Zacuto and others, he was the son of Gerson ben Solomon Catalan.\nBiography.\nAs in the case of the other medieval Jewish philosophers, little is known of his life. His family had been distinguished for piety and exegetical skill in Talmud, but though he was known in the Jewish community by commentaries on certain books of the Bible, he never seems to have accepted any rabbinical post. It has been suggested that the uniqueness of his opinions may have put obstacles in the way of his advancement to a higher position or office. He is known to have been at Avignon and Orange during his life, and is believed to have died in 1344, though Zacuto asserts that he died at Perpignan in 1370.\nGersonides is known for his unorthodox views and rigid Aristotelianism, which eventually led him to rationalize many of the miracles in the Bible. His commentary on the Bible was sharply criticized by the most prominent scholars, such as Abarbanel, Chisdai Crescas, and Rivash, the latter accusing him of heresy and almost banning his works.\nPhilosophical and religious works.\nPart of his writings consist of commentaries on the portions of Aristotle then known, or rather of commentaries on the commentaries of Averroes. Some of these are printed in the early Latin editions of Aristotle's works. His most important treatise, that by which he has a place in the history of philosophy, is entitled \"Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem\", (\"The Wars of the Lord\"), and occupied twelve years in composition (1317\u20131329). A portion of it, containing an elaborate survey of astronomy as known to the Arabs, was translated into Latin in 1342 at the request of Pope Clement VI.\n\"The Wars of the Lord\" is modeled after the plan of the great work of Jewish philosophy, the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" of Maimonides. It may be regarded as a criticism of some elements of Maimonides' syncretism of Aristotelianism and rabbinic Jewish thought. Ralbag's treatise strictly adhered to Aristotelian thought. The \"Wars of the Lord\" review:\n1. the doctrine of the soul, in which Gersonides defends the theory of impersonal reason as mediating between God and man, and explains the formation of the higher reason (or acquired intellect, as it was called) in humanity\u2014his view being thoroughly realist and resembling that of Avicebron;\n2. prophecy;\n3. and 4. God's knowledge of facts and providence, in which is advanced the theory that God does not decide individual facts. While there is general providence for all, special providence only extends to those whose reason has been enlightened;\n5. celestial substances, treating of the strange spiritual hierarchy which the Jewish philosophers of the middle ages accepted from the Neoplatonists and the pseudo-Dionysius, and also giving, along with astronomical details, much of astrological theory; and\n6. creation and miracles, in respect to which Gersonides deviates widely from the position of Maimonides.\nGersonides was also the author of commentaries on the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, I &amp; II Samuel, I &amp; II Kings, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles. He makes reference to a commentary on Isaiah, but it is not extant.\nViews on God and omniscience.\nIn contrast to the theology held by other Jewish thinkers, Jewish theologian Louis Jacobs argues, Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. \"Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, holds that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.\"\nAnother neoclassical Jewish proponent of self-limited omniscience was Abraham ibn Daud. \"Whereas the earlier Jewish philosophers extended the omniscience of God to include the free acts of man, and had argued that human freedom of decision was not affected by God's foreknowledge of its results, Ibn Daud, evidently following Alexander of Aphrodisias, excludes human action from divine foreknowledge. God, he holds, limited his omniscience even as He limited His omnipotence in regard to human acts\".\nThe view that God does not have foreknowledge of moral decisions which was advanced by ibn Daud and Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom) is not quite as isolated as Rabbi Bleich indicates, and it enjoys the support of two highly respected Acharonim, Rabbi Yeshayahu Horowitz (\"Shelah haKadosh\") and Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar (\"Or haHayim haKadosh\"). The former takes the views that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but this does not impair His perfection. The latter considers that God could know the future if He wished, but deliberately refrains from using this ability in order to avoid the conflict with free will.\nRabbi Yeshayahu Horowitz explained the apparent paradox of his position by citing the old question, \"Can God create a rock so heavy that He cannot pick it up?\" He said that we cannot accept free choice as a creation of God's, and simultaneously question its logical compatibility with omnipotence.\nSee further discussion in \"Free will in Jewish thought\".\nViews of the afterlife.\nGersonides posits that people's souls are composed of two parts: a material, or human, intellect; and an acquired, or agent, intellect. The material intellect is inherent in every person, and gives people the capacity to understand and learn. This material intellect is mortal, and dies with the body. However, he also posits that the soul also has an acquired intellect. This survives death, and can contain the accumulated knowledge that the person acquired during his lifetime. For Gersonides, Seymour Feldman points out, Man is immortal insofar as he attains the intellectual perfection that is open to him. This means that man becomes immortal only if and to the extent that he acquires knowledge of what he can in principle know, e.g. mathematics and the natural sciences. This knowledge survives his bodily death and constitutes his immortality.\nTalmudic works.\nGersonides was the author of the following Talmudic and halakhic works: \nOnly the first work is extant.\nWorks in mathematics and astronomy/astrology.\nGersonides was the first to make a number of major mathematical and scientific advances, though since he wrote only in Hebrew and few of his writings were translated to other languages, his influence on non-Jewish thought was limited.\nGersonides wrote \"Maaseh Hoshev\" in 1321 dealing with arithmetical operations including extraction of square and cube roots, various algebraic identities, certain sums including sums of consecutive integers, squares, and cubes, binomial coefficients, and simple combinatorial identities. The work is notable for its early use of proof by mathematical induction, and pioneering work in combinatorics. The title Maaseh Hoshev literally means the Work of the thinker, but it is also a pun on a biblical phrase meaning \"clever work\". Maaseh Hoshev is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Sefer Hamispar (The Book of Number), which is an earlier and less sophisticated work by Rabbi Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra (1090\u20131167). In 1342, Gersonides wrote \"On Sines, Chords and Arcs\", which examined trigonometry, in particular proving the sine law for plane triangles and giving five-figure sine tables.\nOne year later, at the request of the bishop of Meaux, he wrote \"The Harmony of Numbers\" in which he considers a problem of Philippe de Vitry involving so-called \"harmonic numbers\", which have the form 2\"m\"\u00b73\"n\". The problem was to characterize all pairs of harmonic numbers differing by 1. Gersonides proved that there are only four such pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) and (8,9).\nHe is also credited to have invented the Jacob's staff, an instrument to measure the angular distance between celestial objects. It is described as consisting &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026of a staff of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) long and about one inch (2.5 cm) wide, with six or seven perforated tablets which could slide along the staff, each tablet being an integral fraction of the staff length to facilitate calculation, used to measure the distance between stars or planets, and the altitudes and diameters of the Sun, Moon and stars.\nGersonides observed a solar eclipse on March 3, 1337. After he had observed this event he proposed a new theory of the sun which he proceeded to test by further observations. Another eclipse observed by Gersonides was the eclipse of the Moon on 3 October 1335. He described a geometrical model for the motion of the Moon and made other astronomical observations of the Moon, Sun and planets using a camera obscura. Some of his beliefs were well wide of the truth, such as his belief that the Milky Way was on the sphere of the fixed stars and shines by the reflected light of the Sun. \nGersonides was also the earliest known mathematician to have used the technique of mathematical induction in a systematic and self-conscious fashion and anticipated Galileo's error theory.\nThe lunar crater Rabbi Levi is named after him.\nGersonides believed that astrology was real, and developed a naturalistic, non-supernatural explanation of how it works. Julius Guttman explained that for Gersonides, astrology was:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;founded on the metaphysical doctrine of the dependence of all earthly occurrences upon the heavenly world. The general connection imparted to the prophet by the active intellect is the general order of the astrological constellation. The constellation under which a man is born determines his nature and fate, and constellations as well determine the life span of nations. \u2026The active intellect knows the astrological order, from the most general form of the constellations to their last specification, which in turn contains all of the conditions of occurrence of a particular event. Thus, when a prophet deals with the destiny of a particular person or human group, he receives from the active intellect a knowledge of the order of the constellations, and with sufficient precision to enable him to predict its fate in full detail. \u2026This astrological determinism has only one limitation. The free will of man could shatter the course of action ordained for him by the stars; prophecy could therefore predict the future on the basis of astrological determination only insofar as the free will of man does not break through the determined course of things.\nEstimation of stellar distances and refutation of Ptolemy's model.\nGersonides appears to be the only astronomer before modern times to have surmised that the fixed stars are much further away than the planets. Whereas all other astronomers put the fixed stars on a rotating sphere just beyond the outer planets, Gersonides estimated the distance to the fixed stars to be no less than 159,651,513,380,944 earth radii, or about 100,000 lightyears in modern units.\nUsing data he collected from his own observations, Gersonides refuted Ptolemy's model in what the notable physicist Yuval Ne'eman has considered as \"one of the most important insights in the history of science, generally missed in telling the story of the transition from epicyclic corrections to the geocentric model to Copernicus' heliocentric model\". Ne'eman argued that after Gersonides reviewed Ptolemy's model with its epicycles he realized that it could be checked, by measuring the changes in the apparent brightnesses of Mars and looking for cyclical changes along the conjectured epicycles. These thus ceased being dogma, they were a theory that had to be experimentally verified, \"\u00e0 la Popper\". Gersonides developed tools for these measurements, essentially pinholes and the camera obscura.\nThe results of his observations did not fit Ptolemy's model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve on it. That challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus and Kepler three centuries later, but Gersonides was the first to falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Gersonides also showed that Ptolemy's model for the lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon's position, fails completely in predicting the apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the findings influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides' writings were translated and available.\nIn modern fiction.\nGersonides is an important character in the novel \"The Dream of Scipio\" by Iain Pears, where he is depicted as the mentor of the protagonist Olivier de Noyen, a non-Jewish poet and intellectual. A (fictional) encounter between Gersonides and Pope Clement VI at Avignon during the Black Death is a major element in the book's plot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was played in England from 11 to 30 July 1966. England defeated West Germany 4\u20132 in the final to win their first ever World Cup title. The final was level at 2\u20132 after 90 minutes and went to extra time, when Geoff Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat-trick, the first to be scored in a men's World Cup final. Portuguese striker Eus\u00e9bio was the tournament's top scorer, with nine goals clinching the golden boot with three goals more than second placed Helmut Haller. It was the first FIFA World Cup held in the English-speaking world.\nEngland were the fifth nation to win the event, and the third host nation to win after Uruguay in 1930 and Italy in 1934. Two time reigning champions Brazil failed to get past the group stages as they were defeated by Hungary and Portugal. It was the second time that defending champions were eliminated in the group stages after Italy in 1950. This would not occur again until 36 years later. The two debut teams performed well at the competition \u2013 North Korea beat Italy 1\u20130 on the way to reaching the quarter-finals, where they lost to Portugal 5\u20133 after leading 3\u20130. Portugal themselves finished third, beating Soviet Union 2\u20131 in the bronze-match.\nDuring the qualifying, FIFA, citing competitive and logistical issues, decided that there would be no direct qualifying place for an African team: all 15 African nations who had entered immediately boycotted the competition in protest. \nMatches were played at eight stadiums across England, foremost Wembley Stadium, which had a capacity of 98,600. Here England played all its matches, here the tournament was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and here the final was held as well. \nPrior to the tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen, but was recovered by a dog named Pickles four months before the tournament began. It was the first World Cup to have selected matches broadcast via satellite to countries on other continents. The final, which was broadcast locally by the BBC, was the last to be shown entirely in black and white. This was also the only World Cup in history that did not have matches on Sundays, due to religious laws at the time, which were only repealed ten years after in 1976.\nBackground.\nEngland was chosen as host of the 1966 World Cup in Rome, Italy, on 22 August 1960, over rival bids from West Germany and Spain. This was the first tournament to be held in a country that was affected directly by World War II, as the four previous tournaments were either held in countries out of war theatres or in neutral countries.\nQualification.\nDespite the Africans' absence, there was another new record number of entries for the qualifying tournament, with 70 nations taking part. FIFA determined that ten teams from Europe would qualify, along with four from South America, one from Asia and one from North and Central America.\nPortugal and North Korea qualified for the first time.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMascot and match ball.\nThe mascot for the 1966 competition was \"World Cup Willie\", a lion wearing a Union Jack jersey emblazoned with the words \"WORLD CUP\". This was the first World Cup mascot, and one of the first mascots to be associated with a major sporting competition. Willie was designed by freelance children's book illustrator Reg Hoye. The official match ball was produced by Slazenger for the tournament.\nControversies.\nAfrican boycott.\nAll fifteen entered African nations boycotted the tournament to protest against a 1964 FIFA ruling that required the three second-round winners from the African zone to enter a play-off round against the winners of the Asian zone in order to qualify for the World Cup: they felt winning their zone was enough in itself to merit qualification.\nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF) felt that the lack of direct representation of African nations in the World Cup was unfair, and demanded that FIFA guarantee at least one African nation a spot in the finals of the following tournament. They also protested against the readmission of South Africa to FIFA in 1963, despite their expulsion from CAF due to the country's apartheid regime in 1958.\nAs a result of this boycott, FIFA fined CAF 5,000 Swiss francs. Yidnekatchew Tessema, then president of the CAF, responded to this punishment by saying, \"FIFA has adopted a relentless attitude against the African Associations and its decisions resemble methods of intimidation and repression designed to discourage any further impulses of a similar nature. In our opinion, the African National Associations\u00a0... really deserved a gesture of respect rather than a fine.\"\nSouth Africa was subsequently assigned to the Asia and Oceania qualifying group, before being disqualified after being suspended again due to pressure from other African nations in October 1964. Despite this, FIFA refused to change the qualifying format, citing competitive and logistical issues, and the African teams withdrew in protest.\nCAF subsequently informed FIFA that they would refuse to participate in World Cup qualifying for 1970 unless at least one African team had an automatic place assured in the World Cup: this was put in place for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and all subsequent World Cup finals. Players from the Portuguese African colonies of Angola and Mozambique participated for Portugal.\nNorth Korea\u2013United Kingdom relations.\nThe United Kingdom, which had fought for South Korea in the Korean War, was concerned over the entry of North Korea in the tournament. The UK did not recognise North Korea and feared that its presence would strain relations with South Korea and the United States. FIFA told England's Football Association that the tournament would be moved if any qualified team were to be refused entry.\nOn the suggestion of the British Foreign Office, the playing of national anthems, and meetings between players and state figures such as Queen Elizabeth II, would only take place in two games: the opener and the final. North Korea was not scheduled for the former, and was considered unlikely to reach the latter. A Foreign Office suggestion for flags outside stadiums to be removed after each team's elimination, in the expectation of an early North Korean exit, was vetoed by the Department of Education and Science.\nTrophy incident.\nThe 1966 World Cup had a rather unusual hero off the field, a dog called Pickles. In the build-up to the tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen from an exhibition display. A nationwide hunt for the icon ensued. It was later discovered wrapped in newspaper as the dog sniffed under some bushes in London. The FA commissioned a replica cup in case the original cup was not found in time. This replica, as well as Pickles' collar, is held at the National Football Museum in Manchester, where it is on display.\nDoping.\nWest Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. A 2013 report by researchers at Berlin's Humboldt University on behalf of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, titled \"Doping in Germany from 1950 to today\", linked the West Germany national team of 1966, which reached the World Cup final, with doping.\nOfficiating issues and subsequent reforms.\nWhile refereeing controversies are common in World Cup history, the 1966 tournament stands out because of the structural reforms it provoked. A series of violent matches and contentious dismissals led FIFA to introduce major changes to the Laws of the Game in the following tournament.\nThe tournament was marked by persistently rough play and inconsistent officiating. In their opening match, Brazilian star Pel\u00e9 was repeatedly fouled and left the pitch injured after a strong tackle to the knee, forcing him to miss the subsequent match against Hungary. Upon returning for the final group stage clash with Portugal, Pel\u00e9 suffered two heavy challenges from Portuguese defenders, most notably Jo\u00e3o Morais, that ended his tournament. Pel\u00e9 departed on a stretcher, and Brazil exited the competition 3\u20131. Morais was allowed to remain on the pitch. No players were sent off in any of those games.\nFurther tension unfolded in the quarter-final between England and Argentina, when captain Antonio Ratt\u00edn was controversially sent off by referee Rudolf Kreitlein for allegedly \"violence of the tongue.\" Ratt\u00edn's refusal to immediately exit the field prompted a delay and police intervention, fuelling accusations of arbitrary officiating. In another quarter-final opposing West Germany to Uruguay, shortly after halftime, Uruguayan players Horacio Troche and H\u00e9ctor Silva were both dismissed by English referee Jim Finney during their match against West Germany. Uruguay conceded 3 goals when reduced to nine men, and South American media decried a pattern of European referee bias.\nIn light of these high-profile incidents, FIFA recognised the need for clearer disciplinary procedures and greater consistency in officiating. Ahead of the 1970 World Cup, the yellow and red card system was introduced, alongside the allowance of two substitutions per team and new efforts to standardise referee training and interpretations of the Laws of the Game.\nFormat.\nThe format of the 1966 competition remained the same as 1962: 16 qualified teams were divided into four groups of four. Each group played a round-robin format. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw, with goal average and eventually drawing lots used to separate teams equal on points. The top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.\nIn the knockout games, if the teams were tied after 90 minutes, 30 minutes of extra time were played. For any match other than the final, if the teams were still tied after extra time, lots would be drawn to determine the winner. The final would have been replayed if tied after extra time; but if still tied after the replay, the champion would have been decided by drawing lots. In the event, no replays or drawing of lots were necessary.\nThe draw for the final tournament, taking place on 6 January 1966 at the Royal Garden Hotel in London was the first ever to be televised, with England, West Germany, Brazil and Italy as seeds.\nVenues.\nEight venues were used for this World Cup. The newest and biggest venue used was Wembley Stadium in north west London, which was 43 years old in 1966. As was often the case in the World Cup, group matches were played in two venues close to each other. Group 1 matches (which included the hosts) were all played in London: five at Wembley, which was England's national stadium and was considered to be the most important football venue in the world; and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley. The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley. Because Wembley's owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London. Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3's matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4's matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland. The stadium construction cost are estimated to be today's equivalent of \u00a39.2 million, additional to \u00a336.22 million for tournament organisation.\nThe most used venue was Wembley, which was used for nine matches, including all six featuring England, the final and the third-place match. Goodison Park was used for five matches, Roker Park and Hillsborough both hosted four, while Old Trafford, Villa Park and Ayresome Park each hosted three matches and did not host any knockout round matches.\nTournament summary.\nThe opening match took place on Monday, 11 July, which made it the second World Cup after 1930 to not begin on May or June. Before the tournament began, eventual winners England were 9/2 second favourites with bookmakers behind Brazil (9/4), while beaten finalists West Germany were 25/1 outsiders. The final took place on Saturday, 30 July 1966, the 36th anniversary of the first final. Until 2022, this was the latest date that any tournament had concluded. The reason for the unusually late scheduling of the tournament appears to lie with the outside broadcast commitments of the BBC, which also had commitments to cover Wimbledon (which ran between 20 June and 2 July) and the Open Golf Championship (6 to 9 July).\nGroup stage.\n1966 was a World Cup with few goals as the teams began to play much more tactically and defensively. This was exemplified by Alf Ramsey's England as they finished top of Group 1 with only four goals, but having none scored against them. They also became the first World Cup winning team not to win its first game in the tournament. Uruguay were the other team to qualify from that group at the expense of both Mexico and France. All the group's matches were played at Wembley Stadium apart from the match between Uruguay and France which took place at White City Stadium.\nIn Group 2, West Germany and Argentina qualified with ease as they both finished the group with 5 points, Spain managed 2, while Switzerland left the competition after losing all three group matches. FIFA cautioned Argentina for its violent style in the group games, particularly in the scoreless draw with West Germany, which saw Argentinean Rafael Albrecht get sent off and suspended for the next match.\nIn the northwest of England, Old Trafford and Goodison Park played host to Group 3 which saw the two-time defending champions Brazil finish in third place behind Portugal and Hungary, and be eliminated along with Bulgaria. Brazil were defeated 3\u20131 by Hungary in a classic encounter before falling by the same scoreline to Portugal in a controversial game. Portugal appeared in the finals for the first time, and made quite an impact. They won all three of their games in the group stage, with a lot of help from their outstanding striker Eus\u00e9bio, whose nine goals made him the tournament's top scorer.\nGroup 4, however, provided the biggest upset when North Korea beat Italy 1\u20130 at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the Soviet Union. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup: the next would be Morocco in 1986.\nKnock-out stages.\nThe quarter-finals provided a controversial victory for West Germany as they cruised past Uruguay 4\u20130; the South Americans claimed that this occurred only after the referee (who was Jim Finney from England) had not recognised a handball by Schnellinger on the goal line and then had sent off two players from Uruguay: Horacio Troche and H\u00e9ctor Silva. It appeared as if the surprise package North Korea would claim another major upset in their match against Portugal at Goodison Park: they led 3\u20130 after 22 minutes. It fell to one of the greatest stars of the tournament, Eus\u00e9bio, to change that. He scored four goals in the game and Jos\u00e9 Augusto added a fifth goal in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5\u20133 victory.\nMeanwhile, in the other two games, Ferenc Bene's late goal for Hungary against the Soviet Union, who were led by Lev Yashin's stellar goalkeeping, proved little more than a consolation as they crashed out 2\u20131, and the only goal between Argentina and England came courtesy of England's Geoff Hurst. During that controversial game (for more details see Argentina and England football rivalry), Argentina's Antonio Ratt\u00edn became the first player to be sent off in a senior international football match at Wembley. Ratt\u00edn at first refused to leave the field and eventually had to be escorted by several policemen. Scoreless when Rattin was dismissed, the game was decided by Hurst's headed goal twelve minutes from the end of normal time. This game is called \"el robo del siglo\" (lit.\u2009'the robbery of the century') in Argentina.\nAll semi-finalists were from Europe. Bobby Charlton scored both goals in England's win, with Portugal's goal coming from a penalty in the 82nd minute after a handball by Jack Charlton on the goal line. The other semi-final also finished 2\u20131: Franz Beckenbauer scoring the winning goal with a left foot shot from the edge of the area for West Germany as they beat the Soviet Union.\nPortugal went on to beat the Soviet Union 2\u20131 to take third place. Portugal's third place was the best finish by a team making its World Cup debut since 1934. It was equalled by Croatia in 1998.\nFinal.\nLondon's Wembley Stadium was the venue for the final, and 98,000 people attended. After 12 minutes 32 seconds Helmut Haller put West Germany ahead, but the score was levelled by Geoff Hurst four minutes later. Martin Peters put England in the lead in the 78th minute; England looked set to claim the title when the referee awarded a free kick to West Germany with one minute left. The ball was launched goalward and Wolfgang Weber scored, with England appealing in vain for handball as the ball came through the crowded penalty area.\nWith the score level at 2\u20132 at the end of 90 minutes, the game went to extra time. In the 98th minute, Hurst found himself on the scoresheet again; his shot hit the crossbar, bounced down onto the goal line, and was awarded as a goal. Debate has long raged over whether the ball crossed the line, with the goal becoming part of World Cup history. England's final goal was scored by Hurst again, as a celebratory pitch invasion began. This made Geoff Hurst the first player to have scored three times in a single World Cup final. BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme's description of the match's closing moments has gone down in history: \"Some people are on the pitch. They think it's all over ... \"[Hurst scores]\" It is now!\"\nEngland's total of eleven goals scored in six games set a new record low for average goals per game scored by a World Cup winning team. The record stood until 1982, when it was surpassed by Italy's 12 goals in seven games; in 2010 this record was lowered again by Spain, winning the Cup with eight goals in seven games. England's total of three goals conceded also constituted a record low for average goals per game conceded by a World Cup winning team. That record stood until 1994, when it was surpassed by Brazil's three goals in seven games. France again lowered the record to two goals in seven during the 1998 tournament, a record that has since been equalled by Italy at the 2006 tournament and by Spain's two goals conceded during the 2010 tournament.\nEngland received the recovered Jules Rimet trophy from Queen Elizabeth II and were crowned World Cup winners for the first time.\nIn this World Cup, the national anthems were played only in the final. They were not played in the earlier matches because the organisers (FIFA and the FA) feared that North Korea's presence \u2013 a socialist country that was not recognised by the United Kingdom \u2013 in the World Cup would cause problems with South Korea. A memo from the Foreign Office months before the finals began stated that the solution would be \"denying the visas to North Korean players\". The final, held at Wembley Stadium, was the last to be broadcast in black and white.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 26 match referees and other officials featured at the event. Despite the event being a worldwide tournament, the majority of the officials were from Europe.

Milnor is a distinguished professor at Stony Brook University and the only mathematician to have won the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, the Abel Prize and all three Steele prizes.\nEarly life and career.\nMilnor was born on February 20, 1931, in Orange, New Jersey. His father was J. Willard Milnor, an engineer, and his mother was Emily Cox Milnor. As an undergraduate at Princeton University he was named a Putnam Fellow in 1949 and 1950 and also proved the F\u00e1ry\u2013Milnor theorem when he was only 19 years old. Milnor graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1951 after completing a senior thesis, titled \"Link groups\", under the supervision of Ralph Fox. He remained at Princeton to pursue graduate studies and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1954 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Isotopy of links\", also under the supervision of Fox. His dissertation concerned link groups (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, classifying Brunnian links up to link-homotopy and introduced new invariants of it, called Milnor invariants. Upon completing his doctorate, he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1970 to 1990.\nHe was an editor of the \"Annals of Mathematics\" for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books which are famous for their clarity, presentation, and an inspiration for the research by many mathematicians in their areas even after many decades since their publication. He served as Vice President of the AMS in 1976\u201377 period.\nHis students have included Tadatoshi Akiba, Jon Folkman, John Mather, Laurent C. Siebenmann, Michael Spivak, and Jonathan Sondow. His wife, Dusa McDuff, is a professor of mathematics at Barnard College and is known for her work in symplectic topology.\nResearch.\nOne of Milnor's best-known works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of 7-dimensional spheres with nonstandard differentiable structure, which marked the beginning of a new field \u2013 differential topology. He coined the term exotic sphere, referring to any \"n\"-sphere with nonstandard differential structure. Kervaire and Milnor initiated the systematic study of exotic spheres by Kervaire\u2013Milnor groups, showing in particular that the 7-sphere has 15 distinct differentiable structures (28 if one considers orientation).\nEgbert Brieskorn found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a singular point is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently, Milnor worked on the topology of isolated singular points of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the Milnor fibration whose fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of \"\u03bc\" spheres where \"\u03bc\" is known as the Milnor number. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory, \"Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces\", inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area that continues to mature to this day.\nIn 1961 Milnor disproved the Hauptvermutung by illustrating two simplicial complexes that are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct, using the concept of Reidemeister torsion.\nIn 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of attractor. The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called unstable attractors and are now known as Milnor attractors.\nMilnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of \"Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics\":\nIt is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with Thurston. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with Poincar\u00e9's work on circle diffeomorphisms, which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems. \nHis other significant contributions include microbundles, influencing the usage of Hopf algebras, theory of quadratic forms and the related area of symmetric bilinear forms, higher algebraic K-theory, game theory, and three-dimensional Lie groups.\nAwards and honors.\nMilnor was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961. In 1962 Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal for his work in differential topology. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1963 and the American Philosophical Society 1965. He later went on to win the National Medal of Science (1967), the Lester R. Ford Award in 1970 and again in 1984, the Leroy P. Steele Prize for \"Seminal Contribution to Research\" (1982), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1989), the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2004), and the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2011). In 1991 a symposium was held at Stony Brook University in celebration of his 60th birthday.\nMilnor was awarded the 2011 Abel Prize, for his \"pioneering discoveries in topology, geometry and algebra.\" Reacting to the award, Milnor told the \"New Scientist\" \"It feels very good,\" adding that \"[o]ne is always surprised by a call at 6 o'clock in the morning.\"\nIn 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for \"contributions to differential topology, geometric topology, algebraic topology, algebra, and dynamical systems\".\nIn 2020 he received the Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the German invasion of France, his family took refuge in Switzerland and then in Lyon. In 1941 he moved to Paris to attend Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and in 1943 he began studying mathematics at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, becoming agr\u00e9g\u00e9 in 1946.\nHe received his PhD in 1951 from the University of Paris. His thesis, titled \"Espaces fibr\u00e9s en sph\u00e8res et carr\u00e9s de Steenrod\" (\"Sphere bundles and Steenrod squares\"), was written under the direction of Henri Cartan.\nAfter a fellowship at Princeton University Graduate College (1951\u20131952), he became Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences at the Universities of Grenoble (1953\u20131954) and Strasbourg (1954\u20131963), where he was appointed Professor in 1957. In 1964 he moved to the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, in Bures-sur-Yvette, where he worked until 1990.\nIn 1958, Thom received the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh for the foundations of cobordism theory, which were already present in his thesis. He was invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians two more times: in 1970 in Nice and 1983 in Warsaw (which he did not attend).\nHe was awarded the Brouwer Medal in 1970, the Grand Prix Scientifique de la Ville de Paris in 1974, and the John von Neumann Lecture Prize in 1976. He became the first president, together with Louis N\u00e9el, of the newly established Fondation Louis-de-Broglie In 1973 and was elected Member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences of Paris in 1976.\nSalvador Dal\u00ed paid homage to Ren\u00e9 Thom with the paintings \"The Swallow's Tail\" and \"Topological Abduction of Europe\".\nResearch.\nWhile Ren\u00e9 Thom is most known to the public for his development of catastrophe theory between 1968 and 1972, his academic achievements concern mostly his mathematical work on topology.\nIn the early 1950s, it concerned what are now called Thom spaces, characteristic classes, cobordism theory, and the Thom transversality theorem. Another example of this line of work is the Thom conjecture, versions of which have been investigated using gauge theory. From the mid 1950s he moved into singularity theory, of which catastrophe theory is just one aspect, and in a series of deep (and at the time obscure) papers between 1960 and 1969 developed the theory of stratified sets and stratified maps, proving a basic stratified isotopy theorem describing the local conical structure of Whitney stratified sets, now known as the Thom\u2013Mather isotopy theorem. Much of his work on stratified sets was developed so as to understand the notion of topologically stable maps, and to eventually prove the result that the set of topologically stable mappings between two smooth manifolds is a dense set.\nThom's lectures on the stability of differentiable mappings, given at the University of Bonn in 1960, were written up by Harold Levine and published in the proceedings of a year long symposium on singularities at Liverpool University during 1969\u201370, edited by C. T. C. Wall. The proof of the density of topologically stable mappings was completed by John Mather in 1970, based on the ideas developed by Thom in the previous ten years. A coherent detailed account was published in 1976 by Christopher Gibson, Klaus Wirthm\u00fcller, Andrew du Plessis, and Eduard Looijenga.\nDuring the last twenty years of his life Thom's published work was mainly in philosophy and epistemology, and he undertook a reevaluation of Aristotle's writings on science. In 1992, he was one of eighteen academics who sent a letter to Cambridge University protesting against plans to award Jacques Derrida an honorary doctorate.\nBeyond Thom's contributions to algebraic topology, he studied differentiable mappings, through the study of generic properties. In his final years, he turned his attention to an effort to apply his ideas about structural topography to the questions of thought, language, and meaning in the form of a \"semiophysics\"."}

He settled in what was then Taos, New Mexico Territory (1898) and was a founder of the Taos art colony. He is known for his paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico, and the American Southwest. He was also a benefactor of the Western artist Harold Dow Bugbee, who became curator of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas in 1951.\nEarly life and education.\nPhillips was born in Hudson, New York in 1868. During his childhood he was influenced by tales of the exploits of American frontiersman Kit Carson and other tales of Western adventure involving American Indians, such as those in James Fenimore Cooper's \"Leatherstocking Tales\". In his recollections of childhood, he noted that he could always be found with paintbrush in hand. He was one of the first to enroll when George McKinstry opened an art studio in Hudson.\nPhillips left home at age sixteen, moving to New York City where he attended the Art Students League of New York and the National Academy of Design. In 1894 he traveled to Europe, briefly staying in London before moving to Paris, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. While at the Acad\u00e9mie he became friends with Ernest Blumenschein and Joseph Henry Sharp.\nArtistic career.\nPhillips returned to New York in 1896, where together with Ernest Blumenschein he leased a studio. In the Spring of 1898, Phillips accompanied Blumenschein on a journey to the American West. Their first stop was Denver, Colorado, where they bought art and camping supplies, a wagon, horses, and a revolver. Thus equipped, they set out with the intention of reaching Mexico.\nIn northern New Mexico, one of their wagon wheels broke due to the roughness of the terrain. Blumenschein rode out on horseback to nearby Taos, New Mexico to have the wheel repaired, while Phillips waited with the wagon. After Blumenschein returned with the repaired wheel three days later, they continued on to Taos, where they sold their horse and equipage, set up a studio, and began to paint.\nPhillips decided to stay in Taos when Blumenschein returned to New York a few months later. He and a friend caused a skirmish during a religious ceremony on Taos Plaza when they refused to remove their hats; during the skirmish the sheriff was killed. The incident increased tensions between the town's Hispanic and Anglo residents. Phillips wrote in a letter to Blumenschein, \"I began to feel as if this was the real 'border life', and only wish old Kit Carson was here with us.\"\nPhillips married Rose Martin, the sister of the famous local doctor Thomas \"Doc\" Martin, in 1899. He conceived the idea of starting an art colony in Taos, which he discussed in correspondence with Blumenschein. In 1915, his dream became reality with the formation of the Taos Society of Artists, of which Phillips was a founding member together with his friends Ernest Blumenschein, Joseph Henry Sharp, and three other artists. The Society was founded in the dining room of Phillips' in-laws, Doc and Helen Martin, who was herself a batik artist. In addition to being instrumental in the formation of the Society, Phillips also spent more years in Taos than any other member.\nConservationism.\nPhillips was instrumental in the 1906 establishment of the Taos National Forest. He later became its first forest ranger when he needed to rest his eyesight.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1936, Ahlfors was awarded the first Fields Medal, along with American mathematician Jesse Douglas.\nBackground.\nAhlfors was born in Helsinki, Finland. His mother, Siev\u00e4 Helander, died at his birth. His father, Axel Ahlfors, was a professor of engineering at the Helsinki University of Technology. The Ahlfors family was Swedish-speaking, so he first attended the private school Nya svenska samskolan where all classes were taught in Swedish. Ahlfors studied at University of Helsinki from 1924, graduating in 1928 having studied under Ernst Lindel\u00f6f and Rolf Nevanlinna. He assisted Nevanlinna in 1929 with his work on Denjoy's conjecture on the number of asymptotic values of an entire function.\nIn 1929 Ahlfors published the first proof of this conjecture, now known as the Denjoy\u2013Carleman\u2013Ahlfors theorem. It states that the number of asymptotic values approached by an entire function of order \u03c1 along curves in the complex plane going toward infinity is less than or equal to 2\u03c1.\nHe completed his doctorate from the University of Helsinki in 1930.\nCareer.\nAhlfors worked as an associate professor at the University of Helsinki from 1933 to 1936. In 1936 he was one of the first two people to be awarded the Fields Medal (the other was Jesse Douglas). In 1935 Ahlfors visited Harvard University. He returned to Finland in 1938 to take up a professorship at the University of Helsinki. The outbreak of war in 1939 led to problems although Ahlfors was unfit for military service. He was offered a position at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich in 1944 and finally managed to travel there in March 1945. He did not enjoy his time in Switzerland, so in 1946 he jumped at a chance to leave, returning to work at Harvard, where he remained until his retirement in 1977; he was William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics from 1964. Ahlfors was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1962 and again in 1966. He was awarded the Wihuri International Prize in 1968 and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1981. He served as the Honorary President of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1986 at Berkeley, California, in celebration of his 50th year of the award of his Fields Medal.\nHis book \"Complex Analysis\" (1953) is the classic text on the subject and is almost certainly referenced in any more recent text which makes heavy use of complex analysis. Ahlfors wrote several other significant books, including \"Riemann surfaces\" (1960) and \"Conformal invariants\" (1973).\nHe made decisive contributions to meromorphic curves, value distribution theory, Riemann surfaces, conformal geometry, quasiconformal mappings and other areas during his career.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1933, he married Erna Lehnert, an Austrian who with her parents had first settled in Sweden and then in Finland. The couple had three daughters. Ahlfors died of pneumonia at the Willowwood nursing home in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1996.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Irving Couse", "text": "American painter\nEanger Irving Couse (September 3, 1866 \u2013 April 26, 1936) was an American artist and a founding member and first president of the Taos Society of Artists. Born and reared in Saginaw, Michigan, he went to New York City and Paris to study art. While spending summers in Taos, New Mexico, he began to make the paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico, and the American Southwest for which he is best known. He later settled full time in Taos.\nHis house and studio in Taos have been preserved as the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios. The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nEarly life and education.\nCouse (pronounced to rhyme with \"house\")\nwas born to a farming family in Saginaw, Michigan. As a boy, he started drawing members of the Chippewa tribe who lived nearby. He attended local schools as a child and continued to work at art.\nCouse left Michigan for professional art studies at the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Academy of Design, New York. He went to Paris, where he studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and Acad\u00e9mie Julian under William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He lived in France for 10 years, painting mostly landscapes of the Normandy coast. Between 1893 and 1896, he lived at the Etaples art colony, where he painted its streets and fisher folk, including \"Coastal Scene, Etaples\".\nArtistic career in the United States.\nAfter his return to the United States, Couse first lived in New York. He spent time in Taos, New Mexico during the summers. At the turn of the 19th century, the Southwest, and New Mexico in particular, attracted numerous artists and writers because it remained untouched by national expansion efforts dictated by the American policy of Manifest Destiny. The artists and writers of this era wanted to capture the last vestiges of the Old West before it disappeared altogether. During his time in New Mexico, Couse studied and painted the lives and culture of the Taos Indians, a Pueblo tribe. He began to show his paintings of Native American life and earned his first solo show in 1891.\nIn 1911 Couse was elected to the National Academy of Design. He also became active in the Taos art colony. In 1915, Couse was one of the six founding members of the Taos Society of Artists, and was elected first president. Another founding member was the artist J. H. Sharp, who adapted a chapel near Couse's house as a studio. Later Sharp built a combined house and studio on the land. The adjacent properties are recognized jointly as the Couse/Sharp Historic Site, and are preserved and operated by the Couse Foundation.\nAmong Couse's works in public galleries are \"Elk-Foot of the Taos Tribe\" (Smithsonian American Art Museum); \"Taos Pueblo - Moonlight\" (New Mexico Museum of Art); \"The Forest Camp\" (Brooklyn Museum of Art); \"The Pottery Maker\" (Two Red Roses Foundation); \"The Tom-Tom Maker\" (Lotos Club, New York); \"Medicine Fires\" (Montclair Gallery, New Jersey); and \"Shapanagons, a Chippewa Chief\" (Detroit Museum of Art).\nOf these works, \"Elk-Foot of the Taos Tribe\", painted in the summer of 1909, is considered Couse's masterwork. The painting was purchased for the United States national art collection by the well-known art collector William T. Evans and is now displayed in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Elk-foot, whose anglicized name was Jerry Mirabal, began posing for Couse in 1907 and was one of the painters favorite subjects because of his \"physical beauty and ideal features.\"\nEarly works.\nCouse's \"The Captive\" was shown in 1891 at his first solo exhibition, held at the Portland Art Association in Oregon, and then at the Paris Salon of 1892. This large, \"salon size\" painting was the first Native American subject by Couse, who later achieved fame in the United States for his paintings of the indigenous peoples of New Mexico. In 1991, \"The Captive\" was included in the National Museum of American Art exhibition entitled \"The West as America,\" which created controversy by its curatorial interpretation of the artists' meanings and intents. Art historians have explored the painting's racial, sexual, and social motives in the context of American society at the time.\nIn 1899, Couse exhibited three paintings at the Boston Art Club: \"A Cayuse Indian\" (oil), \"Maternity\" (oil), and \"Yakima Encampment\" (oil). His address at that time was the Van Dyck Studios, 939 8th Avenue, New York City.\nLegacy and honors.\nHis works won recognition and numerous awards from such institutions as the following: the Paris Salon, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Academy of Design (Second Hallgarten Prize, 1900; First Hallgarten Prize, 1902; Altman Prize, 1916); and the Salmagundi Club (Isidor prize, 1917). He was awarded the Lippincott prize from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1921). He received awards from the American Exposition, Buffalo; the Boston Art Club, the Corcoran Gallery, and the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco (silver medal, 1915). His works are held in many museums in the United States and around the world, including a collection from David and Peggy Rockefeller, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\nTwo buildings he used as studios are part of the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties. This is one of 30 sites recognized as an \"Historic Artist's Home and Studio Associate Site\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In 2001 the Couse Foundation was formed to restore and preserve the properties. It operates the historic site of the two artists and offers scheduled tours.\nDeath.\nCouse died in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1936 at the age of 69. He is buried at Sierra View Cemetery in Taos.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

In 1912 he briefly studied at the Art Student's League, where Ernest Blumenschein told him about Taos, New Mexico.\nArtistic career.\nHe first visited Taos in 1912 and became part of the Taos art colony. Dunton became one of the founding members of the Taos Society of Artists in 1915.\nAmong his proteges in Western art was Harold Dow Bugbee of Clarendon and Canyon in the Texas Panhandle.\nIn 1921, American oil executive W. H. McFadden commissioned Dunton to paint a full-length portrait of big-game hunter Ben Lilly. The portrait was exhibited by the National Academy of Design before being located in McFadden's home in New Orleans. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and first appeared professionally on the stage in 1926. Over his career he received an Academy Award and a Grammy Award as well as nominations for two BAFTAs and a Golden Globe. He earned a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\nLaughton played a wide range of classical and modern roles both on West End and Off West End, making an impact in Shakespeare at the Old Vic. His acting career took him to Broadway and then Hollywood, where portrayed everything from monsters and misfits to kings. He earned the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the title character in the historical drama \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" (1933). He was further Oscar-nominated for his roles as Captain William Bligh in the action adventure \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935) and an irascible barrister in the courtroom drama \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957). Among Laughton's biggest film hits were \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (1934), \"Ruggles of Red Gap\" (1935), \"Rembrandt\" (1936), \"Jamaica Inn\" (1939), \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939), \"The Big Clock\" (1948), \"Young Bess\" (1953), \"Hobson's Choice\" (1954) and \"Spartacus\" (1960). His final film role was in \"Advise &amp; Consent\" (1962). \nHe directed one film, the acclaimed thriller \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955). In his later career, Laughton took up stage directing, notably in the dramas \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial\", and \"Don Juan in Hell\", in which he also starred.\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nLaughton was born on 1 July 1899 in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Robert Laughton (1869\u20131924) and Eliza (n\u00e9e Conlon; 1869\u20131953), Yorkshire hotel keepers. A blue plaque marks his birthplace. His mother was a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent, and she sent him to briefly attend a local boys' school, Scarborough College, before sending him to Stonyhurst College, the pre-eminent English Jesuit school. Laughton served in World War I, during which he was gassed, serving first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Battalion, and then with the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.\nHe started work in the family hotel, though also participating in amateur theatrical productions in Scarborough. He was permitted by his family to become a drama student at RADA in 1925, where actor Claude Rains was one of his teachers. Laughton made his first professional appearance on 28 April 1926 at the Barnes Theatre, as Osip in the comedy \"The Government Inspector\", in which he also appeared at London's Gaiety Theatre in May. He impressed audiences with his talent and had classical roles in two Chekov plays, \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"The Three Sisters\". Laughton played the lead role as Harry Hegan in the world premiere of Se\u00e1n O'Casey's \"The Silver Tassie\" in 1928 in London. He played the title roles in Arnold Bennett's \"Mr Prohack\" (Elsa Lanchester was also in the cast) and as Samuel Pickwick in \"Mr. Pickwick\" at the Theatre Royal (1928\u201329) in London.\nHe played Tony Perelli in Edgar Wallace's \"On the Spot\" and William Marble in \"Payment Deferred\". He took the last role across the Atlantic and made his United States debut on 24 September 1931, at the Lyceum Theatre. He returned to London for the 1933\u201334 Old Vic season and was engaged in four Shakespeare roles (as Macbeth, Henry VIII, Angelo in \"Measure for Measure\" and Prospero in \"The Tempest\") and also as Lopakhin in \"The Cherry Orchard\", Canon Chasuble in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", and Tattle in \"Love for Love\". In 1936, he went to Paris and on 9 May appeared at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as Sganarelle in the second act of Moli\u00e8re's \"Le M\u00e9decin malgr\u00e9 lui\", the first English actor to appear at that theatre, where he performed the role in French and received an ovation.\nLaughton commenced his film career in Great Britain while still acting on the London stage. He also accepted small roles in three short silent comedies starring his wife Elsa Lanchester, \"Daydreams,\" \"Blue Bottles,\" and \"The Tonic\" (all 1928), which had been specially written for her by H. G. Wells and were directed by Ivor Montagu. He made a brief appearance as a disgruntled diner in another silent film \"Piccadilly\" with Anna May Wong in 1929. He appeared with Lanchester again in \"Comets\" (1930), a film revue featuring assorted British variety acts, in which they sang a duet, \"The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie\". He made two other early British talkies: \"Wolves\" with Dorothy Gish (1930) from a play set in a whaling camp in the frozen north, and \"Down River\" (1931), in which he played a drug-smuggling ship's captain.\nHis New York stage debut in 1931 immediately led to film offers, and Laughton's first Hollywood film, \"The Old Dark House\" (1932) with Boris Karloff, in which he played a bluff Yorkshire businessman marooned during a storm with other travelers in a creepy remote Welsh manor. He then played a demented submarine commander in \"Devil and the Deep\" with Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant, and followed this with his best-remembered film role of that year as Nero in Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Sign of the Cross.\" Laughton gave other memorable performances during that first Hollywood trip, repeating his stage role as a murderer in \"Payment Deferred\", playing H. G. Wells' mad vivisectionist Dr. Moreau in \"Island of Lost Souls\", and the meek raspberry-blowing clerk in the brief segment of \"If I Had A Million\", directed by Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in six Hollywood films in 1932. His association with director Alexander Korda began in 1933 with the hugely successful \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" (loosely based on the life of King Henry VIII), for which Laughton won the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n1933\u20131943.\nAfter his success in \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\", Laughton soon abandoned the stage for films and returned to Hollywood, where his next film was \"White Woman\" (1933) in which he co-starred with Carole Lombard as a Cockney river trader in the Malayan jungle. Then came \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (1934) as the malevolent father of Norma Shearer's character (although Laughton was only three years older than Shearer); \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (1935) as Inspector Javert; one of his most famous screen roles in \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935) as Captain William Bligh, co-starring with Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian; and \"Ruggles of Red Gap\" (1935) as the very English butler transported to early 1900s America. He signed to play Micawber in \"David Copperfield\" (1934), but after a few days' shooting asked to be released from the role and was replaced by W. C. Fields.\nBack in the UK, and again with Korda, he played the title role in \"Rembrandt\" (1936). In 1937, also for Korda, he starred in an ill-fated film version of the classic novel, \"I, Claudius\", by Robert Graves, which was abandoned during filming owing to the injuries suffered by co-star Merle Oberon in a car crash. After \"I, Claudius\", he and the expatriate German film producer Erich Pommer founded the production company Mayflower Pictures in the UK, which produced three films starring Laughton: \"Vessel of Wrath\" (US title \"The Beachcomber\") (1938), based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham, in which his wife, Elsa Lanchester, co-starred; \"St. Martin's Lane\" (US title \"Sidewalks of London\"), about London street entertainers, which featured Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison; and \"Jamaica Inn\", with Maureen O'Hara and Robert Newton, about Cornish shipwreckers, based on Daphne du Maurier's novel (and the last film Alfred Hitchcock directed in Britain), before moving to Hollywood in the late 1930s.\nThe films produced were not commercially successful enough, and the company was rescued from bankruptcy only when RKO Pictures offered Laughton the title role (Quasimodo) in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939), with \"Jamaica Inn\" co-star O'Hara. Laughton and Pommer had plans to make further films, but the outbreak of World War II, which implied the loss of many foreign markets, meant the end of the company. Laughton's early success in \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" established him as one of the leading interpreters of the costume and historical drama roles for which he is best remembered (Nero, Henry VIII, Mr. Barrett, Inspector Javert, Captain Bligh, Rembrandt, Quasimodo, and others); he was also type-cast as arrogant, unscrupulous characters.\nHe largely moved away from historical roles when he played an Italian vineyard owner in California in \"They Knew What They Wanted\" (1940); a South Seas patriarch in \"The Tuttles of Tahiti\" (1942); and a US admiral during World War II in \"Stand By for Action\" (1942). He played a Victorian butler in \"Forever and a Day\" (1943) and an Australian bar-owner in \"The Man from Down Under\" (1943). Simon Callow's 1987 biography quotes a number of contemporary reviews of Laughton's performances in these films. James Agate, reviewing \"Forever and a Day\", wrote: \"Is there no-one at RKO to tell Charles Laughton when he is being plain bad?\" On the other hand, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" declared that \"Forever and a Day\" boasted \"superb performances\".\nC. A. Lejeune, wrote Callow, was \"shocked\" by the poor quality of Laughton's work of that period: \"One of the most painful screen phenomena of latter years\", she wrote in \"The Observer\", \"has been the decline and fall of Charles Laughton.\" On the other hand, David Shipman, in his book \"The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years\", said \"Laughton was a total actor. His range was wide\".\n1943\u20131962.\nLaughton played a cowardly schoolmaster in occupied France in \"This Land Is Mine\" (1943), by Jean Renoir, in which he engaged himself most actively; in fact, while Renoir was still working on an early script, Laughton would talk about Alphonse Daudet's story \"The Last Lesson\", which suggested to Renoir a relevant scene for the film. Laughton played a henpecked husband who eventually murders his wife in \"The Suspect\" (1944), directed by Robert Siodmak, who would become a good friend. He played sympathetically an impoverished composer-pianist in \"Tales of Manhattan\" (1942) and starred in \"The Canterville Ghost\", based on the Oscar Wilde story in 1944.\nLaughton appeared in two comedies with Deanna Durbin, \"It Started with Eve\" (1941) and \"Because of Him\" (1946). He portrayed a bloodthirsty pirate in \"Captain Kidd\" (1945) and a malevolent judge in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Paradine Case\" (1947). Laughton played a megalomaniac press tycoon in \"The Big Clock\" (1948). He had supporting roles as a Nazi in pre-war Paris in \"Arch of Triumph\" (1948), as a bishop in \"The Girl from Manhattan\" (1948), as a seedy go-between in \"The Bribe\" (1949), and as a kindly widower in \"The Blue Veil\" (1951). He played a Bible-reading pastor in the multi-story \"A Miracle Can Happen\" (1947), but his piece wound up being cut and replaced with another featuring Dorothy Lamour, and in this form the film was retitled as \"On Our Merry Way\". However, an original print of \"A Miracle Can Happen\" was sent abroad for dubbing before the Laughton sequence was deleted, and in this form it was shown in Spain as \"Una Encuesta Llamada Milagro\".\nLaughton made his first colour film in Paris as Inspector Maigret in \"The Man on the Eiffel Tower\" (1949) and, wrote the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\", \"appeared to overact\" alongside Boris Karloff as a mad French nobleman in a version of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"The Strange Door\" in 1951. He played a tramp in \"O. Henry's Full House\" (1952). He became the pirate Captain Kidd again, this time for comic effect, in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd\" (1952). Laughton made a guest appearance on the \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" (featuring Abbott and Costello), in which he delivered the Gettysburg Address. In 1953 he played Herod Antipas in \"Salome\", and he reprised his role as Henry VIII in \"Young Bess\", a 1953 drama about Henry's children.\nHe returned to Britain to star in \"Hobson's Choice\" (1954), directed by David Lean. Laughton received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role in \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957). He played a British admiral in \"Under Ten Flags\" (1960) and worked with Laurence Olivier in \"Spartacus\" (1960). His final film was \"Advise &amp; Consent\" (1962), for which he received favourable comments for his performance as a Southern US Senator (for which accent he studied recordings of Mississippi Senator John C. Stennis).\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" and other projects.\nIn 1955, Laughton directed \"The Night of the Hunter\", starring Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish, and produced by his friend Paul Gregory. The film has been cited among critics as one of the best of the 1950s, and has been selected by the United States National Film Registry for preservation in the Library of Congress. At the time of its original release it was a critical and box-office failure, and Laughton never directed again. The documentary \"Charles Laughton Directs The Night of the Hunter\" by Robert Gitt (2002) features preserved rushes and outtakes with Laughton's audible off-camera direction.\nLaughton had intended to follow up \"The Night of the Hunter\" with an adaptation of Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead\". Terry and Dennis Sanders were hired as writers, and press releases announced that Robert Mitchum was to star and that Walter Schumann would compose the score. Following the box-office failure of \"The Night of the Hunter\", Laughton was replaced by Raoul Walsh as director on the film and recruited an uncredited writer to rewrite the Sanders brothers' screenplay.\nLaughton also developed a remake of the 1927 silent film \"White Gold\".\nTheatre.\nLaughton made his London stage debut in Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" (1926). He appeared in many West End plays in the following few years and his earliest successes on the stage were as Hercule Poirot in \"Alibi\" (1928); he was the first actor to portray the Belgian detective in this stage adaptation of \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\", and as William Marble in \"Payment Deferred\", making his Lyceum Theatre (New York) debut in 1931.\nIn 1926, he played the role of the criminal Ficsur in the original London production of Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's \"Liliom\" (The play became a musical in 1945 by Rodgers and Hammerstein as \"Carousel\", where Ficsur became Jigger Craigin, but Laughton never appeared in the musical version). While Laughton is most remembered for his film career, he continued to work in the theatre, as when, after the success of \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" he appeared at the Old Vic Theatre in 1933 as Macbeth, Lopakin in \"The Cherry Orchard\", Prospero in \"The Tempest\" and Angelo in \"Measure for Measure\". In the US, Laughton worked with Bertolt Brecht on a new English version of Brecht's play \"Galileo\". Laughton played the title role at the play's premiere in Los Angeles on 30 July 1947 and later that year in New York. This staging was directed by Joseph Losey. The processes by which Laughton painstakingly, over many weeks, created his Galileo\u2014and incidentally, edited and translated the play along with Brecht\u2014are detailed in an essay by Brecht, \"Building Up A Part: Laughton's Galileo.\"\nLaughton had one of his most notable successes in the theatre by directing and playing the Devil in \"Don Juan in Hell\" beginning in 1950. The piece is actually the third act sequence from George Bernard Shaw's play \"Man and Superman\", frequently cut from productions to reduce its playing time, consisting of a philosophical debate between Don Juan and the Devil with contributions from Do\u00f1a Ana and the statue of Ana's father. Laughton conceived the piece as a staged reading and cast Charles Boyer, Cedric Hardwicke and Agnes Moorehead (billed as \"The First Drama Quartette\") in the other roles. Boyer won a special Tony Award for his performance.\nHe directed several plays on Broadway, mostly under the production of his friend and Broadway producer Paul Gregory. His most notable box-office success as a director came in 1954, with \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial\", a full-length stage dramatisation by Herman Wouk of the court-martial scene in Wouk's novel \"The Caine Mutiny\". The play, starring Henry Fonda as defence attorney Barney Greenwald, opened the same year as the film starring Humphrey Bogart as Captain Queeg and Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as Greenwald based on the original novel, but did not affect that film's box-office performance. Laughton also directed a staged reading in 1953 of Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t's \"John Brown's Body\", a full-length poem about the American Civil War and its aftermath. The production starred Tyrone Power, Raymond Massey (re-creating his film characterisations of Abraham Lincoln and John Brown), and Judith Anderson. Laughton did not appear himself in either production, but \"John Brown's Body\" was recorded complete by Columbia Masterworks. He directed and starred in George Bernard Shaw's, \"Major Barbara\" which ran on Broadway from approximately 1 November 1956, to 18 May 1957. Others in the cast were Glynis Johns, Burgess Meredith, Cornelia Otis Skinner, and Eli Wallach.\nLaughton returned to the London stage in May 1958 to direct and star in Jane Arden's \"The Party\" at the New Theatre which also had Elsa Lanchester and Albert Finney in the cast. He made his final appearances on stage as Nick Bottom in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and as King Lear at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1959, although failing health resulted in both performances being disappointing, according to some British critics. His performance as King Lear was lambasted by critics, and Kenneth Tynan wrote that Laughton's Nick Bottom \"... behaves in a manner that has nothing to do with acting, although it perfectly hits off the demeanor of a rapscallion uncle dressed up to entertain the children at a Christmas party\". Although he did not appear in any later plays, Laughton toured the US with staged readings, including a successful appearance on the Stanford University campus in 1960.\nRecordings.\nLaughton's voice, equally capable of a penetrating, theatre-filling shout and a soft, velvety tone, first appeared on 78-rpm records with the release of five British Regal Zonophone 10-inch discs entitled \"Voice of the Stars\" issued annually from 1934 to 1938. These featured short soundtrack snippets from the year's top films. He is heard on all five records in, respectively, \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\", \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"I, Claudius\" (curiously, since this film was unfinished and thus never released), and \"Vessel of Wrath\". In 1937 he recorded Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on a 10-inch Columbia 78, having made a strong impression with it in \"Ruggles of Red Gap\".\nHe made several other spoken-word recordings, one of his most famous being his one-man album of Charles Dickens's \"Mr. Pickwick's Christmas\", a twenty-minute version of the Christmas chapter from Dickens's \"The Pickwick Papers\". It was first released by American Decca in 1944 as a four-record 78-rpm set, but was afterward transferred to LP. It frequently appeared on LP with a companion piece, Decca's 1941 adaptation of Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\", starring Ronald Colman as Scrooge. Both stories were released together on a Deutsche Grammophon CD for Christmas 2005.\nIn 1943, Laughton recorded a reading of the Nativity story from St. Luke's Gospel, and this was released in 1995 on CD on a Nimbus Records collection entitled \"Prima Voce: The Spirit of Christmas Past\". A Brunswick/American Decca LP entitled \"Readings from the Bible\" featured Laughton reading Garden of Eden, The Fiery Furnace, Noah's Ark, and David and Goliath. It was released in 1958. Laughton had previously included several Bible readings when he played the title role in the film \"Rembrandt\". Laughton also narrated the story on the soundtrack album of the film that he directed, \"Night of the Hunter\", accompanied by the film's score. This album has also been released on CD. Also, and derived from the film they made together, a complete radio show (18 June 1945) of \"The Canterville Ghost\" was broadcast which featured Laughton and Margaret O'Brien. It has been issued on a Pelican LP. \nA two-LP Capitol Records album was released in 1962, the year of Laughton's death, entitled \"The Story Teller: A Session with Charles Laughton\". Taken from Laughton's one-man stage shows, it compiles dramatic readings from several sources. Three of the excerpts are broadcast annually on a Minnesota Public Radio Thanksgiving program entitled \"Giving Thanks\". \"The Story Teller\" won a Grammy in 1962 for Best Spoken Word Recording. Although the album has yet to be released on compact disc, it can now be heard in its entirety online.\nTelevision.\nLaughton was the fill-in host on 9 September 1956, when Elvis Presley made his first of three appearances on CBS's \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", which garnered 60.7\u00a0million viewers (Ed Sullivan was recuperating from a car accident). That same year, Laughton hosted the first of two programmes devoted to classical music entitled \"Festival of Music\", and telecast on the NBC television anthology series \"Producers' Showcase\". One of his last performances was on \"Checkmate\", in which he played a missionary recently returned from China. He threw himself into the role, travelling to China for several months to better understand his character.\nPersonal life and death.\nMarriage.\nIn 1927, Laughton began a relationship with Elsa Lanchester, at the time a castmate in a stage play. The two were married in 1929, became US citizens in 1950, and remained together until Laughton's death. Over the years, they appeared together in several films, including \"Rembrandt\" (1936), \"Tales of Manhattan\" (1942), \"The Vessel of Wrath\" (1938), and \"The Big Clock\" (1948). Lanchester portrayed Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII's fourth wife, opposite Laughton in \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\". They both received Academy Award nominations for their performances in \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957)\u2014Laughton for Best Actor, and Lanchester for Best Supporting Actress\u2014but neither won.\nSexuality.\nLaughton's bisexuality was corroborated by several of his contemporaries and is generally accepted by Hollywood historians. Hollywood procurer and prostitute Scotty Bowers alleged in his memoir \"Full Service\" that Laughton was in love with Tyrone Power and that his sex life was exclusively homosexual. Actress Maureen O'Hara, a friend and co-star of Laughton, disputed the contention that his sexuality was the reason Laughton and Lanchester did not have children, saying Laughton told her he had wanted children but that it had not been possible because of a botched abortion that Lanchester had early in her career of performing burlesque. In her autobiography, Lanchester acknowledged two abortions in her youth\u2014one of the pregnancies purportedly by Laughton\u2014but did not mention infertility. According to her biographer, Charles Higham, the reason she did not have children was that she did not want any.\nInterests.\nLaughton owned an estate on the bluffs above Pacific Coast Highway at 14954 Corona Del Mar in Pacific Palisades. The property suffered a landslide in 1944, referenced by Bertolt Brecht in his poem \"Garden in Progress\". Laughton was a Democrat and supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.\nDeath and influence.\nLaughton checked in to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in July 1962 with what was described as a ruptured disc. He had surgery for the collapse of a vertebra and it was found that the vertebra had fractured due to a spinal metastasis. He left the hospital at the end of November. He was in a coma for some time and died at home on 15 December 1962 from renal cancer and bladder cancer. His ashes were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).\nEnglish actor Daniel Day-Lewis cited Laughton as one of his inspirations, saying: \"He was probably the greatest film actor who came from that period of time. He had something quite remarkable. His generosity as an actor; he fed himself into that work. As an actor, you cannot take your eyes off him.\"\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Berninghaus", "text": "American painter\nOscar Edmund Berninghaus (October 2, 1874 \u2013 April 27, 1952) was an American artist and a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He is best known for his paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico and the American Southwest. His son, Charles Berninghaus (1905\u20131988), was also a Taos artist.\nEarly life and education.\nBerninghaus was born on October 2, 1874, in St. Louis, Missouri. His father ran a lithography business, which stimulated an interest in watercolor painting in Oscar. The young artist regularly sketched local scenes around St. Louis, including the St. Louis riverfront. He developed an interest in business and sold his works to tourists and newspapers. At sixteen, he had quit school and taken a job with Compton &amp; Sons, a local lithography company, where he started as an errand boy, but soon learned the technical details of engraving, color separation and printmaking. In 1893, he left Compton &amp; Sons and joined Woodward and Tiernan, one of the largest printing concerns in the world at the time.\nIn search of something more than the practical experience he was receiving at the lithography companies, Berninghaus attended night classes at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis and sketched and painted in his spare time.\nSt. Louis artistic career.\nBy 1899, Berninghaus held his first one-man show, developed a reputation as an artist, and worked teaching illustration at the School of Fine Arts. He was offered a commission by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad to produce promotional sketches of the Colorado and New Mexico landscapes and soon traveled West. After spending a day in Denver, he traveled south to Antonito, Colorado, on a standard gauge railroad before transition to a narrow gauge track for the remainder of his trip into New Mexico. All the while, Berninghaus sketched, and was eventually invited by the conductor to ride on the top of the train car.\nWhen he passed nearby Taos, New Mexico, he disembarked the train and travelled overland. During his 8-day stay, he met and befriended Bert Phillips, who had established himself as a painter in Taos the previous year. Although he soon returned to St. Louis, and was married to Emelia Miller in 1900, Berninghaus was captivated by the local Indian culture and the landscape and light of New Mexico. For the next few years, the painter lived in St. Louis during the winters, where he pursued his commercial illustration work, and returned to Taos in the summers to pursue his fine art painting.\nIn 1903 Berninghaus had two designs selected for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair medal competition. In 1905 Berninghaus and his wife, Emelia, had their second son, Julius Charles Berninghaus, who would go on to become a well known New Mexican landscape painter in his own right. By 1908 the painter had firmly established himself as one of St. Louis' foremost artists, having won a competition at the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", become a member of the St. Louis Artists' Guild, the Society of Western Artists, and the Salmagundi Club, and held a one-man exhibition of fifty Western paintings at the Noonan-Kocian Gallery.\nIn 1914, a year after his wife died of diabetes, the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company release a promotional booklet titled \"Epoch Marking Events of American History\" that was composed of billboard illustrations that Berninghaus had previously completed for the company. The book included 10 paintings by the artist featuring historical events important to the American West, including Hernando de Soto's founding the Mississippi River, Jacques Marquette's descending the same river, Pierre Lacl\u00e8de's founding of St. Louis, a scene from the Lewis and Clark Expedition, John C. Fr\u00e9mont, a pioneer wagon train on the Salt Lake Trail, and a Union Pacific train. Berninghaus painted a number of paintings for the Busch family throughout his lifetime, many of which were donated to the St. Louis Art Museum.\nTaos Society of Artists.\nIn 1915, he became a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists, along with his friend Bert Phillips and four other artists. He was the first (temporary) chairman of the Society. He also spent more time as secretary of the Society than any other member. In 1917, Berninghaus received his first formal accolade for his Taos Indian-based fine art; the prestigious and much coveted St. Louis Artists' Guild Brown Prize for his painting \"The Sage Brush Trail\". This painting went on to be exhibited at The Annual Exhibition, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1917), National Academy of Design, Winter Exhibition (1917), Art World Winter Show, Academy of Design (1918), and numerous other national exhibitions. Arguably his first painting to receive national recognition and acclaim, this painting is referenced in many publications including \"American Art Annual\", volume 14, 1017, \"El Palacio\", Volume VIII (1920), \"Painters, Pictures and The People\", Neuhaus (1918), \"Art World\" Ruckstull (1917), \"American Art Directory, American Federation of Arts\" (1918), \"Master Painter of American Indians and The Frontier West\", Sanders. He continued to reside in St. Louis until 1925, when he finally made the move to Taos.\nBerninghaus was committed to the artist colony of Taos, maintained the Society's business affairs, and insisted that Taos would be the single location from which a distinctly American Art would originate; \"We have had French, Dutch, Italian and German art. Now we have American art. I feel that from Taos will come that art.\"\nIn 1936, Berninghaus was commissioned to paint \"Commerce on the Levee\", a rendition of early commercial life in St. Louis.

He was proclaimed \"Augustus\" as an infant and ruled as the Eastern Empire's sole emperor after the death of his father Arcadius in 408. His reign was marked by the promulgation of the Theodosian law code and the construction of the Theodosian walls of Constantinople. He also presided over the outbreak of two great Christological controversies, Nestorianism and Eutychianism.\nEarly life.\nTheodosius was born on 10 April 401 as the only son of Emperor Arcadius and his wife Aelia Eudoxia. On 10 January 402, at the age of 9 months, he was proclaimed co-\"augustus\" by his father, thus becoming the youngest to bear the imperial title up to that point. On 1 May 408, his father died and the seven-year-old boy became the sole emperor of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire.\nReign.\nEarly reign.\nThe government was at first administered by the praetorian prefect Anthemius, under whose supervision the Theodosian walls of Constantinople were constructed.\nAccording to the sixth-century historian Procopius and eight-century chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the Sasanian king Yazdegerd I (399\u2013420) was appointed by Arcadius as the guardian of Theodosius, whom Yazdegerd treated as his own child, sending a tutor to raise him and warning that enmity toward him would be taken as enmity toward Persia. Though this story is assumed to be inconclusive, Antiochus, a eunuch of Persian origin, became a tutor and an influence on Theodosius. He also became \"praepositus sacri cubiculi\" later but Theodosius dismissed him when he reached his adulthood.\nIn 414, Theodosius's older sister Pulcheria vowed perpetual virginity along with her sisters. She was proclaimed \"augusta\", and acted as a guardian of her brother. The guardianship ended when he reached his majority, but it is assumed that his sister continued to exert some influence during his reign. In June 421, Theodosius married Aelia Eudocia, a woman of Athenian origin. The two had a daughter named Licinia Eudoxia, another named Flaccilla, and possibly a son called Arcadius.\nIn 423, the Western Emperor Honorius, Theodosius's uncle, died and the \"primicerius notariorum\" Joannes was proclaimed emperor. Honorius's sister Galla Placidia and her young son Valentinian, who had earlier fled to Constantinople to escape Honorius's hostility, sought Eastern assistance to claim the throne for Valentinian, and after some deliberation in 424 Theodosius opened the war against Joannes. On 23 October 425, Valentinian III was installed as emperor of the West with the assistance of the \"magister officiorum\" Helion, with his mother taking an influential role. To strengthen the ties between the two parts of the empire, Theodosius's daughter Licinia Eudoxia was betrothed to Valentinian. She married Valentinian III later on 29 October 437, and became empress of the western portion of the empire.\nUniversity and Law Code.\nIn 425, Theodosius founded the University of Constantinople with 31 chairs (15 in Latin and 16 in Greek). Among the subjects were law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music and rhetoric. It is likely that his wife Eudocia encouraged him in this matter and was behind the establishment of the university; she had been born in Athens, where the Neoplatonic School of Athens was the last great center for pagan, classical learning. Eudocia was known for her great intellect.\nIn 429, Theodosius appointed a commission to collect all of the laws since the reign of Constantine I, and create a fully formalized system of law. This plan was left unfinished, but the work of a second commission that met in Constantinople, assigned to collect all of the general legislations and bring them up to date, was completed; their collection was published as the \"Codex Theodosianus\" in 438. The law code of Theodosius II, summarizing edicts promulgated since Constantine, formed a basis for the law code of Emperor Justinian I, the , in the following century.\nBanishment of Eudocia.\nEudocia reached the height of her influence with the emperor from 439 to 441, a period in which, according to some sources, the emperor's sister Pulcheria was sidelined in favor of his wife. However, a separation ultimately occurred between the imperial couple between 441 and 444, with Eudocia's establishment in Jerusalem where she favored monastic Monophysitism. The reasons for her banishment are related by two conflicting tales.\nThe sixth-century historian John Malalas explains Eudocia's departure in a legend involving a certain Phrygian apple. Malalas wrote in his \"Chronicle\" that one day, the emperor was on his way to church when a man presented the emperor with an \"apple huge beyond any exaggeration.\" The emperor thanked the man with 150 solidi, and promptly sent the apple to his wife as a present. Eudocia decided to give the apple to Paulinus, a friend of both her and the emperor. Paulinus, unknowing of where Eudocia had gotten the apple, thought it was fit for only the emperor, and gave it to him. Theodosius was suspicious, and asked Eudocia what she had done with the apple. \"I ate it,\" she replied, and then Theodosius asked her to confirm her answer with an oath, which she did. Theodosius then presented her with the enormous apple. The emperor was enraged and suspected an affair between Eudocia and Paulinus; he had his lifelong friend Paulinus executed, and Eudocia asked to be exiled to Jerusalem.\nBut the contemporary historian Priscus and a sixth-century chronicler Marcellinus Comes relate a different story. In this version, Eudocia murdered the \"comes domesticorum\" Saturninus for killing her close associates on Theodosius' orders. In response, the emperor stripped her of her attendants and she went on to settle in Jerusalem.\nWars with the Huns, Vandals, and Persians.\nThe situation between the Romans and the Sassanids deteriorated in 420 due to the Persian persecution of Christians, and the Eastern empire declared war against the Sasanian empire (421\u2013422); the war ended in an indecisive stalemate, when the Romans were forced to accept peace as the Huns menaced Constantinople. Peace was arranged in 422 without changes to the \"status quo\". The later wars of Theodosius were generally less successful.\nThe Eastern Empire was plagued by raids by the Huns. Early in Theodosius II's reign Romans used internal Hun discord to overcome Uldin's invasion of the Balkans. The Romans strengthened their fortifications and in 424 agreed to pay 350 pounds of gold to encourage the Huns to remain at peace with the Romans. In 439 with the rise of Attila and Bleda to unify the Huns, the payment was doubled to 700 pounds.\nTheodosius became engaged with the affairs of the West after installing Valentinian III as his Western counterpart. When Roman Africa fell to the Vandals in 439, Theodosius sent forces to Sicily, intending to launch an attack on the Vandals at Carthage. In 441 seeing the borders without significant forces, the Huns attacked the Balkans, pushing as far as Naissus (Ni\u0161) and Serdica (Sofia) and sacking nearly all the major cities on the middle Danube. This led to the expeditionary force in Sicily being recalled in 442. In 447 Huns defeated the Roman armies in Utus and Chersonese, and went through the Balkans, destroying among others the city of Serdica and reaching Athyra (B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece) on the outskirts of Constantinople. In 443 or 447, Anatolius negotiated a peace agreement; the Huns withdrew in exchange for humiliating concessions, including an annual tribute of 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 687\u00a0kg) of gold and an additional payment of 6,000 pounds. In 449, an Eastern Roman attempt to assassinate Attila failed, however the relations between the two did not deteriorate further.\nTheological disputes.\nTheodosius frequently attempted to resolve doctrinal controversies regarding the nature of Christ. During a visit to Syria, Theodosius met the monk Nestorius, a renowned preacher. Nestorius was appointed as archbishop of Constantinople in 428 and became involved in a Christological dispute between two groups. One group called the Virgin Mary \"Theotokos\" (\"birth-giver of God\"), based on God being born a man in Christ, and the other rejected the title, based on God being eternal and thus could not be born. Nestorius' compromise, the title \"Christotokos\" (\"birth-giver of Christ\"), was rejected; he was accused of separating Christ's divine and human natures, resulting in \"two Christs\", in a doctrine later called Nestorianism. Though initially enjoying Theodosius' favor, Nestorius was strongly opposed by Archbishop Cyril of Alexandria and eventually lost Theodosius's support. Nestorius had also alienated the emperor's sister, Pulcheria. At Nestorius's request, the emperor convened the First Council of Ephesus in 431 to allow Nestorius to contest Cyril's accusations of heresy. The council was divided between the Cyrillians and the Nestorians, with Theodosius ultimately favoring the Cyrillians. The council affirmed the title \"Theotokos\" and condemned Nestorius, who returned to his monastery in Syria and was eventually exiled to a remote monastery in Egypt.\nConstantinopolitan abbot Eutyches reignited the theological dispute almost twenty years later by asserting the miaphysite view that Christ's divine and human nature were one. Eutyches was condemned by Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople for refusing to confess two natures after the union, but supported by the powerful Dioscurus of Alexandria, Cyril's successor. The Second Council of Ephesus in 449 restored Eutyches and deposed Flavian. The Chalcedonians opposed the decision, with Pope Leo I calling the council the \"robber synod\". Theodosius supported the outcome, but it was reversed by the Council of Chalcedon which was held a year after his death in 450.\nDeath.\nTheodosius died on 28 July 450 as the result of falling off his horse. On 25 November, his sister Pulcheria married Marcian, a domesticus under the influential general Aspar, and he became emperor. The eunuch Chrysaphius was executed or murdered shortly after by the new imperial couple.\nLike Constantine I and several of his successors, he was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII in the .\nAssessments and legacy.\nTheodosius is often seen by both ancient and modern historians as being constantly pushed around by his sister, wife, and eunuchs, particularly Chrysaphius among them. In the later decades of his life, Chrysaphius rose to prominence as one of the emperor's favorites. He favored the pro-Monophysite policy, influenced the foreign policy towards the Huns, and was resented by Pulcheria, general Zeno, and pro-Chalcedonian writers. According to Theodorus Lector, Theodosius was so unmindful of his surroundings that he accidentally signed his sister's note selling his wife, Eudocia, into slavery.\nHowever, these views of Theodosius have been challenged in modern scholarship. Some historians argue that contrary to hostile ancient sources, Theodosius was more in control of his government. Others view that the government was controlled mostly by the high ranking civilian officials of the \"consistorium\", and not by Pulcheria or Eudocia. Historian Christopher Kelly notes that the modern dismissal of Theodosius has origins in the Enlightenment disapproval, and argues that \"the reign of Theodosius II should not be too quickly dismissed, simplified or partitioned.\"\nAmong ancient and medieval writers, Monophysites had a favorable opinion of Theodosius. Theodosius was also a very learned emperor, with a great aptitude for maths, history, astronomy and writing, hence his nickname \"the Calligrapher\" by some later historians. Theodosius has been described by Kenneth Holum as \"a man of intelligence and sincerity but little backbone.\"\nSaint Right-Believing Theodosius II the Younger is commemorated in Eastern Orthodox Church on 29 July. He is also venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Church for his support during the post-Chalcedonian controversy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the first woman to win a Hugo Award for fiction (Best Novella, \"Weyr Search\", 1968) and the first to win a Nebula Award (Best Novella, \"Dragonrider\", 1969). Her 1978 novel \"The White Dragon\" became one of the first science-fiction books to appear on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nIn 2005 the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named McCaffrey its 22nd Grand Master, an annual award to living writers of fantasy and science fiction. She was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame on 17 June 2006. She also received the Robert A. Heinlein Award for her work in 2007.\nLife and career.\nAnne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the second of three children of Anne Dorothy (n\u00e9e McElroy) and Col. George Herbert McCaffrey. She had two brothers: Hugh (\"Mac\", died 1988) and Kevin Richard McCaffrey (\"Kevie\"). Her father had Irish and English ancestry, and her mother was of Irish descent. She attended Stuart Hall (a girls' boarding school in Staunton, Virginia), and graduated from Montclair High School in Montclair, New Jersey. From 1944 to 1947 she attended Radcliffe College, where her tutors included Samuel H. Cross, graduating cum laude with a degree in Slavonic languages and Literature.\nIn 1950 she married Horace Wright Johnson (died 2009), who shared her interests in music, opera and ballet. They had three children: Alec Anthony, born 1952; Todd, born 1956; and Georgeanne (\"Gigi\", Georgeanne Kennedy), born 1959.\nExcept for a short time in D\u00fcsseldorf, the family lived for most of a decade in Wilmington, Delaware. They moved to Sea Cliff, Long Island in 1965, and McCaffrey became a full-time writer.\nMcCaffrey served a term as secretary-treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1968 to 1970. In addition to handcrafting the Nebula Award trophies, her responsibilities included production of two monthly newsletters and their distribution by mail to the membership.\nMcCaffrey immigrated to Ireland with her two younger children in 1970, weeks after filing for divorce. Ireland had recently exempted resident artists from income taxes, an opportunity that fellow science-fiction author Harry Harrison had promptly taken and helped to promote. McCaffrey's mother soon joined the family in Dublin. The following spring, McCaffrey was guest of honour at her first British science-fiction convention (Eastercon 22, 1971). There she met British reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, who would be a consultant on the science of Pern.\nWriter.\nMcCaffrey had had two short stories published during the 1950s. The first (\"Freedom of the Race\", about women impregnated by aliens) was written in 1952 when she was pregnant with her son Alec. It earned a $100 prize in \"Science-Fiction Plus\". Her second story, \"The Lady in the Tower\", was published in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" by editor Robert P. Mills and published again by editor Judith Merril for \"The Year's Greatest Science Fiction\". McCaffrey said \"she thought of the story when wishing herself alone, like a lady in an ivory tower\".\nJudith Merril matched McCaffrey with her long-time literary agent Virginia Kidd and invited her to the Milford Writer's Workshop (to which she returned many times), where participants each brought a story to be critiqued. After her first Milford workshop in 1959 she worked on \"The Ship Who Sang\", the story which began the Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series. At the story's end, the spaceship Helva sings \"Taps\" for her human partner. Decades later, McCaffrey's son Todd called it \"almost an elegy to her father\". In interviews between 1994 and 2004, she considered it her best story and her favourite. \"I put much of myself into it: myself and the troubles I had in accepting my father's death [1954] and a troubled marriage.\"\nMcCaffrey then wrote two more \"Ship\" stories and began her first novel. Regarding her motivation for \"Restoree\" (1967), her son recalled her saying, \"I was so \"tired\" of all the weak women screaming in the corner while their boyfriends were beating off the aliens. I wouldn't have been\u2014I'd've been in there swinging with something or kicking them as hard as I could\". McCaffrey explained that it did not require a sequel; it \"served its purpose of an intelligent, survivor-type woman as the protagonist of an s-f story\".\nRegarding her 1969 \"Decision at Doona\" (which she dedicated \"To Todd Johnson\u2014of course!\"), her son recalled that he was directed to lower his voice in his fourth-grade school play when his mother was in the auditorium. That inspired the Doona story, which opens on \"an overcrowded planet where just talking too loud made you a social outcast\". As a settler on Doona, the boy talker has a priceless talent.\nMcCaffrey made a fast start in Ireland, completing for 1971 publication \"Dragonquest\" and two Gothic novels for Dell, \"The Mark of Merlin\" and \"The Ring of Fear\". With a contract for \"The White Dragon\" (which would complete the \"original trilogy\" with Ballantine), her writing stalled. During the next few years the family moved several times in the Dublin area and struggled to make ends meet, supported largely by child-care payments and meager royalties.\nThe young-adult book market provided a crucial opportunity. Editor Roger Elwood sought short contributions for anthologies, and McCaffrey started the Pern story of Menolly. She delivered \"The Smallest Dragonboy\" for $154, and four stories which later became \"The Crystal Singer\". Futura Publications in London signed her to write books about dinosaurs for children. Editor Jean E. Karl at Atheneum Books sought to attract more female readers to science fiction and solicited \"a story for young women in a different part of Pern\". McCaffrey completed Menolly's story as \"Dragonsong\" and contracted for a sequel before its publication in 1976.\nThe tales of Menolly are continued in \"Dragonsinger: Harper of Pern\", and \"Dragondrums\" as the \"Harper Hall Trilogy\". With a contract with Atheneum she was able to buy a home (named \"Dragonhold\" for the dragons who bought it). Her son wrote, 20 years later, that she \"first set dragons free on Pern and then was herself freed by her dragons.\"\nDragons.\nThe first Pern story, \"Weyr Search\", was published in 1967 by John W. Campbell in \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\". It won the 1968 Hugo Award for best novella, voted by participants in the annual World Science Fiction Convention. The second Pern story, \"Dragonrider\", won the 1969 Nebula Award for best novella, voted annually by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Thus she was the first woman to win a Hugo for fiction and the first to win a Nebula.\n\"Weyr Search\" covers the recruitment of a young woman, Lessa, to establish a telepathic bond with a queen dragon at its hatching, thus becoming a dragonrider and the leader of a Weyr community. \"Dragonrider\" explores the growth of the queen dragon Ramoth, and the training of Lessa and Ramoth. Editor Campbell requested \"to see dragons fighting thread [the menace from space]\", and also suggested time travel; McCaffrey incorporated both suggestions. The third story, \"Crack Dust, Black Dust\", was not separately published, but the first Pern novel (\"Dragonflight\", published by Ballantine Books in 1968) was a fix-up of all three.\nAgent Virginia Kidd and editor Betty Ballantine provided advice and assistance for its sequel \"Dragonquest\". It was almost complete (and the contract for another sequel signed) before the 1970 move to Ireland. Both Ballantine and fellow writer Andre Norton made suggestions for the mutant white dragon.\nReaders waited a long time for the completion of the original trilogy. Progress was not made until 1974\u20131975, when the New England Science Fiction Association invited McCaffrey to its annual convention (Boskone) as guest of honour (which included publication of a novella for sale on-site). She wrote \"A Time When\", which would become the first part of \"The White Dragon\".\n\"The White Dragon\" was released with new editions of the first two Pern books, with cover art illustrated by Michael Whelan. It was the first science-fiction book by a woman on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list, and the cover painting is still in print from Whelan. The artists share credit for their career breakthroughs.\nCollaborations.\nMcCaffrey said of her collaborations with son Todd McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, \"While I would dearly love to have the energy to tell a tale all on my own, I really cannot say that I am not ably represented with my collaborations\". In the Pern collaboration with Todd, she was mainly \"making suggestions or being a sounding board\". McCaffrey also gave Todd and his sister Gigi permission to write their own stories set in the Pern universe.\nMcCaffrey collaborated with author Mercedes Lackey to write \"The Ship Who Searched\", the third of seven books in the Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series by McCaffrey and four other authors. She wrote two books in the \"Planet Pirates\" trilogy with Elizabeth Moon\nDeath.\nMcCaffrey died at age 85 on 21 November 2011 at her home in Ireland, following a stroke.\nBooks.\nClassification.\nIn August 1987, \"Locus: The magazine of the science fiction &amp; fantasy field\" ranked two of the eight extant Pern novels among the \"All-Time Best Fantasy Novels\", based on a poll of subscribers; \"Dragonflight\" was 9th and \"The White Dragon\" 23rd. Commenting on the \"Locus\" list, David Pringle called them \"arguably science fiction rather than fantasy proper\" and named McCaffrey a \"leading practitioner\" of the planetary romance subgenre of science fiction.\nMcCaffrey considered most of her work science fiction and enjoyed \"cutting them short when they call me a 'fantasy' writer\". All the Pern books may be considered science fiction, since the dragons were genetically engineered by the Pern colonists. Regarding science, she said \"I don't keep up with developments, but I do find an expert in any field in which I must explain myself and the science involved\". Astronomer Steven Beard often helped with science questions, and McCaffrey acknowledged reproductive biologist Jack Cohen several times.\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame citation of Anne McCaffrey summarises her genre as \"science fiction, though tinged with the tone and instruments of fantasy\", and her reputation as \"a writer of romantic, heightened tales of adventure explicitly designed to appeal\u2014and to make good sense to\u2014a predominantly female adolescent audience.\"\nMcCaffrey said in 2000, \"There are no demographics on my books which indicate the readers are predominantly of an age or sex group. Dragons have a universal appeal!\" Formerly, it was another matter:\nI started writing s-f in the late 50s/early 60s, when readership was predominantly male. And their attitudes unreconstructed. [...\u00a0Women] began reading s-f and fantasy\u2014and, by preference, women writers. My stories had themes and heroines they could, and did, relate to. I never had any trouble with editors and publishers. I had trouble getting male readers to believe I was serious, and a good enough writer to interest them.\nIn 1999, the American Library Association gave McCaffrey the 11th Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for teens. The librarians credited her with \"over 50 novels for young adults and adults\" and cited seven published from 1968 to 1979 for the \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\" that the award features: \"The Ship Who Sang\" (1969) and the first six Pern books (those sometimes called the \"original trilogy\" and the \"Harper Hall trilogy\"). The panel chair observed that \"McCaffrey's focus on the personal and emotional need of human beings mirrors the quest of today's teens to find their own place in society.\"\n\"Restoree\".\nMcCaffrey's first novel was \"Restoree\", published by Ballantine Books in 1967. Unlike most science fiction books of the era, \"Restoree\"'s heroine is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who is willing and able to think for herself and act on her own initiative. McCaffrey was widely quoted as saying that \"Restoree\" was intended as a \"jab\" at how women were usually portrayed in science fiction.\nFederated Sentient Planets universe.\nSeveral of McCaffrey's series (and more than half her books) are set in a universe governed by the \"Federated Sentient Planets\" (\"Federation\" or \"FSP\"). Although Pern's history is connected to the Federation, McCaffrey only used it as a backdrop for storytelling and did not consider her different \"worlds\" to be part of the same universe.\nDragonriders of Pern series.\nMcCaffrey's best-known works are the \"Dragonriders of Pern\" series. When colonists from Earth and other planets make a decades-long space journey to Pern (an acronym designating \"Parallels Earth, Resources Negligible\" stamped on the original exploration team report) to escape interstellar wars, their fledgling society is threatened by \"Thread\", a mindless organism that falls like a \"hungry rain\" to consume all organic material. The survivors of the original expedition create genetically engineered \"dragons\" from a native species of small fire-breathing, winged reptiles as self-propagating weapons to destroy the encroaching organism in the sky. The majority of the Dragonriders of Pern books take place approximately 2500 years after the planet's colonization, when new challenges face the now low-tech, agrarian society that depends on the telepathically linked dragons and riders for protection from their ancient menace, and their long-forgotten origins are ultimately rediscovered.\nThe Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series.\nThe Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series comprises seven novels, only the first of which (a fix-up of five previously published stories) was written by McCaffrey alone. The stories in this series deal with the adventures of \"shell-people\" or \"Brains\", who as infants (due to illness or birth defects) have had to be hard-wired into a life-support system. With sensory input and motor nerves tied into a computer they serve as starship pilots (or colony administrators), seeing and feeling the colony or ship as an extension of their own body. They perform this job to pay off their debt for education and hardware, and continue as free agents once the debt is paid. To compensate for the Brains' inability to move within human habitats they are paired with partners known as \"Brawns\", who are trained in a wide array of skills (including the protection of their Brain counterparts). It was considered impossible for a person to adjust to being a shell after the age of two or three. An exception, in \"The Ship Who Searched\", was a shell-person who was seven when she became quadriplegic.\nThe Ship books are set in the same universe as the Crystal Singer books; Brainship-Brawn pairings were also characters in the second and third volumes of that series.\nThe Crystal series.\nThe first book (and first of the trilogy), \"The Crystal Singer\" (1982) is a fix-up of four stories published in 1974\u20131975.\nThe Crystal Singer series revolves around the planet Ballybran. Under a permanent biohazard travel restriction due to a potentially-fatal symbiotic organism on the planet's surface, Ballybran is the source of valuable crystals that are vital to a number of industries, and home to one of the FSP's wealthiest (and most reclusive) organisations: the Heptite Guild. The Heptite Guild is known to require absolute, perfect pitch in hearing and voice for all applicants (especially those seeking to mine crystal by song). Because Ballybran's weather is unpredictable and dangerous (Ballybran's windstorms will cause exposed crystal to 'scream' in a discordant, deafening cacophony), the Heptite Guild is prohibited from actively recruiting members.\nThe Coelura series.\n'The Coelura' explores the theme of environmental abuse, as a precious animal is hunted to near extinction for the thread it spins for its net. The Lady Caissa must choose between protecting the Coelura or meeting her obligations to her father and mother.\n'Nimisha's Ship' takes place in the same universe, as a woman in the First Families becomes a ship designer and on a test run her ship is captured by a wormhole. On exploring a nearby planet, she finds and befriends the remaining crew of a stranded ship who suffered the same fate years before, plus a new sapient species.\nIreta.\nThe Ireta series (as catalogued by the Internet Speculative Fiction Database) comprises five novels published 1978 to 1991, the first two by McCaffrey as subseries \"Dinosaur Planet\" and three as \"Planet Pirates\" by McCaffrey and co-writers.\nThey share a fictional premise, and some characters and events overlap. \"Dinosaur Planet\" and its sequel follow the Exploration and Evaluation Corps team on the planet Ireta, which did not expect to find dinosaurs. In \"Planet Pirates\", all is not well in the FSP: pirates attack the spacelanes. Survivors on Ireta join forces with the survivors of space pirate attacks.\nThe Talents universe.\n\"The Talents Universe\" (as catalogued by the Internet Speculative Fiction Database) comprises two series: \"Talent\" and \"The Tower and Hive\" and share a fictional premise.

{"id": "61648", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61648", "title": "Natural abundance", "text": "Relative proportion of an isotope as found in nature\nIn physics, natural abundance (NA) refers to the abundance of isotopes of a chemical element as naturally found on a planet. The relative atomic mass (a weighted average, weighted by mole-fraction abundance figures) of these isotopes is the atomic weight listed for the element in the periodic table. The abundance of an isotope varies from planet to planet, and even from place to place on the Earth, but remains relatively constant in time (on a short-term scale).\nAs an example, uranium has three naturally occurring isotopes: 238U, 235U, and 234U. Their respective natural mole-fraction abundances are 99.2739\u201399.2752%, 0.7198\u20130.7202%, and 0.0050\u20130.0059%. For example, if 100,000 uranium atoms were analyzed, one would expect to find approximately 99,274 238U atoms, approximately 720 235U atoms, and very few (most likely 5 or 6) 234U atoms. This is because 238U is much more stable than 235U or 234U, as the half-life of each isotope reveals: 4.468 billion years for 238U compared with 7.038\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 years for 235U and 245,500 years for 234U.\nExactly because the different uranium isotopes have different half-lives, when the Earth was younger, the isotopic composition of uranium was different. As an example, 1.7 billion years ago the NA of 235U was 3.1% compared with today's 0.7%, and that allowed a natural nuclear fission reactor to form, something that cannot happen today.\nHowever, the natural abundance of a given isotope is also affected by the probability of its creation in nucleosynthesis (as in the case of samarium; radioactive 147Sm and 148Sm are much more abundant than stable 144Sm) and by production of a given isotope as a daughter of natural radioactive isotopes (as in the case of radiogenic isotopes of lead).\nDeviations from natural abundance.\nIt is now known from study of the Sun and primitive meteorites that the Solar System was initially almost homogeneous in isotopic composition. Deviations from the (evolving) galactic average, locally sampled around the time that the Sun's nuclear burning began, can generally be accounted for by mass fractionation (see the article on mass-independent fractionation) plus a limited number of nuclear decay and transmutation processes. There is also evidence for injection of short-lived (now-extinct) isotopes from a nearby supernova explosion that may have triggered solar nebula collapse. Hence deviations from natural abundance on Earth are often measured in parts per thousand (per mille or \u2030) because they are less than one percent (%).\nAn exception to this lies with the presolar grains found in primitive meteorites. These small grains condensed in the outflows of evolved (\"dying\") stars and escaped the mixing and homogenization processes in the interstellar medium and the solar accretion disk (also known as the solar nebula or protoplanetary disk). As stellar condensates (\"stardust\"), these grains carry the isotopic signatures of specific nucleosynthesis processes in which their elements were made. In these materials, deviations from \"natural abundance\" are sometimes measured in factors of 100.\nNatural isotope abundance of some elements.\nThe next table gives the terrestrial isotope distributions for some elements. Some elements, such as phosphorus and fluorine, only exist as a single isotope, with a natural abundance of 100%.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In July 1449, Esen Taishi, leader of the Oirat Mongols, launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China. Despite having capable generals, Emperor Yingzong of Ming, under the influence of eunuch Wang Zhen who dominated the Ming court at the time, made the decision to personally lead his armies into battle against Esen. On 1 September, the Ming army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the much weaker Mongols, and the Emperor was captured. This defeat was one of the biggest military failures in the Ming dynasty's three centuries of existence, and it was largely attributed to the poor leadership of their army. \nEsen, for his part, was not prepared for the scale of his victory or for the capture of the Ming emperor. Initially, he attempted to use the captured Emperor to raise a ransom and planned to conquer the undefended Ming capital of Beijing. His plan was foiled due to the steadfast leadership of the commander in the capital, Yu Qian, and the ascension of the captured Emperor's brother, the Jingtai Emperor. Emperor Yingzong was eventually released in 1450, but he was placed under house arrest by his brother. Esen faced growing criticism for his failure to exploit his victory over the Ming and was assassinated six years after the battle in 1455.\nBackground.\nMilitary situation.\nThe Ming dynasty was established in 1368 when Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), a former peasant rebel, overthrew the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and forced the Mongols to retreat back to the northern steppes. To counter persistent Mongol threats along the northern frontier, the Hongwu Emperor implemented significant military reforms and launched multiple military campaigns to secure the border regions. His son, the Yongle Emperor, further expanded these efforts by personally leading expeditions against the Mongols between 1410 and 1424. The decision to move the capital to Beijing in 1421 was also a strategic move to focus on northern defense. While these aggressive policies initially strengthened frontier security, they ultimately depleted Ming resources.\nAfter the death of the Yongle Emperor in 1424, the defense of the northern borders began to deteriorate. Despite complaints from generals about the lack of resources, no action was taken. In 1435 and 1438, some garrisons were reinforced, but the overall situation remained unchanged. Inland, only half of the supposed 2.5\u00a0million soldiers in the \"Weisuo\" military system were actually performing their duties. Farms given to hereditary soldiers from \"Weisuo\" garrisons on the borders were often seized by officers, who became landowners while reducing their soldiers to farm laborers, leading to the collapse of local self-sufficiency and a reliance on grain transported from the interior. This resulted in a decline in the quality of training, military prowess, and logistic support (including weapons and equipment). The Beijing garrison was frequently used for construction projects, such as defensive positions, but more often for the building of palaces, temples, and private residences for officers and eunuchs of the imperial palace.\nThe defense of the northern border was primarily focused on the area between China and the steppe, as the outposts in present-day Inner Mongolia had been abandoned. The Great Wall had not yet been constructed and the border was only guarded by patrols between fortified cities. The defense of the northeast relied on three main fortified cities: Xuanfu, Datong, and Beijing. The fortifications of Beijing were not completed until 1445. In Xuanfu, there were 90,000 soldiers, with 35,000 ready for battle and 55,000 in training. Additionally, there were 25,000 horsemen and 9,000 firearms of various types, as well as 90,000 hand rockets. Datong had a stronger cavalry force, with 35,000 horses, and was supported by 160,000 men in Beijing. The reserve consisted of garrisons stationed in northeastern China, specifically in North Zhili, Shandong, and Henan.\nThe border patrol battalions were meant to hold off the enemy until the main forces arrived, but with Xuanfu only 180 km from Beijing, the defense system lacked depth and relied on a quick and decisive response to any attack.\nSino\u2013Mongol relations.\nThe Mongols were divided into three groups: the Uriankhai in the southeast, the Eastern Mongols (also known as Tatars) in the east, and the Oirats in the west. After Arughtai, leader of the Eastern Mongols, was defeated in 1434, the Oirats took control over Mongolian Plateau. Their chief, Toghon, the Choros taishi, or \"grand marshal\", strengthened their authority by arranging for his daughter to marry the young khan of the Eastern Mongols, Toghtoa Bukha. After Toghon's death in 1440, his son Esen inherited the title of taishi, and \"de facto ruler of all Mongols\". Esen was more ambitious than his father, and in 1443 and 1445, he launched attacks on Hami, an important city on the route from China to Central Asia near the Chinese border. In 1448, he successfully conquered it. He also attempted to gain the support of the Mongol divisions in the Ming army in the western Chinese province of Gansu. In the east, his authority extended to the borders of Korea. In Beijing, he was viewed as a threat by those who opposed Wang Zhen, a powerful eunuch who held great influence at the imperial court in the 1440s.\nIn their relationship with China, the Mongols were primarily interested in free trade, specifically in the exchange of horses for tea, silk, and other luxury goods. However, the Ming government imposed restrictions and regulations on trade, limiting it to a few designated border towns, with Datong being the main hub. As Esen's power and influence expanded, so did his dependence on these goods to maintain the loyalty of the Mongol tribes. This led to a significant number of Mongols in border markets in the late 1440s, with up to two thousand arriving each year. The large number of armed horsemen posed a serious security concern for the Ming authorities. As a result, the Ming government protested against the excessive number of incoming Mongols, causing a sharp deterioration in their relationship. In 1449, the Ming ultimately rejected the Mongols' request for goods and only provided them with a fifth of what was requested. This rejection led the Mongols to resort to force. The immediate cause of the war was Ming's refusal to grant Esen's request to marry an imperial princess for his son.\nCrisis.\nMongol invasion.\nIn July 1449, Esen launched a large-scale invasion of China, with the Mongols advancing in three directions. Toghtoa Bukha Khan and the Uriankhai attacked the Liaodong Peninsula in the east, while the second Mongol army advanced on Xuanfu and the third, led by Esen himself, advanced on Datong. The main objective of this campaign was to capture the fortified cities of Xuanfu and Datong, which would grant the Mongols unrestricted access to the northern regions of China.\nOn 20 July, news of the raid reached Beijing and the Emperor responded by ordering four generals and 45,000 soldiers from the Beijing garrison to advance to Datong and Xuanfu to protect the border. After learning on 30 July that Esen had already attacked Datong, Emperor Yingzong ordered the mobilization of the Beijing garrison. He also declared his intention to personally lead a punitive expedition without consulting his ministers.\nEmperor Yingzong was known for his love of military parades, often organized for him by Wang Zhen. His self-confidence was further bolstered by the recent successes of the Ming troops in the Luchuan\u2013Pingmian campaigns and in suppressing the rebellion of Deng Maoqi. All previous Ming emperors, except for Jianwen Emperor, personally led armies into battle. Therefore, Wang Zhen used this to support the Emperor's decision.\nThe first to protest were Minister of War Kuang Ye () and his deputy Yu Qian. They believed that the monarch's participation in a punitive expedition was an unacceptably risky adventure. Other officials also attempted to dissuade the Emperor from joining the campaign. Minister of Personnel Wang Zhi () wrote a memorandum on behalf of the dissenting officials, arguing that officers were responsible for the dangers of war, and the Emperor, as the head of the imperial family and the empire, and the person on whom the world's attention was focused, should not expose himself to danger. Although the Emperor appreciated his concern, he remained determined to carry out his plans. The last attempt to stop the Emperor was made by a supervising secretary as the army was leaving the city. He threw himself in front of the Emperor's palanquin, but was unsuccessful.\nOn 3 August, Esen's army defeated the poorly supplied Ming army from Datong at the Yanghe Pass. On the same day, Emperor Yingzong appointed his younger brother Zhu Qiyu, Prince of Cheng, to oversee the administration of the capital during the campaign. Zhu Qiyu was assisted by four representatives from the most influential power groups. These included Prince Consort Commander Jiao Jing (), who represented the imperial family; Jin Ying, the head of the Directorate of Ceremonial and the highest-ranking eunuch in the absence of Wang Zhen; Minister Wang Zhi, who led the government; and Grand Secretary Gao Gu (). All major decisions were to be postponed until the Emperor's return.\nDespite the deteriorating security situation, the Emperor made a sudden decision without any prior preparations. This left the soldiers with only a few days, from 1 to 4 August, to get ready for the campaign. The Emperor was accompanied by twenty experienced generals, most of whom held noble titles, and an equal number of high-ranking officials. They were also accompanied by hundreds of lower-ranking dignitaries, with Wang Zhen serving as the \"de facto\" commander-in-chief. While the number of mobilized soldiers is unknown, it is often estimated to be around half a million, but in reality, the actual number may have been significantly smaller. Even under optimal conditions, supplying such a large army would have been challenging. The troops were hastily assembled, poorly supplied, and incompetently led, ultimately leading to disaster.\nMing counterattack.\nThe army departed from Beijing on 4 August and headed towards the Juyong Pass. The objective was to make a swift and brief march westward, passing through Xuanfu and reaching Datong. The plan was to conduct a rapid campaign in the steppe and then return to Beijing via the southern route. This route was chosen to avoid excessive destruction in the region along the Beijing\u2013Xuanfu\u2013Datong road, as the army would be passing through it twice. The return journey would take them through Yuzhou and the Zijing Pass.\nFrom the very beginning, chaos and disarray plagued the army. The soldiers trudged on through relentless heavy rain. After seven days, they finally reached Xuanfu, but only after being delayed by a storm. Despite pleas from many to turn back, both in Xuanfu and earlier in Juyong Pass, Wang Zhen urged them to press on. By 12 August, some officials were already discussing the possibility of assassinating Wang Zhen and bringing the Emperor back, but they lacked the courage to follow through with their plan.\nOn 16 August, the army arrived at the corpse-strewn battlefield of Yanghe. Two days later, on 18 August, the Emperor reached Datong. During the journey, more soldiers died from starvation due to poor supplies than from skirmishes with the enemy. Upon reaching Datong, Wang Zhen received reports from local commanders and information from nearby border garrisons, which convinced him that continuing the campaign into the steppe would be dangerous. As a result, the expedition was declared victorious and the army turned back on 20 August. The discipline of the army had already begun to deteriorate. Wang Zhen was also concerned about the impact of the army's passage on his hometown in Yuzhou (present-day Yu County, Hebei), so he insisted on returning the same way they had come.\nOn 27 August, the returning troops arrived in Xuanfu. Just three days later, the Mongols launched an attack on the Ming army's rear in Xuanfu, resulting in its destruction. The Mongols then proceeded to Yao'er Gorge, where they ambushed and destroyed a newly formed rear guard of 40,000 cavalry under the command of General Zhu Yong (). The following day, 31 August, the Ming army set up camp at the Tumu post station. Despite suggestions from ministers, Wang Zhen refused to seek refuge in the nearby walled city of Huailai, which was only 10.5\u00a0km away. Wang Zhen's reluctance was due to his desire to keep his baggage with him. The army faced a lack of water in Tumu, leaving the men and horses thirsty.\nTumu debacle.\nEsen dispatched troops to block Chinese access to the river south of their camp. By the morning of 1 September, the Mongols had surrounded the Chinese camp and offered to negotiate. Wang Zhen ignored their overtures and instead ordered the confused Ming army to advance towards the river. A battle ensued between the disorganized Ming army and the vanguard of the Mongol army, with Esen himself choosing not to participate. Only 20,000 Mongols were involved in the battle but the hungry and thirsty Ming soldiers were unable to put up much resistance. The Ming army suffered a swift defeat, with nearly half of its soldiers lost and a significant amount of weapons and equipment seized by the Mongols. Among the casualties were high-ranking officials, including two dukes, two marquises, five counts, several generals, and hundreds of officials. Notable figures such as the old general Zhang Fu and Grand Secretaries Cao Nai () and Zhang Yi () were also killed. After reclaiming the area, Ming troops were able to gather tens of thousands of firearms, armor, and other equipment left behind by the defeated army.\nDuring the battle, the Emperor's bodyguard attempted to remove him from the fighting, but were unsuccessful. In the chaos, one of the Ming officers killed Wang Zhen. The Emperor was then captured and taken to a Mongol camp near Xuanfu on 3 September. Esen decided not to kill him and instead chose to inform the Ming side of the Emperor's survival before deciding on his next course of action.\nAftermath.\nEmpress Dowager Sun and Empress Qian, who were leading the court, learned of the battle and the Emperor's capture on the night of 2\u20133 September. They quickly sent gifts to Esen, along with a request for the Emperor's release. Panic spread as the Beijing garrison was left with less than 100,000 soldiers and the fate of Datong and Xuanfu was uncertain.\nReader-in-waiting Xu Cheng, a native of Suzhou known for his military strategy skills and familiarity with the border situation, suggested temporarily moving the capital to the south to keep it safe from the enemy. Minister of Rites Hu Ying opposed this plan, arguing that the tombs of the Yongle and Xuande emperors could not be abandoned. Vice Minister of War Yu Qian then strongly opposed the idea, even threatening to execute anyone who suggested it. This calmed down the panicking officials, as Yu Qian was supported by influential eunuchs and Grand Secretaries Chen Xun () and Shang Lu (). Although Empress Dowager Sun reluctantly approved staying and authorized any necessary actions to defend the capital, many officials chose to flee south, and some sent their families there for safety.\nMeanwhile, the Mongols approached Xuanfu and demanded entry into the city for the captured Emperor Yingzong and his entourage. The defenders of the city responded by shooting at them. The Mongols then retreated to Datong. In a separate message to Beijing, the Emperor requested that supplies be provided for the Mongols. The local commanders at Datong also refused to open the gates; they cited imperial orders as their reason for not surrendering. Regional commander Liu An went to the Mongol camp to meet with the Emperor, followed by several officials and officers from the city, but the city was not surrendered. Liu An only handed over the local silver reserve (140,000 \"liang\") to the Emperor, who then distributed it among the Mongol chieftains.\nOn 4 September, Minister Wang Zhi requested the Empress Dowager appoint the Prince of Cheng to govern the country. The Empress Dowager agreed, but limited his authority by labeling it as \"special\" and \"temporary\". Additionally, she also promoted the two-year-old Zhu Jianshen, eldest son of the captured Emperor, to the position of heir to the throne. This appointment was made on 6 September.\nYu Qian used his position as the highest-ranking official in the Ministry of War to oversee defense preparations. He ensured that grain was transported from the granaries in Tongzhou, located near Beijing, where almost half of the grain stocks were stored. The Prince of Cheng also supported Yu's plan to gather military units from nearby provinces and the south, as well as levies from the metropolitan area. On 7 September, Yu was appointed as Minister of War. On the same day, commanders in Datong were warned against responding to the captured Emperor's requests.\nEnthronement of a new emperor and the defense of Beijing.\nOn 15 September, officials in Beijing urged the Prince of Cheng to assume the role of emperor to stabilize the government and reduce the importance of the captured Emperor Yingzong in the hands of the Oirats. Although initially hesitant, the prince eventually ascended the throne as the Jingtai Emperor on 17 (or 23) September. He declared his captive brother as the \"emperor emeritus\" (; \"Taishang Huangdi\"), a title that was purely honorary.\nIn response to the threat of invasion from the Mongols, Yu Qian withdrew 80,000 soldiers from Xuanfu and other areas to defend Beijing. He also called in reserves from northern China, including transport and training units and coast guard units. New commanders were appointed and defenses were organized. Meanwhile, Esen once again approached Datong, this time claiming to be defending Emperor Yingzong's right to the throne. His claim was rejected by the garrison at Yanghe Pass. He then marched on Beijing with the intention of restoring Emperor Yingzong to the throne. The defenders at the Jijing Pass held off the Mongol army for several days before being outnumbered. Esen finally reached Beijing on 27 October. With 220,000 men at his disposal, Yu Qian was able to fend off the 70,000 Mongol troops. After five days of fighting, the Mongols realized they did not have the strength to take the city and returned to their homeland. Following Esen's failed campaign, the Ming troops were able to drive out the remaining smaller Mongol forces from China. As a result of Esen's defeat, Mongol unity began to crumble rapidly. Just a few days after his departure from Beijing, Toghtoa Bukha Khan sent an envoy with tribute to the Ming court.\nIn the following weeks, the Mongols continued their border raids, sometimes involving numerous detachments. The Ming army, commanded from Beijing by Yu Qian, responded by strengthening the defenses of the passes, while the Ming cavalry cleared the border steppes. The operations of the Ming troops did not have significant results, but they faced difficulties in supplying their troops due to the destruction of the surrounding area.\nEsen then offered to release Emperor Yingzong, but the Jingtai Emperor was hesitant to accept, as he wanted to solidify his position in the palace and government before allowing his brother to return. As a result, Emperor Yingzong was not able to return until September 1450, remaining in captivity for twelve and a half months. Upon his return, the Jingtai Emperor felt threatened by Emperor Yingzong and ordered him to stay in the Southern Palace within the Forbidden City, limiting his contact with the outside world. Essentially, Emperor Yingzong was under house arrest.\nConsequences.\nThe Tumu Crisis sparked a major reorganization of Ming authorities and the military, which ultimately contributed to the relative stability of the Ming dynasty for the remainder of the 15th century. Although the initial impact of losing the battle and capturing the emperor was significant, the fortified cities were able to hold their ground against the Mongols, preventing them from permanently occupying any territory. There were no territorial changes, and relations between the two sides returned to their previous state after a few months. The Mongols' main objective was not to gain territory, but rather to establish stable trade relations with China. As a result, Esen quickly established positive relations with the Ming dynasty following the battle. His failure to make significant gains led to widespread criticism in Mongolia and weakened his authority. In 1453, he declared himself Khan, but was murdered just two years later.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61662", "revid": "50550078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61662", "title": "Battle of Xiangyang", "text": "Battles during Mongol invasion of China (1267\u20131273)\nThe Battle of Xiangyang () was a protracted series of battles between the Yuan dynasty and the Southern Song dynasty from 1267 to 1273. The battle was a significant victory for the Yuan dynasty and ended a 30-year defensive campaign waged by the Southern Song dynasty, allowing Yuan forces to advance into the Southern Song heartland. The capture of Xiangyang also allowed the Yuan dynasty to take control of the Han and Yangtze rivers, thereby depriving the Southern Song dynasty of two formidable natural barriers. The defeat devastated the Southern Song dynasty, which collapsed several years later at the Battle of Yamen.\nThe battle consisted of skirmishes, ground assault, and the siege of the twin fortified cities of Fancheng and Xiangyang in modern-day Hubei, China. L\u00fc Wenhuan, commander-in-chief of the Southern Song dynasty, surrendered to Yuan Emperor Kublai Khan in 1273. The conventional use of Mongol cavalry was restricted by the woody terrain and numerous military outposts of the Southern Song. Chinese firearms and cannons were employed by the Yuan in the victorious siege of Fancheng after capturing the outposts and relieving Southern Song forces from Sichuan and Yuezhou, which broke through the siege but was eventually defeated. The use of the counterweight trebuchet by the Yuan proved especially effective.\nBackground.\nBefore the rule of Kublai Khan, the Mongols had launched military campaigns as far as Eastern Europe, and had conquered Russia, Siberia, Tibet, Korea, North China, Yunnan, Iraq, Anatolia and Iran. However, the Song dynasty was difficult to conquer because of the strategic location of Xiangyang, which became a vital position for Kublai to capture and hold. The city guarded the waterways of South China because the Han River was a major tributary into the Yangtze river. Once the city fell, the Mongols obtained easy access into important Southern cities in China and the Southern Song would collapse shortly after.\nThe Southern Song knew the importance of this vital spot, and treated the defense of Xiangyang as important as their capital. The city was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and a river (Han river) on one side. Song stored massive amount of supplies inside the fortress, as preparation for long sieges. They also built high walls and towers on all four sides of the fortress. Each entrance of the fortress had at least two layers of walls, used to trap enemy sieging forces inside.\nIn 1133, the famous Song general Yue Fei led many successful campaigns against the Jin dynasty, in the Xiangyang area. From there, he pushed the Jin army back north as far as Kaifeng. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols under the leadership of \u00d6gedei. At that time, Mongols and the Southern Song dynasty were allies. After that, the two former allies did not have any common enemy. The Song killed Mongol envoys and attempted to invade the Mongol territories.\nXiangyang surrendered to the army of the Mongol Empire without resistance in 1236. But the Mongols voluntarily left the city after it was briefly held by them in 1236\u201338. The twin cities of Xiangyang-Fenchang, with walls almost 5 kilometers around and 200,000 people, withstood a Mongol assault in 1257. The Mongolian cavalry were lured in Xiangyang where they were slaughtered by the Song defenders due to the fortress's double-layered wall design. When a Mongol contingent entered the entrance of the fortress, the Mongol forces would be slaughtered to the last man, while trapped between four walls. The Mongols lifted the siege of Xiangyang. The sudden death of M\u00f6ngke Khan forced the imperial army of the Mongol Empire to withdraw from the Song territory in 1259\u201360.\nIn 1260, Kublai Khan was proclaimed successor to the throne after the death of his brother M\u00f6ngke, as was his youngest brother Ariq B\u00f6ke. The succession war between him and Ariq B\u00f6ke began. Kublai Khan won the war eventually, though his claim as the successor to M\u00f6ngke was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan renamed his empire \"Yuan\", establishing the Yuan dynasty, instead of \"Ikh Mongol Uls\" (Great Mongolian Nation or Great Mongol Empire). After defeating his rivals and opponents in Mongolia and Northern China, Kublai Khan also wanted to continue his grandfather Genghis Khan's conquest of China. In 1267, Kublai Khan ordered Aju and the Song defector Liu Zheng to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng. General Lu Zende had levied corruption charges against Liu Zheng, the Luzhou prefect, causing Liu Zheng to defect to the Mongols in 1261\nSiege.\nAju and Liu Zheng arrived in 1268 and blockaded the city with a ring of forts. Liu Zheng had advised the cities be starved from Sichuan by building forts there. The Mongols probed the defenses of Xiangyang and Fancheng. The Yuan-Mongols learned from their mistake, and this time brought along with them about a hundred trebuchets. These trebuchets had a shooting range of around 100 metres, and could use projectiles of around 50\u00a0kg. During Mongol campaigns against the Jin dynasty, the Mongols used about 5,000 trebuchets, and they were very successful in destroying the Jin fortresses. Lu Wende commanded the Song dynasty's Yangtze and his son-in-law Fan Wenhu and son Lu Wenhuan commanded Xiangyang.\nHowever the twin cities had expected an assault by bombardment and prepared for it. The city moat was expanded to a width of 150 metres, forcing Yuan siege weapons to set up at a distance. In addition to reinforcing their walls with clay, they made netting screens ten centimetres thick and ten metres in length to cover them and dampen projectile impact. As a result, the Yuan siege weapons were both ineffective and inaccurate, and the few shots that did land bounced off the wall harmlessly.\nMongol entrapment.\nThe Mongols then started to block Xiangyang off from the rest of Song. A Yuan fleet of 5,000 ships was established, to stop any Song supplies from the Han river. The Han River was blockaded with five stone platforms capped by arbalests. The Mongol trained 70,000 marines but Song food supplies still held out in 1271. The Yuan also sent forces to go around the fortress, and set up camps at the key roads, to stop Song supplies from land. Eventually, Yuan built their own forts at these key locations.\nFrom late 1267 to 1271, Song reinforcements from the south tried, many times, to attack the Mongol positions, in order to supply Xiangyang, but outside of Xiangyang, the Song forces were no match for the Mongolian cavalry. The catalog of useless thrusts continued, the Chinese losing 1,000 in October 1270, 2,000 in August 1271, and most of a 3,000 strong force was destroyed the following month. Once the Yuan forts were completed, the situation became hopeless. As a result, the Song forces inside Xiangyang had to depend on themselves.\nThe Song had stored years of supplies within Xiangyang. However, by 1271, the fortress finally ran low on their supplies. Still, the Song troops chose to hang on. Finally, in 1272, a small Song force of 3,000 men was able to break through the Yuan naval blockade, and supplied Xiangyang from the Han river. The force, led by two men both named Zhang, commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, was discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with \"vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter.\" Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water. The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, \"on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood.\" With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens \"leapt up a hundred times in joy.\" This was a major morale boost to the defenders. However, no one could get back out to inform others of the success. The Song officials considered that reinforcement lost and Xiangyang, doomed to fall from the lack of supplies, did not send more Song reinforcements afterwards. The high casualties and low success rates ended the transportation of further supplies.\nAju realized that the twin cities were hard to take with Mongol cavalry and wrote to Kublai that he needed Chinese infantry. Kublai reinforced him with 20,000 men.\nNew weapon of the Yuan forces.\nThe defense of Xiangyang came to an end in 1273, with the introduction of the counterweight trebuchet. Because the Han Chinese commander Guo Kan fought with the Mongols under Hulagu in the Middle East, Kublai had heard of siege engines of great effectiveness. Experts Ismail and Al al-Din were sent by Abaqa, Ilkhan of Persia, to China by the decree of Kublai Khan in 1272. They built the powerful siege engines under the Uyghur general Arikhgiya by March, 1273. These counterweight trebuchets had a shooting range of , and could launch projectiles weighing over . On top of their power, these new trebuchets were much more accurate than the old ones, and were the only artillery capable of reaching the walls of Xiangyang. Yuan forces built about 20 of them, and used them to assist the siege of Xiangyang.\nThe Mongols started the siege with Fancheng in early 1273. Song soldiers in Xiangyang witnessed a giant rock which flew right over the gigantic walls of Fancheng, and hit the houses inside. Under the cover of bombardment, the Yuan army was able to fill the moat and take the walls, after which followed an assault by cavalry. The storming of the city resulted in high casualties on both sides. Fancheng, after holding out for years, suddenly fell within a few days.\nThe Yuan Mongol army then turned their attention to Xiangyang. Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong of Song, to request immediate reinforcements. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor. But upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements.\nFor the next few days, Song soldiers looked to the south for reinforcements, but all they saw were Yuan siege weapons and the Mongols waiting to end their lives. \nThe position of Song forces worsened when, in February, Yuan siege weapons began bombarding the city. A shot happened to hit a stone bridge inside the city. When the stone landed, it made a thunderous noise. Song soldiers went to check the damage, and saw that the stone had sunk a few feet into the solid ground.\nThe Yuan bombardment began to collapse the city structures as well as reduce the drum tower and turrets on the city walls. Lu Wenhuan surrendered the city on 14 March 1273; he was made governor of Xiangyang and Fancheng under Yuan rule as part of the terms.\nAftermath.\nXiangyang, the strongest fortress of the Song dynasty, had fallen. As a result, Yuan forces were free to conquer the rest of southern China. Everywhere else Yuan went, Song fortresses defected as the defecting Song commander in Xiangyang, Lu Wenhuan, ordered other members of his family commanding Song forces to defect to the Yuan. In 1275, the Song government unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a truce, but by then it was too late.\nMany people agree that the fall of Xiangyang essentially marked the end of the Song dynasty. For example, Paul K. Davis wrote, \"Mongol victory broke the southern Song dynasty, leading to the establishment of the Yuan dynasty.\" For the six years that Yuan sieged Xiangyang, Song were unable to regroup and strike back at Yuan with their resources in the south. In fact, they could not even get much reinforcements and supplies to Xiangyang, to support the hard-working defense there. The emperor of the Song dynasty abdicated on 4 February 1276.\nRole of Chinese-designed gunpowder weapons.\nBoth the Song and Mongol forces had thunder crash bombs during the siege, a type of gunpowder weapon. The Mongols also utilized siege crossbows and traction trebuchets. The Song forces used fire arrows and fire lances in addition to their own thundercrash bombs. The Song forces also used paddle ships. Siege crossbows and firebombs were also deployed on Song ships against Mongol forces, in addition to fire lances. The name of the bombs in Chinese was Zhen tian lei. They were made from cast iron and filled with gunpowder, the Chinese Song forces delivered them to the enemy via trebuchets. Armor made out of iron could be penetrated by pieces of the bomb after the explosion, which had a 50-kilometre noise range.\nRole of the counterweight trebuchet.\nSince the Yuan employed Muslim engineers for the designing of the counterweight trebuchets, they were designated in Chinese historiography as the \"Muslim\" trebuchet (\"hui-hui pao\"). The Chinese scholar Zheng Sixiao (1206\u20131283) indicates that, \"in the case of the largest ones, the wooden framework stood above a hole in the ground\". After Aju spoke with Kublai, the Emperor of the Mongol Empire, about the powerful siege machines of the Ilkhanate, the engineers Ismail and Al-aud-Din from Iraq arrived in South China to construct a new type of trebuchet, one which used explosive shells. These Muslim engineers built mangonels and trebuchets for the siege. Explosive shells had been in use in China for centuries but what was new was use of the counterweight type of trebuchet, as opposed to the torsion type, the counterweight giving greater range and accuracy as it was easier to judge the weight of the counter weight than the torsion generated by repeated windings.\nThe counterweight trebuchet, built under guidance from the Muslims from Mosul, were longer in range and assisted in destroying Fancheng. It became common for Chinese and Muslim engineers to operate artillery and siege engines for the Mongol armies. The design for the Mongol weapons was taken from those used by Hulegu to batter down the walls of Baghdad.\nThe Chinese were the first to invent the traction trebuchet, now they faced Muslim designed counterweight trebuchets in the Mongol army. The Chinese responded by building their own counterweight trebuchets, an account from the Chinese said in 1273 \"the frontier cities have all fallen. But Muslim trebuchets were constructed with new and ingenious improvements, and different kinds became available, far better than those used before.\"\nThe design of the trebuchets deployed at Xiangyang.\nThe Chinese scholar Zheng Sixiao (1206\u20131283) indicates that, \"in the case of the largest ones, the wooden framework stood above a hole in the ground\".\nAnother version is given by Marco Polo in his book \"Il Milione\" where he claims having been responsible for teaching the Mongols how to build and use catapults during the siege of Xiangyang. However, the names of the Muslim engineers were given by Muslim sources as Talib and his sons Abubakr, Ibrahim and Muhammad, respectively, by Chinese sources as Ala-ud-Din and Isma'il. Moreover, it has been claimed the siege had already ended before Marco Polo's arrival in China.\nRole of political infighting in the Song Court.\nPolitical infighting among the Song also contributed to the fall of Xiangyang and Fancheng; due to the power of the L\u00fc family, many questioned their allegiance to the Song. The Emperor barred Jia Sidao himself from the command, so Li Tingzhi, an enemy of the L\u00fc family, was appointed commander. Jia permitted the L\u00fc family to ignore Li's orders, resulting in a fractious command. Li was then unable to relieve Xiangyang and Fancheng, managing only temporary resupply during several breaks in the siege.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is also a single mother to Esteban, a teenager who aspires to become a writer.\nOn the night of Esteban's 17th birthday, he is hit and killed by a car while chasing after his favorite actress, Huma Rojo, for her autograph following a performance of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", where Huma portrays Blanche DuBois. Manuela allows her son's heart to be transplanted to a man in A Coru\u00f1a. After tracking down the recipient, she resigns from her job and travels to Barcelona in search of Esteban's other mother, Lola, a transgender woman whom Manuela had kept secret from her son, just as she had never told Lola about the boy.\nIn Barcelona, Manuela reunites with her old friend Agrado, a warm and witty transgender sex worker. She also befriends Huma as well as her co-star and lover Nina Cruz, who is a heroin addict, and young HIV-positive nun Rosa, who works in a shelter for battered sex workers and is pregnant with Lola's child. Manuela's life becomes entwined with theirs as she cares for Rosa during her pregnancy, works as Huma's personal assistant, or takes the stage as an understudy for Nina during one of her drug abuse crises.\nOn her way to the hospital, Rosa asks the taxi to stop at a park where she spots her father's dog, Sapic, and then her own father, who suffers from Alzheimer's. He does not recognize Rosa and asks for her age and height, but Sapic recognizes her. Rosa dies giving birth to a healthy boy; at her funeral, Manuela finally reunites with Lola. Lola (formerly known as Esteban) is dying from AIDS and talks about how she always wanted a son. Manuela tells her about their own son Esteban and his fatal accident. Manuela adopts Rosa's son, Esteban, caring for him at Rosa's parents' house. The father does not understand who Manuela is, and Rosa's mother introduces her as the new cook who is living there with her son.\nManuela introduces Esteban, Rosa's son, to Lola and gives her a picture of their own Esteban. Rosa's mother spots them from the street and confronts Manuela about letting strangers see the baby. Manuela tells her that Lola is Esteban's other parent, but Rosa's mother is appalled and blames Lola for causing Rosa's death, and fears that she will contract HIV from the baby. Deciding that she cannot live at Rosa's house any longer, Manuela flees back to Madrid with Esteban, and writes a letter to Huma and Agrado, apologizing once again for not saying goodbye like she did years before.\nTwo years later, Manuela returns to Barcelona with Esteban, who has remained healthy and AIDS-free. At an AIDS convention, she meets up with Huma and Agrado, who now run a stage show together, and tells them that she is returning to stay with Esteban's grandparents. When Manuela asks about Nina, Agrado reveals that Nina broke up with Huma, returned to her town, got married, and now has a son of her own.\nProduction.\nAlmod\u00f3var dedicated his film \"To all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother\".\nAlmod\u00f3var recreated the accident scene from John Cassavetes' \"Opening Night\" (1977) as the epicenter of the dramatic conflict.\nThe film was mainly shot on location in Barcelona.\nThe soundtrack includes \"Gorri\u00f3n\" and \"Coral para mi peque\u00f1o y lejano pueblo\", written by Dino Saluzzi and performed by Saluzzi, Marc Johnson, and Jos\u00e9 Saluzzi, and \"Tajabone\", written and performed by Isma\u00ebl L\u00f4.\nThe poster of the film was designed by Madrid illustrator \u00d3scar Marin\u00e9. This poster was designed to epitomize the very image of beauty, simplicity, and femininity. The poster intentionally emphasizes red, white, and blue with black accent strokes and a pop of yellow.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered in Spain on 8 April 1999 and went into general theatrical release on 16 April. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, the Auckland Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and the New York Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States. It eventually grossed \u20ac9,962,047 in Spain ($12,595,016), $8,344,738 in the US, and $59,609,091 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $67,957,990.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" called it Almod\u00f3var's \"best film by far\", noting he \"presents this womanly melodrama with an empathy to recall George Cukor's and an eye-dampening intensity to out-Sirk Douglas Sirk\". She added, \"It's the crossover moment in the career of a born four-hankie storyteller of ever-increasing stature. Look out, Hollywood, here he comes\".\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed, \"You don't know where to position yourself while you're watching a film like \"All About My Mother\", and that's part of the appeal: Do you take it seriously, like the characters do, or do you notice the bright colors and flashy art decoration, the cheerful homages to Tennessee Williams and \"All About Eve\", and see it as a parody? . . . Almod\u00f3var's earlier films sometimes seemed to be manipulating the characters as an exercise. Here the plot does handstands in its eagerness to use coincidence, surprise, and melodrama. But the characters have a weight and reality, as if Almod\u00f3var has finally taken pity on them \u2013 has seen that although their plights may seem ludicrous, they are real enough to hurt\".\nBob Graham of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said, \"No one else makes movies like this Spanish director\" and added, \"In other hands, these characters might be candidates for confessions \u2013 and brawls \u2013 on \"The Jerry Springer Show\", but here they are handled with utmost sympathy. None of these goings-on is presented as sordid or seedy. The presentation is as bright, glossy, and seductive as a fashion magazine . . . The tone of \"All About My Mother\" has the heart-on-the-sleeve emotions of soap opera, but it is completely sincere and by no means camp\".\nWesley Morris of the \"San Francisco Examiner\" called the film \"a romantically labyrinthine tribute that piles layers of inter-textual shout-outs to \"All About Eve\", Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Alfred Hitchcock, and beautifully assesses the nature of facades . . . Almod\u00f3var imbues his Harlequin-novel-meets-Marvel-comic-book melodramas with something more than a wink and a smile, and it is beguiling. His expressionism and his screenwriting have always had fun together, but now there is a kind of faith and spirituality that sexcapades like \"Law of Desire\" and \"Kika\" only laughed at... it contains a host of superlative firsts: a handful of the only truly moving scenes he has filmed, the most gorgeous dialogue he has composed, his most dimensional performances of his most dimensional characters and perhaps his most dynamic photography and elaborate production design\".\nJonathan Holland of \"Variety\" called the film \"emotionally satisfying and brilliantly played\" and commented, \"The emotional tone is predominantly dark and confrontational . . . But thanks to a sweetly paced and genuinely witty script, pic doesn't become depressing as it focuses on the characters' stoic resilience and good humor\".\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 97 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Almodovar weaves together a magnificent tapestry of femininity with an affectionate wink to classics of theater and cinema in this poignant story of love, loss and compassion.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 87 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating . In 2018 the film was ranked 32nd in BBC's list of The 100 greatest foreign language films.

{"id": "61665", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61665", "title": "Amorphophallus", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nAmorphophallus is a large genus of some 200 tropical and subtropical tuberous herbaceous plants from the arum family (Araceae), native to Asia, Africa, Australia and various oceanic islands. The genus includes the Titan arum (\"A. titanum\") of Indonesia, which has the largest inflorescence in the genus, and is known as the 'corpse flower' for the pungent odour it produces during its flowering period, which can take up to seven years of growth before it occurs.\nA few species are edible as \"famine foods\" after careful preparation to remove irritating chemicals.\nHistory.\nThe oldest systematic record of the plants was in 1692, when Van Rheede tot Drakenstein published descriptions of two plants. The name \"Amorphophallus\" was first mentioned in 1834 by the Dutch botanist Blume from Ancient Greek \"without form, misshapen\" and \"penis\", referring to the shape of the prominent spadix. Between 1876 and 1911, Adolf Engler merged a number of other genera into \"Amorphophallus\", with a final monograph published in 1911.\nDistribution.\nThese are typical lowland plants, growing in the tropical and subtropical zones of the paleotropics, from West Africa through the Pacific Islands. None of them are found in the Americas, although a remarkably similar but not closely related genus, \"Dracontium\", has evolved there. Most species are endemic. They grow preferentially on disturbed grounds, such as secondary forests.\nDescription.\nThese small to massive plants grow from a subterranean tuber. \"Amorphophallus\" tubers vary greatly from species to species, from the quite uniformly globose tuber of \"A.\u00a0konjac\" to the elongated tubers of \"A. longituberosus\" and \"A. macrorhizus\" to the bizarre clustered rootstock of \"A. coaetaneus\". The weight of these tubers range from as little as in \"Amorphophallus pusillus\" of Vietnam to as much as for \"Amorphophallus titanum\". From the top of this tuber a single leaf, which can be several metres across in larger species, is produced atop a trunk-like petiole followed, on maturity, by a single inflorescence. This leaf consists of a vertical leaf stalk and a horizontal blade, which may consist of a number of small leaflets. The leaf lasts one growing season. The peduncle (the primary flower stalk) can be long or short.\nAs is typical of the Arum family, these species develop an inflorescence consisting of an elongate or ovate spathe (a sheathing bract) which usually envelops the spadix (a flower spike with a fleshy axis). The spathe can have different colours, but mostly brownish-purple or whitish-green. On the inside, they contain ridges or warts, functioning as insect traps.\nThe plants are monoecious. The spadix has tiny flowers: female flowers, no more than a pistil, at the bottom, then male flowers, each with one stamen, and then a blank sterile area. This last part, called 'the appendix', consists of sterile flowers, called staminodes, and can be especially large. The flowers do not have corollas.\nMature female flowers are usually receptive for only one day. In many species, the inflorescence emits a scent of decaying flesh in order to attract insects, though a number of species give off a pleasant odour. Through a number of ingenious insect traps, pollinating insects that entered a spathe when female flowers were receptive remain inside the spathe for about one day while male flowers mature and release pollen. Pollen falls on these insects, and they carry pollen as they exit the spathe and can pollinate female flowers in another spathe. \"Amorphophallus\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including \"Palpifer sexnotatus\" and \"Palpifer sordida\".\nPollinated flowers usually each develop into a globose berry, a fruit. The berries are red, orange-red, white, white and yellow, or blue, depending on the species.\nNotable species.\nThe species \"Amorphophallus titanum\", 'corpse flower' or titan arum, has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, with a height of up to and a width of . After an over -tall flower opened at Chicago Botanic Gardens on 29 September 2015, thousands lined up to see and smell it. The floriculturalist described it as smelling \"like roadkill, a barnyard, a dirty diaper, very strong, a little bit of mothball smell too\". Native to the Indonesian rainforest, it takes about 10 years to blossom. Dubbed \"Alice\", its bloom was broadcast via live webcam. It is one of two plants at the Chicago Botanic Gardens, which kept open until 2 am on September 30 to accommodate visitors.\nA runner-up is \"Amorphophallus gigas\", which is taller but has a somewhat smaller inflorescence.\n\"Amorphophallus konjac\" tubers are used to make , a Japanese thickening agent and edible jelly containing glucomannan.\nSome species are called voodoo-lily, as are some species of \"Typhonium\" (also in the Araceae).\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nThe genus was divided into 4 subgenera based on phylogenetic analysis in 2017, with a number of SE Asian genera currently unplaced:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The PCMCIA originally introduced the 16-bit ISA-based PCMCIA Card in 1990, but renamed it to PC Card in March 1995 to avoid confusion with the name of the organization. The CardBus PC Card was introduced as a 32-bit version of the original PC Card, based on the PCI specification. CardBus slots are backwards compatible, but older slots are not forward compatible with CardBus cards.\nAlthough originally designed as a standard for memory-expansion cards for computer storage, the existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to the development of many kinds of devices including network cards, modems, and hard disks.\nThe PC Card port has been superseded by the ExpressCard interface since 2003, which was also initially developed by the PCMCIA. The organization dissolved in 2009, with its assets merged into the USB Implementers Forum.\nApplications.\nMany notebooks in the 1990s had two adjacent type-II slots, which allowed installation of two type-II cards or one, double-thickness, type-III card. The cards were also used in early digital SLR cameras, such as the Kodak DCS 300 series. However, their original use as storage expansion is no longer common.\nSome manufacturers such as Dell continued to offer them into 2012 on their ruggedized XFR notebooks.\nMercedes-Benz used a PCMCIA card reader in the W221 S-Class for model years 2006-2009. It was used for reading media files such as MP3 audio files to play through the COMAND infotainment system. After 2009, it was replaced with a standard SD Card reader.\nSome vehicles from the 2010s from Honda and Nissan included a PC Card reader integrated into the audio system.\nSome Japanese brand consumer entertainment devices such as TV sets include a PC Card slot for playback of media.\nAdapters for PC Cards to Personal Computer ISA slots were available when these technologies were current. Cardbus adapters for PCI slots have been made. These adapters were sometimes used to fit Wireless (802.11) PCMCIA cards into desktop computers with PCI slots.\nThe Taito G-NET arcade hardware, based on the original PlayStation, uses PC Card as a software distribution method to allow games to be replaced without total replacement of the arcade board. Konami also used the PC Card on their System 573 hardware, also based on the original PlayStation, for similar purposes. Early PlayStation 2 models in Japan (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000 and SCPH-18000) included a PC Card slot for installing a network adapter and an external hard disk drive (SCPH-20400); this was replaced by the Expansion Bay on later models (SCPH-3000x onwards).\nHistory.\nBefore the introduction of the PCMCIA card, the parallel port was commonly used for portable peripherals.\nThe PCMCIA 1.0 card standard was published by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association in November 1990 and was soon adopted by more than eighty vendors.\n It corresponds with the Japanese JEIDA memory card 4.0 standard. It was originally developed to support Memory cards.\nIntel authored the Exchangable Card Architecture (ExCA) specification, but later merged this into the PCMCIA.\nSanDisk (operating at the time as \"SunDisk\") launched its PCMCIA card in October 1992. The company was the first to introduce a writeable Flash RAM card for the HP 95LX (an early MS-DOS pocket computer). These cards conformed to a supplemental PCMCIA-ATA standard that allowed them to appear as more conventional IDE hard drives to the 95LX or a PC. This had the advantage of raising the upper limit on capacity to the full 32\u00a0MB available under DOS 3.22 on the 95LX.\nNew Media Corporation was one of the first companies established for the express purpose of manufacturing PC Cards; they became a major OEM for laptop manufacturers such as Toshiba and Compaq for PC Card products. \nIt soon became clear that the PCMCIA card standard needed expansion to support \"smart\" I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy disk cards. It also needed interrupt facilities and hot plugging, which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces. This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and JEIDA 4.1 in September 1991, which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.\nTo recognize increased scope beyond memory, and to aid in marketing, the association acquired the rights to the simpler term \"PC Card\" from IBM. This was the name of the standard from version 2 of the specification onwards. These cards were used for wireless networks, modems, and other functions in notebook PCs.\nAfter the release of PCIe-based ExpressCard in 2003, laptop manufacturers started to fit ExpressCard slots to new laptops instead of PC Card slots.\nForm factors.\nAll PC Card devices use a similar sized package which is long and wide, the same size as a credit card.\nBus.\nOriginal.\nThe original standard was defined for both 5\u00a0V and 3.3\u00a0volt cards, with 3.3\u00a0V cards having a key on the side to prevent them from being inserted fully into a 5 V-only slot. Some cards and some slots operate at both voltages as needed. The original standard was built around an 'enhanced' 16-bit ISA bus platform. A newer version of the PCMCIA standard is CardBus (see below), a 32-bit version of the original standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus of 32 bits (instead of the original 16), CardBus also supports bus mastering and operation speeds up to 33\u00a0MHz.\nCardBus.\nCardBus are PCMCIA 5.0 or later (JEIDA 4.2 or later) 32-bit PCMCIA devices, introduced in 1995 and present in laptops from late 1997 onward. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33\u00a0MHz PCI bus in the PC Card design. CardBus supports bus mastering, which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU. Many chipsets, such as those that support Wi-Fi, are available for both PCI and CardBus.\nThe notch on the left hand front of the device is slightly shallower on a CardBus device so, by design, a 32-bit device cannot be plugged into earlier equipment supporting only 16-bit devices. Most new slots accept both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices. CardBus cards can be distinguished from older cards by the presence of a gold band with eight small studs on the top of the card next to the pin sockets.\nThe speed of CardBus interfaces in 32-bit burst mode depends on the transfer type: in byte mode, transfer is 33\u00a0MB/s; in word mode it is 66\u00a0MB/s; and in dword (double-word) mode 132\u00a0MB/s.\nCardBay.\nCardBay is a variant added to the PCMCIA specification introduced in 2001. It was intended to add some forward compatibility with USB and IEEE 1394, but was not universally adopted and only some notebooks have PC Card controllers with CardBay features. This is an implementation of Microsoft and Intel's joint Drive Bay initiative.\nDesign.\nThe \"card information structure\" (CIS) is metadata stored on a PC card that contains information about the formatting and organization of the data on the card. The CIS also contains information such as:\nWhen a card is unrecognized it is frequently because the CIS information is either lost or damaged.\nDescendants and variants.\nCompactFlash.\nThe interface has spawned a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of Type I cards: CompactFlash, MiniCard, P2 Card and SmartMedia. For example, the PC Card electrical specification is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter can be a passive physical adapter rather than requiring additional circuitry. CompactFlash is a smaller dimensioned 50 pin subset of the 68 pin PC Card interface. It includes a setting for the interface mode of either \"memory\" (using the limited PC Card addressing mode) or \"ATA storage\" (using PCMCIA-ATA addressing mode).\nExpressCard.\nExpressCard is a later specification from the PCMCIA, intended as a replacement for PC Card, built around the PCI Express and USB 2.0 standards. The PC Card standard is closed to further development and PCMCIA strongly encourages future product designs to utilize the ExpressCard interface. From about 2006, ExpressCard slots replaced PCMCIA slots in laptop computers, with a few laptops having both in the transition period.\nExpressCard and CardBus sockets are physically and electrically incompatible. ExpressCard-to-CardBus and Cardbus-to-ExpressCard adapters are available that connect a Cardbus card to an Expresscard slot, or vice versa, and carry out the required electrical interfacing. These adapters do not handle older non-Cardbus PCMCIA cards.\nPC Card devices can be plugged into an ExpressCard adapter, which provides a PCI-to-PCIe Bridge.\nDespite being much faster in speed/bandwidth, ExpressCard was not as popular as PC Card, due in part to the ubiquity of USB ports on modern computers. Most functionality provided by PC Card or ExpressCard devices is now available as an external USB device. These USB devices have the advantage of being compatible with desktop computers as well as portable devices. (Desktop computers were rarely fitted with a PC Card or ExpressCard slot.) This reduced the requirement for internal expansion slots; by 2011, many laptops had none.\nOthers.\nSome IBM ThinkPad laptops took their onboard RAM (in sizes ranging from 4 to 16\u00a0MB) in the factor of an IC-DRAM Card. While very similar in form-factor, these cards did not go into a standard PC Card Slot, often being installed under the keyboard, for example. They also were not pin-compatible, as they had 88 pins but in two staggered rows, as opposed to even rows like PC Cards. These correspond to versions 1 and 2 of the JEIDA memory card standard.\nThe shape is also used by the Common Interface form of conditional-access modules for DVB, and by Panasonic for their professional \"P2\" video acquisition memory cards.\nA CableCARD conditional-access module is a type II PC Card intended to be plugged into a cable set-top box or digital cable-ready television.\nThe EOMA68 open-source hardware standard uses the same 68-pin PC Card connectors and corresponds to the PC Card form factor in many other ways.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Others are tied off or have the end(s) of the twine sewn through the rope. According to \"The Ashley Book of Knots\", \"The purpose of a \"whipping\" is to prevent the end of a rope from fraying ... A whipping should be, in width, about equal to the diameter of the rope on which it is put ... [Two sailmaker's whippings], a short distance apart, are put in the ends of every reef point, where the constant 'whipping' against the sail makes the wear excessive; this is said to be the source of the name \"whipping\".\" The other type of stopping knot is a seizing knot.\nWhipping is suitable for synthetic and natural stranded and braided lines, including 3-strand rope, 4-strand cable and 8-strand multiplait, as well as concentric and braided constructions.\nTying.\nMultiple turns of twine (sometimes called small stuff for smaller lines) or heavier whipcord (for large diameter cables and ropes) are tightly wrapped around a rope's cut end to prevent its fibers from unlaying.\nUsually one end of the whipping cord is looped along the rope to be whipped, and the remaining cord wound tightly over the loop. Finally the loose end of the wound whipping is passed through the loop so that both ends may be drawn securely inside the winding. \nWhippings may also be applied by hand or using a palm and needle, and either simply tied off or made neat and permanent by reeving the twine's cut ends into or behind the whipping, sewing them to adjacent strands, or through the rope itself.\nIn applications where a lot of flexing is expected, the whipping may be impregnated with dilute spar varnish or superglue.\nTypes.\nFrench whipping.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"French whipping\" is merely a series of half hitches. Start with a running eye and finish up with the end tucked back under the last few hitches. The ridge of the hitches should follow the lay of the rope.\u2014\u200a\nFrench whipping is a whipping knot that consists of a series of half hitches. It is used to stop unraveling of rope ends as well as to provide a grip over railings.\nPortuguese whipping.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"Portuguese whipping\" is the quickest of all to apply; the ends are merely reef knotted together. It is given by Esparteiro in his \"Dicionario de Marinharia\" (Lisboa, 1936).\nThe Portuguese whipping is a type of whipping knot. To make it you take the small diameter string and lay one end against the rope. Wrap backwards up the rope until you have both ends side by side, finish by tying a reef knot. This is the quickest of the seizings, but is not as secure as some.\nAlternatives.\nConstrictor knot.\nA constrictor knot can be used temporarily to hold the fibres of a cut line until a final whipping can be applied.\nTape.\nSeveral turns of self-adhesive plastic tape may form a temporary or emergency substitute for whipping.\nFusion.\nThe ends of some man-made fibers such as Dacron, Nylon, polyethylene, polyester, and polypropylene (but not aramid fibers) may be melted to fuse their fibers to prevent fraying. However, the rope and knotting expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against this practice for boat operators thus:\n\"Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous.\" A tugboat operator once sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and obviously \"sharp\") end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping.\nAmong the methods of fusing are using an electrically heated rope cutter, heating the blade of a knife, or melting cut ends in a flame. The cool (transparent) part of a butane lighter flame works best.\nIt is helpful to wrap the end of a line to be fused with several turns of plastic tape first. The finished end will be neater and narrower if a cut is made through the tape.\nBack splice.\nBack splicing uses a stranded rope's own fibres to prevent fraying. A back splice adds extra thickness to the rope end, preventing it from running through blocks and sheaves. It can also be of benefit when a user needs to feel the end of the rope, as on a bucket lanyard.\nLiquid.\nLiquid whipping is a semi-permanent rubbery coating applied by dipping the cut end of a line into a container of the product. When the coating sets it is flexible but solid enough to keep the rope together. Liquid whipping can be used on both natural and synthetic fibers.\nAglet.\nAn aglet is a permanent ending applied mechanically to bind the end of the rope. A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called \"percussive foraging\", and takes up 5\u201341% of foraging time. The only other living mammal species known to find food in this way are the striped possum and trioks (genus \"Dactylopsila\") of northern Australia and New Guinea, which are marsupials. From an ecological point of view, the aye-aye fills the niche of a woodpecker, as it is capable of penetrating wood to extract the invertebrates within.\nThe aye-aye is the only extant member of the genus \"Daubentonia\" and family Daubentoniidae. It is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN. A second species, \"Daubentonia robusta\", appears to have become extinct at some point within the last 1000 years, and is known from subfossil finds.\nEtymology.\nThe genus \"Daubentonia\" was named after the French naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton by his student, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name \"Scolecophagus\" (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered. In 1863, British zoologist John Edward Gray coined the family name Daubentoniidae.\nThe French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat was the first to use the vernacular name \"aye-aye\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"long-fingered lemur\" by English zoologist George Shaw in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick. According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment). However, American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall noted in 1982 that the name resembles the Malagasy name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", (also \"ahay\", , \"haihay\") which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel \"et al.\" (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"heh heh\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"heh heh\" to avoid saying the name of a feared, magical animal.\nEvolutionary history and taxonomy.\nDue to its derived morphological features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery. The possession of continually growing incisors (front teeth) parallels those of rodents, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order Rodentia and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.\nThe aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain. It has been considered a highly derived member of the family Indridae, a basally diverging branch of the strepsirrhine suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates. In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs.\nHowever, molecular results have consistently placed \"Daubentonia\" as the most basally diverging of lemurs. The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that rafted from Africa to Madagascar during the Paleogene. Similarities in dentition between aye-ayes and several African primate fossils (\"Plesiopithecus\" and \"Propotto\") have led to the alternate theory that the ancestors of aye-ayes colonized Madagascar separately from other lemurs. In 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.\nFurther evidence indicating that the aye-aye belongs in the superfamily Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of petrosal bullae encasing the ossicles of the ear. The aye-ayes are also similar to lemurs in their shorter back legs.\nAnatomy and morphology.\nA full-grown aye-aye is typically about long with a tail longer than its body. The species has an average head and body length of plus a tail of , and weighs around .\nYoung aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers. The third finger, which is much thinner than the others, is used for extracting grubs and insects out of trees, using the hooked nail. The finger is unique in the animal kingdom in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint, can reach the throat through a nostril and is used for picking one's nose and eating mucus (mucophagy) so harvested from inside the nose. The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a pseudothumb, to aid in gripping.\nThe complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of aye-aye ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals from the tapping of its finger, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others.\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin. The male's genitalia are similar to those of canids, with a large prostate and long baculum.\nBehaviour and lifestyle.\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent. The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\nMating season extends throughout the year, with females typically starting to breed at the age of three or four. They give birth to one offspring every two to three years. During the period of parenting, a female becomes the dominant figure over males, likely to secure better access to food while caring for her young. The infant remains in a nest for up to two months before venturing out, but it takes another seven months before the young aye-aye can maneuver the canopy as skillfully as an adult.\nDiet and foraging.\nThe aye-aye is an omnivore and commonly eats seeds, nuts, fruits, nectar, plant exudates and fungi, but also xylophagous, or wood boring, insect larvae (especially cerambycid beetle larvae) and honey.\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to a night.\nThough foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups. Individual movements within the group are coordinated using both vocalisations and scent signals.\nSocial systems.\nThe aye-aye is classically considered 'solitary' as they have not been observed to groom each other. However, recent research suggests that it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to , while females have smaller living spaces that go up to . It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this. Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging. The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses echolocation to find its prey.\nDistribution and habitat.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is rainforest or dry deciduous forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built from interwoven twigs and dead leaves up in the canopy among the vines and branches.\nConservation.\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. In 1966, nine individuals were transported to Nosy Mangabe, an island near Maroantsetra off eastern Madagascar. Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to endangered in 2014. This is for four main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil by local cultures, and is killed as such. The forests of Madagascar are declining in range due to deforestation. Local farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops; aye-aye poaching is another major issue. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest aye-ayes pose any legitimate threat to crops and therefore are killed based on superstition.\nAs many as 50\u00a0aye-ayes can be found in zoological facilities worldwide.\nFolk belief.\nThe aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and death and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle fingers to puncture their victims' aorta.\nCaptive breeding.\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs, including how they develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet. Jersey Zoo in the United Kingdom, also plays a big role in the conservation of the species. After importing six aye-ayes from the wild in 1990, they achieved the world's first captive breeding in 1992. They also keep the international studbook of the species and manage the European breeding program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterature cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is essentially a fork of an earlier operating system originating on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab's Lisp machines which Symbolics had used in common with Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI), and Texas Instruments (TI). Genera was also sold by Symbolics as Open Genera, which runs Genera on computers based on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Alpha processor using Tru64 UNIX. In 2021 a new version was released as Portable Genera which runs on Tru64 UNIX on Alpha, Linux on x86-64 and Arm64 Linux, and macOS on x86-64 and Arm64 (Apple Silicon M Series). It is released and licensed as proprietary software.\nGenera is an example of an object-oriented operating system based on the programming language Lisp.\nGenera supports incremental and interactive development of complex software using a mix of programming styles with extensive support for object-oriented programming.\nMIT's Lisp machine operating system.\nThe Lisp Machine operating system was written in Lisp Machine Lisp. It was a one-user workstation initially targeted at software developers for artificial intelligence (AI) projects. The system had a large bitmap screen, a mouse, a keyboard, a network interface, a disk drive, and slots for expansion. The operating system was supporting this hardware and it provided (among others):\nThis was already a complete one-user Lisp-based operating system and development environment.\nThe MIT Lisp machine operating system was developed from the middle 1970s to the early 1980s.\nIn 2006, the source code for this Lisp machine operating system from MIT was released as free and open-source software.\nGenera operating system.\nSymbolics developed new Lisp machines and published the operating system under the name \"Genera\". The latest version is 8.5. Symbolics Genera was developed in the early 1980s and early 1990s. In the final years, development entailed mostly patches, with very little new function.\nSymbolics developed Genera based on this foundation of the MIT Lisp machine operating system. It sells the operating system and \"layered software\". Some of the layered software has been integrated into Genera in later releases. Symbolics improved the operating system software from the original MIT Lisp machine and expanded it. The Genera operating system was only available for Symbolics Lisp machines and the Open Genera virtual machine.\nSymbolics Genera has many features and supports all the versions of various hardware that Symbolics built over its life. Its source code is more than a million lines; the number depends on the release and what amount of software is installed. Symbolics Genera was published on magnetic tape and CD-ROM. The release of the operating system also provided most of the source code of the operating system and its applications. The user has free access to all parts of the running operating system and can write changes and extensions. The source code of the operating system is divided into \"systems\". These systems bundle sources, binaries and other files. The \"system construction toolkit\" (SCT) maintains the dependencies, the components and the versions of all the systems. A system has two numbers: a major and a minor version number. The major version number counts the number of full constructions of a system. The minor version counts the number of patches to that system. A \"patch\" is a file that can be loaded to fix problems or provide extensions to a particular version of a system.\nSymbolics developed a version named \"Open Genera\", that included a virtual machine that enabled executing Genera on DEC Alpha based workstations, plus several Genera extensions and applications that were sold separately (like the Symbolics \"S-Graphics\" suite). Also, they made a new operating system named \"Minima\" for embedded uses, in Common Lisp. The latest version is \"Portable Genera\", which has the virtual machine ported to x86-64, Arm64 and Apple M1 processors - additionally to the DEC Alpha processor. The virtual machine then runs under the Linux and macOS, additionally to Tru64 UNIX.\nThe original Lisp machine operating system was developed in Lisp Machine Lisp, using the \"Flavors\" object-oriented extension to that Lisp. Symbolics provided a successor to Flavors named \"New Flavors\". Later Symbolics also supported Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). Then Symbolics Common Lisp became the default Lisp dialect for writing software with Genera. The software of the operating system was written mostly in Lisp Machine Lisp (named ZetaLisp) and Symbolics Common Lisp. These Lisp dialects are both provided by Genera. Also parts of the software was using either Flavors, New Flavors, and Common Lisp Object System. Some of the older parts of the Genera operating system have been rewritten in Symbolics Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Object system. Many parts of the operating systems remained written in ZetaLisp and Flavors (or New Flavors).\nUser interface.\nThe early versions of Symbolics Genera were built with the original graphical user interface (GUI) windowing system of the Lisp machine operating system. Symbolics then developed a radically new windowing system named \"Dynamic Windows\" with a \"presentation-based user interface\". This window system was introduced with Genera 7 in 1986. Many of the applications of Genera have then been using Dynamic Windows for their user interface. Eventually there was a move to port parts of the window system to run on other Common Lisp implementations by other vendors as the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM). Versions of CLIM have been available (among others) for Allegro Common Lisp, LispWorks, and Macintosh Common Lisp. An open source version is available (McCLIM).\n\"Dynamic Windows\" uses typed objects for all output to the screen. All displayed information keeps its connection to the objects displayed (\"output recording\"). This works for both textual and graphical output. At runtime the applicable operations to these objects are computed based on the class hierarchy and the available operations (\"commands\"). Commands are organized in hierarchical \"command tables\" with typed parameters. Commands can be entered with the mouse (making extensive use of mouse chording), keystrokes, and with a command line interface. All applications share one command line interpreter implementation, which adapts to various types of usage. The graphical abilities of the window system are based on the PostScript graphics model.\nThe user interface is mostly in monochrome (black-and-white) since that was what the hardware console typically provided. But extensive support exists for color, using color frame buffers or X Window System (X11) servers with color support. The \"activities\" (applications) use the whole screen with several panes, though windows can also be smaller. The layout of these activity windows adapts to different screen sizes. Activities can also switch between different pane layouts.\nGenera provides a \"system menu\" to control windows, switch applications, and operate the window system. Many features of the user interface (switching between activities, creating activities, stopping and starting processes, and much more) can also be controlled with keyboard commands.\nThe \"Dynamic Lisp Listener\" is an example of a command line interface with full graphics abilities and support for mouse-based interaction. It accepts Lisp expressions and commands as input. The output is mouse sensitive. The Lisp listener can display forms to input data for the various built-in commands.\nThe user interface provides extensive online help and context sensitive help, completion of choices in various contexts.\nDocumentation.\nGenera supports fully hyperlinked online documentation. The documentation is read with the Document Examiner, an early hypertext browser. The documentation is based on small reusable documentation records that can also be displayed in various contexts with the Editor and the Lisp Listener. The documentation is organized in books and sections. The books were also provided in printed versions with the same contents as the online documentation. The documentation database information is delivered with Genera and can be modified with incremental patches.\nThe documentation was created with a separate application that was not shipped with Genera: Symbolics \"Concordia\". Concordia provides an extension to the \"Zmacs\" editor for editing documentation records, a graphics editor and a page previewer.\nThe documentation provides user guides, installation guidelines and references of the various Lisp constructs and libraries.\nThe markup language is based on the Scribe markup language and also usable by the developer.\nGenera supports printing to postscript printers, provides a printing queue and also a PostScript interpreter (written in Lisp).\nFeatures.\nGenera also has support for various network protocols and applications using those. It has extensive support for TCP/IP.\nGenera supports one-processor machines with several threads (called \"processes\").\nGenera supports several different types of garbage collection (GC): full GC, in-place GC, incremental GC, and ephemeral GC. The ephemeral collector uses only physical memory and uses the memory management unit to get information about changed pages in physical memory. The collector uses generations and the virtual memory is divided into areas. Areas can contain objects of certain types (strings, bitmaps, pathnames, ...), and each area can use different memory management mechanisms.\nGenera implements two file systems: the FEP file system for large files and the \"Lisp Machine File System\" (LMFS) optimized for many small files. These systems also maintain different versions of files. If a file is modified, Genera still keeps the old versions. Genera also provides access to, can read from and write to, other, local and remote, file systems including: NFS, FTP, HFS, CD-ROMs, tape drives.\nGenera supports netbooting.\nGenera provides a client for the \"Statice\" object database from Symbolics.\nGenera makes extensive use of the \"condition system\" (exception handling) to handle all kinds of runtime errors and is able to recover from many of these errors. For example, it allows retrying network operations if a network connection has a failure; the application code will keep running. When errors occur, users are presented a menu of restarts (abort, retry, continue options) that are specific to the error signalled.\nGenera has extensive debugging tools.\nGenera can save versions of the running system to \"worlds\". These worlds can be booted and then will contain all the saved data and code.\nProgramming languages.\nSymbolics provided several programming languages for use with Genera:\nSymbolics Common Lisp provides most of the Common Lisp standard with very many extensions, many of them coming from ZetaLisp.\nOther languages from Symbolics.\nIt is remarkable that these programming language implementations inherited some of the dynamic features of the Lisp system (like garbage collection and checked access to data) and supported incremental software development.\nThird-party developers provided more programming languages, such as OPS5, and development tools, such as the Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) from IntelliCorp).\nApplications.\nSymbolics Genera comes with several applications. Applications are called \"activities\". Some of the activities:\nOther applications from Symbolics.\nSymbolics sold several applications that run on Symbolics Genera.\nThird-party applications.\nSeveral companies developed and sold applications for Symbolics Genera. Some examples:\nLimits.\nGenera's limits include:\nReleases.\nA stable version of Open Genera that can run on x86-64 or arm64 Linux, and Apple M1 MacOS has been released and has been renamed to Portable Genera.\nA hacked version of Open Genera that can run on x86-64 Linux exists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61700", "revid": "50882933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61700", "title": "Sahelanthropus", "text": "Extinct hominid from Miocene Africa\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSahelanthropus is an extinct genus of hominid dated to about https://\u00a0million years ago during the Late Miocene. The type species, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, was first announced in 2002, based mainly on a partial cranium, nicknamed \"Touma\u00ef\", discovered in northern Chad.\nThe definitive phylogenetic position of \"Sahelanthropus\" within hominids is uncertain. It was initially described as a possible hominin ancestral to both humans and chimpanzees, but subsequent interpretations suggest that it could be an early member of the tribe Gorillini or a stem-hominid outside the hominins. Examinations on the postcranial skeleton of \"Sahelanthropus\" also indicated that this taxon was not a habitual biped.\nTaxonomy.\nDiscovery.\nFour employees of the Centre National d'Appui \u00e0 la Recherche (CNAR, National Research Support Center) of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Republic of Chad, three Chadians (Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye,&lt;ref name=\"researchgate/2007191460\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fanon\u00e9 Gongdib\u00e9 and Mahamat Adoum) and one French (Alain Beauvilain&lt;ref name=\"researchgate/9991597\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) collected and identified the first remains in the Toros-Menalla area (TM 266 locality) in the Djurab Desert of northern Chad, July 19, 2001. By the time Michel Brunet and colleagues formally described the remains in 2002, a total of six specimens had been recovered: a nearly complete but heavily deformed skull, a fragment of the midline of the jaw with the tooth sockets for an incisor and canine, a right third molar, a right first incisor, a right jawbone with the last premolar to last molar, and a right canine. With the skull as the holotype specimen, they were grouped into a new genus and species as \"Sahelanthropus tchadensis\", the genus name referring to the Sahel, and the species name to Chad. These, along with \"Australopithecus bahrelghazali\", were the first discoveries of any fossil African great ape (outside the genus \"Homo\") made beyond eastern and southern Africa. By 2005, a third premolar was recovered from the TM 266 locality, a lower jaw missing the region behind the second molar from the TM 292 locality, and a lower left jaw preserving the sockets for premolars and molars from the TM 247 locality.\nThe skull was nicknamed Touma\u00ef by the then-president of the Republic of Chad, Idriss D\u00e9by, not only because it designates in the local Daza language meaning \"hope of life\", given to infants born just before the dry season and who, therefore, have fairly limited chances of survival, but also to celebrate the memory of one of his comrades-in-arms, living in the north of the country where the fossil was discovered, and killed fighting to overthrow President Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 supported by France. Touma\u00ef also became a source of national pride, and Brunet announced the discovery before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a television audience in the capital of N'Djamena, \"l'anc\u00eatre de l'humanit\u00e9 est Tchadien...Le berceau de l'humanit\u00e9 se trouve au Tchad. Touma\u00ef est votre anc\u00eatre\" (\"The ancestor of humanity is Chadian...The cradle of humanity is in Chad. Touma\u00ef is your ancestor.\").\nTouma\u00ef had been found with a femur, but this was stored with animal bones and shipped to the University of Poitiers in 2003, where it was stumbled upon by graduate student Aude Bergeret the next year. She took the bone to the head of the Department of Geosciences, Roberto Macchiarelli, who considered it to be inconsistent with bipedalism contra what Brunet \"et al.\" had earlier stated in their description analysing only the distorted skull. This was conspicuous because Brunet and his team had already explicitly stated Touma\u00ef was associated with no limb bones, which could have proven or disproven their conclusions of locomotion. Because Brunet had declined to comment on the subject, Macchiarelli and Bergeret petitioned to present their preliminary findings during an annual conference organised by the Anthropological Society of Paris, which would be held at Poitiers that year. This was rejected as they had not formally published their findings yet. They were able to publish a full description in 2020, and concluded \"Sahelanthropus\" was not bipedal.\nIn 2022, French primatologist Franck Guy and colleagues reported that a hominin left femur (TM 266-01-063), a right (TM 266-01-358), and a left (TM 266-01-050) ulna (forearm bone) were also discovered at the site in 2001, but were excluded originally from \"Sahelanthropus\" because they could not be reliably associated with the skull. They decided to include it because \"Sahelanthropus\" is the only hominin known from the site, and they concluded that the material is consistent with obligate bipedalism, the earliest evidence of such. In 2023, Meyer and colleagues suggested that its phylogenetic position and its status as a hominin still remain equivocal.\nAll \"Sahelanthropus\" specimens, representing six to nine different adults, have been recovered within the area.\nTaphonomy.\nUpon description, Brunet and colleagues were able to constrain the TM 266 locality to 7 or 6 million years ago (near the end of the Late Miocene) based on the animal assemblage, which made \"Sahelanthropus\" the earliest African ape at the time. In 2008, Anne-Elisabeth Lebatard and colleagues (which includes Brunet) attempted to radiometrically date using the 10Be/9Be ratio the sediments Touma\u00ef was found near (dubbed the \"anthracotheriid unit\" after the commonplace \"Libycosaurus petrochii\"). Averaging the ages of 28 samples, they reported an approximate date of 7.2\u20136.8 million years ago.\nTheir methods were soon challenged by Beauvilain, who clarified that Touma\u00ef was found on loose sediments at the surface rather than being \"unearthed\", and had probably been exposed to the harsh sun and wind for some time considering it was encrusted in an iron shell and desert varnish. This would mean it is unsafe to assume that the skull and nearby sediments were deposited at the same time, making such radiometric dating impossible. Further, the \"Sahelanthropus\" fossils lack white silaceous cement which is present on every other fossil in the site, which would mean they date to different time periods. Because the large mammal fossils were scattered across the area instead of concentrated like the \"Sahelanthropus\" fossils, the discoverers originally believed the \"Sahelanthropus\" fossils were dumped there by a palaeontologist or geologist, but later dismissed this because the skull was too complete to have been thrown away like that. In 2009, Alain Beauvilain and Jean-Pierre Watt\u00e9 argued that Touma\u00ef was purposefully buried in a \"grave\", because the skull was also found with two parallel rows of large mammal fossils, seemingly forming a box. Because the \"grave\" is orientated in a northeast\u2013southwest direction towards Mecca, and all sides of the skull were exposed to the wind and were eroded (meaning the skull had somehow turned), they argued that Touma\u00ef was first buried by nomads who identified the skull as human and collected nearby limb fossils (believing them to belong with the skull) and buried them, and was reburied again sometime after the 11th century by Muslims who reorientated the grave towards Mecca when the fossils were re-exposed.\nClassification.\nWhen describing the species in 2002, Brunet \"et al.\" noted the combination of features that would be considered archaic or derived for a species on the human line (the subtribe Hominina), the latter being bipedal locomotion and reduced canine teeth, which they interpreted as evidence of its position near the chimpanzee\u2013human last common ancestor (CHLCA). This classification made \"Sahelanthropus\" the oldest Hominina, shifting the centre of origin for the clade away from East Africa. They also suggested that \"Sahelanthropus\" could be a sister group to the 5.5-to-4.5-million-year-old \"Ardipithecus\" and later Hominina. The classification of \"Sahelanthropus\" in Hominina, as well as \"Ardipithecus\" and the 6-million-year-old \"Orrorin\", was at odds with molecular analyses of the time, which had placed the CHLCA between 6 and 4 million years ago based on a high mutation rate of about 70 mutations per generation. All these genera were anatomically too derived to represent a basal hominin (the group containing chimps and humans), so molecular data would only permit their classification into more ancient and now-extinct lineages. This was overturned in 2012 by geneticists Aylwyn Scally and Richard Durbin, who studied the genomes of children and their parents and found the mutation rate was actually half that, placing the CHLCA anywhere from 14 to 7 million years ago, though most geneticists and palaeoanthropologists use 8 to 7 million years ago. A recent phylogenetic analysis classified \"Orrorin\" as a hominin, but placed \"Sahelanthropus\" as a stem-hominid outside hominins, though dental metric analysis supports its position as a hominin.\nA further possibility is that Touma\u00ef is not ancestral to either humans or chimpanzees at all, but rather an early representative of the Gorillini lineage. Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford, the discoverers of \"Orrorin tugenensis\", suggested that the features of \"S. tchadensis\" are consistent with a female proto-gorilla. Even if this claim is upheld the find would lose none of its significance, because at present very few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa. Thus, if \"S. tchadensis\" is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees or gorillas, then it represents the earliest known member of \"their\" lineage. \"S. tchadensis\" does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to closely resemble extant chimpanzees, as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists. Additionally, with the significant sexual dimorphism known to have existed in early hominins, the difference between \"Ardipithecus\" and \"Sahelanthropus\" may not be large enough to warrant a separate genus for the latter.\nAnatomy.\nCranium.\nExisting fossils include a relatively small cranium, five pieces of jaw, and some teeth, making up a head that has a mixture of derived and primitive features. A virtual reconstruction of the interior of the braincase indicated a cranial capacity of 378\u00a0cm3, similar to that of extant chimpanzees and approximately a third the size of modern human brains.\nThe teeth, brow ridges, and facial structure differ markedly from those found in modern humans. Cranial features show a flatter face, U-shaped tooth rows, small canines, an anterior foramen magnum, and heavy brow ridges. The only known skull suffered a large amount of distortion during the time of fossilisation and discovery, as the cranium is dorsoventrally flattened, and the right side is depressed.\nLocomotion.\nIn the original description in 2002, Brunet \"et al.\" said it \"would not be unreasonable\" to speculate that \"Sahelanthropus\" was capable of maintaining an upright posture while walking bipedally. Because they had not reported any limb bones or other post-cranial material (anything other than the skull), this was based on the reconstructed original orientation of the foramen magnum (where the skull connects the spine), and their classification of \"Sahelanthropus\" into Hominina based on facial comparisons (one of the diagnostic characteristics of Hominina is bipedalism). This was soon disputed because the orientation of the foramen magnum is not an entirely conclusive piece of evidence in regard to the question of habitual posture, and the features used to classify \"Sahelanthropus\" into Hominina are not entirely unique to Hominina.\nIn 2020, the femur had been formally described, and the study concluded it was not consistent with habitual bipedalism. But, in 2022, Daver and colleagues suggested that the ulnar and femoral morphologies do show characteristics consistent with habitual bipedalism. In 2023, however, Meyer and colleagues examined its ulna shaft and argued that \"Sahelanthropus\" is not an obligate biped based on the mathematical analysis of its locomotor behavior which indicated that its forelimbs had different functions compared to modern humans and hominins, and that it probably walked on its knuckles like modern gorillas and chimpanzees, so more examination is required to truly identify its locomotor behavior (i.e. whether it exhibited facultative bipedalism) and its phylogenetic position as a hominin in the evolution of humans. A 2024 study re-examined the 2022 study's postcranial evidence, and concluded that it is not sufficient to determine whether \"Sahelanthropus\" was a habitual biped, since none of the features are consistent with or unique to bipedal hominins, but with non-hominin apes or even non-primates.\nPalaeoecology.\nBased on dental mesowear patterns of the bovids found in the same palaeoenvironment, \"S. tchadensis\" inhabited a mosaic environment with patches of both forests and grasslands.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The diagrams are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses simple closed curves on a plane to represent sets. The curves are often circles or ellipses.\nSimilar ideas had been proposed before Venn such as by Christian Weise in 1712 (\"Nucleus Logicoe Wiesianoe\") and Leonhard Euler in 1768 (\"Letters to a German Princess\"). The idea was popularised by Venn in \"Symbolic Logic\", Chapter V \"Diagrammatic Representation\", published in 1881.\nDetails.\nA Venn diagram, also called a \"set diagram\" or \"logic diagram\", shows \"all\" possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. The points inside a curve labelled \"S\" represent elements of the set \"S\", while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set \"S\". This lends itself to intuitive visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets \"S\" and \"T\", denoted \"S\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"T\" and read \"the intersection of \"S\" and \"T\"\", is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions \"S\" and \"T\".\nIn Venn diagrams, the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams, which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science.\nA Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an area-proportional (or scaled) Venn diagram.\nExample.\nThis example involves two sets of creatures, represented as overlapping circles: one circle that represents all types of creatures that have two legs, and another representing creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram. Living creatures that have two legs \"and\" can fly\u2014for example, parrots\u2014are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the two circles overlap. This overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example, creatures) that are members of both the set of two-legged creatures and set of flying creatures.\nHumans and penguins are bipedal, and so are in the \"has two legs\" circle, but since they cannot fly, they appear in the part of the that circle that does not overlap with the \"can fly\" circle. Mosquitoes can fly, but have six, not two, legs, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the \"can fly\" circle that does not overlap with the \"has two legs\" circle. Creatures that are neither two-legged nor able to fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.\nThe combined region of the two sets is called their \"union\", denoted by A \u222a B, where A is the \"has two legs\" circle and B the \"can fly\" circle. The union in this case contains all living creatures that either are two-legged or can fly (or both). The region included in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the \"intersection\" of A and B, denoted by A \u2229 B.\nHistory.\nVenn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by John Venn in a paper entitled \"On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings\" in the \"Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science\", about the different ways to represent propositions by diagrams. The use of these types of diagrams in formal logic, according to Frank Ruskey and Mark Weston, predates Venn but are \"rightly associated\" with him as he \"comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them\".\nDiagrams of overlapping circles representing unions and intersections, such as Borromean rings, were already in frequent use in the Middle Ages. However, the extent to which these types of diagrams can be considered precursors to Venn diagrams is disputed. Euler diagrams, which are similar to Venn diagrams but do not necessarily contain all possible unions and intersections, were named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. However, these diagrams, which are considered the precursors of Venn diagrams, can also be clearly traced back to the 16th century. Pioneers in this tradition of Euler diagrams included Erhard Weigel (1625\u20131699) and his students Johann Christoph Sturm (1635-1703) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). Christian Weise (1642\u20131708) is also worth mentioning, whose student Johann Christian Lange worked intensively on these diagrams. Euler further developed these diagrams, and Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) and his students popularized them in the 19th century. \nVenn did not use the term \"Venn diagram\" and referred to the concept as \"Eulerian Circles\". He became acquainted with Euler diagrams in 1862 and wrote that Venn diagrams did not occur to him \"till much later\", while attempting to adapt Euler diagrams to Boolean logic. In the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn wrote that Euler diagrams were the only diagrammatic representation of logic to gain \"any general acceptance\".\nVenn viewed his diagrams as a pedagogical tool, analogous to verification of physical concepts through experiment. As an example of their applications, he noted that a three-set diagram could show the syllogism: 'All \"A\" is some \"B\". No \"B\" is any \"C\". Hence, no \"A\" is any \"C\".'\nCharles L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) includes \"Venn's Method of Diagrams\" as well as \"Euler's Method of Diagrams\" in an \"Appendix, Addressed to Teachers\" of his book \"Symbolic Logic\" (4th edition published in 1896). The term \"Venn diagram\" was later used by Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, in his book \"A Survey of Symbolic Logic\".\nIn the 20th century, Venn diagrams were further developed. David Wilson Henderson showed, in 1963, that the existence of an \"n\"-Venn diagram with \"n\"-fold rotational symmetry implied that \"n\" was a prime number. He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when \"n\" is five or seven. In 2002, Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for \"n\" = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. These combined results show that rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist, if and only if \"n\" is a prime number.\nVenn diagrams and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory, as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted in the curriculum of other fields such as reading. With the work of Sun-Joo Shin, Venn diagrams have been recognized as a logical system equivalent to symbolic logic. Similar methods were then adopted in mathematics and subsequently in computer science. \nPopular culture.\nVenn diagrams have been commonly used in memes. At least one politician has been mocked for misusing Venn diagrams.\nOverview.\nA Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in a plane. According to Lewis, the \"principle of these diagrams is that classes [or \"sets\"] be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not-null\".\nVenn diagrams normally comprise overlapping circles. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the elements of the set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all wooden objects, while the other circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region, or \"intersection\", would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes (cardinality) of sets. That is, they are schematic diagrams generally not drawn to scale.\nVenn diagrams are similar to Euler diagrams. However, a Venn diagram for \"n\" component sets must contain all 2\"n\" hypothetically possible zones, that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion in each of the component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram, the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents \"dairy products\" and another \"cheeses\", the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context \"cheese\" means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone\u2014there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.\nThe difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:\nThe Euler and the Venn diagram of those sets are:\nExtensions to higher numbers of sets.\nVenn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a simplex and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a tesseract (or the cells of a 16-cell, respectively).\nFor higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find \"symmetrical figures\u00a0... elegant in themselves,\" that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an \"elegant\" four-set diagram using ellipses (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for \"any\" number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.\nEdwards\u2013Venn diagrams.\nAnthony William Fairbank Edwards constructed a series of Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting the surface of a sphere, which became known as Edwards\u2013Venn diagrams. For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (\"x\"\u00a0=\u00a00, \"y\"\u00a0=\u00a00 and \"z\"\u00a0=\u00a00). A fourth set can be added to the representation, by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane, to give \"cogwheel\" diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth\u2014as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a stained-glass window in memory of Venn.\nOther diagrams.\nEdwards\u2013Venn diagrams are topologically equivalent to diagrams devised by Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum, which were based around intersecting polygons with increasing numbers of sides. They are also two-dimensional representations of hypercubes.\nHenry John Stephen Smith devised similar \"n\"-set diagrams using sine curves with the series of equations\nformula_4\nCharles Lutwidge Dodgson (also known as Lewis Carroll) devised a five-set diagram known as Carroll's square. Joaquin and Boyles, on the other hand, proposed supplemental rules for the standard Venn diagram, in order to account for certain problem cases. For instance, regarding the issue of representing singular statements, they suggest to consider the Venn diagram circle as a representation of a set of things, and use first-order logic and set theory to treat categorical statements as statements about sets. Additionally, they propose to treat singular statements as statements about set membership. So, for example, to represent the statement \"a is F\" in this retooled Venn diagram, a small letter \"a\" may be placed inside the circle that represents the set F.\nRelated concepts.\nVenn diagrams correspond to truth tables for the propositions formula_5, formula_6, etc., in the sense that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the truth table. This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph's R-diagrams.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot. The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception. There have been 611 films nominated for Best Picture and 97 winners.\nHistory.\nCategory name changes.\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture\", the former being won by the war epic \"Wings\", and the latter by the art film \"\". Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, \"The Jazz Singer\" was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a \"sui generis\" item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the \"Unique and Artistic Picture\" award, deciding retroactively that the award won by \"Wings\" was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award. Although the award kept the title \"Outstanding Picture\" for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years, as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called \"Best Picture\".\nRecipients.\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of \"Shakespeare in Love\" had received the award.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:\nThe rules allow a team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for \"The Reader\". As of 2014[ [update]] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at thirteen, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. During the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer received the most, with five wins and 40 nominations.\nBest Picture and Best Director.\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 97 films that have won Best Picture, 70 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: \"Wings\" directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), \"Grand Hotel\" directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), \"Driving Miss Daisy\" directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), \"Argo\" directed by Ben Affleck (2012), \"Green Book\" directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and \"CODA\" directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for \"Two Arabian Knights\" (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for \"The Divine Lady\" (1928/29).\nNomination limit increased.\nOn June 24, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from 5 to 10, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009). Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of \"The Dark Knight\" and \"WALL-E\" (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture. Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when 8 to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting). In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between 5 and 10; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process. Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\" This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.\nLanguage and country of origin.\nNineteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: \"La Grande Illusion\" (French, 1938); \"Z\" (French, 1969); \"The Emigrants\" (Swedish, 1972); \"Cries and Whispers\" (Swedish, 1973); \"\" (Italian/Spanish, 1995); \"Life Is Beautiful\" (Italian, 1998); \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); \"Amour\" (French, 2012); \"Roma\" (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); \"Parasite\" (Korean, 2019); \"Minari\" (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production); \"Drive My Car\" (Japanese/Korean/Mandarin Chinese/German/Korean Sign Language, 2021), \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (German, 2022), \"Anatomy of a Fall\" (French, 2023), \"Past Lives\" (Korean, 2023, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production), \"The Zone of Interest\" (German/Polish/Yiddish, 2023), \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" (Spanish, 2024), and \"I'm Still Here\" (Portuguese, 2024). \"Parasite\" became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.\nTen films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: \"Hamlet\" (1948), \"Tom Jones\" (1963), \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966), \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981), \"Gandhi\" (1982), \"The Last Emperor\" (1987), \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (2008), and \"The King's Speech\" (2010). The ninth film, \"The Artist\" (2011), was financed in France, and the tenth film, \"Parasite\" (2019), was financed in South Korea.\nRating.\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. \"Oliver!\" is the only G-rated film and \"Midnight Cowboy\" is the only X-rated film (what is categorized as an NC-17 film today), so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been changed to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was \"Patton\" (1970) and the most recent was \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was \"The Last Emperor\" (1987) and the most recent was \"CODA\" (2021). For unrated films, \"A Room with a View\" (1985) is the first film to not be rated by the MPA and be nominated Best Picture, though no unrated films have won Best Picture.\nGenres and mediums.\nThree animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991), \"Up\" (2009), and \"Toy Story 3\" (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\nNo comic book film has won, although three have been nominated: \"Skippy\" (1931), \"Black Panther\" (2018), and \"Joker\" (2019).\nTwo fantasy films have won: \"\" (2003) and \"The Shape of Water\" (2017), although more have been nominated.\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) is the only horror/thriller film to win Best Picture. Six others have been nominated: \"The Exorcist\" (1973), \"Jaws\" (1975), \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999), \"Black Swan\" (2010), \"Get Out\" (2017), and \"The Substance\" (2024).\nSeveral science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" (2022) was the first one to win.\n\"Titanic\" (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including \"Airport\" (1970) and \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974).\nNo documentary has been nominated for Best Picture, although \"\" was nominated in the \"Unique and Artistic Picture\" category at the 1927/28 awards. A Best Documentary Feature category was introduced in 1941.\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including \"Gigi\", \"West Side Story\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"Oliver!\", and \"Chicago\".\nSeveral epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient \"Wings\". Others include \"Cimarron\", \"Cavalcade\", \"Gone with the Wind\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Ben-Hur\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Patton\", \"The Godfather\", \"The Godfather Part II\", \"Gandhi\", \"The Last Emperor\", \"Dances With Wolves\", \"Schindler's List\", \"Forrest Gump\", \"Braveheart\", \"The English Patient\", \"Titanic\", \"Gladiator\", \"\", and \"Oppenheimer\".\nSeveral war films have been nominated for Best Picture, with \"Wings\", \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"From Here to Eternity\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Patton\", \"Platoon\" and \"The Hurt Locker\" being some of the many winners.\nSequel nominations and winners.\nTen films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, \"Going My Way\"), \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990), ' (2002), ' (2003), \"Toy Story 3\" (2010), ' (2015)\", \" (2022), ' (2022), and \"\" (2024).\n\"Toy Story 3\", \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", and \"Top Gun: Maverick\" are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. \"The Godfather Part II\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. \"The Godfather\" series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.\nAnother nominee, \"Broadway Melody of 1936\", was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner \"The Broadway Melody\", but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" was adapted from the sequel novel to \"Red Dragon\". The latter had been adapted for film as \"Manhunter\" by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series. Conversely, 2024's \"Wicked\" uses iconography and characters who appeared in 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz\" and other \"Oz\" films, but is not a direct prequel to any film. \n\"The Lion in Winter\" features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film \"Becket\", but \"The Lion in Winter\" is not a sequel to \"Becket\". Similarly, \"The Queen\" features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film \"The Deal\". Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described \"The Queen\" as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.\nClint Eastwood's \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" was a companion piece to his film \"Flags of Our Fathers\" that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\nIn addition, \"Black Panther\" is a continuation of the events that occurred in \"\" and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nRemake nominations and winners.\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects.\n\"Ben-Hur\", which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the and both were adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel \"\". \"The Departed\", which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film \"Infernal Affairs\" and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win.\nOther nominees include 1963's \"Cleopatra\" about the titular last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018's \"A Star is Born\" following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019's \"Little Women\" following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel. \"True Grit\", which was nominated for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis's 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name.\nFour of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: \"CODA\", \"Dune\", \"Nightmare Alley\", and \"West Side Story\". The 2021 version of \"West Side Story\" became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962's \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". For that same ceremony, \"CODA\" became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win.\nThe 2022 German-language \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.\nSilent film winners.\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film \"Wings\".\n\"The Artist\" (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since \"Wings\" to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's \"The Patriot\" and the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's \"The Apartment\". (\"Schindler's List\", the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)\nVersion availability.\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as \"Tom Jones\" (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and \"Star Wars\", are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. \"The Broadway Melody\" originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.\nThe 1928 film \"The Patriot\" is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant). \"The Racket\", also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies. The only surviving complete prints of 1931's \"East Lynne\" and 1934's \"The White Parade\" exist within the UCLA film archive.\nDiversity standards.\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\", called Academy Aperture 2025, which a film is now required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023. There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development. As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\". The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nThese standards only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories. For the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.\n2016 ceremony mistake.\nAt the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, presenter Faye Dunaway read \"La La Land\" as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in \"La La Land\". While accepting the award, \"La La Land\" producer Jordan Horowitz, who was given the correct envelope, realized the mistake and announced that \"Moonlight\" had won the award.\nCriticisms and controversies.\n\"High Noon\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\".\nIn 2013, the selection of \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" rather than \"High Noon\" at the 25th Academy Awards was listed by \"Time\" among the 10 most controversial Best Picture races. Retrospectively, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" has been considered by some to be one of the worst Best Picture winners in history.\nDiversity criticisms.\nIn general, the awardees of that category have been criticized for disproportionately recognizing films about white men over those of women or non-white people. In opposition, the Academy's decision to favor Best Picture winning films with depiction of race relations among people of color\u2014most primarily \"Driving Miss Daisy\", \"Crash\", and \"Green Book\", all of which were directed by white filmmakers\u2014led to significant backlash over racism against the Academy.\nIn 2005, \"Brokeback Mountain\" losing the Best Picture to \"Crash\" was heavily criticized, with some critics such as Kenneth Turan accusing the Academy members of homophobia and benefitting from making a non-groundbreaking choice in \"Crash\", considered as one of the most notable Oscars upsets. After announcing the award, presenter Jack Nicholson was caught on camera mouthing the word \"whoa\" out of apparent surprise at the result. The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic, since many saw it as the \"safe\" alternative to \"Brokeback Mountain\", which is about a gay relationship (the other nominees, \"Good Night, and Good Luck\", \"Capote\", and \"Munich\" also tackle heavy subjects of McCarthyism, homosexuality, and terrorism, respectively).\nThough there have been exceptions like Barry Jenkins's \"Moonlight\", films like \"Precious\" and \"Get Out\" have been seen as potentially being shut out of the Best Picture race because of older and white Academy voters choosing not to see them. From 2018 onwards, the Academy made an effort to add more younger, female, non-white, and non-American voters, and to create a non-voting \"emeritus\" status for people who had not worked in the film industry after a certain length of time, in order to diversify and rejuvenate their voter bloc.\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Shakespeare in Love\".\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" was immediately pegged as a favorite for the category by many members and fans of Spielberg's films, but it lost to \"Shakespeare in Love.\" The Academy's decision was widely criticized. The choice was seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history, and led to DreamWorks executives (including Terry Press) and many industry pundits accusing Miramax Films and one of the \"Shakespeare in Love\" producers, Harvey Weinstein, of winning due to their award campaign's negative messaging against \"Saving Private Ryan\" rather than their own film's merits. Press stated that Weinstein and Miramax \"tried to get everybody to believe that \"Saving Private Ryan\" was all in the first 15 minutes\".\nAnimated films in Best Picture category.\nThe category of Best Animated Feature was created for the 74th Academy Awards to ensure the recognition of animated films; prior to its creation, the only animated film ever nominated for Best Picture was 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast.\" However, the award has since received criticism on the grounds that it discourages animated films from being eligible to win Best Picture. While the Academy rules allow for a film to be nominated in both categories, only two animated films (\"Up\" and \"Toy Story 3\") have been nominated for Best Picture since the creation of the two categories.\nA prominent example was the 2001 film \"Shrek;\" DreamWorks and producer Jeffrey Katzenberg campaigned heavily for the film to be awarded Best Picture, but it was not nominated in the category despite receiving nominations for a Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy, PGA Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, BAFTA Award for Best Film, and Critics' Choice Awards for Best Picture (and was the first animated film nominated in the latter three categories). Similarly, the 2008 film \"WALL-E\" received many accolades and garnered speculation that it might be nominated for Best Picture, but it was instead nominated for six categories, tying with \"Beauty and the Beast\" as the most nominated animated films in Oscar history, and won the award for Best Animated Feature Film. Other animated films that garnered Best Picture speculation but were ultimately not nominated include \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\", \"The Boy and the Heron\", and \"\" with the former two films winning Best Animated Feature Film at back-to-back ceremonies.\n\"Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close\" nomination.\nCritics and audiences criticized \"Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close\"'s nomination for Best Picture, with some calling the film one of the worst Best Picture nominees ever. Chris Krapek of \"The Huffington Post\" wrote very negatively about the film's nomination, calling the film \"not only the worst reviewed Best Picture nominee of the last 10 years, [but] easily the worst film of 2011\". \"Paste\" Magazine's Adam Vitcavage called the film's consensus for a Best Picture nominee \"certainly the worst for at least 28 years\", and David Gritten of \"The Telegraph\" called the nomination \"mysterious\".\n\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" nomination.\nThe nomination of \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" for Best Picture, among other categories, was heavily criticized. Critics took issue with the film's portrayal of trans characters, and its portrayal of Mexican culture, including director Jacques Audiard's claims about the Spanish language being \"a language of developing countries, it's a language of countries of few means, of poor people, of migrants.\"\nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the titular role, accused the team of fellow Best Picture nominee \"I'm Still Here\" (as well as its lead, fellow Best Actress nominee Fernanda Torres) of running a smear campaign against her and \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\", which is explicitly against AMPAS's rules of campaigning. The accusations were found to be baseless and itself perceived as an attempt to smear Torres's and \"I'm Still Here\"'s reputation. As attention grew around Gasc\u00f3n, a series of tweets in which she made several bigoted comments, of racist and islamophobic nature, were unearthed by Canadian journalist Sarah Hagi. The majority of Oscar pundits agreed that they marked the end of \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\"'s, the year's most nominated film, chances of winning Best Picture.\nWinners and nominees.\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees. Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, but it may be the year after first release (as with \"Casablanca\" and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, \"Crash\" and \"The Hurt Locker\"). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of \"Shakespeare in Love\" made speeches after its win. A three-producer limit has been applied some years since. There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of \"Crash\" and \"Little Miss Sunshine\". The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for \"The Reader\". However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2022.\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\nSince 2023, the category's winners and nominees from the 1927/28 and 1928/29 ceremonies have entered the public domain.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0indicates the winner\n1920s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1930s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1940s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1950s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1960s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1970s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1980s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1990s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIndividuals with multiple wins.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIndividuals with multiple nominations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction companies and distributors with multiple nominations and wins.\nColumbia Pictures and United Artists have the most wins with 12, while 20th Century Fox has the most nominations with 64.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61703", "revid": "27417341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61703", "title": "Boustrophedon", "text": "Form of writing, left-to-right and right-to-left in alternate lines\nBoustrophedon ( ) is a style of writing in which alternate lines of writing are reversed, with letters also written in reverse, mirror-style. This is in contrast to modern European languages, where lines always begin on the same side, usually the left.\nThe original term comes from , a composite of , \"ox\"; , \"turn\"; and the adverbial suffix , \"like, in the manner of\"\u2014that is, \"like the ox turns [while plowing]\". It is mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. It was a common way of writing on stone in ancient Greece, becoming less and less popular throughout the Hellenistic period. Many ancient scripts, such as Etruscan, Safaitic, and Sabaean, were frequently or even typically written boustrophedon.\nReverse boustrophedon.\nThe wooden boards and other incised artefacts of Rapa Nui bear a boustrophedonic script called Rongorongo, which remains undeciphered. In Rongorongo, the text in alternate lines was rotated 180 degrees rather than mirrored; this is termed \"reverse boustrophedon.\"\nThe reader begins at the bottom left-hand corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line from left to right again. When reading one line, the lines above and below it appear upside down. The writing continues onto the second side of the tablet at the point where it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, the second will start at the \"upper\" left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom. Larger tablets and staves may have been read without turning if readers could read upside-down.\nThe Hungarian folklorist Sebesty\u00e9n Gyula writes that ancient boustrophedon writing resembles the Hungarian rov\u00e1s-sticks of Old Hungarian script made by shepherds. A notcher would hold the wooden stick in their left hand, cutting the letters with their right hand from right to left. When the first side was complete, they would flip the stick over vertically and start to notch the opposite side in the same manner. When unfolded horizontally (as in the case of the stone-cut boustrophedon inscriptions), the result is writing that starts from right to left and continues from left to right in the next row, with letters turned upside down. Sebesty\u00e9n suggests that the ancient boustrophedon writings were copied from such wooden sticks with cut letters, applied for epigraphic inscriptions (not recognizing the real meaning of the original wooden type).\nExample of Hieroglyphic Luwian.\nThe Luwian language had a version, Hieroglyphic Luwian, that is read in boustrophedon style (most of the language was written down in cuneiform).\nHieroglyphic Luwian is read boustrophedonically, with the direction of any individual line pointing into the front of the animals or body parts constituting certain hieroglyphs. While Egyptian hieroglyphs' numerous ideograms and logograms show directionality, the lineal direction of the text in hieroglyphic Luwian is harder to see.\nOther examples.\nA modern example of boustrophedonics is the numbering scheme of sections within survey townships in the United States and Canada. In both countries, survey townships are divided into a 6-by-6 grid of 36 sections. In the U.S. Public Land Survey System, Section 1 of a township is in the northeast corner, and the numbering proceeds boustrophedonically until Section 36 is reached in the southeast corner. Canada's Dominion Land Survey also uses boustrophedonic numbering, but starts at the southeast corner. Following a similar scheme, street numbering in the United Kingdom sometimes proceeds serially in one direction then turns back in the other (the same numbering method is used in some mainland European cities). This is in contrast to the more common method of odd and even numbers on opposite sides of the street both increasing in the same direction.\nThe Avoiuli script used on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is written boustrophedonically by design.\nThe Indus script, though still undeciphered, can be written boustrophedonically.\nAnother example is the boustrophedon transform, known in mathematics.\nSources also indicate that Linear A may have been written left-to-right, right-to-left, and in boustrophedon fashion.\nPermanent human teeth are numbered in a boustrophedonic sequence in the American Universal Numbering System.\nMarilyn Aronberg Lavin adopted the term to describe a type of narrative direction a mural painting cycle may take: \"The boustrophedon is found on the surface of single walls [\"linear\"] as well on one or more opposing walls [\"aerial\"] of a given sanctuary. The narrative reads on several tiers, first from left to right, then reversing from right to left, or vice versa.\"\nIn digital file compression for spatial data, the GRIB2 compression algorithm packs values \"boustrophedonically to make 'consecutive' values more redundant.\"\nIn constructed languages.\nThe constructed language Ithkuil uses a boustrophedon script.\nThe Atlantean language created by Marc Okrand for Disney's 2001 film \"\" is written in boustrophedon to recreate the feeling of flowing water.\nThe code language used in \"The Montmaray Journals\", Kernetin, is written boustrophedonically. It is a combination of Cornish and Latin and is used for secret communication.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien wrote that many elves were ambidextrous and would write left-to-right or right-to-left as needed.\nIn the \"Green Star\" novels by Lin Carter, the script of the Laonese people is written in boustrophedon style.\nRousseau.\nTo make it easier to read from one musical staff to another, and avoid \"jumping the eye\", Jean-Jacques Rousseau envisioned a \"boustrophedon\" notation. This requires the writer to write the second staff from right to left, then the next one from left to right, etc. The words are reversed in every other line.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than tall. Small shrubs, less than tall are sometimes termed as subshrubs.\nSome define a shrub as less than and a tree as over 6 m tall. Others use as the cutoff point for classification. Many trees do not reach this mature height because of hostile, less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble shrub-sized plants. Others in such species have the potential to grow taller in ideal conditions. Some only last about five years in good conditions. Others, usually larger and more woody, live beyond 70 years. On average, they die after eight years.\nShrubland is the natural landscape dominated by various shrubs; there are many distinct types around the world, including fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland. In gardens and parks, an area largely dedicated to shrubs (now somewhat less fashionable than a century ago) is called a shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden. There are many garden cultivars of shrubs, bred for flowering, for example rhododendrons, and sometimes even leaf colour or shape.\nApart from the several berry-bearing shrub species (using the culinary rather than botanical definition), few are eaten directly, and they are generally too small for much timber use unlike trees. Those that are used include several perfumed species such as lavender and rose, and a wide range of plants with medicinal uses. Tea and coffee are on the tree-shrub boundary; they are normally harvested from shrub-sized plants, but these would be large enough to become small trees if left to grow instead.\nDefinition.\nShrubs are perennial woody plants, and therefore have persistent woody stems above ground (compare with succulent stems of herbaceous plants). Usually, shrubs are distinguished from trees by their height and multiple stems. Some shrubs are deciduous (e.g. hawthorn) and others evergreen (e.g. holly). Ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastus divided the plant world into trees, shrubs and herbs. Small, low shrubs, generally less than tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of rose, are often termed as subshrubs.\nMost definitions characterize shrubs as possessing multiple stems with no main trunk below. This is because the stems have branched below ground level. There are exceptions to this, with some shrubs having main trunks, but these tend to be very short and divide into multiple stems close to ground level without a reasonable length beforehand. Many trees can grow in multiple stemmed forms also while being tall enough to be trees, such as oak or ash.\nEvolution and adaptive value of growth form.\nEcologists and evolutionary biologists have paid little attention to why there are two major growth forms of woody plants; shrubs and trees, both occurring on large land area, and often together. While the time when the first shrubs appeared on the Earth is difficult to establish, hypotheses explaining the adaptive value of having multiple stems, compared to a single one in trees, exist. One model is based on the advantages of having many stems, with larger total stem area for photosynthesis (on, and under bark), larger area of cambium and phloem, and larger area for sprouting from stems, compared to a (small) tree with same initial woody volume. This model could successfully predict faster shrub growh than tree growth at early stages. Other advantages for shrubs (compared to trees) include for instance extra stems in case one die, and faster seed production. It is not surprising that at least angiosperm trees, if cut or broken, revert to shrub growth form for fast growth (due to their capacity of sprouting at the base, and thus becoming shrub-like for some time). \nMany shrubs, such as \"Salix\" species, have good dispersal ability (seeds disperse by air) and many shrubs are also able to grow in more extreme habitats, such as alpine areas, where trees are less common. The last decades have seen 'shrubification' in the arctic, with marked increase of shrublands. One reason is increased temperature, with consequences for plant community structure and carbon balance. \nUse in gardens and parks.\nAn area of cultivated shrubs in a park or a garden is known as a shrubbery. When clipped as topiary, suitable species or varieties of shrubs develop dense foliage and many small leafy branches growing close together. Many shrubs respond well to renewal pruning, in which hard cutting back to a \"stool\", removes everything but vital parts of the plant, resulting in long new stems known as \"canes\". Other shrubs respond better to selective pruning to dead or unhealthy, or otherwise unattractive parts to reveal their structure and character.\nShrubs in common garden practice are generally considered broad-leaved plants, though some smaller conifers such as mountain pine and common juniper are also shrubby in structure. Species that grow into a shrubby habit may be either deciduous or evergreen.\nBotanical structure.\nIn botany and ecology, a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical canopy structure or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than high and usually multiple stems arising at or near the surface of the ground.

He was then the bassist of Megadeth from 1983 to their breakup in 2002, and again from 2010 to 2021.\nEllefson co-founded the hard rock band the Lucid in 2021 alongside vocalist Vinnie Dombroski (Sponge), guitarist Drew Fortier (formerly of Bang Tango), and drummer Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy, Raven). In addition to playing bass guitar in Megadeth and the Lucid, Ellefson had various side projects, which include Temple of Brutality, F5, Killing Machine, and Metal Allegiance, and he is also the current bassist of Metal Church.\nBiography.\nEllefson is of Norwegian ancestry.\nPre-Megadeth.\nEllefson played in a band called Killers, which featured himself on bass, Greg Handevidt on guitar, Brett Frederickson on drums and Jerry Giefer, during Frederickson's senior year of high school.\nFirst tenure with Megadeth and initial departure (1983\u20132002).\nOther than guitarist, vocalist, and primary lyricist Dave Mustaine, Ellefson was the only constant member of Megadeth from early in the band's history in 1983 until the group's dissolution in 2002. Ellefson has maintained that he was a founding member of the band, though Mustaine has disputed the idea in multiple interviews. Mustaine referred to Ellefson as \"Dave Junior\", which was often shortened to \"Junior\" after vocalist Lor Kane used the nickname to differentiate between the two Daves. Ellefson appeared on every album and tour from 1985's record \"Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!\" up until 2002's \"Rude Awakening.\" Mustaine reformed Megadeth without Ellefson in 2004. In the early days of Megadeth, Ellefson played using his fingers, but as Megadeth progressed and the music became more complex, he tended to prefer playing with a pick, or plectrum. Ellefson was credited with some Megadeth songs, including \"Family Tree\" from 1994's \"Youthanasia\" (in the 2004 remastered collection of the CD, however, the track is credited to Mustaine, Ellefson, Friedman, Menza, but Mustaine credited the \"Rust in Peace\"-era line-up with the entire \"Youthanasia\" album as a tribute to the band's success at the time of the record's initial release).\nPost-Megadeth career and return (2002\u20132010).\nEllefson formed F5 following Megadeth's 2002 disbandment. The band featured Ellefson on bass, Dale Steele on vocals, Steve Conley on lead guitar, John Davis on rhythm guitar, and former Megadeth bandmate Jimmy DeGrasso on drums. Their first album, \"A Drug for all Seasons\", was released in 2005. F5 appeared in support for Disturbed in February 2006 and toured the American Mid-West in the summer of 2006. Ellefson also appeared on the new Killing Machine record \"Metalmorphosis\" in 2006 alongside DeGrasso; he has also been working with Temple of Brutality. Ellefson is currently a member of the melodic power metal band Avian, which features singer Lance King. He commented in an interview with Alternative-Zine.com that \"Megadeth was really just a starting point for me, creatively\". Ellefson played five tracks for the Soulfly album \"Prophecy\" and also played on one track on \"Dark Ages\". He also worked with underground emcee/Record producer Necro for his album entitled \"Death Rap\".\nEllefson is also a member of a cover band called Hail!. Ellefson, DeGrasso (Mike Portnoy for 2010), Tim \"Ripper\" Owens and Andreas Kisser formed the band in late 2008. The band was, as of April 2009, touring Europe. Ellefson participated in the Christmas Rock project Northern Light Orchestra, he performed bass on many of the 17 tracks produced by rock drummer Ken Mary and also at the live show Christmas in April Orpheum Theatre, Phoenix, Arizona.\nIn February 2010, Ellefson received a text message from Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover, saying \"if ever there was a time for you and Dave [Mustaine] to talk, now is it\". Ellefson was invited to rehearse with the band. After the phone call, the news was released that Ellefson would return to the Megadeth lineup. Ellefson was quoted saying \"it felt like I never left\" after their first rehearsal together.\nSecond tenure with Megadeth and departure (2010\u20132021).\nIn 2013, Ellefson announced that his autobiography, entitled \"My Life with Deth\", would be issued by American publisher Howard Books. The memoir was co-written with author Joel McIver, and features a foreword by Alice Cooper.\nIn 2018, it was announced that Ellefson had begun work on \"More Life with Deth\", the follow-up to his 2013 memoir \"My Life with Deth\", to be co-written with Ellefson's business partner, and frequent collaborator, Thom Hazaert. The book was released on July 16, 2019, by UK based Jawbone Press, and features contributions from Alice Cooper, K.K. Downing of Judas Priest, Dan Donegan of Disturbed, Brian Welch of Korn, Mark Slaughter, Ron Keel, Jason McMaster of Dangerous Toys, Frank Bello of Anthrax, Chris Adler (Lamb of God, ex-Megadeth), Mark Tremonti of Creed and Alter Bridge, Kiko Loureiro and Dirk Verbeuren of Megadeth, actor Kristian Nairn (\"Game of Thrones\"), and more, plus a foreword by \"My Life with Deth\" co-author, and \"Bass Player Magazine\" editor Joel McIver.\nIn late 2018, he confirmed he was considered for the role of Metallica bassist twice: in 1986, after Cliff Burton was killed in a bus accident, and again in 2002 when bassist Jason Newsted left the band a year earlier. He was not included in the documentary \"\" showing musicians auditioning for the band, however, and after Newsted's departure the position was ultimately filled by Robert Trujillo (former Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Ozzy Osbourne). In 2019, Ellefson said since he rejoined Megadeth, he is a salaried member as opposed to being an \"equal owner\" with Mustaine in order to retain their friendship.\nIn 2019 Ellefson was inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame, he has since joined the Hall of Fames board of directors.\nOn May 24, 2021, Dave Mustaine released a statement on behalf of the band that David Ellefson had once again parted ways with Megadeth, following allegations of sexual misconduct with an underage fan. Ellefson denied any wrongdoing, and the other party denied being underage and said explicit videos were released without her consent. On June 17, 2021, Dave Mustaine announced in his weekly Gimme Radio show that he intended to hire a new bassist to rerecord Ellefson's bass tracks for Megadeth's 2022 album \"The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!\" Ellefson's parts were overdubbed by Steve Di Giorgio of Testament. Former Megadeth bassist James LoMenzo, who Ellefson replaced in 2010, would rejoin Megadeth in 2022 as Ellefson's full-time replacement.\nPost Megadeth projects (2021\u2013present).\nFollowing his departure from Megadeth, Ellefson formed a new band named The Lucid. With Ellefson on bass, the band also consists of drummer Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy), guitarist Drew Fortier, and vocalist Vinnie Dombroski (Sponge, Spys4Darwin). Between September and October 2021, the band released three singles; \"Maggot Wind\", \"Damned\", and \"Hair\". Their self-titled debut, \"The Lucid\", was released on October 15, 2021.\nIn January 2023, the Lucid released their sophomore effort, a five-track EP titled \"Saddle Up and Ride\". The EP includes a guest performance from Insane Clown Posse vocalist Violent J on the title track as well as a cover of Faith No More's \"Epic\" retitled as \"Sweet Toof\". Between December 2022 and January 2023, four singles from the EP were released; \"Saddle Up and Ride\", \"Mumps\", \"Risk Machine\", and \"Sweet Toof\".\nIn 2022, Ellefson formed the death metal band Dieth with Guilherme Miranda on guitar and vocals and Micha\u0142 \u0141ysejko on drums. The band released their first single, \"In the Hall of the Hanging Serpents\", on July 13, 2022. The band released three more singles and their first album \"To Hell and Back\" in 2023. Song \"Walk With Me Forever\" from the same album marks Ellefson's first time in his career singing lead vocals.\nIn 2022, Ellefson formed the band Kings Of Thrash with former Megadeth guitarist Jeff Young. The band plays songs from the first three studio albums of Megadeth live (and sometimes Mustaine-penned Metallica tunes, such as \"Jump In The Fire\"). They had former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland as a guest on their \"The MEGA Years\" tour in 2022. In February 2023, the group also played shows with an early guitarist for Megadeth, Greg Handevidt.\nIn April 2024, Ellefson filled in for bassist D.D. Verni on Overkill's Latin American tour when Verni was unable to perform as he was recovering from shoulder surgery.\nOn November 21, 2025, it was announced that Ellefson has joined Metal Church as their new bassist and performed on the band's upcoming fourteenth studio album that is set for release in 2026.\nOther ventures.\nEllefson Music Productions \u2013 EMP Label Group.\nIn October 2015 it was announced that Ellefson had launched a record label and production company, Ellefson Music Productions, also known as EMP Label Group, and would release \"In Your Face\", the debut EP from Phoenix-based all-girl pop punk group Doll Skin (which Ellefson also produced), in conjunction with Megaforce Records in North America, and Cargo Records in Europe. The EP was released October 30 in North America, and December 18 in Europe, and re-released as an LP titled in Your Face (Again) in March 2016 via eOne Distribution. The singles from the LP received airplay on many prominent stations in the US and Europe, including Rodney Bingenheimer's weekly show on influential LA Rock station KROQ.\nSince forming in 2015, EMP Label Group has secured distribution from eOne in North America and SPV in Europe, with the roster spread among several imprints including EMP Label Group (Ellefson Music Productions in Europe) and EMP Underground. Ellefson also appears on a recurring segment \"Mandatory Megadeth\" on Hazaert's Dash Radio show. In January 2017, Ellefson opened Ellefson Coffee Co. in his hometown, Jackson, Minn.\nEllefson Films.\nIn May 2019 Ellefson along with business partner Thom Hazaert formed Ellefson Films and are producing the upcoming found footage horror film Dwellers; written, directed by, and starring Drew Fortier with James L. Edwards and Douglas Esper co-starring. On top of producing the project, Ellefson and Hazaert will also be appearing in the film as featured cameos.\nA 50 second teaser trailer for the film was released in August 2019.\nEllefson Films held a Q&amp;A panel at Rue Morgue's annual Frightmare in the Falls horror convention to speak about Dwellers, which is intended to be released in 2020 through film festival showings eventually leading to digital and physical distribution. During the panel Ellefson along with Drew Fortier revealed that Dwellers is a gritty found footage horror film with the story being told as a documentary gone severely wrong drawing influences from such films as \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999) and \"C.H.U.D.\" (1984) \nIn November 2019, the full trailer for Dwellers was released.\nThe film was released October 12, 2021.\nThe Ellefson Book Co..\nIn November 2020 Ellefson announced that he had completed a fiction thriller novel titled \"Rock Star Hitman\" co-written with Drew Fortier to be released via his book imprint The Ellefson Book Co in December 2020. It was revealed on the Decibel Geek Podcast in an interview with Ellefson and Fortier that an album very loosely tying into \"Rock Star Hitman\" recorded with Vinnie Dombroski from Sponge on vocals, Mike Heller from Fear Factory on drums, Drew Fortier on guitar, and Ellefson on bass would be released in 2021 under the name Lucid.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and children.\nEllefson and his wife, Julie, were married in 1993. They have a son and a daughter. He resides in Scottsdale, Arizona.\nFeud with Mustaine.\nMustaine intended to release a solo album in 2004, which would become \"The System Has Failed\", although due to contractual obligations, Mustaine released it under the Megadeth name. Ellefson and Mustaine had a severe legal disagreement over royalties and rights to Megadeth's name and back catalog, resulting in Ellefson filing an unsuccessful lawsuit. Though the two once enjoyed a close friendship, considerable animosity developed between Ellefson and Mustaine during this period to the point that on Ellefson's website, Megadeth was not mentioned in his biography, only in the discography.\nIn a mid-2005 podcast, Ellefson did not mention his past with Megadeth at all, instead concentrating on discussing his current projects. Mustaine felt Ellefson was unfairly using the Megadeth name when advertising an amplifier for Peavey. Mustaine claims to have had dinner with Ellefson around Christmas in 2005 to talk things through; this got them on good terms, as Mustaine has stated that they spoke on the phone numerous times afterward. In 2010 Mustaine and Ellefson agreed to keep any unresolved issues in the past and were working on building and maintaining their friendship again. Since this time Ellefson has gone on to say that he feels \"that having that time away created a realization for both of us that, while we are both productive individually, Megadeth is definitely stronger with both of us in it together.\"\nEllefson's dismissal from Megadeth in 2021 spurred renewed tensions with Mustaine, with the pair frequently attacking each other in interviews. Ellefson accused Mustaine of \u201cnot having his back\u201d when the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced, while Mustaine has downplayed Ellefson's contributions to Megadeth and denied he was a founding member of the band.\nChristianity.\nEllefson, like his ex-bandmate Dave Mustaine, is a committed Christian. \"Well, I was actually brought up in a Christian household, so I have, you know, a pretty broad knowledge of it; [I had] strayed from it for quite a while, [but] now that I have children, I actually do go to church, so I've kinda sorta returned to it, you know?\" Ellefson further discussed his Christianity in a 2010 interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast explaining \"I've found that when you just suit up and show up and walk your talk instead of talking your talk all the time, that is often the best testimony!\"\nIn an article titled CODA \u2013 Ready for a MEGA Life, Ellefson indicated that in the fall of 2007 he began the new MEGA Life Ministries worship service in Scottsdale, AZ. \"Oddly, the service has become one of my most rewarding and musically invigorating gigs I've ever had... a gig that literally landed in my lap and not something I had to chase down either. Not only are the parishioners respectful (no bar fights, spilled drinks and foul mouthed hecklers in the crowd like many secular gigs) but it's a musical event my whole family participates in. Plus, I was finally given the venue to put into practical application the very words I'd been trying to live by for many years which is 'Play music for God, not us'.\" Ellefson began studying for the ministry in the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod through an extension program of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis.\nControversy.\nOn May 10, 2021, videos of Ellefson masturbating were posted on Twitter. The videos, recorded in 2020 by a fan that Ellefson was in correspondence with, initially led to accusations of child grooming. However, Ellefson and the other party both denied the accusations and stated that it was consensual adult conduct. An official statement released the next day from Megadeth stated that the situation was being \"watched closely\". On May 24, 2021, Dave Mustaine released a statement stating that, in light of the recent allegations and an already strained relationship, Megadeth had officially parted ways with Ellefson again.\nOn May 26, 2021, Ellefson released the following statement: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Recently, a very private video was illegally posted on the internet and false allegations were made against me. The actions in the video were between two consenting adults and were recorded without my knowledge. I am working with Scottsdale Police Department in their investigation into charges regarding revenge pornography to be filed against the person who posted this video. Also, my lawyers are preparing a defamation lawsuit to be filed against this person. This person will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I am taking this time to be with my family. I wish my bandmates the best with their upcoming tour.\nEquipment.\nAfter rejoining Megadeth in early 2010, Ellefson started using his old Jackson Custom and Concert bass guitars and Hartke amps again.\nHe used an LH1000 with two HX810s on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour. He has since moved onto using the Kilo amplifier. In early 2011, Jackson released a Dave Ellefson Concert and Kellybird signature model, both in 4-string and 5-string variants. According to providence website, Ellefson has used or is still using the Dual Bass Station. Ellefson formerly used Peavey amps and his Peavey Zodiac DE Scorpio 4-string signature bass. In the early days of Megadeth, Ellefson, along with Dave Mustaine, primarily used B.C. Rich instruments, most notably Ironbird and Mockingbird basses, the latter of which he has still been known to periodically bring out on occasion.\nEllefson plays exclusively with a guitar pick, as he is unable to perform in fingerstyle the fast tempos and palm-muting in many Megadeth songs. Ellefson shifted exclusively to pick playing since \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\", after recording their debut effort with a mix of fingerstyle and playing with a pick.\nDiscography.\nWith Megadeth\nSolo releases\nWith Ellefson\nWith the Lucid\nWith Dieth\nWith Ellefson \"ES\" Soto\nGuest appearances\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature word play including puns, adventurous rhyme, and heavy alliteration. Nonsense poetry is often considered light verse, as well as some poems that employ parody or satire. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as doggerel or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned \"serious\" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.\nHistory.\n19th Century.\nLord Byron's poem \"Beppo\" is an early and notable instance of light poetry in the 19th century, though other writers like Winthrop Mackworth Praed, Frederick Locker-Lampson, C.

It is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region, the fourth-most populous city in Japan (with a 2025 population of 2.3million), and the principal city of the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area, which is itself the third-most populous metropolitan area in Japan (with a population of 10.11million). Nagoya is located on the Pacific coast in central Honshu, and its seaport is the largest in Japan.\nIn 1610, the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. The early 1900s brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in the city during the Meiji Restoration, and it became a major industrial hub for the country as the area's automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished; the traditional manufacturing of bicycles, sewing machines, and timepieces was thus followed by the production of ceramic, chemicals, oil, petrochemicals, and steel. These factors made Nagoya a target of American air raids during the Pacific War.\nNagoya's economy diversified following the Second World War, but the city remains a significant centre of industry and transport in Japan. It is linked to Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto by the Tokaido Shinkansen and is home to the Nagoya Stock Exchange, as well as the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others. It hosts educational institutes such as Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. Famous landmarks include Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Hisaya \u014cdori Park, Nagoya Castle, Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, and Nagoya TV Tower. Nagoya will host the 2026 Asian Games, making it the third Japanese city to do so after Tokyo in 1958 and Hiroshima in 1994.\nToponymy.\nThe city's name was historically written as or (both read as \"Nagoya\"). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'calm'.\nThe name , consisting of \"ch\u016b\" (middle) + \"ky\u014d\" (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn the Jomon and Yayoi period, the \u014cguruwa Shell Midden was discovered before the settlement of Nagoya. In the Kofun period, Nagoya was settled and the Danpusan Kofun and Shiratori Kofun was built in this area. The Atsuta Shrine is of ancient origin, it is home to the Imperial Regalia of Japan, the legendary sword \"Kusanagi no Tsurugi\". According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in 113 AD. The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home.\nThe Seigan-ji was built by the Fujiwara clan in the late Heian period. A member served as the head priest of the nearby Atsuta Shrine, one of the legendary shrines of Japan. It is believed that Yura-Gozen, also known as Urahime, a daughter of Fujiwara no Suenori, was married to Minamoto no Yoshitomo (1123\u201360) and their son Minamoto no Yoritomo's birthplace is Nagoya, he is also the founder of the Kamakura shogunate.\nFeudal period.\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nEarly modern period.\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\nModern period.\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on 1 September 1956, by government ordinance. Nagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\".\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\nNagoya was the target of air raids during the Pacific War. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within Nagoya. Others, notably 240 and 1833, were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during the war.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued to the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command's attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. \nNagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945, followed by the Yokkaichi bombing in June 1945.

Nagoya was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. \nThe human-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nNagoya's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\nClimate.\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfa\") with hot, humid summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, with rain falling throughout the year.\nArea.\nWards.\nNagoya has 16 wards.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents.

Almost every feudal lord had his own \"oniwa-yaki\", also to have gifts made. \nIn the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware.

{"id": "61722", "revid": "30911873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61722", "title": "Shikoku", "text": "Island and region of Japan\n is the smallest of the four main islands of Japan. It is long and between wide. It has a population of 3.8\u00a0million, the least populated of Japan's four main islands. It is south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. Shikoku's ancient names include , , and , and its current name refers to the four former provinces that make up the island: Awa, Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo.\nGeography.\nShikoku Island, comprising Shikoku and its surrounding islands, covers about and consists of four prefectures: Ehime, Kagawa, K\u014dchi, and Tokushima. Across the Seto Inland Sea lie Wakayama, Osaka, Hy\u014dgo, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi Prefectures on Honshu. To the west lie \u014cita and Miyazaki Prefectures on Kyushu.\nShikoku is ranked as the 50th largest island by area in the world. Additionally, it is ranked as the 23rd most populated island in the world, with a population density of 193 inhabitants per square kilometre (500/sq mi).\nMountains running east and west divide Shikoku into a narrow northern subregion, fronting on the Seto Inland Sea, and a southern part facing the Pacific Ocean. The \"Hydrangea hirta\" species can be found in these mountain ranges. Most of the 3.8\u00a0million inhabitants live in the north, and all but one of the island's few larger cities are located there. Mount Ishizuchi () in Ehime at is the highest mountain on the island. Industry is moderately well developed and includes the processing of ores from the important Besshi copper mine. Land is used intensively. Wide alluvial areas, especially in the eastern part of the zone, are planted with rice and subsequently are double-cropped with winter wheat and barley. Fruit is grown throughout the northern area in great variety, including citrus fruits, persimmons, peaches, and grapes. Because of wheat production, Sanuki udon () became an important part of the diet in Kagawa Prefecture (formerly Sanuki Province) in the Edo period.\nThe larger southern area of Shikoku is mountainous and sparsely populated. The only significant lowland is a small alluvial plain at K\u014dchi, the prefectural capital. The area's mild winters stimulated some truck farming, specializing in growing out-of-season vegetables under plastic covering. Two crops of rice can be cultivated annually in the southern area. The pulp and paper industry took advantage of the abundant forests and hydroelectric power.\nThe major river in Shikoku is the Yoshino River. It runs from its source close to Mount Ishizuchi, flowing basically west to east across the northern boundaries of K\u014dchi and Tokushima Prefectures, reaching the sea at the city of Tokushima. The Yoshino is famous for Japan's best white-water rafting, with trips going along the Oboke Koboke sections of the river.\nShikoku has four important capes: Gam\u014dda in Anan, Tokushima on the easternmost point on the island, Sada in Ikata, Ehime on the westernmost point. Muroto in Muroto, K\u014dchi and Ashizuri, the southern extreme of Shikoku, in Tosashimizu, K\u014dchi, jut into the Pacific Ocean. The island's northernmost point is in Takamatsu.\nUnlike the other three major islands of Japan, Shikoku has no active volcanoes, and is the largest of Japan's islands to completely lack them. But Shikoku did experience volcanic activity in the distant prehistoric past; a major volcanic caldera in the area of Mount Ishizuchi was active during the Miocene around 14\u00a0million years ago and the small volcanic cone of Mount Iino at an unknown date.\nPopulation.\nShikoku has a total population of 3,630,320 in 2022. The largest city is Matsuyama (population: 507,137) and is the capital of Ehime Prefecture. Shikoku is the main island with the third largest population density, at .\nCapital cities of four prefectures of Shikoku\nPer Japanese census data, and, Shikoku region's peak population was at 1950 and has had negative population growth from 1950 to 1970 and 1990 onward.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nSociety and architecture.\nShikoku has historically been quite isolated and therefore it has kept the original characteristics of Japan for a longer period, especially in regards to vegetation and some architectural techniques. There are many Buddhist temples.\nThe \"lost\" Shikoku has been described by an American writer, Alex Kerr, who lived in a remote mountain village near Oboke (\u5927\u6b69\u5371) for many years from 1970 onwards.\nAshizuri-Uwakai National Park is located in the south-west part of Shikoku.\nTraditions.\nShikoku is also famous for its 88-temple pilgrimage of temples. The pilgrimage was established by the Heian-period Buddhist priest K\u016bkai, a native of present-day Zents\u016bji-cho in Kagawa prefecture. According to legend, K\u016bkai still appears to pilgrims today. Most modern-day pilgrims travel by bus, rarely choosing the old-fashioned method of going by foot. They are seen wearing white jackets emblazoned with the characters reading \"d\u014dgy\u014d ninin\" () meaning \"two traveling together\".\nTokushima Prefecture also has its annual Awa Odori running in August at the time of the Obon festival, which attracts thousands of tourists each year from all over Japan and from abroad.\nK\u014dchi Prefecture is home to the first annual Yosakoi festival. The largest festival in K\u014dchi, it takes place in August every year and attracts dancers and tourists from all over Japan.\nFood.\nOne of the major foods of Shikoku is udon. Udon is often served hot as a noodle soup in its simplest form, as \"kake udon\", in a mildly flavoured broth called \"kakejiru,\" which is made of dashi, soy sauce (sh\u014dyu), and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or \"kakiage\" (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or \"aburaage\", a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added. Shichimi can be added to taste. Another specialty is K\u014dchi's signature dish, seared bonito.\nThe warm climate of Shikoku lends itself to the cultivation of citrus fruits. As a result, yuzu, mikan and other citrus fruits are plentiful on Shikoku and have become synonymous with the regions they are grown in.\nMovements.\nPioneering natural farmer Masanobu Fukuoka, author of \"The One-Straw Revolution\", developed his methods here on his family's farm.\nSports.\nHistorically no Shikoku-based sports team has competed in the top Japanese division of baseball, football (soccer) or even rugby union. However, Tokushima Vortis have had two spells in the top flight of Japanese soccer (J1) in 2014 and 2021. Currently the major teams competing in Shikoku's major cities include:\nNotable sportspeople.\nTwo time darts Women's World Champion Mikuru Suzuki is a native of Takamatsu in Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku.\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nShikoku is connected to Honshu by three expressways, which together form the Honsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project.\nThe eastern gateway to Shikoku, Naruto in Tokushima Prefecture has been linked to the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway since 1998. This line connects Shikoku to the Kansai area which has a large population, including the large conurbations of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. Therefore, the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway carries a large traffic volume. Many highway buses are operated between Kansai and Tokushima Prefecture.\nThe central part of Shikoku is connected to Honshu by ferry, air, and \u2013 since 1988 \u2013 by the Great Seto Bridge network. Until completion of the bridges, the region was isolated from the rest of Japan. The freer movement between Honshu and Shikoku was expected to promote economic development on both sides of the bridges, which has not materialized yet.\nWithin the island, a web of expressways and national highways connects the major population centers. These include K\u014dchi Expressway, Matsuyama Expressway, Takamatsu Expressway, Tokushima Expressway, Routes 11, 32, 33, 55, and 56. \nRail.\nThe Shikoku Railway Company (JR Shikoku) serves the island and connects to Honshu via the Great Seto Bridge. JR lines include:\nPrivate railway lines operate in each of the four prefectures on Shikoku.\nAir travel.\nShikoku lacks a full international airport but has four regional/domestic airports (Tokushima Airport, Takamatsu Airport, K\u014dchi Ry\u014dma Airport and Matsuyama Airport). All of these airports have flights to Tokyo and other major Japanese cities such as Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, and Fukuoka. International flights to Seoul, South Korea are serviced by Asiana Airlines from Matsuyama and Takamatsu. There are periodic international charter flights as well.\nSea Travel\nFerries link Shikoku to destinations including Honshu, Kyushu, and islands around Shikoku.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a wide, classical definition, it encompasses nine prefectures (\"ken\"): Aichi, Fukui, Gifu, Ishikawa, Nagano, Niigata, Shizuoka, Toyama, and Yamanashi.\nIt is located directly between the Kant\u014d region and the Kansai region and includes the major city of Nagoya as well as Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan coastlines, extensive mountain resorts, and Mount Fuji.\nThe region is the widest part of Honsh\u016b and the central part is characterized by high, rugged mountains. The Japanese Alps divide the country into the Pacific side, sunny in winter, and the Sea of Japan side, snowy in winter.\nAlthough Mie is part of Kinki/Kansai/Western Japan in traditional geographical regional divisions, Northern Mie is part of the metropolitan area around Nagoya, and Mie is in many practical contexts considered to be part of T\u014dkai/Ch\u016bbu/Central Japan. Including Mie, Ch\u016bbu had a population of 23,010,276 as of 1 June 2019.\nOther definitions.\nIn the MLIT of the central government, the jurisdiction of the Ch\u016bbu regional development bureau (\u4e2d\u90e8\u5730\u65b9\u6574\u5099\u5c40, \"Ch\u016bbu-chih\u014d seibi-kyoku\"; ) extends to five prefectures: Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie and the Southern part of Nagano.\nIn the National Police Agency, the Ch\u016bbu Regional Police Bureau (\u4e2d\u90e8\u7ba1\u533a\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40, \"Ch\u016bbu kanku keisatsu-kyoku\"; ) is responsible for six prefectural police forces: Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Gifu, Aichi and Mie.\nIn local government, the Ch\u016bbu area governors' association (\u4e2d\u90e8\u570f\u77e5\u4e8b\u4f1a, \"Ch\u016bbuken chijikai\") unites the governors of Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie and Shiga and the mayor of Nagoya City in Aichi.\nGeography.\nLocated in the center of the Japanese archipelago. It refers to the area between the Kanto, Tohoku and Kansai regions. It began to be used in the late Meiji era as a tentative name for unclassified areas. In a broad sense, it often refers to the eight regional divisions and similar ranges. In a narrow sense it may refer to a range similar to the T\u014dkai region.\nThe terrain is mainly rugged and mountainous except for the N\u014dbi Plain and coastal areas. The steep Japanese Alps rise in the central area. It is located between Tokyo and Osaka, which are the east\u2013west centers of the Japanese economy and culture. Thus the Chubu region has various differences between the eastern side and the western side.\nSubregions.\nThe Ch\u016bbu region covers a large and geographically diverse area of Honsh\u016b which leads to it generally being divided into three distinct subregions: T\u014dkai, K\u014dshin'etsu, and Hokuriku. There is also another subregion occasionally referred to in business circles called Ch\u016bky\u014d.\nT\u014dkai.\nThe T\u014dkai region, mostly bordering the Pacific Ocean, is a narrow corridor interrupted in places by mountains that descend into the sea.\nSince the Tokugawa period (1600\u20131867), this corridor has been critical in linking Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. One of old Japan's most important ancient roadways, the T\u014dkaid\u014d, ran through it connecting Tokyo (at that time called Edo) and Kyoto, the old imperial capital. In the twentieth century, it became the route for new super-express highways and high-speed railroad lines (shinkansen). The area consists of Aichi, Mie, Shizuoka, and southern Gifu prefectures.\nA number of small alluvial plains are found in the corridor section. A mild climate, favorable location relatively close to the great metropolitan complexes, and availability of fast transportation have made this area a center for truck-gardening and out-of-season vegetables. Upland areas of rolling hills are extensively given over to the growing of mandarin oranges and tea. Nagoya, which faces Ise Bay, is a center for heavy industry, including iron and steel and machinery manufacturing. The corridor also has a number of small but important industrial centers. The western part of T\u014dkai includes the N\u014dbi Plain, where rice was being grown by the seventh century.\nCh\u016bky\u014d.\nThe three T\u014dkai prefectures centered on Nagoya (Aichi, Gifu, and Mie) have particularly strong economic ties, and the parts of these prefectures that are closest to the city comprise the Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area. This area boasts the third strongest economy in Japan and this influence can sometimes extend into the more remote parts of these prefectures that are farther away from Nagoya. Thus, these three prefectures are sometimes called the \"Ch\u016bky\u014d region\" in a business sense. This name does not see widespread usage throughout Japan; however, as the economy in the area strengthens, this name may become more well-known country-wide.\nK\u014dshin'etsu.\nK\u014dshin'etsu is an area of complex and high rugged mountains\u2014often called the \"roof of Japan\"\u2014that include the Japanese Alps. The population is chiefly concentrated in six elevated basins connected by narrow valleys. It was long a main silk-producing area, although output declined after World War II. Much of the labor formerly required in silk production was absorbed by the district's diversified manufacturing industry, which included precision instruments, machinery, textiles, food processing, and other light manufacturing. K\u014dshin'etsu means Yamanashi, Nagano, and Niigata prefectures; Niigata is also included to the Hokuriku region. Yamanashi, Nagano and northern Gifu Prefecture are sometimes referred to as Ch\u016b\u014d-k\u014dchi or T\u014dsan region.\nHokuriku.\nThe Hokuriku region lies on the Sea of Japan coastline, northwest of the massive mountains that comprise K\u014dshin'etsu. Hokuriku includes the four prefectures of Ishikawa, Fukui, most of Niigata and Toyama,\nThe district has very heavy snowfall (sometimes enough to block major roads) and strong winds in winter, and its turbulent rivers are the source of abundant hydroelectric power. Niigata Prefecture is the site of domestic gas and oil production as well. Industrial development is extensive, especially in the cities in Niigata and Toyama; Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures also have large manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Hokuriku's development is owed to markets in the Kansai region, however recently the urban areas at the heart of the Kant\u014d region and T\u014dkai region are having a heavy an influence as well. Hokuriku has port facilities which are mainly to facilitate trade with Russia, Korea and China. Transportation between Niigata and Toyama used to be geographically limited and so Niigata has seen especially strong influence from the Kant\u014d region, because of this Niigata Prefecture is often classified as being part of the K\u014dshin'etsu region with Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures.\nTransport.\nThe region's largest airport is Chubu Centrair International Airport which provides most domestic and international destinations, it is located south of Nagoya. There are also smaller airports across the region including Niigata Airport, Komatsu Airport, and Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport.\nDemographics.\nThe three most dense areas of Ch\u016bbu region are Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area (greater Nagoya), Niigata-Toyama area at Hokuriku subregion, and Nagano at the mountains (Ch\u016b\u014d-k\u014dchi).\nPer Japanese census data, and, Ch\u016bbu region has had positive population growth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor cities.\nCapital cities of the nine prefectures of Ch\u016bbu\nOther cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its population is estimated 915,691 as of 1 August 2023 and its geographic area is 11,637 km2 (4,493 sq mi). Akita Prefecture is bordered by Aomori Prefecture to the north, Iwate Prefecture to the east, Miyagi Prefecture to the southeast, and Yamagata Prefecture to the south.\nAkita is the capital and largest city of Akita Prefecture. Other major cities include Yokote, Daisen, and Yurihonj\u014d. Akita Prefecture is located on the coast of the Sea of Japan and extends east to the \u014cu Mountains, the longest mountain range in Japan, at the border with Iwate Prefecture. Akita Prefecture formed the northern half of the historic Dewa Province with Yamagata Prefecture.\nHistory.\nThe region of Akita was created from the ancient provinces of Dewa and Mutsu.\nSeparated from the principal Japanese centres of commerce, politics, and population by several hundred kilometres and by the \u014cu and Dewa mountain ranges to the east, Akita remained largely isolated from Japanese society until after the year 600. Akita was a region of hunter-gatherers and principally nomadic tribes.\nThe first historical record of what is now Akita Prefecture dates to 658, when Abe no Hirafu conquered the native Ezo tribes at what are now the cities of Akita and Noshiro. Abe, then governor of Koshi Province (the northwestern part of Honsh\u016b bordering the Sea of Japan), established a fort on the Mogami River, and thus began the Japanese settlement of the region.\nIn 733, a new military settlement (later renamed Akita Castle) was built in what is now the Takashimizu area of Akita, and more permanent roads and structures were developed. The region was used as a base of operations for the Japanese empire as it drove the native Ezo people from northern Honsh\u016b.\nGovernance of the region shifted hands several times. During the Tokugawa shogunate it was appropriated to the Satake clan, who ruled the region for 260 years and developed the agriculture and mining industries that are still predominant today. Throughout this period, it was classified as part of Dewa Province. In 1871, during the Meiji Restoration, Dewa Province was reshaped and the old daimy\u014d domains were abolished and administratively reconstructed, resulting in the modern-day borders of Akita.\nThe famous Heian period waka poet, Ono no Komachi, is said to have been born in Yuzawa City, Ogachi Town, located in the southeast of the prefecture.\nGeography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLocated on the north-western side of Honshu, Akita Prefecture is adjacent to the Sea of Japan to the west and borders four other prefectures: Aomori in the north, Iwate in the east, Miyagi in the southeast, and Yamagata in the south.\nThe borders of Akita Prefecture roughly form a rectangle that is 169 kilometres (105 miles) from north to south and 86 kilometres (54 miles) from west to east. The Oga Peninsula is a prominent feature of the western edge, while the \u014cu Mountains mark the eastern border and the higher Dewa Mountains run parallel through the center. Like much of northern Japan, the prefecture has cold winters, particularly in areas farther from the sea.\nAs of 31 March 2019, 11% of the total land area of the prefecture is designated as Natural Parks, namely the Towada-Hachimantai National Park; Ch\u014dkai, Kurikoma, and Oga Quasi-National Parks; and Akita Shirakami, Hachimori Iwadate, Kimimachizaka, Magi Mahiru, Moriyoshizan, Taiheizan, Tashirodake, and Tazawako Dakigaeri Prefectural Natural Parks.\nCities.\nThirteen cities are located in Akita Prefecture:\nTowns and villages.\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\nEconomy and population.\nLike much of the T\u014dhoku Region, Akita's economy remains dominated by traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing, and forestry. This has led many young people to migrate to Tokyo and other large cities. Akita Prefecture has seen some of the most severe population decline in Japan: it is one of four prefectures in Japan registering declines in population since 1955. Its population also has the lowest percentage of children (defined as under the age of 15), at 9.3% in 2022, down from 11.2% in 2010. 38.6% of residents are 65 or older, the highest percentage of any Japanese prefecture. As of October 1, 2022, it has an estimated population of 944,902 people.\nThe high rate of depopulation in Akita Prefecture has led smaller communities to merge with each other, which has affected the smallest of these merged communities. As depopulation in these communities continues, educational and health facilities have closed in some areas, encouraging families to migrate to larger cities for better access to health and educational opportunities and perpetuating the decline in population. This decline, combined with an aging population, has been concerning for rural communities.\nCulture.\nAkita, \u79cb\u7530, meaning autumn rice paddy, is famous for rice farming and its sake breweries. It is well known for having the highest consumption of sake in Japan and is thought to be the origin of the Akita breed of dog which carries the prefecture's name. The women of the region, referred to as , have also gained widespread renown for their white skin, rounded faces and high voices, all of which are considered highly desirable. Ono no Komachi is a famous example of an \"Akita bijin\".\nFood.\nAkita is known for the following regional specialties (tokusanhin):\nTourism.\nRecently there have been efforts to revitalize rural communities facing depopulation with different forms of green tourism and agritourism. These efforts are primarily aimed at attracting urbanites and foreign tourists to Akita Prefecture, advertising its pristine forests, sprawling rice fields, and range of cultures. There has been a push for home stays, farmers markets for locally produced foods, and the integration of outsiders into local cultural practices. The Namahage ritual in Oga on New Year's Eve draws a large number of tourists to Akita Prefecture every year.\nNear Lake Tazawa, there are a number of hot springs resorts (\"onsen\"). These are popular with tourists from all over Japan. In addition, numerous seasonal festivals (\"matsuri\") offer a glimpse of rural or traditional Japan. Some famous examples are the Akita Kant\u014d, the Omagari Fireworks, Namahage Festival, and the Yokote Kamakura Festivals.\nKakunodate, known as the little Kyoto, features many preserved samurai houses. The Aoyagi house is the former residence of Odano Naotake, who illustrated Japan's first modern guide to human anatomy. The house is now a museum and gallery of medical illustrations and traditional crafts.\nStarting in 2009, Akita began experiencing a huge surge in Korean tourism after the airing of the popular drama \"Iris\", which featured several scenes shot in Akita, most notably at Lake Tazawa and Oga's GAO Aquarium.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "61730", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61730", "title": "Aomori", "text": ", officially Aomori City (, ), is the capital city of Aomori Prefecture, in the T\u014dhoku region of Japan. As of 2023[ [update]], the city had an estimated population of 264,945 in 136,781 households, and a population density of 321 people per square kilometer spread over the city's total area of . Aomori is one of Japan's 62 core cities and the core of the Aomori metropolitan area.\nEtymology.\nThe original name of the Aomori was Ut\u014d, named for the , a seabird that is closely related to the puffin. In 1626 the name was changed to , but this was not fully embraced until 1783.\n\"Aomori\" literally means blue forest, although it could possibly be translated as \"green forest\". The name is generally considered to refer to a small forest on a hill which existed near the town. This forest was often used by fishermen as a landmark. A different theory suggests the name might have been derived from the Ainu language.\nHistory.\nPre-Tokugawa Period.\nThe area has been settled extensively since prehistoric times, and numerous J\u014dmon period sites have been found by archaeologists, the most famous being the Sannai-Maruyama Site located just southwest of the city center dating to 5500\u20134000\u00a0BC, and the Komakino Site slightly farther south dating to around 4000\u00a0BC. The large scale of these settlements revolutionized theories on J\u014dmon period civilization. \nLater History.\nDuring the Heian period, the area was part of the holdings of the Northern Fujiwara clan, but remained inhabited by the Emishi people well into the historic period. After the fall of the Northern Fujiwara in the Kamakura period, the territory was part of the domain assigned to the Nambu clan, and into the Sengoku period, it came under the control of the rival Tsugaru clan, whose main castle was located in Namioka. After the start of the Edo period, what would become the core of present-day Aomori was a minor port settlement in the Hirosaki Domain called . The town was rebuilt in 1626 under orders of the \"daimy\u014d\", Tsugaru Nobuhira and renamed \"Aomori\", but this name did not come into common use until after 1783; however, the historical accuracy of this claim is debated since there is no written material from the time to definitively connect Ut\u014d to Aomori. Some evidence even claims that Aomori and Ut\u014d co-existed in different parts of the city in its current state. It was not until 1909 that a local scholar claimed that the village of Ut\u014d became Aomori.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, the feudal domains were abolished and replaced with prefectures, of which a total of six were initially created in the territory of modern Aomori Prefecture. These were merged into the short-lived Hirosaki Prefecture in July 1871. However, due to the historic enmity between the former Tsugaru territories in the west and the former Nambu territories in the east, the prefectural capital was relocated from Hirosaki to the more centrally located Aomori immediately after the merger and the prefecture was renamed Aomori Prefecture on 23 September 1871. However, the municipality of Aomori was not given town status within Higashitsugaru District until 1 April 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was later designated as a city on 1 April 1898.\nThe Hokkaid\u014d Colonization Office began operations of a ferry service from Aomori to Hakodate in Hokkaido from 1872. In September 1891, Aomori was connected with Tokyo by rail with the opening of the T\u014dhoku Main Line. The \u014cu Main Line running along the Sea of Japan coast opened in December 1894. The development of modern Aomori was primarily due to its prefectural capital status and the singular importance as the terminus of these rail lines and the Seikan Ferry, which officially opened in 1908. The 8th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army were stationed in Aomori from 1896. In the winter of 1902, 199 of 210 soldiers on a military cold-weather readiness exercise perished while attempting to cross the Hakk\u014dda Mountains from Aomori to Towada in what was later called the Hakk\u014dda Mountains incident.\nMuch of the town burned down in a large fire on 3 May 1910. The port facilities were expanded in 1924, and the city received its first bus services in 1926. Japan Air Transport began scheduled air services from 1937.\nTowards the final stages of World War II, on the night of 28\u201329 July 1945, Aomori was subject to an air raid as part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States against military and civilian targets and population centers during the Japan home islands campaign. The 28\u201329 July bombing claimed 1,767 lives and destroyed 88% of the city.\nIn the post-war period, Aomori was rebuilt as the local political and commercial center. The Tsugaru Line railway opened between Aomori Station and Kanita Station in 1951. Aomori Airport was opened in 1964 in nearby Namioka. The city was connected to Tokyo by highway in 1979 with the opening of the T\u014dhoku Expressway. Construction began on a new airport within the city of Aomori in 1982. Aomori's landmark pyramidal Aomori Prefecture Tourist Center opened in 1986. The new airport was completed on 19 July 1987. On 1 October 2002, Aomori was proclaimed a core city, granting it an increased level of local autonomy.\nOn 1 April 2005, Aomori absorbed the town of Namioka to create the new and expanded city of Aomori; but lost a portion of Namioka to the town of Fujisaki (from Minamitsugaru District) on 1 September 2007.\nGeography.\nAomori is located in central Aomori Prefecture, the northernmost prefecture of Honshu. It is located in the northeastern part of the Tsugaru region, which refers to the western half of the prefecture, and is centered on Aomori Plain, facing Aomori Bay, a branch bay of Mutsu Bay, to the north, and the Hakk\u014dda and Higashidake Mountains, which are the northern end of the \u014cu Mountains to the south to the east. Among other smaller rivers, the city has two large rivers flowing through it, the Komagome River and its tributary, the Arakawa River. Parts of the city in the southeast are within the borders of Towada-Hachimantai National Park and is a tourist destination throughout the four seasons. In the northeast is Asamushi-Natsudomari Prefectural Natural Park. There are many hot springs in the city, including Sukayu Onsen at the foot of Mt. Hakk\u014dda and Asamushi Onsen on the coast.\nSurrounding municipalities.\nAomori Prefecture\nClimate.\nLike most of the T\u014dhoku region, Aomori has a humid temperate climate with warm summers, and cold, though not extreme, winters. The city has a cold, humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\") closely bordering the Humid Subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\") using the isotherm with both January and February monthly averages being too cold to be of the latter, characterized by warm, short summers and long, cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Aomori is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .\nAomori and the surrounding areas are known for having the heaviest snowfall in the world. In 2016, AccuWeather ranked Aomori City as the snowiest city in the world. In February 1945, the city recorded a maximum snow cover of , but the record low of was recorded 14 years earlier. In contrast, Sapporo's heaviest snowfall which occurred in 1939 was , and Wakkanai which is located further north has recorded similar maxima. The particularly heavy snow is caused by several winds that collide around the city and make the air rise and cool, resulting in quick, thick cloud formation followed by intense precipitation.\nIn summer, a cool wind called \"Yamase\" often blows from the east, which sometimes results in abnormally cool weather and poor harvests. Additionally, thick fogs from the Oyashio Current are often observed in mountainous areas in the summer. Due to this fog, flights to Aomori Airport are often cancelled.\nDemographics.\nA person living in or from Aomori is referred to as an Aomorian. Per Japanese census data, the population of Aomori has remained relatively steady over the past 40 years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nAomori has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 35 members. The city also contributes 10 members of the 48 member Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city falls within the Aomori 1st district, a single-member constituency of the House of Representatives in the national Diet of Japan, which also includes the city of Mutsu, the Higashitsugaru District, the Shimokita District, and the northern half of the Kamikita District.\nEconomy.\nAomori serves as the regional commercial center for central Aomori Prefecture. Agriculture and commercial fishing form only 4% of the city economy, with manufacturing forming 16.2% and the service sector forming 78.2%.\nEducation.\nAomori is the only prefectural capital in Japan which has no national university, instead, nearby Hirosaki became the site for the prefecture's highest educational facility. The city has 45 public elementary schools and 19 public junior high schools operated by the city government, as well as two private junior high schools. The city has 10 public high schools operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education and three private high schools. The prefecture also operates eight special education schools for the handicapped.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nRailways.\nAomori Station has been the main station of the city since 1891. The two trunk lines of the T\u014dhoku region, the T\u014dhoku Main Line (now the Aoimori Railway) and the \u014cu Main Line, terminated at Aomori Station and continued to Hakodate by the Seikan Ferry. In 1988, Seikan Tunnel replaced the ferry's role as the connector of Honshu and Hokkaido's rail networks, but the station still functioned as the connecting point between main line trains and trains for the Aomori-Hakodate section.\nThe T\u014dhoku Shinkansen opened in 2010 with a new terminal at Shin-Aomori Station. The Shinkansen provides high-speed service between Shin-Aomori, Hachinohe, Morioka, Sendai and Tokyo.\n East Japan Railway Company (JR East) \u2013 T\u014dhoku Shinkansen \n JR East \u2013 \u014cu Main Line\n JR East \u2013 Tsugaru Line\n Aoimori Railway Line\nSports.\nAomori has hosted several international curling events, two in 2003 (including the Asian Winter Games), and the local women's \"Team Aomori\" was selected to represent Japan at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italyhttps:// and at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. From 17 to 25 March 2007, Aomori hosted the World Women's Curling Championshipshttps://.\nParks and recreation.\nGappo Park is Aomori's oldest public park and its most iconic green space. Located to the east of the center of the city, it contains a public beach, water gardens, various ornamental trees, and the Aomori City Baseball Stadium. Other parks in the city include the centrally located Aoimori Park,Aoimori Central Park, and Nogiwa Park.\nLocal attractions.\nAomori Nebuta Matsuri is a famous festival performed from 2\u20137 August annually and is listed as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. Besides this, major attractions of Aomori include ruins, museums, and mountains. The Hakk\u014dda Mountains have good locations for trekking with hot spas (\"onsen\"), such as Sukayu Onsen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prefecture's capital, largest city, and namesake is the city of Aomori. Aomori is the northernmost prefecture on Japan's main island, Honshu, and is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, Iwate Prefecture to the southeast, Akita Prefecture to the southwest, the Sea of Japan to the west, and Hokkaido across the Tsugaru Strait to the north. Aomori Prefecture is the eighth-largest prefecture, with an area of , and the 31st-most populous prefecture, with more than 1.18\u00a0million people. Mount Iwaki, an active stratovolcano, is the prefecture's highest point, at .\nHumans have inhabited the prefecture for at least 15,000 years, and the oldest evidence of pottery in Japan was discovered at the J\u014dmon period \u014cdai Yamamoto I Site. After centuries of rule by the Nanbu and Tsugaru clans, the prefecture was formed out of the northern part of Mutsu Province during the Meiji Restoration in the 19th century. The entire T\u014dhoku region, including Aomori Prefecture, experienced significant growth in population and economy until the late 20th century, when a significant population decline began. Though the prefecture remains dominated by primary sector industries, especially apple orchards, it also serves as a transportation and logistics hub due to its location. Additionally, it is the largest producer of black garlic in Japan. Tourism is also a significant part of the prefecture's economy, especially due to the J\u014dmon Prehistoric Sites in Northern Japan and Shirakami-Sanchi World Heritage Sites.\nAomori Prefecture has a distinctive subculture influenced by its distant location relative to the central government of Japan and the region's long, snowy winters. It is the birthplace of the traditional \"Tsugaru-jamisen\", a local version of the three-stringed musical instrument known as \"shamisen\". Embroidery, pottery, lacquerware, cabinetry, and iron working are also significant crafts in the prefecture. Various porridges and soups are distinctive to Aomori Prefecture. Several festivals are held in Aomori Prefecture; the most noted of which is Aomori Nebuta Matsuri. Aomori Prefecture is home to several association football, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey teams. The prefecture's religious beliefs are heavily rooted in Shinto and Buddhism; it is noted for its blind mediums and purported tomb of Jesus.\nHistory.\n literally means 'blue forest', although it could possibly be translated as 'green forest'. The name most likely refers to a small forest on a hill which existed near Aomori City, which was often used by fishermen as a landmark.\nJ\u014dmon period.\nThe J\u014dmon period is the time between c.\u200914,000 and 300 BCE, during which Japan was inhabited by the J\u014dmon people, a diverse hunter-gatherer and early agriculturalist population. The oldest evidence of pottery in Japan was found at the \u014cdai Yamamoto I Site in the town of Sotogahama in the northwestern part of the prefecture. The relics found there suggest that the J\u014dmon period began about 15,000 years ago. By 7,000 BCE, fishing cultures had developed along the shores of the prefecture. Around 3,900 BCE, settlement at the Sannai-Maruyama Site in the present-day city of Aomori began. The settlement shows evidence of wide interaction between the site's inhabitants and people from across J\u014dmon period Japan, including Hokkaido and Kyushu. The settlement of Sannai-Maruyama ended around 2,300 BCE for unknown reasons. Its abandonment was likely due to the population's subsistence economy being unable to result in sustained growth, with its end being spurred on by the reduced amount of natural resources during a neoglaciation. The J\u014dmon period continued up to 300 BCE in present-day Aomori Prefecture at the Kamegaoka site in the city of Tsugaru where small statuettes called \"Shak\u014dkidog\u016b\" have been found.\nYayoi period to Heian period.\nThe Yayoi period, c.\u2009300 BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009300 AD, is one of the major historical periods of the Japanese archipelago. It is generally defined as the era between the beginning of food production in Japan and the emergence of keyhole-shaped burial mounds. During this time, the area that would become Aomori Prefecture was impacted by the migration of settlers from continental Asia, though to a lesser extent than the rest of Honshu. The region, known then as Michinoku, was inhabited by the Emishi. It is not clear if the Emishi were the descendants of the J\u014dmon people, a group of the Ainu people, or if both the Ainu and Emishi were descended from the J\u014dmon people. The northernmost tribe of the Emishi that inhabited what would become Aomori Prefecture was known as the Tsugaru. Historic records mention a series of destructive eruptions in 917 from the volcano at Lake Towada. The eruptive activity peaked on August 17. The Heian period, c.\u2009794 and 1185, was characterized by centralized government influenced by China. Throughout this period, the Emishi were slowly subdued by the Imperial Court in Kyoto before being incorporated into Mutsu Province by the Northern Fujiwara around 1094. The Northern Fujiwara continued to rule the T\u014dhoku region until 1189. Mutsu Province was a large province that was later broken into Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, and Aomori Prefectures and the municipalities of Kazuno and Kosaka in Akita Prefecture.\nThe Northern Fujiwara set up the port settlement of Tosaminato in present-day Goshogawara to develop trade between their lands, Kyoto, and continental Asia. The Northern Fujiwara were deposed in 1189 by Minamoto no Yoritomo, who would go on to establish the Kamakura shogunate, which is known for the emergence of the samurai, the warrior caste, and for the establishment of feudalism in Japan.\nKamakura period.\nThe Kamakura period is a phase that marks the governance by the Kamakura shogunate between c.\u20091185 and 1333. \nMinamoto no Yoritomo incorporated Mutsu Province into the holdings of the Kamakura shogunate. Nanbu Mitsuyuki, founder of the Nanbu clan, was awarded vast estates in Nukanobu District after he had joined Minamoto no Yoritomo at the Battle of Ishibashiyama in 1180 and the conquest of the Northern Fujiwara. \nNanbu Mitsuyuki built Sh\u014djujidate Castle in what is now Nanbu, Aomori. The eastern area of the current prefecture was dominated by horse ranches, and the Nanbu grew powerful and wealthy on the supply of warhorses. These horse ranches were fortified stockades, numbered one through nine (Ichinohe through Kunohe), and were awarded to the six sons of Nanbu Mitsuyuki, forming the six main branches of the Nanbu clan. The northwestern part of the prefecture was awarded to the And\u014d clan for their role in driving the Northern Fujiwara out of Tosaminato. The port was expanded under the rule of the And\u014d clan and they traded heavily with the Ainu in Ezo. Conflict would break out between the Ainu and the And\u014d clan in 1268 and again in the 1320s. The conflict ended after the Nanbu intervened at the behest of the shogunate. The conflict weakened the Kamakura shogunate in its later years. The And\u014d became split into northern (And\u014d) and southern (Akita) divisions.\nMuromachi period.\nThe Muromachi period, c.\u20091336\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091573, saw the rise of the Muromachi or Ashikaga shogunate and \"Onmy\u014dji\", practitioners of astronomy and divination, into high governmental positions. At the onset of the Ashikaga shogunate, the Nanbu and And\u014d continued to rule the area, with the Nanbu controlling the current prefecture's southeastern section and the And\u014d controlling the Shimokita and Tsugaru peninsulas. The And\u014d also were involved with controlling the fringes of Ezo, splitting their attention. In 1336, the And\u014d completed construction of Horikoshi Castle during the Northern and Southern Courts period. During the Muromachi, the Nanbu slowly began edging the And\u014d out of present-day Aomori Prefecture. The And\u014d were pushed out of Tosaminato in 1432, retreating to Ezo, giving the Nanbu control over all their lands. The port settlement would fall into disrepair under the Nanbu.\nSengoku period.\nThe Sengoku period of the 15th and 16th centuries is an era in which civil wars and social upheavals took place almost continuously, similar to the Early Middle Ages in Europe. During the Sengoku period, the Nanbu clan collapsed into several rival factions. One faction under \u014cura Tamenobu asserted their control over the Hirosaki Domain. His clan, originally the , was of uncertain origins. According to later Tsugaru clan records, the clan was descended from the noble Fujiwara clan and had an accent claim to ownership of the Tsugaru region on the Tsugaru Peninsula and the area surrounding Mount Iwaki in the northwestern corner of Mutsu Province; however, according to the records of their rivals, the Nanbu clan, clan progenitor \u014cura Tamenobu was born as either Nanbu Tamenobu or Kuji Tamenobu, from a minor branch house of the Nanbu and was driven from the clan due to discord with his elder brother. \nIn any event, the \u014cura were hereditary under the Nanbu clan's local magistrate Ishikawa Takanobu; however, in 1571, Tamenobu attacked and killed Ishikawa and began taking the Nanbu clan's castles in the Tsugaru region. He captured castles at Ishikawa, Daikoji and Aburakawa, and soon gathered support of many former Nanbu retainers in the region. After pledging fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he was confirmed as an independent warlord in 1590 and changed his name to \"Tsugaru\", formally establishing the Tsugaru clan. Tsugaru Tamenobu assisted Hideyoshi at the Battle of Odawara, and accompanied his retinue to Hizen during the Korean Expedition. Afterwards, he sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.\nEdo period.\nDuring the Edo period, c.\u20091600\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091868, Japan was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and some 300 regional \"daimyo\", or feudal lords. The Edo period was a prolonged era of peace, stability, economic expansion, and urbanizaion. After the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the Nanbu ruled the Shimokita Peninsula and the districts immediately to the south of it. The area to the west of the Nanbu's holdings and to the north of the lands held by the Akita clan were all controlled by the Tsugaru clan, from their capital at Hirosaki. Work on Hirosaki Castle was completed in 1611, replacing Horikoshi Castle as the Tsugaru clan's fortress. By 1631, the Tsugaru clan had solidified their control over their gains made during the Sengoku period. Mutsu Province was struck by the Tenmei famine between 1781 and 1789, due to lower than usual temperatures that were exacerbated by volcanic eruptions at Mount Iwaki, near the Tsugaru clan's capital, Hirosaki, between November 1782 and June 1783.\nAt the beginning of the Edo period, the last pockets of Ainu people in Honshu still lived in the mountainous areas on the peninsulas of the prefecture. They interacted with the ruling clans to some extent, but they primarily lived off of fishing the waters of Mutsu Bay and the Tsugaru Strait. The Tsugaru clan made two big pushes to assimilate the Ainu; the first came in 1756 and the second came in 1809. Records show that the clan was successful in wiping out the Ainu culture in their holdings, though some geographic names in Aomori Prefecture still retain their original Ainu names.\nMeiji Restoration to World War II.\nThe Meiji Restoration in 1868 restored imperial rule to Japan, with Emperor Meiji assuming the throne. Despite the 1867 resignation of the last shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the Boshin War had reached northern Japan by late 1868. On September 20, 1868 the pro-Sh\u014dgunate \u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei was proclaimed at Morioka, the capital of the Nanbu clan who ruled Morioka Domain. The Tsugaru clan first sided with the pro-imperial forces of Satch\u014d Alliance, and attacked nearby Sh\u014dnai Domain. The Tsugaru soon switched course, and briefly became a member of the \u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei. For reasons unclear, the Tsugaru backed out of the alliance and re-joined the imperial cause after a few months. The Nanbu and Tsugaru clans resumed their old rivalry and fought at the Battle of Noheji.\nAs a result of the minor skirmish, the Tsugaru clan was able to prove its defection from the \u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei and loyalty to the imperial cause. Tsugaru forces later joined the imperial army in attacking the Republic of Ezo at the Battle of Hakodate, where the pro-Sh\u014dgunate forces were finally defeated. As a result, the entire clan was able to evade the punitive measures taken by the Meiji government on other northern domains.\nIn 1868, Mutsu Province was broken up into five provinces in the aftermath of the Boshin War, with a new province, Riku\u014d, occupying what would later become Aomori Prefecture and the northwestern corner of Iwate Prefecture. On September 4, 1871, Riku\u014d Province was abolished and divided, establishing today's Aomori Prefecture. Its capital was briefly located in Hirosaki, but it was moved on September to 23, 1871 to the centrally located port village, Aomori City.\nThe prefecture's new capital, Aomori City, saw rapid expansion due to its importance as a logistic hub in northern Japan. It became a town in 1889 and then a city in 1898. The Nippon Railway, a private company, completed the T\u014dhoku Main Line in 1891, linking Aomori to Ueno Station in Tokyo. Despite problems with harsh winters and little previous urban development, this accomplishment was crucial to the rapid population and economic development of the prefecture after the Meiji Restoration.\nOn October 30, 1889, an American merchant ship, \"Cheseborough\", was wrecked off the prefecture's west coast near the village Shariki; many of the ship's crew were saved by the villagers. During a military exercise on January 23, 1902, 199 soldiers died after getting lost during a blizzard in the Hakk\u014dda Mountains disaster. On May 3, 1910, a fire broke out in the Yasukata district. Fanned by strong winds, the fire quickly devastated the whole city. The conflagration claimed 26 lives and injured a further 160 residents. It destroyed 5,246 houses and burnt 19 storage sheds and 157 warehouses. Sabishiro Beach, Misawa was the departure point for Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon when they began the first successful nonstop trans-Pacific flight on October 4, 1931. They landed in East Wenatchee, Washington a little over 41 hours later.\nThroughout much of World War II, the conflict remained distant for the people of Aomori Prefecture. Its ports and railways served to connect Hokkaido to the rest of Japan, chiefly bringing coal from the north to production sites in Japan's more populous areas. This connectivity became a strategic target for the American forces as the war neared its conclusion. American carrier-based aircraft attacked Aomori Prefecture on July 14, 1945, destroying infrastructure across the prefecture, including the Seikan Ferry, naval facilities in Mutsu and Misawa, Hachinohe Airfield, and the ports and railways of Aomori and Hachinohe. At 10:30 p.m. on July 28, 1945, a group of 61 American B-29 bombers bombed the city of Aomori. Despite prior warnings, the estimated civilian impact of the air raid on the city was significant, partly because of threats by the prefecture's governor to cut food rations for those who fled the city. About 90 percent of city structures was destroyed, including 18,000 homes, along with 1,767 people killed and 282 people injured.\n1945 to present.\nDuring the occupation of Japan, Aomori Prefecture's military bases were controlled by the US military. Hachinohe Airfield was occupied until 1950, and was called Camp Haugen. Misawa Air Base was occupied and rebuilt by the United States Army Air Forces; since then the base has been shared by the Japanese military and the US military.\nThe occupation government began an extensive Land Reclamation Policy (LRP) in 1946 aimed at reintegrating the seven million repatriates from Japan's former Asian colonies. This resulted in 269 new villages and 29,612 households on approximately of land in Aomori Prefecture.\nIn March 1985, after 23 years of labor and a financial investment of 690\u00a0billion yen, the Seikan Tunnel finally linked the islands of Honsh\u016b and Hokkaido, thereby becoming the longest tunnel of its kind in the world. Almost exactly three years later, on March 13, railroad service was inaugurated on the Tsugaru Kaikyo Line. The tunnel's opening to rail traffic saw the end of the Seikan Ferry rail service. During their 80 years of service, the Seikan rail ferries sailed between Aomori City and Hakodate some 720,000 times, carrying 160\u00a0million passengers. Ferry service continues to operate between the cities, ferrying automobile traffic and passengers rather than trains. \nOn June 2, 2007, four North Korean defectors reached Aomori Prefecture, after having been at sea for six days, marking the second known case ever where North Korean defectors have successfully reached Japan by boat. This was a family of four who were picked up by the Japan Coast Guard and taken to the port of Fukaura. They were eventually flown to Incheon International Airport in South Korea at their own request.\nOn March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck the east coast of Japan. The southeastern coast of Aomori Prefecture was affected by the resulting tsunami: three people died and one was missing. Buildings along harbors were damaged, with boats thrown about in the streets. Disruptions as result of the earthquake to road and rail networks were widespread throughout the prefecture in the days following the earthquake. The T\u014dhoku Shinkansen rail line was significantly damaged, cutting connectivity from the prefecture to points south along the line until full service was restored in late September.\nDuring the first week of January 2025, a record setting disaster-level snowfall hit Aomori Prefecture, with snow depths as much as . S\u014dichir\u014d Miyashita, the provincial governor, called this snowfall a \"disaster\" and invoked the Disaster Relief Act, the first time the prefecture had done so in 13 years. At least 4 people died as a result of the snowfall. This snowfall did massive damage to the prefecture's important apple harvest, causing an estimated \u00a510 billion (US$64.8 million) in damage to the crop. Many apple trees had their trunks and branches broken.\nGeography.\nAomori Prefecture is the northernmost prefecture in the T\u014dhoku region, lying on the northern end of the island of Honshu. It faces Hokkaido from across the Tsugaru Strait and it borders Akita and Iwate in the south. The prefecture is flanked by the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Sea of Japan to the west with the Tsugaru Strait linking those bodies of water to the north of the prefecture. The islets of Ky\u016broku-jima in the Sea of Japan are the prefecture's westernmost point. \u014cma, at the northwestern tip of the axe-shaped Shimokita Peninsula, is the northernmost point of Honshu. The Shimokita and Tsugaru Peninsulas enclose Mutsu Bay. Between those peninsulas lies the smaller Natsudomari Peninsula, the northern end of the \u014cu Mountains. The three peninsulas are prominently visible in the prefecture's symbol, a stylized map. Aomori Prefecture is the eighth-largest prefecture, with an area of , and the 31st-most populous prefecture, with more than 1.18\u00a0million people. Mount Iwaki, an active stratovolcano, is the prefecture's highest point, at almost .\nLake Ogawara lies at the base of the Shimokita Peninsula. It is the prefecture's largest lake and the eleventh largest in Japan. It is also the largest brackish lake in the T\u014dhoku area. Lake Towada sits in a volcanic caldera, straddles Aomori Prefecture's boundary with Akita. It is a primary feature of Towada-Hachimantai National Park and is Honshu's largest caldera lake. Also within the park, the Oirase River flows east towards the Pacific Ocean from Lake Towada. Another feature of the park, the Hakk\u014dda Mountains, an expansive volcanic group, rises in the lands to the south of the city of Aomori and north of Lake Towada.\nShirakami-Sanchi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located in the Shirakami Mountains in the western part of the prefecture. The site contains the largest surviving virgin beech forest in East Asia, which is home to over 87 species of birds. Mount Iwaki, a stratovolcano and the prefecture's highest point lies to northeast of the Shirakami Mountains. The lands to the east and northeast of Mount Iwaki are an expansive floodplain that is drained by the Iwaki River. Hirosaki, the former capital of the Tsugaru clan, sits on the banks of the river.\nAs of March 31, 2019, 12 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Towada-Hachimantai and Sanriku Fukk\u014d National Parks; Shimokita Hant\u014d and Tsugaru Quasi-National Parks; and Asamushi-Natsudomari, Ashino Chish\u014dgun, Iwaki K\u014dgen, Kuroishi Onsenky\u014d, Nakuidake, \u014cwani Ikarigaseki Onsenky\u014d, and Tsugaru Shirakami Prefectural Natural Parks; and Mount Bonju Prefectural Forest.\nNatural resources.\nAomori Prefecture is highly biodiverse and rural, with forests covering 66 percent of its land and it promotes responsible forestry practices; the exemplars are the virgin Japanese beech forests of Shirakami-Sanchi. The Shirakami Mountains are primarily granite and sedimentary rock and also include rhyolite and quartz diorite. The prefecture has many waterfalls and rivers. Significant birds and mammals include: harlequin duck, Hodgson's hawk eagle, golden eagle, black woodpecker, Japanese serow, Japanese dormouse, Japanese macaque\u2014those found on Shimokita Peninsula are the world's northernmost wild primates, and Tsukinowa bear.\nBeing surrounded on three sides by ocean, marine resources are a significant food source for the entire country of Japan, not just the prefecture, which includes: tuna (especially the \"black diamond\" type from \u014cma), \"akaika\" (flying squid), scallop, flounder, monkfish, sea urchin roe, and \"konbu\" (kelp).\nIn 2011, non-ferrous metal mining was 23.7 percent of the prefecture's economy. Ferrous metals and nickel are also mined. The Hachinohe mine is a limestone quarry that is the lowest point in Japan at below sea level. Tsugaruite is a sulfosalt mineral still being researched that was discovered at the Yunosawa mine in the Tsugaru region in 1997 and approved as a new mineral by the International Mineralogical Association in 1998.\nCities, towns, and villages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClimate.\nAomori Prefecture has four distinct seasons, with an average annual temperature of . Variations in climate exist between the eastern (Pacific Ocean) and the western (Sea of Japan) parts of the prefecture. This is in part due to the \u014cu Mountains that run north to south in the middle of the prefecture, dividing the two regions. The western side is subject to heavy monsoons and receives little sunshine; it experiences heavy snowfall during the winter. The eastern side is subject to low clouds brought in by northeasterly winds during the summer months, known locally as Yamase winds, from June through August, with temperatures staying relatively low. There are instances of Yamase winds making summers so cold that food production is hindered. The lowest recorded temperature during the winter is , and the highest recorded temperature during the summer is . The city of Aomori and the surrounding areas are known for having the heaviest snowfall in the world. In 2016, AccuWeather ranked Aomori as the snowiest city in the world.\nAomori Prefecture's typically heavy snowfalls are caused by cold dry air from Siberian masses moving south, reaching the Sea of Japan, where they pick up significant amounts of moisture, thereby causing heavy snowfalls when they reach Japan's mountains. The Kuroshio Current is a major cause of the warm ocean waters in the area. Climate change in Aomori Prefecture is impacting its snowy winters and affecting water resources and marine life. Steady average temperature increases have been occurring in Aomori Prefecture since the early 1980s. Trends show decreasing seasonal snowfall and a shift in river runoff timing, potentially leading to water supply issues for agriculture during the spring. Warming ocean temperatures are impacting local fisheries, specifically with the potential to harm the cold-water seaweed \"kombu\". The prefecture's historically heavy winters are known for creating , also known as rime ice. Climate change change has steadily made it more difficult to find instances of \"snow monsters\".\nTemperature comparison.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA person living in or from Aomori Prefecture is referred to as an Aomorian in English. As of 2020, the prefecture had a total population of 1.23\u00a0million residents, accounting for just over 1 percent of Japan's total population. Approximately 45 percent of Aomori Prefecture's residents live in its two core cities, Aomori and Hachinohe, on its coastal plains. The majority of the prefecture is covered in forested mountain ranges, with population centers occupying valleys and plains. Aomori is the third-most populous prefecture in the T\u014dhoku region, after Miyagi Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture. \nAomori Prefecture's population grew until the late 20th century; it peaked at 1.52 million in 1985, dropped to 1.23 million by 2020 and by 2023 was 1.19 million. Japan's population growth rate started declining in 1970 and the total population peaked in 2010 at 128 million; dropping to 123.3 million by 2025. Aomori Prefecture has the 5th highest percentage of population of seniors among all prefectures at 34.8 percent. This percentage is expected to be 46.8 percent by 2045, resulting in the prefecture having the second highest rate above age 65 by then. The total population is expected to fall by 35 percent by 2050. The prefecture's declining total fertility rate (TFR) was 6.32 in 1925, but by 2008 it had fallen to 2.04. In 2022, the prefecture's birth rate was 1.24, the lowest in its recorded history. \nIn 2018, Aomori Prefecture saw the second largest decrease in the number of Japanese citizens out of any prefecture in the country. Only neighboring Akita Prefecture lost more citizens than Aomori Prefecture. In July 2025 the \"Aomori Declaration\" was issued by a meeting held in Aomori City of the National Governors' Association to address Japan's declining population, describing it as \"the biggest challenge\" facing the country. In 2017, 23,529 people moved out of Aomori Prefecture, while 17,454 people moved to the prefecture.\nIn 2020, 583,402 of the prefecture's residents were men and 654,582 were women, 10.8 percent of the population was below the age of 15, 56.6 percent of residents were between the ages of 15 and 64, and 32.6 percent was above the age of 64. In the same year the prefecture had a density of 130.9 people per square kilometer. Japan is noted for long lifespans, however Aomori Prefecture has the lowest male and female life expectancy of the whole country, for which high salt consumption and low physical activity are factors.\nIn 2020, Aomori Prefecture the fifth lowest ratio of foreign immigrants of all Japan's prefectures. Scholars suggest that immigration is not expected to reverse the prefecture's population decline. In 2007, Aomori Prefecture had the 7th lowest number of international marriages among all of Japan's prefectures, with only 664 marriages where one of the spouses was a foreigner. Efforts have been made to attract more foreign workers to address the labor shortage but so far these efforts have been insufficient to meet needs.\nEconomy.\nLike much of the T\u014dhoku Region, Aomori Prefecture remains dominated by primary sector industries, such as farming, forestry and fishing. The prefecture's forestry industry is centered around the cultivation and harvesting of hiba, a cypress tree utilized in construction of wooden structures across the country. In 2021, its economy had a GDP of 4,464\u00a0billion yen, which represented about 0.8 percent of Japan's economy. Aomori Prefecture generates the largest amount of wind energy out of the prefectures of Japan, with large wind farms located on the Shimokita Peninsula and Tsugaru. The peninsula is also home to the inactive Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant that is owned by Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited, a company headquartered in the village of Rokkasho that is involved in the production of nuclear fuel, as well as the reprocessing, storage, and disposal of nuclear waste. In July 2024, the governor of Aomori Prefecture announced the approval of a nuclear waste storage facility in town of Mutsu. The city of Hachinohe is home to the Pacific Metals Company, a manufacturer of ferronickel products.\nAgriculture.\nAomori Prefecture is a leading agricultural region in Japan. It has Japan's largest producer of apples for more than 100 years, growing about 60 percent of Japan's total apple production, producing 50 million tons yearly. The cultivation of apples in the prefecture began in 1875 when the prefecture was given three varieties of Western origin to grow. Most imported apple trees came from the France and United States. The apples are consumed within Japan and exported to the United States, China, Taiwan, and Thailand. Aomori Prefecture is also ranked highly in the nation's production of redcurrant, burdock, and garlic, accounting for 81, 37, and 66 percent, respectively, of the country's production. Climate change is having a negative impact on agriculture in Aomori Prefecture, especially on apples and other fruits.\nAomori Prefecture is also the center of Hakk\u014dda cattle rearing, a rare, region-specific breed of Japanese Shorthorn. The town of Gonohe has a long history as a breeding center for horses, popular among the samurai. With the decline of the samurai, Gonohe's horses continued to be bred for their meat. The lean horse meat is coveted as a delicacy, especially when served in its raw form, known as . The Aomori Prefecture coastline along Mutsu Bay is a large source of scallops; they are particularly a specialty of the town Hiranai, where the calm water around Natsudomari Peninsula makes a good home for them.\nTourism.\nWith a growth rate of 43.5%, Aomori Prefecture was among the top five prefectures of Japan in terms of growth rate in foreign tourists between 2012 and 2017. Heavy marketing of the prefecture's strong connection to the J\u014dmon culture significantly increased heritage tourism and kept this trend going through at least 2023. The total number of overnight visitors to the prefecture in 2019 was 5,060,000, with around 296,000 being foreigners. In terms of guest-nights, foreign visitors accounted for 356,550 nights in 2018, dipped to a low of 17,090 nights in 2021 due to COVID-19, and reached an all-time high of 435,010 in 2024.\nThis influx of foreign tourists has led to the construction of more hotels in Aomori Prefecture. Major draws to the prefecture are its apple industry, historic sites, museums, and national parks. Several of the prefecture's J\u014dmon period historic sites were nominated in January 2009 to become UNESCO World Heritage Sites and were placed on the World Heritage Tentative List. On July 27, 2021 the other J\u014dmon sites, totaling 17 sites, in neighboring prefectures were placed on the World Heritage Site list. These sites were the second sites in Aomori Prefecture placed on the list. The first was Shirakami-Sanchi, an area of virgin forests. Tourist access to Shirakami-Sanchi is heavily restricted due to its delicate ecosystem, though several water features, trails, and roads can be accessed by its visitors. About 35.2\u00a0million domestic travelers visited Aomori Prefecture in 2016, while about 95,000 foreign tourists visited in 2017.\nMilitary.\nAomori Prefecture and the Tsugaru Strait are of strategic value to both Japan and the United States, as the strait serves as an access point for the United States Navy into the Sea of Japan where they can put pressure on Russia, China, and North Korea. The prefecture also hosts Misawa Air Base, the only combined, joint U.S. service installation in the western Pacific servicing Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Space Force, and Air Force, as well as the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nCulture.\nCrafts.\nThe Tsugaru region of Aomori Prefecture is the birthplace of the traditional \"Tsugaru-jamisen\", a local style of music played on the \"shamisen\" (a three\u2013stringed musical instrument). A notable player of the style was Takahashi Chikuzan, a blind musician from Hiranai, who wandered around the country and eventually gained nationwide appeal. Aomori Prefecture is also where the decorative embroidery styles, \"kogin-zashi\" and \"Nanbu hishizashi\" originated, as more utilitarian textile techniques during the Edo period. The peasant women of the area, who created the styles, used them to make linen clothing more robust and warm during the harsh winters since cotton was unavailable to the lower class. Wooden horse figures called \"Yawata-uma\" (also \"Hachinohe horse\") Have Been Made in the Former Holdings of the Nanbu for 700 Years. Hachinohe horses are often given at celebrations as they are believed to bring good luck. Other crafts native to Aomori Prefecture include pottery, lacquerware, cabinetry, and iron working. The type of lacquerware specific to Aomori Prefecture is known as \"Tsugaru-Nuri\".\nCuisine.\nAomori Prefecture has given rise to several soups: \"ke porridge\" or Keno-jiru, which consists of \"miso soup\" with diced root vegetables and wild plants such as butterbur and bracken with tofu from the Tsugaru area; \"ichigoni\", a sea urchin roe and abalone soup in which the sea urchin roe looks like strawberries, known as \"ichigo\" in Japanese, from the town of Hashikami; \"hittsumi\" a roux with chicken and vegetables from the Nanbu area; \"Hachinohe senbei soup\" a hearty soup with \"Nanbu senbei\" loaded with vegetables and chicken; \"jappa-jiru\" a vegetable soup with cod roe from Aomori City; and \"keiran\" a red bean dumpling soy sauce soup served during special occasions on the Shimokita Peninsula. Another dish that was created in the area surrounding Mutsu Bay is \"kaiya\" in the Tsugaru area or \"kayaki\" on the Shimokita Peninsula, it is a boiled miso and egg dish mixed with fish or scallop meat on a large scallop shell that serves as both the cookware and dishes. In 2006, the production of aged black garlic began in Aomori Prefecture. The prefecture has since become the largest producer of black garlic in Japan.\nFestivals.\nAomori Prefecture hosts the Aomori Nebuta Matsuri, one of the Three Great Festivals of T\u014dhoku annually in early August. The other two Great Festivals are Akita Kanto and the Sendai Tanabata, which are held elsewhere in T\u014dhoku. During late April, \"hanami\" festivals are held across the prefecture, with the most prominent being located on the grounds of Hirosaki Castle. Many unique festivals are held during summer with bright lights, floats, dancing and music; including Aomori Nebuta Matsuri as well as several other iterations of the festival throughout the towns and cities of the prefecture. Winter is centered on snow festivals where attendees can view ice sculptures and eat local cuisine inside ice huts. Tsugaru's festivals tie in to its past and are more rural and community in nature than religious; even though they mix Shinto and Buddhist practices as well as music and dance.\nArts and literature.\nOsamu Dazai, the writer of Japan's second most popular novel \"No Longer Human\", is one of the prefecture's best-known writers. Shunsuke Kikuchi, a composer for series such as \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Doraemon\", was born in the city of Hirosaki. The creator of the supernatural manga series \"Shaman King\", Hiroyuki Takei, is from the village of Yomogita in northwestern Aomori Prefecture. The comedian Daima\u014d Kosaka, known widely for his viral single \"PPAP (Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen)\", was born in Aomori Prefecture. \"S\u014dsaku-hanga\" artist Shik\u014d Munakata was born in Aomori City. Much of his art was inspired by the prefecture's natural qualities and rural culture.\nReligion.\nJapanese religious beliefs are very syncretic, known as \"Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d\". About 95 percent of the populations is either Buddhist or Shinto. The formal separation of those two religions did not occur until the late 19th century and is known as \"Shinbutsu bunri\". This began occurring during the Meiji Restoration when a series of laws began to be passed. There is no agreement among modern theologians as to the degree of melding of the two religions. Christianity comprises about 1-2 percent of the population of Japan. The Christian population is concentrated mostly in Tokyo and western Japan. In Aomori Prefecture in 2018, there were only 5,582 Christians out of a populations of about 1.2 million.\nThe Takayama Inari Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Tsugaru. People come here to offer prayers on behalf of business prosperity, plentiful harvests, and maritime safety. There is a memorial with a Christian cross dedicated to American sailors who died when the \"Cheseborough\" ran aground in a typhoon at Shariki, Aomori in 1889.\nMount Osore, located on the Shimokita Peninsula of the prefecture, is covered with a barren landscape, jagged rock formations, and smells of sulfuric gases. It is considered a gateway to the underworld in some belief systems. The Bodai-ji Temple is located here and it specializes in taking care of the dead and is the traditional home to the itako blind mediums who connect with the dead.\nBlind mediums.\n\"Itako\", also known as \"ichiko\" or \"ogamisama\", are blind women who train to become spiritual mediums in Japan. They are strongly associated with Aomori Prefecture and today they are most commonly associated with the Mt. Osore area of the prefecture. \"Itako\" have traditionally gathered there for an annual festival to channel the dead. \"Itako\" perform ceremonies to communicate with spirits of the recently deceased, including those of aborted and stillborn children.\nThe tradition of \"itako\" arose because in earlier times the prefecture had very poor nutrition and sanitation, causing many children to go blind. In order for these children to be able to make a living, the females were trained as \"itako\" and the males for professions such as acupuncture, massage, moxibustion, and playing \"shamisen\". Blindness has long been associated with spiritual powers in Japan.\n\"Itako\" training traditionally began at a very young age, and included ritualized exposure to cold water. Hundreds of buckets of ice water could be poured on their bodies over the course of a few days. This education for \"itako\" takes about three years, and also includes memorization of songs and sutras. This training involves severe ascetic practices, after which the woman is said to be able to communicate with Japanese Shinto spirits, \"kami\", and the spirits of the dead. At the end of this training, a ceremony is held, announcing the marriage of the \"itako\" and her patron spirit. \"Itako\" perform rituals tied to communication with the dead and divination. In the 1950s to 1970s there were still dozens of \"itako\" in the prefecture. The practice has been on the decline since then. As of 2009, there were only 20 living \"itako\" in Japan, all more than 40 years old.\nTomb of Christ.\nPurportedly ancient documents were published in 1935, claiming Jesus preached and died at age 106 in Shing\u014d village in Aomori Prefecture. The documents, known as the \"Takeuchi manuscript\" or \"Takeuchi documents\", claim Jesus did not die on the cross, but rather his brother did and Jesus made his way to Aomori Prefecture via Siberia. Jesus then married a young woman named Miyuko and fathered three daughters. During this time he trained for 12 years and then began to spread Christianity. His purported grave is in Shing\u014d and 20,000-30,000 thousand visitors see it every year. In June 1964 an annual festival began being held at the gravesite. Jesus' eldest purported daughter married into the Sawaguchi family and there are still members of that family who claim non-Asian physical characteristics and lineage from Jesus.\nLandmarks.\nHirosaki Castle was the seat of the Tsugaru clan; it was constructed in 1611. It is the only castle in the T\u014dhoku region from the Edo period that is still standing and is located in the western part of the prefecture. Festivals held on the grounds of Hirosaki Castle include the Cherry Blossom Festival and Snow Lantern Festival.\nThe Sannai-Maruyama Site is an early-middle J\u014dmon period site where thousands of artifacts have been found. It is located in Sannai, Aomori City. It was designated as a Special National Historical Site of Japan in 2000, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the J\u014dmon Prehistoric Sites in Northern Japan collection in 2021. The site has various reconstructions of J\u014dmon structures, and a museum that displays and houses artifacts collected on the site, which have collectively been designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan.\nOsamu Dazai Memorial Museum, also known as \"Shay\u014dkan\", is a museum that was formerly a writer's home built in 1907 located in Kanagi area of Goshogawara. While consisting mostly of Japanese style architecture, there are also Westen influences, such as the staircase. It is an Important Cultural Property of Japan.\nThe Aomori Museum of Art is located near the Sannai-Maruyama Site, which inspired the museum's partially buried structure. It opened in 2006 focusing on highlighting the arts of northern T\u014dhoku. An tall concrete sculpture of a dog has become the museum's symbol. The museum has helped increase tourism in the area and is most noted for its collection of Marc Chagall's backdrops for the play \"Aleko\". The Towada Art Center is a set of geometric structures designed by SANAA and opened in 2008 in an effort to revitalize downtown Towada. It focuses on art that blends city structures and nature. Some of the works it holds are by Ron Mueck and Yoko Ono. \nThe Aomori Prefecture Tourist Center, also known as Aomori Prefecture Tourism Information Center (ASPAM: \"Aomori\", \"Sightseeing\", \"Products\", \"Mansion\".), is large triangle shaped building built in 1986 in Aomori City used to promote tourism in the prefecture. It has a 360-degree panoramic movie theater, a Kogin-zashi embroidery demonstration, apple sales, and an observatory.\nSports.\nThe two largest cities of the prefecture, Aomori and Hachinohe, both host professional sports teams. Both cities have professional soccer clubs in the Japan Professional Football League: Aomori City's ReinMeer Aomori and Hachinohe's Vanraure Hachinohe. Other professional sports teams in the two cities include the Aomori Wat's, a basketball team from Aomori City in the B.League and the Tohoku Free Blades, an ice hockey team from Hachinohe that competes in the Asia League. Aomori Prefecture hosted the 2003 Asian Winter Games in February 2003. Approximately 1,200 athletes from 29 Asian countries participated in the games. Five venues across the prefecture held 51 different events. Aomori Prefecture is scheduled to host the 80th National Sports Festival of Japan in 2026. Aomori Prefecture was to have hosted these games in 2025, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the games were delayed for a year. The prefecture has produced some professional athletes. Yoshisada Yonezuka from the town of Nakadomari was a martial arts instructor for USA Judo. He coached the team in the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics. Several ice hockey players are from Aomori, such as Masami Tanabu, who later became a politician, and Fumika Sasano.\nOther teams.\nThe Aomori Curling Club was a member of the Japan Curling Association from the city of Aomori that represented Japan in the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Olympics and several World Curling Championships. The club was disbanded in 2013.\nSumo.\nThe prefecture is known as the due to the success of its wrestlers in the professional divisions. Aomori is the home prefecture of (the highest rank in sumo) Kagamisato, Wakanohana I, Tochinoumi, Wakanohana II, Takanosato, and Asahifuji. Although the prefecture is second in terms of producing the most (behind Hokkaido), Aomori earned its title by always having at least one wrestler from the prefecture in the top division since Ichinoya in 1883. In September 2025, this continuity was threatened when Takerufuji withdrew due to injury, forcing him to drop down to the second division for the November tournament. At the same time, however, Nishikifuji achieved a high enough score to return him to the top division, thus continuing the streak for a 142nd year. The prefecture is facing a decline in the number of professional recruits, falling from 50 natives in the 1950s, to just 10 in the 2020s.\nGovernment.\nAomori Prefecture's head of government is a governor, with the seat of the prefectural government in the city of Aomori. There are 48 members in the Aomori Prefectural Assembly, which is unicameral. Members are elected to four-year terms. In terms of national politics, the prefecture has three single-member districts: Aomori 1st district, Aomori 2nd district, Aomori 3rd district, each a constituency of the House of Representatives in the national Diet of Japan. In addition, the prefecture has two members elected from the Aomori at-large district to the House of Councillors in the Diet. The at-large members are elected to six-year terms in staggered elections every three years. \nAomori Prefecture is a stronghold of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), though the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) has won some elections since its formation in 2017. One of Aomori Prefecture's notable politicians is LDP member Tadamori \u014cshima, who served as the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (2000-2002), Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (2002-2003), and Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan (2015-2021). He also held several leadership positions in the LDP.\nEducation.\nAomori Prefecture's most prominent university is Hirosaki University, which was formed by the combination of several colleges and higher education schools in 1949 in accordance with the National School Establishment Law of 1949. The prefecture has two other public universities, Aomori Public University and the Aomori University of Health and Welfare. Several private universities are also located in Aomori Prefecture. Among them are Aomori University, Hachinohe Gakuin University, Hachinohe Institute of Technology, Hirosaki Gakuin University, Hirosaki University of Health and Welfare, Tohoku Women's College, and the Towada Campus of Kitasato University.\nThe Aomori Prefecture Board of Education oversees various aspects of the prefecture's educational system including the management of libraries, the Aomori Prefectural Museum, and various educational support offices and centers. The declining population has resulted in significant decreases in the number of schools and enrollment, but with a slight increase in the budget due to rising costs. The prefecture allocated 130.3 billion yen towards education in 2018 and 131.8 billion yen in 2025. In 2017 the prefecture's public school system was teaching 133,507 students, a sharp decrease from a total of 173,537 students ten years earlier. By 2024 the enrollment dropped to 126,406 students. Overall in 2018, the prefecture had 94 kindergartens (1 of which is a national school and 3 that are public), 289 elementary schools (1 of which is a national school and 288 that are run by municipal governments), 161 middle schools (1 of which is a national school, another which is run by the prefecture, 4 that are private, and 155 that are run by municipal governments), and 95 high schools. By 2025 the number of schools had dropped to 242 elementary schools (1 national, 241 municipal), 151 middle schools (national: 1, prefectural: 1, municipal: 143, private: 6), and 1 cumpulsory school; with the number of high schools dropping to 46 public and 17 private schools.\nTransportation.\nAomori Prefecture has of roads, highways, and streets, along with of expressways. Four major expressways pass through the prefecture: the T\u014dhoku Expressway, which runs south\u2013north through center of the prefecture; the incomplete Tsugaru Expressway, running east\u2013west in the southwestern portion of the prefecture; the partially-complete Hachinohe-Kuji Expressway that travels south\u2013north along the prefecture's eastern coast to Hachinohe; and the partially-complete Shimokita Expressway that travels south\u2013north along Shimokita Peninsula from the town of Noheji to the city of Mutsu.\nSeveral auxiliary routes of the T\u014dhoku Expressway also serve the prefecture. The Aomori Expressway and Hachinohe Expressway, spur routes into the eastern part of the city of Aomori and central Hachinohe. A spur of the Hachinohe Expressway continues northwest across the eastern side of the prefecture towards the prefecture's capital. It is made up of several named routes: the Momoishi Toll Road, the Daini-Michinoku Toll Road, the Kamikita Expressway, and the Michinoku Toll Road. Several national highways pass through the prefecture. National routes 4, 7, and 45 are primary routes that link the prefectural capital to the capitals of other prefectures across Japan. Additional national routes in Aomori Prefecture include routes 101, 102, 103, 104, 279, 280, 282, 338, 339, 340, 394, and 454. Two of the prefecture's national highways also continue north across the Tsugaru Strait to Hokkaido: National Route 279, which is carried to Hakodate by the Tsugaru Kaiky\u014d Ferry; and National Route 280, which was previously carried by ferry to the town of Fukushima, Hokkaido, though the route is still signed from Fukushima to Hakodate.\nRailways have played an important role in Aomori Prefecture's transportation network and development since the Meiji period. Aomori Station, Shin-Aomori Station, Hachinohe Station, Hirosaki Station, and Shichinohe-Towada Station are major rail stations operating in Aomori Prefecture. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East), operates several rail lines in the prefecture: the T\u014dhoku Shinkansen, the T\u014dhoku Main Line, the \u014cu Main Line, the \u014cminato Line, the Gon\u014d Line, the Hachinohe Line, and the Tsugaru Line. Other notable rail operators in the prefecture are the Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido), that runs the Hokkaido Shinkansen through the Seikan Tunnel to and from Hokkaido, the Aoimori Railway that operates passenger services on the T\u014dhoku Main Line, and the northernmost privately owned railway in Japan, the Tsugaru Railway.\nMaritime transport in Aomori Prefecture operates primarily from the ports of Aomori City, Mutsuogawara, and Hachinohe, though smaller ports are found throughout the prefecture. The ports at Aomori City and Hachinohe both serve cruise ships and ferry lines. Additionally, a ferry line operates between \u014cma and Hakodate. Prior to the opening of the Seikan Tunnel, rail ferries operated by the Japanese National Railways linked Aomori Station and Hakodate Station as the primary connection between Hokkaido and the rest of Japan. A museum dedicated to the historic rail ferries operates near Aomori Station in a former rail ferryboat, the \"Hakkoda Maru\". In April 1995, Aomori Airport began offering a regular international air service.\nThere are two commercial airports located within Aomori Prefecture, Aomori Airport and Misawa Airport. Both airports are relatively small, though Aomori Airport offers regular international flights to South Korea and Taiwan, in addition to domestic flights to several cities. Combined the prefecture's two commercial airports moved 1.56 million passengers in 2024, with Aomori Airport handling 1.23 million of them.\nSymbols and names.\nDuring the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search conducted in Flagstaff, Arizona for main-belt asteroids that have a risk of coming close to Earth, observers discovered , an asteroid which they named after Aomori Prefecture. 19701 Aomori was given its name on May 9, 2012 after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami to pay respect towards the damaged communities along the prefecture's southeastern coast.\nPrefectural symbols.\nSince 1961, the prefectural symbol of Aomori is a green stylized map of the prefecture on a white background, showing the crown of Honsh\u016b: the Tsugaru, Natsudomari and Shimokita Peninsulas. The green is representative of development while the white symbolizes the vastness of the world.\nThe prefectural bird has been Bewick's swan since 1964, the species migrates to the area during the winter. In 1966, the prefecture designated the hiba (\"Thujopsis dolabrata\") as its prefectural tree. The apple blossom was designated as the prefectural flower in 1971 to pay homage to the prefecture's apple production. In 1987, the Japanese halibut was designated as the prefectural fish.\nDialects.\nT\u014dhoku dialect, one of the three main dialects of Japan, is spoken in Aomori Prefecture. The most widespread variants are the Tsugaru dialect, Nanbu dialect, and Shimokita dialect. The boundary determining which of these dialects are spoken is mainly along the former border of the Tsugaru and Nanbu clans between Hiranai and Noheji, with some overlap. Speakers of the Tsugaru dialect are typically centered around Hirosaki, while those who use the Nanbu dialect are centered around Hachinohe. The Shimokita dialect is used on the Shimokita Peninsula around Mutsu and has been recognized as having enough differences to distinguish it from the Nanbu dialect. It was also used in combination with the Nanbu dialect in an early Japanese\u2013Russian dictionary written by a man whose father came from the Shimokita Peninsula. The Ainu people, culture, and language still influence Aomori Prefecture, including several Ainu words that are still in use, place names in particular.\nThe oldest discovered compilation of words and phrases of the Nanbu dialect was written in 1790 followed by a dictionary of the Tsugaru dialect in 1809. Special features of the Aomori Prefecture dialects include an atypical intonation, voicing consonants that are typically unvoiced (e.g. [k] sounds become [g]), and the addition of voiced velar nasal sounds and corresponding kana (\u304b\u309a [\u014ba], \u304d\u309a [\u014bi], \u304f\u309a [\u014bu], \u3051\u309a [\u014be], and \u3053\u309a [\u014bo]).\nThere is a negative connotation associated with the T\u014dhoku dialect, associated with rurality and laziness. In shogunate times, government officials visiting the prefecture considered the Nanbu dialect very hard to understand. People from the entire T\u014dhoku region were often considered unsophisticated, simple, and rural and their accent was often the object of jokes. The name for the defunct Mutsu Province uses the same kanji symbol, \u9678\u5965, as the Japanese phrase for . The inhabitants were called and . Due to these negative perceptions, speakers of T\u014dhoku dialects will often hide their accents. A study performed in 2016 indicated that people from Aomori Prefecture who are 70 years and older frequently use these dialects, while use becomes less frequent the younger a person is, regardless of fluency. Additionally, the study revealed that when traveling to Tokyo, older generations will continue to use their dialect, while younger generations switch to standard Japanese. Over half of each generation surveyed preferred to use their local dialect when talking to Tokyoites in Aomori Prefecture. Dialectal forms are more common in the Tsugaru region of Aomori Prefecture and forms a significant part of the cultural identity of the local population. Southern T\u014dhoku reveals a transition from standard language to dialects of Aomori Prefecture.\nMedia.\nThe largest newspaper by readership in Aomori Prefecture is \"The T\u014d-\u014c Nipp\u014d Press\" with a daily readership of 205,000, 55 percent of the total share of the newspaper market in the region. The newspaper also runs a radio news station which is broadcast by the Aomori Broadcasting Corporation (RAB). Other local newspapers are Hachinohe's \"The Daily T\u014dhoku Shimbun\", Hirosaki's \"Mutsu Shimp\u014d\", and Kuroishi's \"Tsugaru Shinp\u014d\".\nFour television stations are broadcast in Aomori Prefecture. RAB is a television and radio broadcaster based in the capital that is affiliated with the Japan Radio Network, National Radio Network, and Nippon News Network. RAB uses the call signs JOGR-DTV for digital television broadcasts and JOGE, JOGO, and JOGR for radio broadcasts in Hirosaki, Hachinohe, and Aomori City, respectively. Japan News Network's affiliate, Aomori Television began broadcasting with the call sign JOAI on 1 December 1969. Asahi Broadcasting Aomori. NHK broadcasts radio, television, and digital television from NHK Aomori with the call signs JOTC and JOTG. NHK radio services began on April 17, 1941, while television broadcasts commenced on March 22, 1959.\nHani Motoko, a native of Hachinohe, is considered to be Japan's first female journalist. She became known for her column about famous Japanese women that began publication in 1897 in the \"H\u014dchi Shimbun\". Motoko later started a journal, that focused on the values of middle-class women.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans have occupied the area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period, and because of the cross-cultural exposure, and relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present day.\nFukuoka is the most populous city on Ky\u016bsh\u016b island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated by government ordinance on April 1, 1972. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5\u00a0million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kansai region has had a larger population than Kyoto.\nEtymology.\nThe name Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1) combines the characters fuku (\u798f), meaning \u201cgood fortune\u201d or \u201cblessing,\u201d and oka (\u5ca1), meaning \u201chill.\u201d The designation was introduced in 1600 by daimy\u014d Kuroda Nagamasa, who named his new castle town after the Fukuoka district of Bizen Province, the ancestral home of the Kuroda clan.\nHistory.\nPre-Tokugawa period.\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia.\nAmong Jomon period sites, early Jomon pit dwellings have been found in the eastern Itoshima Peninsula, while early to late Jomon pottery and stone-collecting hearths have been found at Kashiwara Site (South Ward). Among middle Jomon period sites, clusters of pits for storing yew and other acorns have been found at Nodame Newatari Site (South Ward) and Arita Site (Sawara Ward). Archeological research revealed that the Fukuoka Plain was underwater during the Jomon period, and like the Paleolithic period, only the aforementioned sites at the edge of Hizen Island remain.\nDuring the Yayoi period, the rise of early rice cultivation led to the development of large, moated villages like the Itazuke Site, and the region served as a hub of activity marked by the introduction of technologies like bronze and copper tools. Fukuoka's location near the Sea of Japan made it an early natural point of entry for trading and cultural influences from countries on the mainland such as Korea and China.\nContact with China.\nInteraction between the region and the Han dynasty of China was recorded as early as 57 A.D. According to the Book of the Later Han, an envoy visited the imperial court during the reign of Emperor Guangwu, and in recognition of this diplomatic mission, the ruler received a gold seal, discovered later in the 17th century.\nBy the end of the Asuka Period, Fukuoka, sometimes called the Port of , had grown from a small town into a critical administrative center, serving as the regional government headquarters for Kyushu and as a trade centre between Japan and Tang China. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen, and archaeology confirm this was a critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested.\nThe Book of Song recorded that King Bu, thought to be the Emperor Y\u016bryaku, sent a letter in 478 A.D. seeking the Chinese emperor's approval for the establishment of three ministries for administration of the kingdom similar to those in use in China; the remains of a ward office and temple in , south from Dazaifu, may be one of these ministries. In addition, remains of the K\u014drokan (, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\nHeian &amp; Kamakura Periods.\nFollowing the collapse of the Tang dynasty, relations with China declined, and Japan went into a period of isolationism. While the existing K\u014drokan declined by the end of the Heian Period in the 12th century, the city's importance as a trading hub continued to grow, evidenced by the discovery of a late Heian period stone revetment from the port in modern times.\nAs a result of the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, several historically important Buddhist temples in Fukuoka were constructed by monks after their studies. Monk Eisai founded Sh\u014dfuku-ji which is known today as the oldest zen temple in Japan. Eisai is also known for establishing a new sect of Zen Buddhism (Rinzai) and for bringing tea and tea culture to Japan. Monk Kukai established Tocho-ji, and Joten-ji was built by Enni who is also known for bringing Udon noodles first from China to Japan.\nHakata Gion Yamakasa is the most famous festival in Fukuoka and\nthe origin of it is believed to date back to 1241, when Enni, the founder of Jotenji temple had people carry him around the town on a platform while praying against the plague and eventually getting successfully rid of it.\nMongol invasions (1274\u20131281).\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience of dealing with. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. After the refusal of the Kamakura shogunate recognition of the Khan, Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900\u00a0ships and 33,000\u00a0troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 meters, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000\u00a0soldiers and 4,000\u00a0ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the \"Kamikaze\" (\"Divine Wind\"), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\nFormation of the modern city (1300-1889).\nBy the end of the 1300s, the threat of Mongol invasions declined, and Fukuoka \nentered a phase of flourishment. The 1300s also marked the fall of the Kamakura shogunate and the rise of the Muromachi shogunate. Kyushu, including Fukuoka, was a contested region during this transition. Throughout the Muromachi period, Hakata was the first free city in Japanese history, with its government run by a council of 12 wealthy merchants called Tongyoji. It prospered as a trading city alongside Sakai City, whose government was run by a council of 36 members. The region continued to experience growth, and Hakata continued to serve as Japan's primary port for trade with mainland Asia, particularly with the Song and Yuan dynasties of China and with Korea. \nBy the 1500s, the control shifts from various clans, and ultimately the fall to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces, marked a period of conflict for the region. The Battle of Sekigahara eventually led to Kuroda Nagamasa being granted the region and beginning the construction of Fukuoka Castle in the early 1600s. Fukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful \"daimy\u014d\" of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. The modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first \"daimy\u014d\" of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping district, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city, and after multiple ties, Fukuoka ultimately was chosen. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, \"Hakata-ben\".\n20th century.\nFukuoka continued to grow during the early 20th century following the Meiji Restoration and industrialization of Japan. The city saw a rise in exponential growth with the introduction of new colleges and universities such as the Fukuoka Medical College in 1903 and the introduction of citywide public transit such as the Fukuoka Streetcar Service in 1910.\nDuring World War II, Fukuoka played a significant role as a regional military center and base for the Imperial Japanese Military due to its geographic position near the Korean Peninsula and China. The region also housed the largest POW base in Japan, Fukuoka 17 which operated from 1943 to 1945. In 1945, Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1945-1989.\nFollowing the close of World War II, Fukuoka then began a period of recovery and development, including the rebuilding of the city and the establishment of Itazuke Air Base, which became the largest USAF base on Kyushu, in addition to a new municipal airport in 1951. The postwar era also saw the establishment of key institutions and events in the city such as the Fukuoka Marathon in 1947, and the founding of the Fukuoka Zoo in 1953. Fukuoka benefited greatly from the Japanese economic miracle, and in 1975, absorbed the town of Sawara. 1975, Sany\u014d Shinkansen high-speed railway was extended to Hakata station, providing more efficient high-speed connection to Tokyo and the rest of the country.\nIn 1981, the Fukuoka City Subway began operations with the opening of its initial segment between Muromi and Tenjin, marking a turning point in Fukuoka\u2019s urban transit infrastructure and signifying a transition from the existing older street-level tram and bus systems toward a high-capacity, grade-separated urban rail network. In doing so, the establishment of the subway system also helped reduce surface traffic congestion in the city core and provided a more reliable and faster mode of transit. Towards the end of the 1980s, the city held two important expositions, including the 1989 Asian-Pacific Exposition, and the 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank.\nPartnership with Atlanta, Georgia, United States.\nFukuoka established a partnership with Atlanta, Georgia after a visit by former Japan Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in 1994. The sister city partnership was formalized in February 2005 by Former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin and former Fukuoka mayor Hirotaro Yamasaki. For 20 years the program has been supporting yearly student exchanges, economic forums and cultural performances. At the yearly cultural celebration \u201cJapanFest\u201d in Atlanta, Fukuoka performers showcase traditional music and dance.\n21st century.\nIn February 2005, the Nanakuma Line started operations, serving as the fourth linear motor subway line to be built in Japan. The Nanakuma Line was originally conceived in the 1960s to provide access to Nakamura Gakuen University and Fukuoka University, but the plan was subsequently amended for the line to end at Hashimoto Station. The line also linked the Central business district and the southwestern part of the city which previously unserved by rail.\nIn 2014, the city was selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups &amp; job creation\" by Japanese government, following an increase in economic activity in the region stemming from Abenomics.\nGeography.\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea. It is located from Tokyo.\nThe nearest overseas region is Busan Metropolitan City in Gyeongsang-do, South Korea, and the distance from Busan is about 180\u00a0km (112 miles). Fukuoka and Busan are sister cities.\nClimate.\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\"), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September.\nAlong with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of , average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual sunshine hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below and snow cover is rarely seen, though very light snow does fall on many days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (\"tsuyu\") lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between and . Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around . Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\nDisaster.\nEarthquakes.\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53\u00a0am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at 15.8\u00a0billion yen.\nA similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of , this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears regarding the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city, and the potential for an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\nWards.\nFukuoka has 7 wards ().\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of November 2018[ [update]], the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of . The total area is . Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population.

Of these, the most famous are \"Hakata Dontaku\" and \"Hakata Gion Yamakasa\".\nYamakasa.\n, held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds.

It is located in the northern part of the Nakad\u014dri or central region of the prefecture. As of 2023[ [update]], the city had an estimated population of 275,850 in 122,130 households and a population density of . The total area of the city is .\nThe present-day city of Fukushima partially consists of most of the former Shinobu and Date Districts and a portion of the former Adachi District. The city is located in the Fukushima Basin's southwest area and nearby mountains.\nThere are many onsen on the outskirts of the city, including the resort areas of Iizaka Onsen, Takayu Onsen, and Tsuchiyu Onsen. Fukushima is also the location of the Fukushima Race Course, the only Japan Racing Association horse racing track in the T\u014dhoku region of Japan.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn ancient Japan, the area now known as Fukushima City was called . The mountain in the middle of the city, present-day Mt. Shinobu, was also formerly called .\nDuring the J\u014dmon period, for around 2,000 years there was a large settlement on the eastern bank of the Abukuma River. This area has since been excavated and named the Miyahata Site.\nIn the 5th century AD, was appointed by the to be the , giving him control over the Fukushima Basin.\nUnder the Nara period's Ritsury\u014d system, stations were established along the Seven Circuits so that officials could change horses. One of the stations, the T\u014dsand\u014d, passed through the area of present-day Fukushima, and Minekoshi Station was established on the route. Minekoshi Station was located south of the Surikami River and north of the Matsukawa River, which at the time flowed to the south of Mt. Minekoshi. The area south of the Matsukawa River was then, as it still is now, known as . Thus it is believed that the station was located north of the area around the present-day prefectural office, in the .\nThe implementation of the Ritsury\u014d system also resulted in administrative changes, with the area of present-day Fukushima and Date being combined to form the district of Shinobu. This was the northernmost point of the Mutsu Province and held responsibility for preventing the southern expansion of the Emishi, a people who lived in northern Honsh\u016b.\nAfter 718, and the widening influence of the Yamato Imperial Court, Mutsu Province was expanded northwards into present-day Miyagi Prefecture. Along with this redrawing of boundaries, present-day Fukushima Prefecture was separated from the new Mutsu Province (approximately present-day Miyagi) and split between the newly formed provinces of Iwaki in the east and Iwase in the west. However, by 724 Mutsu Province was unable to deal on its own with the economic costs of holding back the Emishi, so Iwaki and Iwase provinces were merged back into Mutsu.\nIn the first half of the 10th century, the Date district was separated from the Shinobu district. As a reform to the tax on rice, labor, and textiles, there was a nationwide effort from the Imperial Court to split up districts so they each had approximately the same population. This was accomplished both through administrative changes and forced population relocations. With Mutsu Province viewed as reclaimed land by the Imperial Court, the area saw a significant amount of reorganization.\nIn the late Heian period, almost the entirety of the T\u014dhoku region was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara clan. Relatives of the Northern Fujiwara clan, the was given domain over nearly the entirety of present-day Fukushima Prefecture's centrally located Nakad\u014dri area and eventually expanded their control to include Aizu to the west as well. It is said that the Shinobu Sat\u014d clan is one of the reasons for the Sat\u014d surname spreading throughout and eventually becoming the most common surname in Japan.\nKamakura to Edo period.\nIn 1180, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, was accompanied by Shinobu district residents and on his way south to Kant\u014d to fight the Taira clan in the Genpei War.\nIn 1413, shut himself inside in defiance of the Kamakura kub\u014d. This is the first known historical mention of Daibutsu Castle, which was near the confluence of the Abukuma and Arakawa rivers at the present-day location of the Fukushima Prefectural Offices. It is said that the castle was named after the , a Vairocana Buddha statue kept within the castle. The castle was also known as . It is believed that in this time period the area's name was changed from Minekoshi to to reflect the concentration of political power in the area.\nDuring the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period, in 1591 Gam\u014d Ujisato gained control of the Shinobu and Date districts, and under him took control of , which was in the southwest of present-day Fukushima. The following year he moved from \u014cmori Castle to Suginome Castle. It is said that, inspired by the recent renaming of to the more joyous-sounding , he changed the name of his new residence to . This castle, like many others in Japan, was later demolished at the beginning of the Meiji period.\nIn 1600, Date Masamune and Honj\u014d Shigenaga, who was under the Uesugi clan and head of Fukushima Castle at the time, fought the . At the time, the Matsukawa River flowed in a different riverbed than it does now, as the current Matsukawa River is north of Mt. Shinobu, while the Matsukawa River at the time of the battle flowed south of Mt. Shinobu. It is said that the Battle of Matsukawa's battlefield extended from the southern base of Mt. Shinobu and extended into the center of modern-day Fukushima. In 1664 the Uesugi clan lost control of the Shinobu district, and the area became directly ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate.\nIn 1702, the Fukushima Domain was established and governed from Fukushima Castle, and in 1787, the was established in the present-day Sakurashimo area in the western part of Fukushima.

Fukushima City was named the prefecture's capital.\nNearly five years later, on August 21, 1876, Fukushima Prefecture merged with (consisting of the coastal Hamad\u014dri area) and (consisting of Aizu in the west), thus creating present-day Fukushima Prefecture. Fukushima continued to serve as the prefecture's capital. In 1879, the Shinobu district's government offices were moved to Fukushima.\nOn November 3, 1881, , which generally followed a portion of the old Ush\u016b Kaid\u014d, was opened and linked Fukushima to Yonezawa, approximately 45\u00a0km to the northwest. On December 15, 1887, the section of the T\u014dhoku Main Line running through Fukushima, connecting K\u014driyama Station in the south to Iwakiri Station in the north, was opened.

Upon inspection of the crash scene it was determined that someone had removed from the track two connecting plates, six spikes, and four bolts. The perpetrator was never found. This became known as the Niwasaka incident.\nOn August 17, 1949, at 3:09 am the Matsukawa incident occurred. In a scene highly reminiscent of the scene from the previous year's Niwasaka incident, a train bound for Ueno derailed, killing three crew members.

It lies between the \u014cu Mountains to the west and the Abukuma Highlands to the east. Most of the city is within the southeast area and nearby mountains of the Fukushima Basin. Mt. Azuma and Mt. Adatara loom over the city from the west and southwest, respectively\nIn the north, Fukushima is adjacent to the Miyagi Prefecture cities of Shiroishi and Shichikashuku. In the northwest, Fukushima borders the Yamagata Prefecture cities of Yonezawa and Takahata. Within Fukushima Prefecture, to the south of Fukushima is the town of Nihonmatsu, to the east are Kawamata and Date, and to the north is Koori.\nTerrain.\nThe Fukushima Basin is created by the surrounding \u014cu Mountains in the west and the Abukuma Highlands in the east, with the Abukuma River flowing through the center of the basin, from south to north. Multiple tributaries to the Abukuma River source in the \u014cu Mountains before flowing down into Fukushima, namely the Surikami, Matsukawa, and Arakawa rivers. These rivers flow eastward through the western side of the city until joining up with the Abukuma River in the central parts of the city. The irrigation from these rivers were formerly used for the cultivation of mullberry trees; however, in the latter half of the 20th century cultivation was switched from focusing on mullberry trees, and instead growing a variety of fruit orchards.\nThe highest point within the city limits is Mt. Higashi-Azuma, a peak of Mt. Azuma, located on the western edge of the city. The lowest point is the neighborhood of , which is in the northeastern part of the city and has an elevation of . Mt.

Azuma and also joins with the Abukuma River in the northern part of the city. Another major tributary of the Abukuma River is the Surikami River, which originates along the Fukushima-Yamagata prefectural border near the Moniwa area in the northwest of the city. From there it flows into Lake Moniwa, a reservoir created by the Surikamigawa Dam. From there it continues flowing southeast before meeting up with the Abukuma River in northern Fukushima, thus completing its run.\nOther tributaries of the Abukuma River which flow within Fukushima are the , , , , , , , , and rivers. The also flows through the city and is a tributary of the , which itself is also a tributary of the Abukuma River, however the Oguni River does not meet up with the Hirose River until the district of Date, outside of the Fukushima city limits.\nThere are multiple lakes in the area of Fukushima that falls within Bandai-Asahi National Park. , also called is a caldera lake located in Mt. Azuma's Mt. Issaiky\u014d peak.

Total combined sales of both retail and wholesale products in 2007 came to \u00a5 billion, approximately a quarter less than sales in 1997 a decade prior.\nTransportation.\nDue to Fukushima having long been the junction of the \u014csh\u016b Kaid\u014d and Ush\u016b Kaid\u014d routes, it has developed into an important transportation hub. It is currently the location of where National Route 13 breaks off from National Route 4. Fukushima Station is where the \u014cu Main Line separates from the T\u014dhoku Main Line and the T\u014dhoku Shinkansen separates from the Yamagata Shinkansen.\nRailway.\nIn addition to the T\u014dhoku and Yamagata shinkansen, JR East also provides service from Fukushima Station on the T\u014dhoku Main Line and \u014cu Main Line routes. Fukushima Station is north of Tokyo via the T\u014dhoku Main Line, which then continues north to Morioka Station.

Gummas are most commonly found in the liver (\"gumma hepatis\"), but can also be found in brain, heart, skin, bone, testis, and other tissues, leading to a variety of potential problems including neurological disorders or heart valve disease.\nPresentation.\nGummas have a firm, necrotic center surrounded by inflamed tissue, which forms an amorphous proteinaceous mass. The center may become partly hyalinized.\nThese central regions begin to die through coagulative necrosis, though they also retain some of the structural characteristics of previously normal tissues, enabling a distinction from the granulomas of tuberculosis where caseous necrosis obliterates preexisting structures. Other histological features of gummas include an \"intervening zone\" containing epithelioid cells with indistinct borders and multinucleated giant cells, and a \"peripheral zone\" of fibroblasts and capillaries. Infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells can be seen in the peripheral zone as well. With time, gummas eventually undergo fibrous degeneration, leaving behind an irregular scar or a round fibrous nodule.\nIt is restricted to necrosis involving spirochaetal infections that cause syphilis. Growths that have the appearance of gummas are described as gummatous.\nPathology.\nIn syphilis, the gumma is caused by a reaction to spirochaete bacteria in the tissue.\nIt appears to be the human body's way to slow down the action of this bacteria; it is a unique immune response that develops in humans after the immune system fails to kill off syphilis.\nEpidemiology.\nThe formation of gummata is rare in developed countries, but common in areas that lack adequate medical treatment.\nSyphilitic gummas are found in most but not all cases of tertiary syphilis, and can occur either singly or in groups. Gummatous lesions are usually associated with long-term syphilitic infection; however, such lesions can also be a symptom of benign late syphilis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kanagawa Prefecture is the second-most populous prefecture of Japan at 9,221,129 (1 April 2022) and third-densest at . Its geographic area of makes it fifth-smallest. Kanagawa Prefecture borders Tokyo to the north, Yamanashi Prefecture to the northwest and Shizuoka Prefecture to the west.\nYokohama is the capital and largest city of Kanagawa Prefecture and the second-largest city in Japan, with other major cities including Kawasaki, Sagamihara, and Fujisawa. Kanagawa Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern Pacific coast on Tokyo Bay and Sagami Bay, separated by the Miura Peninsula, across from Chiba Prefecture on the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula. Kanagawa Prefecture is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with Yokohama and a number of its cities being major commercial hubs and southern suburbs of Tokyo. Kanagawa Prefecture was the political and economic center of Japan during the Kamakura period when Kamakura was the de facto capital and largest city of Japan as the seat of the Kamakura shogunate from 1185 to 1333. Kanagawa Prefecture is a popular tourist area in the Tokyo region, with Kamakura and Hakone being two popular side trip destinations.\nHistory.\nThe prefecture has some archaeological sites going back to the J\u014dmon period (around 400 BCE). About 3,000 years ago, Mount Hakone produced a volcanic explosion which resulted in Lake Ashi on the western area of the prefecture.\nIt is believed that the imperial dynasty ruled this area from the 5th century onwards. In the ancient era, its plains were sparsely inhabited.\nIn medieval Japan, Kanagawa was part of the provinces of Sagami and Musashi. Kamakura in central Sagami was the capital of Japan during the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333).\nDuring the Edo period, the western part of Sagami Province was governed by the \"daimy\u014d\" of Odawara Castle, while the eastern part was directly governed by the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo (modern-day Tokyo).\nCommodore Matthew Perry landed in Kanagawa in 1853 and 1854 and signed the Convention of Kanagawa to force open Japanese ports to the United States. Yokohama, the largest deep-water port in Tokyo Bay, was opened to foreign traders in 1859 after several more years of foreign pressure, and eventually developed into the largest trading port in Japan. Nearby Yokosuka, closer to the mouth of Tokyo Bay, developed as a naval port and now serves as headquarters for the U.S. 7th Fleet and the fleet operations of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. After the Meiji period, a number of foreigners lived in Yokohama City, and visited Hakone. The Meiji government developed the first railways in Japan, from Shinbashi (in Tokyo) to Yokohama in 1872.\nThe epicenter of the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima (island) in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. The sea receded as much as 400 metres from the shore at Manazuru Point, and then rushed back towards the shore in a great wall of water which swamped Mitsuishi-shima. At Kamakura, the total death toll from earthquake, tsunami, and fire exceeded 2,000 victims. At Odawara, ninety percent of the buildings collapsed immediately, and subsequent fires burned the rubble along with anything left standing.\nYokohama, Kawasaki, and other major cities were heavily damaged by the U.S. bombing in 1945. Total casualties amounted to more than several thousand. After the war, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers for the Occupation of Japan, landed in Kanagawa, before moving to other areas. U.S. military bases still remain in Kanagawa, including Camp Zama (Army), Yokosuka Naval Base, Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Navy).\nGeography.\nKanagawa is a relatively small prefecture located at the southeastern corner of the Kant\u014d Plain wedged between Tokyo on the north, the foothills of Mount Fuji on the northwest, and the Sagami Bay and Tokyo Bay on the south and east. The eastern side of the prefecture is relatively flat and heavily urbanized, including the large port cities of Yokohama and Kawasaki.\nThe southeastern area nearby the Miura Peninsula is less urbanized, with the ancient city of Kamakura drawing tourists to temples and shrines. The western part, bordered by Yamanashi Prefecture and Shizuoka Prefecture on the west, is more mountainous and includes resort areas like Odawara and Hakone. The area, stretching from west to east and from north to south, contains of land, accounting for 0.64% of the total land area of Japan.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], 23% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park; Tanzawa-\u014cyama Quasi-National Park; and Jinba Sagamiko, Manazuru Hant\u014d, Okuyugawara, and Tanzawa-\u014cyama Prefectural Natural Parks.\nTopography.\nTopographically, the prefecture consists of three distinct areas. The mountainous western region features the Tanzawa Mountain Range and the volcano Mount Hakone. The hilly eastern region is characterized by the Tama Hills and Miura Peninsula. The central region, which surrounds the Tama Hills and Miura Peninsula, consists of flat stream terraces and low lands around major rivers including the Sagami River, Sakai River, Tsurumi River, and Tama River.\nThe Tama River forms much of the boundary between Kanagawa and Tokyo. The Sagami River flows through the middle of the prefecture. In the western region, the Sakawa runs through a small lowland, the Sakawa Lowland, between Mount Hakone to the west and the \u014ciso Hills to the east, and flows into Sagami Bay.\nThe Tanzawa Mountain Range, part of the Kant\u014d Mountain Range, contains Mount Hiru (), the highest peak in the prefecture. Other mountains measure similar mid-range heights: Mount Hinokiboramaru (), Mount Tanzawa, (), Mount \u014cmuro (), Mount Himetsugi (), and Mount Usu (). The mountain range is lower in height southward leading to Hadano Basin to the \u014ciso Hills. At the eastern foothills of the mountain range lies the Isehara Plateau and across the Sagami River the Sagamino plateau.\nCities.\nNineteen cities are located in Kanagawa Prefecture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTowns and villages.\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1945, Kanagawa was the 15th most populous prefecture in Japan, with a population of about 1.9 million. In the years after the war, the prefecture underwent rapid urbanization as a part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The population as of September\u00a01, 2014[ [update]] is estimated to be 9.1 million. Kanagawa became the second most populous prefecture in 2006. \nTransportation.\nKanagawa's transport network is heavily intertwined with that of Tokyo (\"see: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\"). Shin-Yokohama and Odawara stations on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen are located in the prefecture, providing high-speed rail service to Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other major cities.\nEducation.\nThe Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education manages and oversees individual municipal school districts.

{"id": "61759", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61759", "title": "Kamakura", "text": ", officially , is a city of Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan. It is located in the Kanto region on the island of Honshu. The city has an estimated population of 172,929 (1 September 2020) and a population density of 4,359 people per km2 over the total area of . Kamakura was designated as a city on 3 November 1939.\nKamakura was Japan's \"de facto\" capital when it was the seat of the Kamakura shogunate from 1185 to 1333, established by Minamoto no Yoritomo. It was the first military government in Japan's history. After the downfall of the shogunate, Kamakura saw a temporary decline. However, during the Edo period, it regained popularity as a tourist destination among the townspeople of Edo. Despite suffering significant losses of historical and cultural assets due to the Great Kant\u014d Earthquake in 1923, Kamakura continues to be one of the major tourist attractions in the Kanto region, known for its historical landmarks such as Tsurugaoka Hachimang\u016b and the Great Buddha of Kamakura.\nToponomy.\nThe name \"Kamakura\" appears in the of 712, and is also mentioned in the c.\u20098th century as well as in the of 938. However, the city clearly appears in the historical record only with Minamoto no Yoritomo's founding of the Kamakura shogunate in 1192.\nThere are various hypotheses about the origin of the name. According to the most likely theory, Kamakura, surrounded as it is on three sides by mountains, was likened both to a and to a , because both only have one side open.\nAnother and more picturesque explanation is a legend, relating how Fujiwara no Kamatari stopped at Yuigahama on his way to today's Ibaraki Prefecture, where he wanted to pray at the Kashima Shrine for the fall of Soga no Iruka. He dreamed of an old man who promised his support, and upon waking, he found next to his bed a type of spear called a . Kamatari enshrined it in a place called \u014ckura. \"Kamayari\" plus \"\u014ckura\" then turned into the name \"Kamakura\". However, this and similar legends appear to have arisen only after Kamatari's descendant Fujiwara no Yoritsune became the fourth of the Kamakura shogunate in 1226, some time after the name \"Kamakura\" appears in the historical record. It used to be also called (short for ).\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest traces of human settlements in the area date back at least 10,000 years. Obsidian and stone tools found at excavation sites near J\u014draku-ji were dated to the Old Stone Age (between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago). During the J\u014dmon period, the sea level was higher than now and all the flat land in Kamakura up to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and, further east, up to Yokohama's Totsuka-ku and Sakae-ku was under water. Thus, the oldest pottery fragments found come from hillside settlements of the period between 7500 BC and 5000 BC. In the late J\u014dmon period the sea receded and civilization progressed. During the Yayoi period (300 BC\u2013300 AD), the sea receded further almost to today's coastline, and the economy shifted radically from hunting and fishing to farming.\nThe Azuma Kagami describes pre-shogunate Kamakura as a remote, forlorn place, but there is reason to believe its writers simply wanted to give the impression that prosperity had been brought there by the new regime. To the contrary, it is known that by the Nara period (about 700 AD) there were both temples and shrines. Sugimoto-dera for example was built during this period and is therefore one of the city's oldest temples. The town was also the seat of area government offices and the point of convergence of several land and marine routes. It seems therefore only natural that it should have been a city of a certain importance, likely to attract Yoritomo's attention.\nKamakura period.\nThe extraordinary events, the historical characters and the culture of the twenty years which go from Minamoto no Yoritomo's birth to the assassination of the last of his sons have been throughout Japanese history the background and the inspiration for countless poems, books, TV dramas, Kabuki plays, songs, manga and even videogames; and are necessary to make sense of much of what one sees in today's Kamakura.\nYoritomo, after the defeat and almost complete extermination of his family at the hands of the Taira clan, managed in the space of a few years to go from being a fugitive hiding from his enemies inside a tree trunk to being the most powerful man in the land. Defeating the Taira clan, Yoritomo became \"de facto\" ruler of much of Japan and founder of the Kamakura shogunate, an institution destined to last 141 years and to have immense repercussions over the country's history.\nThe Kamakura shogunate era is called by historians the Kamakura period and, although its end is clearly set (Siege of Kamakura (1333)), its beginning is not. Different historians put Kamakura's beginning at a different point in time within a range that goes from the establishment of Yoritomo's first military government in Kamakura (1180) to his elevation to the rank of in 1192. It used to be thought that during this period, effective power had moved completely from the Emperor in Kyoto to Yoritomo in Kamakura, but the progress of research has revealed this was not the case. Even after the consolidation of the shogunate's power in the east, the Emperor continued to rule the country, particularly its west. However, it is undeniable that Kamakura had a certain autonomy and that it had surpassed the technical capital of Japan politically, culturally and economically. The shogunate even reserved for itself an area in Kyoto called where lived its representatives, who were there to protect its interests.\nIn 1179, Yoritomo married H\u014dj\u014d Masako, an event of far-reaching consequences for Japan. In 1180, he entered Kamakura, building his residence in a valley called \u014ckura (in today's Nishi Mikado). The stele on the spot reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1185, his forces, commanded by his younger brother Minamoto no Yoshitsune, vanquished the Taira and in 1192 he received from Emperor Go-Toba the title of . Yoshitsune's power would however cause Yoritomo's envy; the relationship between the brothers soured, and in 1189 Yoritomo was given Yoshitsune's head pickled in liquor. For the same reason, in 1193 he had his other brother Noriyori killed. Power was now firmly in his hands, but the Minamoto dynasty and its power however were to end as quickly and unexpectedly as they had started.\nIn 1199, Yoritomo died falling from his horse at the age of 51, and was buried in a temple that had until then housed his tutelary goddess. He was succeeded by his 17-year-old son Minamoto no Yoriie under the regency of his maternal grandfather H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa. A long and bitter fight ensued in which entire clans like the Hatakeyama, the Hiki, and the Wada were wiped out by the H\u014dj\u014d who wished to get rid of Yoritomo's supporters and consolidate their power. Yoriie did become head of the Minamoto clan and was regularly appointed in 1202 but by that time, real power had already fallen into the hands of the H\u014dj\u014d clan. Yoriie plotted to take back his power, but failed and was assassinated on July 17, 1204. His six-year-old first son Ichiman had already been killed during political turmoil in Kamakura, while his second son Yoshinari at age six was forced to become a Buddhist priest under the name Kugy\u014d. From then on all power would belong to the H\u014dj\u014d, and the would be just a figurehead. Since the H\u014dj\u014d were part of the Taira clan, it can be said that the Taira had lost a battle, but in the end had won the war.\nYoritomo's second son and third Minamoto no Sanetomo spent most of his life staying out of politics and writing poetry, but was nonetheless assassinated in February 1219 by his nephew Kugy\u014d under the giant ginkgo tree whose trunk still stood at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b until it was uprooted by a storm in the early hours of March 10, 2010. Kugy\u014d himself, the last of his line, was beheaded as a punishment for his crime by the H\u014dj\u014d just hours later. Barely 30 years into the shogunate, the Seiwa Genji dynasty who had created it in Kamakura had ended.\nIn 1293, a severe earthquake killed 23,000 people and seriously damaged the city. In the confusion following the quake, H\u014dj\u014d Sadatoki, the Shikken of the Kamakura shogunate, carried out a purge against his subordinate Taira no Yoritsuna. In what is referred to as the Heizen Gate Incident, Yoritsuna and 90 of his followers were killed.\nThe H\u014dj\u014d regency however continued until Nitta Yoshisada destroyed it in 1333 at the Siege of Kamakura. It was under the regency that Kamakura acquired many of its best and most prestigious temples and shrines, for example Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, Kench\u014d-ji, Engaku-ji, Jufuku-ji, J\u014dchi-ji, and Zeniarai Benten Shrine. The H\u014dj\u014d family crest in the city is therefore still ubiquitous.\nFrom the middle of the thirteenth century, the fact that the vassals (the ) were allowed to become \"de facto\" owners of the land they administered, coupled to the custom that all children could inherit, led to the parcelization of the land and to a consequent weakening of the shogunate. This, and not lack of legitimacy, was the primary cause of the H\u014dj\u014d's fall.\nAccording to The Institute for Research on World-Systems, Kamakura was the 4th largest city in the world in 1250 AD, with 200,000 people, and Japan's largest, eclipsing Kyoto by 1200 AD. Yet, despite Kamakura's annihilation of Kyoto-based political and military power at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185, and the failure of the Emperor to free himself from Kamakura's control during the J\u014dky\u016b War, Takahashi (2005) has questioned whether Kamakura's nationwide political hegemony actually existed. Takahashi claims that if Kamakura ruled the Kant\u014d, not only was the Emperor in fact still the ruler of Kansai, but during this period the city was in many ways politically and administratively still under the ancient capital of Kyoto. Kamakura was simply a rival center of political, economic and cultural power in a country that had Kyoto as its capital.\nNichiren in Kamakura.\nKamakura is known among Buddhists for having been the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism during the 13th century. Founder Nichiren was not a native; he was born in Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture. But it was only natural for a preacher to come here because the city was the political centre of the country at the time. Nichiren settled down in a straw hut in the Matsubagayatsu (literally transl.\u2009pine needle valley) district, where three temples (Ankokuron-ji, My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji, and Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honour of being the true heir of the master. During his turbulent life Nichiren came and went, but Kamakura always remained at the heart of his religious activities. It is here that, when he was about to be executed by the H\u014dj\u014d Regent for being a troublemaker, he was allegedly saved by a miracle; it is also in Kamakura that he wrote his famous , or 'Treatise on Peace and Righteousness', and that legend says he was rescued and fed by monkeys. Kamakura is also where he preached.\nSome Kamakura locations important to Nichiren Buddhism are:\nAnkokuron-ji claims to have on its grounds the cave where the master, with the help of a white monkey, hid from his persecutors. (However Hossh\u014d-ji in Zushi's Hisagi district makes the same claim, and with a better historical basis.) Within Ankokuron-ji lie also the spot where Nichiren used to meditate while admiring Mount Fuji, the place where his disciple Nichiro was cremated, and the cave where he is supposed to have written his . Nearby My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji (also called Koke-dera or 'Temple of Moss'), a much smaller temple, was erected in an area where Nichiren had his home for 19 years. The third Nichiren temple in Nagoe, Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji, also claims to lie on the very spot where it all started.\nFall of the Kamakura shogunate.\nOn July 3, 1333, warlord Nitta Yoshisada, who was an Emperor loyalist, attacked Kamakura to reestablish imperial rule. After trying to enter by land through the Kewaizaka Pass and the Gokuraku-ji Pass, he and his forces waited for a low tide, bypassed the Inamuragasaki cape, entered the city and took it.\nIn accounts of that disastrous H\u014dj\u014d defeat it is recorded that nearly 900 H\u014dj\u014d samurai, including the last three Regents, committed suicide at their family temple, T\u014dsh\u014d-ji, whose ruins have been found in today's \u014cmachi. Almost the entire clan vanished at once, the city was sacked and many temples were burned. Many simple citizens imitated the H\u014dj\u014d, and an estimated total of over 6,000 died on that day of their own hand. In 1953, 556 skeletons of that period were found during excavations near Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's Ichi no Torii in Yuigahama, all of people who had died of a violent death, probably at the hand of Nitta's forces.\nMuromachi and Edo periods.\nThe fall of Kamakura marks the beginning of an era in Japanese history characterized by chaos and violence called the Muromachi period. Kamakura's decline was slow, and in fact the next phase of its history, in which, as the capital of the Kant\u014d region, it dominated the east of the country, lasted almost as long as the shogunate had. Kamakura would come out of it almost completely destroyed.\nThe situation in Kant\u014d after 1333 continued to be tense, with H\u014dj\u014d supporters staging sporadic revolts here and there. In 1335, H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyuki, son of last regent Takatoki, tried to re-establish the shogunate by force and defeated Kamakura's \"de facto\" ruler Ashikaga Tadayoshi in Musashi, in today's Kanagawa Prefecture. He was in his turn defeated in Koshigoe by Ashikaga Takauji, who had come in force from Kyoto to help his brother.\nTakauji, founder of the Ashikaga shogunate which, at least nominally, ruled Japan during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, at first established his residence at the same site in Kamakura where Yoritomo's had been, but in 1336 he left Kamakura in charge of his son Yoshiakira and went west in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada. The Ashikaga then decided to permanently stay in Kyoto, making Kamakura instead the capital of the (or ), a region including the provinces of Sagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa, Shim\u014dsa, Hitachi, Kozuke, Shimotsuke, Kai, and Izu, to which were later added Mutsu and Dewa, making it the equivalent to today's Kanto, plus the Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures.\nKamakura's ruler was called , a title equivalent to assumed by Ashikaga Takauji's son Motouji after his nomination to , or deputy , in 1349. Motouji transferred his original title to the Uesugi family, which had previously held the hereditary title of , and would thereafter provide the . Motouji had been sent by his father because this last understood the importance of controlling the Kant\u014d region and wanted to have an Ashikaga in power there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness, so the 's idea never really worked and actually backfired. The era is essentially a struggle for the shogunate between the Kamakura and the Kyoto branches of the Ashikaga clan, because both believed they had a valid claim to power. In the end, Kamakura had to be retaken by force in 1454. The five recorded by history, all of Motouji's bloodline, were in order Motouji himself, Ujimitsu, Mitsukane, Mochiuji and Shigeuji. The last had to escape to Koga, in today's Ibaraki prefecture, and he and his descendants thereafter became known as the . According to the Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book published in 1685, more than two centuries later the spot where the 's mansion had been was still left empty by local peasants in the hope he may one day return.\nA long period of chaos and war followed the departure of the last (the Sengoku period). Kamakura was heavily damaged in 1454 and almost completely burned during the Siege of Kamakura (1526). Many of its citizens moved to Odawara when it came to prominence as the home town of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan. The final blow to the city was the decision taken in 1603 by the Tokugawa to move the capital to nearby Edo, the place now called Tokyo. The city never recovered and gradually returned to be the small fishing village it had been before Yoritomo's arrival. Edmond Papinot's \"Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan\", published in 1910 during the late Meiji period, describes it as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMeiji period and the 20th century.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kamakura's great cultural assets, its beach, and the mystique that surrounded its name made it as popular as it is now, and for essentially the same reasons. The destruction of its heritage nonetheless did not stop: during the anti-Buddhist violence of 1868 () that followed the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism () many of the city temples were damaged. In other cases, because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, shrines or temples had to give away some of their treasures, thus damaging their cultural heritage and decreasing the value of their properties. Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's giant (the two wooden warden gods usually found at the sides of a Buddhist temple's entrance), for example, being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were brought to Jufuku-ji, where they still are.\nThe shrine also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its tower, its , and its .\n Some Buddhist temples were simply closed, like Zenk\u014d-ji, to which the now-independent Meigetsu-in used to belong.\nIn 1890, the railroad, which until then had arrived just to Ofuna, reached Kamakura bringing in tourists and new residents, and with them a new prosperity. Part of the ancient Dankazura (see above) was removed to let the railway system's new Yokosuka Line pass.\nThe damage caused by time, centuries of neglect, politics, and modernization was further compounded by nature in 1923. The epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake that year was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay, a short distance from Kamakura. Tremors devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, causing widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. It was reported that the sea receded at an unprecedented velocity, and then waves rushed back towards the shore in a great wall of water over seven meters high, drowning some and crushing others beneath an avalanche of waterborne debris. The total death toll from earthquake, tsunami, and fire exceeded 2,000 victims. Large sections of the shore simply slid into the sea; and the beach area near Kamakura was raised up about six-feet; or in other words, where there had only been a narrow strip of sand along the sea, a wide expanse of sand was fully exposed above the waterline.\nMany temples founded centuries ago have required restoration, and it is for this reason that Kamakura has just one National Treasure in the building category (the Shariden at Engaku-ji). Much of Kamakura's heritage was for various reasons over the centuries first lost and later rebuilt.\nGeography.\nSurrounded to the north, east, and west by hills and to the south by the open water of Sagami Bay, Kamakura is a natural fortress. Before the construction of several tunnels and modern roads that now connect it to Fujisawa, Ofuna, and Zushi, on land it could be entered only through narrow artificial passes, among which the seven most important were called , a name sometimes translated as 'Kamakura's Seven Mouths'. The natural fortification made Kamakura an easily defensible stronghold.\nBefore the opening of the Entrances, access on land was so difficult that the Azuma Kagami reports that H\u014dj\u014d Masako came back to Kamakura from a visit to S\u014dt\u014dzan temple in Izu bypassing by boat the impassable Inamuragasaki cape and arriving in Yuigahama. Again according to the Azuma Kagami, the first of the Kamakura, Minamoto no Yoritomo, chose it as a base partly because it was his ancestors' land (his ), and partly because of these physical characteristics.\nTo the north of the city stands (), which then passes behind the Daibutsu and reaches Inamuragasaki and the sea.\nFrom the north to the east, Kamakura is surrounded by (), (), (), (), and (), which extend all the way to Iijimagasaki and Wakae Island, on the border with Kotsubo and Zushi. From Kamakura's alluvional plain branch off numerous narrow valleys like the Urigayatsu, Shakad\u014dgayatsu, \u014cgigayatsu, Kamegayatsu, Hikigayatsu, and Matsubagayatsu valleys.\nKamakura is crossed by the Namerigawa river, which goes from the Asaina Pass in northern Kamakura to the beach in Yuigahama for a total length of about . The river marks the border between Zaimokuza and Yuigahama.\nIn administrative terms, the municipality of Kamakura borders with Yokohama to the north, with Zushi to the east, and with Fujisawa to the west. It includes many areas outside the Seven Entrances as Yamanouchi, , Shichirigahama, and Ofuna, and is the result of the fusion of Kamakura proper with the cities of Koshigoe, absorbed in 1939, Ofuna, absorbed in 1948, and with the village of Fukasawa, absorbed in 1948.\nKita-Kamakura (Yamanouchi).\nNorthwest of Kamakura lies Yamanouchi, commonly called Kita-Kamakura because of the presence of East Japan Railway Company's (JR) Kita-Kamakura Station. Yamanouchi, however, was technically never a part of historical Kamakura since it is outside the Seven Entrances. Yamanouchi was the northern border of the city during the shogunate, and the important Kobukorozaka and Kamegayatsu Passes, two of Kamakura's Seven Entrances, led directly to it. Its name at the time used to be . The border post used to lie about a hundred meters past today's Kita-Kamakura train station in Ofuna's direction.\nAlthough very small, Yamanouchi is famous for its traditional atmosphere and the presence, among others, of three of the five highest-ranking Rinzai Zen temples in Kamakura, the . These three great temples were built here because Yamanouchi was the home territory of the H\u014dj\u014d clan, a branch of the Taira clan which ruled Japan for 150 years. Among Kita-Kamakura's most illustrious citizens were artist Isamu Noguchi and movie director Yasujir\u014d Ozu. Ozu is buried at Engaku-ji.\nWakamiya \u014cji and the shogunate's six avenues.\nKamakura's defining feature is Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, a Shinto shrine in the center of the city. A runs from Sagami Bay directly to the shrine. This road is known as Wakamiya \u014cji, the city's main street. Built by Minamoto no Yoritomo as an imitation of Kyoto's Suzaku \u014cji, Wakamiya \u014cji used to be much wider, delimited on both sides by a canal and flanked by pine trees.\nWalking from the beach toward the shrine, one passes through three , or Shinto gates, called respectively ('first gate'), ('second gate') and ('third gate'). Between the first and the second lies Geba Yotsukado which, as the name indicates, was the place where riders had to get off their horses in deference to Hachiman and his shrine.\nApproximately after the second , the , a raised pathway flanked by cherry trees that marks the center of Kamakura, begins. The becomes gradually wider, giving the effect of looking longer than it really is when viewed from the shrine. Its entire length is under the direct administration of the shrine. Minamoto no Yoritomo made his father-in-law H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa and his men carry by hand the stones to build it to pray for the safe delivery of his son Yoriie. The used to go all the way to Geba, but it was drastically shortened during the 19th century to make way for the newly constructed Yokosuka railroad line.\nIn Kamakura, wide streets are known as , narrower streets as , the small streets that connect the two as , and intersections as . Komachi \u014cji and Ima K\u014dji run respectively east and west of Wakamiya \u014cji, while Yoko \u014cji, the road that passes right under , and \u014cmachi \u014cji, which goes from Kotsubo to Geba and Hase, run in the east\u2013west direction. Near the remains of Hama no \u014ctorii runs Kuruma \u014cji Avenue (also called Biwa Koji). These six streets (three running north to south and three east to west) were built at the time of the shogunate and are all still under heavy use. The only one to have been modified is Kuruma \u014cji, a segment of which has disappeared.\nDemographics.\nPer Japanese census data, the population of Kamakura has remained relatively steady in recent decades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable locations.\nKamakura has many historically significant Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, some of them, like Sugimoto-dera, over 1,200 years old. K\u014dtoku-in, with its monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amida Buddha, is the most famous. A 15th-century tsunami destroyed the temple that once housed the Great Buddha, but the statue survived and has remained outdoors ever since. This iconic Daibutsu is arguably amongst the few images which have come to represent Japan in the world's collective imagination. Kamakura also hosts the so-called Five Great Zen Temples (the ).\nThe architectural heritage of Kamakura is almost unmatched, and the city has proposed some of its historic sites for inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list. Although much of the city was devastated in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923, damaged temples and shrines, founded centuries ago, have since been carefully restored.\nSome of Kamakura's highlights are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShakad\u014d Pass.\nBesides the Seven Entrances there is another great pass in the city, the huge , which connects Shakad\u014dgayatsu to the \u014cmachi and Nagoe (formerly called Nagoshi) districts.\nAccording to the plaque near the pass itself, the name derives from the fact that third Shikken H\u014dj\u014d Yasutoki built here a Shakad\u014d (a Buddhist temple devoted to Shakyamuni) dedicated to his father Yoshitoki's memory. The original location of the temple is unclear, but it was closed some time in the middle Muromachi period. The Shaka Nyorai statue that is supposed to have been its main object of cult has been declared an Important Cultural Property and is conserved at Daien-ji in Meguro, Tokyo.\nAlthough important, the pass was not considered one of the Entrances because it connected two areas both fully within Kamakura. Its date of creation is unclear, as it is not explicitly mentioned in any historical record, and it could be therefore recent. It seems very likely however that a pass which connected the Kanazawa Road to the Nagoe area called and mentioned in the in relation to an 1180 war in Kotsubo between the Miura clan and the Hatakeyama clan is indeed the Shakad\u014d Pass. In any case, the presence of two tombs within it means that it can be dated to at least the Kamakura period. It was then an important way of transit, but it was also much narrower than today and harder to pass.\nInside the pass, there are two small tombs containing some . On the Shakad\u014dgayatsu side of the pass, just before the first houses a small street on the left takes to a large group of called . There rest the bones of some of the hundreds of H\u014dj\u014d family members who committed suicide at T\u014dsh\u014d-ji after the fall of Kamakura in 1333.\nThe pass appears many times in some recent Japanese films like \"The Blue Light\", , and . The pass is presently closed to all traffic because of the danger posed by falling rocks.\nOn April 28, 2010, a day of heavy rain, a large section of rock on the Omachi side of the Shakado Pass gave way, making the road temporarily impassable for pedestrians.\ntombs.\nAn important and characteristic feature of Kamakura is a type of grave called . are caves dug on the side of hills during the Middle Ages to serve as tombs for high-ranking personalities and priests. Two famous examples are H\u014dj\u014d Masako's and Minamoto no Sanetomo's cenotaphs in Jufuku-ji's cemetery, about from Kamakura Station.\nUsually present in the cemetery of most Buddhist temples in the town, they are extremely numerous also in the hills surrounding it, and estimates of their number always put them in the thousands. can be found either isolated or in groups of even 180 graves, as in the . Many are now abandoned and in a bad state of preservation.\nThe reason why they were dug is not known, but it is thought likely that the tradition started because of the lack of flat land within the narrow limits of Kamakura's territory. Started during the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), the tradition seems to have declined during the following Muromachi period, when storehouses and cemeteries came to be preferred.\nTrue can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and even in distant Awa Province (Chiba).\nTombs in caves can also be found in the T\u014dhoku region, near Hiroshima and Kyoto, and in Ishikawa Prefecture, however they are not called and their relationship with those in Kanagawa Prefecture is unknown.\nFestivals and other events.\nKamakura has many festivals () and other events in each of the seasons, usually based on its rich historical heritage. They are often sponsored by private businesses and, unlike those in Kyoto, they are relatively small-scale events attended mostly by locals and a few tourists. January in particular has many because it is the first month of the year, so authorities, fishermen, businesses and artisans organize events to pray for their own health and safety, and for a good and prosperous working year. Kamakura's numerous temples and shrines, first among them city symbols Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and Kench\u014d-ji, organize many events too, bringing the total to over a hundred.\nTransportation.\nRail.\nJR East's Yokosuka Line has three stations within the city. \u014cfuna Station is the northernmost. Next is Kita-Kamakura Station. In the center of the city is Kamakura Station, the central railway station in the city.\nKamakura Station is the terminal for the Enoshima Electric Railway. This railway runs westward to Fujisawa, and part of its route runs parallel to the seashore. After leaving Kamakura Station, trains make eight more station stops in the city. One of them is Hase Station, closest to Hase-dera and K\u014dtoku-in. The next station on the line is Gokurakuji Station, one of the settings for the 2014 film Our Little Sister.\nEducation.\nKamakura has many educational facilities. The city operates sixteen public elementary schools and nine middle schools. The national government has one elementary and one middle school, and there are two private elementary and six private middle schools. At the next level are four prefectural and six private high schools. Also in Kamakura is a prefectural special school.\nKamakura Women's University is the city's sole university.\nGovernment and administration.\nKamakura has a mayor and a city council, all publicly elected. The mayor is Takashi Matsuo. The City Council consists of 28\u00a0members.\nSister cities.\nKamakura has six sister cities. Three are in Japan and three are overseas:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61760", "revid": "38205273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61760", "title": "Academy Award for Best International Feature Film", "text": "American film award\nThe Academy Award for Best International Feature Film (known as Best Foreign Language Film prior to 2020) is one of the Academy Awards handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\nWhen the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929, to honor films released in 1927/28, there was no separate category for foreign language films because most of the films released in 1927 and in 1928 were silent films. Between 1947 and 1955, the academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards, however, were not handed out on a regular basis (no award was given in 1953), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year. For the 1956 (29th) Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films and has been given annually since then.\nAlthough directors are the official recipients of the \"International Feature Film\" Oscar, it is not an individual accolade. The Academy considers it a collective award for the submitting country and the director on behalf of the film creatives as a whole. Initially, not even the winning film director used to be officially acknowledged as the recipient of the award. This just changed in 2014, when The Academy finally agreed to directly acknowledge filmmakers of winning International Feature Films, engraving their name on the Oscar statuette ever since. Over the years, the Best International Feature Film Award and its predecessors have been given predominantly to European films: out of the seventy-seven awards handed out by the academy since 1947 to foreign language films, sixty have gone to European films, nine to Asian films, five to films from the Americas and three to African films. Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award\u2013winning motion pictures during his lifetime, a record that remains unmatched as of 2024[ [update]] (if Special Awards are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his countryman Vittorio De Sica).\nThe most awarded foreign country is Italy, with 14 awards won (including three Special Awards) and 33 nominations, while France is the foreign country with the most nominations (41 for 12 wins, including three Special Awards). Israel is the foreign country with the most nominations (10) without winning an award, while Portugal has the most submissions (40) without a nomination. In 2020 (92nd), South Korea's entrant \"Parasite\" became the first International Feature Film winner, as well as the first non-English language film overall, to win Best Picture.\nHistory.\nWhen the first Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929, no foreign-language film was honored. During the early post-war era (1947\u20131955), eight foreign language films received Special or Honorary Awards. Academy leader and board member Jean Hersholt argued that \"an international award, if properly and carefully administered, would promote a closer relationship between American film craftsmen and those of other countries\". The first foreign language film honored with such an award was the Italian neorealist drama \"Shoeshine\", whose citation read: \"the high quality of this motion picture, brought to eloquent life in a country scarred by war, is proof to the world that the creative spirit can triumph over adversity\". In the following years, similar awards were given to seven other films: one from Italy (\"The Bicycle Thief\"), two from France (\"Monsieur Vincent\" and \"Forbidden Games\"), three from Japan (\"Rashomon\", \"Gate of Hell\" and \"\"), as well as a Franco-Italian co-production (\"The Walls of Malapaga\"). These awards, however, were handed out on a discretionary rather than a regular basis (no award was given at the 26th Academy Awards held in 1954), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year.\nA separate category for non-English-language films was created in 1956. Known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, it has been awarded every year since then. The first recipient was the Italian neorealist drama \"La Strada\", which helped establish Federico Fellini as one of the most important European directors.\nDuring the academy's board of governors meeting on April 23, 2019, it was decided that the category would be renamed Best International Feature Film beginning at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020. It was argued that the use of the term \"Foreign\" was \"outdated within the global filmmaking community\", and that the new name \"better represents this category, and promotes a positive and inclusive view of filmmaking, and the art of film as a universal experience\". Animated and documentary films would also be permitted in this category. The existing eligibility criteria remained.\nEligibility.\nUnlike other Academy Awards, the International Feature Film Award does not require films to be released in the United States in order to be eligible for competition. Films competing in the category must have been first released in the country submitting them during the eligibility period defined by the rules of the academy and must have been exhibited for at least seven consecutive days in a commercial movie theater. The eligibility period for the category differs from that required for most other categories: the awards year defined for the International Feature Film category usually begins and ends before the ordinary awards year, which corresponds to an exact calendar year. For the 80th Academy Awards, for instance, the release deadline was set on September 30, 2007, whereas the qualifying run for most other categories was extended until December 31, 2007.\nAlthough the award is commonly referred to simply as the Foreign Film Oscar in newspaper articles and on the Internet, such a designation is misleading, since a film's nationality matters much less than its language. Although a film has to be produced outside the United States in order to be nominated for the award, it also has to be in a language other than English. Foreign films with dubbed American actors can be nominated, for example, \"Battle of Neretva\" (1969) starring Orson Welles and Yul Brynner. Foreign films where most of the dialogue is in English cannot qualify for the International Feature Film Award, and the academy has usually applied this requirement very seriously by disqualifying films containing too much English dialogue, the most recent case being that of the Nigerian film \"Lionheart\" (2019). Despite the basic importance of the foreign language requirement, the 1983 Algerian dance film \"Le Bal\" and the 2024 Latvian animated film \"Flow\" were nominated despite completely lacking dialogue.\nAnother disqualifying factor is a film's television or Internet transmission before its theatrical release, hence the academy's rejection of the Dutch film \"Bluebird\" (2004). A film may also be refused if its submitting country has exercised insufficient artistic control over it. Several films have been declared ineligible by the academy for the latter reason, the most recent of which is \"Persian Lessons\" (2020), Belarus's entry for the 93rd Academy Awards. The disqualifications, however, generally take place in the pre-nomination stage, with the exception of \"A Place in the World\" (1992), Uruguay's entry for the 65th Academy Awards, which was disqualified because of insufficient Uruguayan artistic control after having secured a nomination. As of the 2021 ceremony, it is the only film to have been declared ineligible and removed from the final ballot after having been nominated in this category.\nSince the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, submitted films no longer have to be in the official language of the submitting country. This requirement had previously prevented countries from submitting films where most of the dialogue was spoken in a language that was non-native to the submitting country, and the academy's executive director explicitly cited as a reason for the rule change the case of the Italian film \"Private\" (2004), which was disqualified simply because its main spoken languages were Arabic and Hebrew, neither of which are indigenous languages of Italy. This rule change enabled a country like Canada to receive a nomination for a Hindi-language film, \"Water\". Previously, Canada had been nominated for French-language films only, since films shot in Canada's other official language (English) were ineligible for consideration for the Foreign Language Film category. Before the rule change, Canada had submitted two films in different languages\u2014the invented-language film \"A Bullet in the Head\" in 1991 and the Inuktitut language film \"\" in 2001. Inuktitut, one of the country's aboriginal languages, is not official throughout Canada, but was (and still is) official in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. Neither film earned a nomination. The rule change, however, did not affect the eligibility of non-English speaking American films, which are still disqualified from the category due to their nationality. Because of this, a Japanese-language film like \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006) or a Mayan-language film like \"Apocalypto\" (2006) was unable to compete for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, even though they were both nominated for (and, in the case of \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", won) the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which does not have similar nationality restrictions. The nationality restrictions also differ from the practice of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for their analogous award for Best Film Not in the English Language. While BAFTA Award eligibility requires a commercial release in the United Kingdom, that body does not impose a nationality restriction.\nAll films produced inside the United States have been ineligible for consideration regardless of the language of their dialogue track. This fact also included films produced in U.S. overseas possessions. However, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States and used to be eligible despite Puerto Ricans having had American citizenship since 1917. Their best success in this award was receiving a nomination for \"Santiago, the Story of his New Life\" (1989). However, in 2011 the academy decided not to allow submissions from the territory anymore.\nSubmission and nomination process.\nEvery country (excluding the United States) is invited to submit what it considers its best film to the academy. Only one film is accepted from each country. The designation of each country's official submission has to be done by an organization, jury or committee composed of people from the film industry. For example, the British entry is submitted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and the Brazilian entry is submitted by a committee under its Ministry of Culture. Names of the members of the selecting group must be sent to the academy.\nAfter each country has designated its official entry, English-subtitled copies of all submitted films are screened by the Foreign Language Film Award Committee(s), whose members select by secret ballot the five official nominations. This procedure was slightly modified for the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards: a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement, and a smaller 30-member committee, which included 10 New York City-based Academy members, spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees. The procedure was amended again for the 2020 (93rd) Academy Awards, allowing all Academy members to take part in this selection procedure. As of 2022, the two-committee system has been reinstated with an \"International Feature Film Preliminary Committee\" that shortlists fifteen films and an \"International Feature Film Nominating Committee\" that narrows down the final five nominees.\nRecipient.\nUnlike the Academy Award for Best Picture, which goes individually to the winning film's producers, the International Feature Film Award is considered a collective award for the submitting country and the film creatives as a whole. The film director is the official recipient, who has the name written on the statue plaque after the country name and movie title. For example, the Oscar statuette won by the Canadian film \"The Barbarian Invasions\" (2003) was until recently on display at the Museum of Civilization in Quebec City. It is now on display at the TIFF Bell lightbox.\nThe rules currently governing the International Feature Film category state that \"The Academy statuette (Oscar) will be awarded to the film and accepted by the director on behalf of the film\u2019s creative talents. For Academy Awards purposes, the country will be credited as the nominee. The director\u2019s name will be listed on the statuette plaque after the country and film title\". Therefore, the director is the only official recipient of the Award, accepting it during the ceremony on behalf of the film creatives. But this just has happened since the 2014 change to include the movie director as official recipient on the Oscar award. The award has always been associated collectively, except for the 1956 (29th) Academy Awards, when the names of the producers were included in the nomination for \"Best Foreign Language Film\". Therefore, officially, it is considered that a director like Federico Fellini received collectively the four Academy Awards which his films won in the \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category, with the 1992 Honorary Award being the only Oscar that Fellini won individually.\nBy contrast, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language is awarded to the director and producer\u2014that award's rules specifically state that the nomination and award is presented to the director or if \"a producer equally shared the creative input with the director, both names may be submitted. A maximum of two individuals will be nominated per film\".\nIn 2014, it was announced that the name of the director will be engraved onto the Oscar statuette in addition to the name of the country.\nCriticisms and controversies.\nBecause each country chooses its official submission according to its own rules, the decisions of the nominating bodies in each respective country are sometimes mired in controversy: for instance, the Indian selection committee (Film Federation of India) was accused of bias by Bhavna Talwar, the director of \"Dharm\" (2007), who claimed her film was rejected in favor of \"\" (2007) because of the personal connections of the latter film's director and producer. \"Vox\"'s Alissa Wilkinson argued in 2020 that countries such as China, Russia, and Iran frequently censor their submissions, ignoring films with politically controversial messages. Another major controversy came in 1985 when Akira Kurosawa's highly acclaimed \"Ran\" was not submitted for nomination by Japan, reportedly because Kurosawa was personally unpopular in the Japanese film industry.\nIn recent years, the academy's definition of the term \"country\" has caused debate. The submissions for the 75th Academy Awards, for instance, became shrouded in controversy when it was reported that Humbert Balsan, producer of the critically acclaimed Palestinian film \"Divine Intervention\" (2002), tried to submit his picture to the Academy but was told it could not run for the Foreign Language Film Award because the State of Palestine is not recognized by the academy in its rules. Because the academy previously had accepted films from other political entities such as Hong Kong, the rejection of \"Divine Intervention\" triggered accusations of double standards from pro-Palestinian activists, according to Electronic Intifada. Three years later, however, another Palestinian-Arab film, \"Paradise Now\" (2005), succeeded in getting nominated for the Foreign Language Film Award. The nomination also caused protests, this time from pro-Israeli groups in the United States, which objected to the academy's use of the name Palestine on its official website to designate the film's submitting country. After intense lobbying from pro-Israeli groups, the academy decided to designate \"Paradise Now\" as a submission from the Palestinian Authority, a move that was decried by the film's director Hany Abu-Assad. During the awards ceremony, the film eventually was announced by presenter Will Smith as a submission from \"the Palestinian territories.\"\nAnother object of controversy is the academy's \"one-country-one-film\" rule, which has been criticized by some filmmakers. Guy Lodge of \"The Guardian\" wrote in 2015 that the idea of a Best Foreign Language Film category is a \"fundamentally flawed premise\" and this is the \"most critically sneered-at of all Oscar categories\". It also stated \"In a perfect world\u2014or, at least, as perfect a world as would still allow for gaudy film-award pageantry\u2014there'd be no need for a separate best foreign language film Oscar. The fact that, after 87 years, the Academy never honored a film not predominantly in English as the year's best says everything about their own limitations, and nothing about those of world cinema\". The 2019 South Korean film \"Parasite\" was the first to win both the newly named Best International Feature Film and Best Picture in the same year.\nWinners and nominees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

K\u014dchi Prefecture has a population of 669,516 (1 April 2023) and has a geographic area of 7,103 km2 (2,742 sq mi). K\u014dchi Prefecture borders Ehime Prefecture to the northwest and Tokushima Prefecture to the northeast.\nK\u014dchi is the capital and largest city of K\u014dchi Prefecture, with other major cities including Nankoku, Shimanto, and K\u014dnan. K\u014dchi Prefecture is located on Japan's Pacific coast surrounding a large bay in the south of Shikoku, with the southernmost point of the island located at Cape Ashizuri in Tosashimizu. K\u014dchi Prefecture is home to K\u014dchi Castle, considered the most intact Japanese castle, and the Shimanto River, one of the few undammed rivers in Japan.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nBefore the Ritsury\u014d System.\nIn the Kujiki, first recorded governments in K\u014dchi Prefecture were Hata (in the west) and Tosa (in the center). Hata was established first, so it is thought that it had more influence and contact with the Yamato court. Written records from this time period are sparse, however it is believed that the first governors of Hata and Tosa were from the Kamo clan based in modern Osaka.\nAfter the Ritsury\u014d System.\nIn the Nihon Shoki, the first report from an official in the K\u014dchi region described the damages caused by the 684 Hakuh\u014d earthquake. From this report, it can be inferred that by 684 at the latest, the Tosa Province (a predecessor to modern-day K\u014dchi Prefecture) had been established. The first report from a named official was written by Hiketa no Mushiro in 743.\nUp until the Genpei War, 106 governors were appointed to govern the Tosa Province. Eventually, like many other provinces Tosa also was appointed absentee governors, given additional rights, and began amassing wealth. Due to being located far from the capital, many prisoners were exiled to the Tosa Province.\nMiddle Ages.\nKamakura period.\nThe Kamakura Shogunate was established at the end of the 12th century. Since Tosa Province was allied to the winning Minamoto Clan in the Genpei War, it quickly fell under the influence of the shogunate. Kajiwara Tomokage was appointed as the first military governor of the Tosa Province. Eventually, the H\u014dj\u014d Clan began serving as the military governor for the province.\nMuromachi period.\nAfter the fall of the Kamakura Shoguante, Ashikaga Takauji was defeated in battle and forced to retreat to Kyushu. Shikoku Island later fell under the control of the Hosokawa Clan. \nK\u014dchi Prefecture was historically known as Tosa Province and was controlled by the Ch\u014dsokabe clan in the Sengoku period and the Yamauchi clan during the Edo period.\nK\u014dchi city is also the birthplace of noted revolutionary Sakamoto Ry\u014dma, who became one of the main instigators of the Meiji Restoration.\nGeography.\nK\u014dchi Prefecture comprises the southwestern part of the island of Shikoku, facing the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Ehime to the north-west and Tokushima to the north-east. It is the largest but least populous of Shikoku's four prefectures. Most of the province is mountainous, and in only a few areas such as around K\u014dchi and Nakamura is there a coastal plain. K\u014dchi is famous for its many rivers. Inamura-yama in Tosa-cho is the highest peak in K\u014dchi prefecture with an altitude of 1,506 meters above sea level.\nK\u014dchi Prefecture has the highest percentage of land covered in mountains out of all Japanese prefectures at 89% with the national average being 66%. The highest peak in K\u014dchi Prefecture is Mt. Miune at 1,894 meters (the highest peak in K\u014dchi Prefecture is Tebakoyama at 1,806 meters). Due to its location in the Shimanto Group geological area, K\u014dchi Prefecture has many sedimentary rocks and is prone to landslides. K\u014dchi Prefecture has many rivers such as the Shimanto River in the western part of the prefecture, Niyodo River flowing from Mount Ishizuchi into the Tosa Bay, and Yoshino River flowing into Tokushima Prefecture.\nHistorically, K\u014dchi Prefecture has not suffered from a lack of water, however river management has been a consistent issue. In the early Edo Period, samurai Nonaka Kenzan oversaw large scale improvements to the Tosa Domain's major rivers. Modern K\u014dchi Prefecture is known for its river management and minimal water damage despite receiving a large amount of rainfall.\nThe Kuroshio Current flows by K\u014dchi Prefecture's coast. The climate of K\u014dchi Prefecture is heavily influenced by the Kuroshio Current. Even during the winter the water is still warm, and causes frequent typhoons. K\u014dchi Prefecture experiences the 2nd most typhoons out of all the Japanese prefectures after Kagoshima Prefecture. The 1934 Muroto Typhoon was especially notorious, with the lowest central pressure of any recorded typhoon in Japan at 911.6 hPa when it made landfall on the Muroto Cape. The Ashizuri and Muroto capes are known for their strong winds.\nAs of April 1, 2012, 7% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park; Ishizuchi, Muroto-Anan Kaigan, and Tsurugisan Quasi-National Parks; and eighteen Prefectural Natural Parks.\nCities.\nEleven cities are located in K\u014dchi Prefecture:\nTowns and villages.\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\nMedia.\nVarious movies have been set in K\u014dchi. These include the following:\nThe 1993 \"Studio Ghibli\" movie Ocean Waves (Umi ga Kikoeru).\nThe 2009 movie \"The Harimaya Bridge\" starring Danny Glover.\nThe 2013 movie Hospitality Department (Kencho Omotenashi Ka), which shows views of K\u014dchi Prefecture.\nThe 2021 movie Belle (Ry\u016b to Sobakasu no Hime).\nCulture.\nFood.\nLike most areas of Japan, K\u014dchi advertises itself as specializing in a major food item, often known as \"meibutsu\". K\u014dchi's is katsuo no tataki \u2013 skipjack tuna or bonito which is lightly seared. Traditionally this is done over the straw generated as a by-product of the rice harvest.\nSawachi is a term which refers to \"a style of meal\" in Kochi prefecture, according to Kochi-City Tourism Association. It says that the characteristic of the style of eating is \"its freeness in the arrangement of food on a large dish\" People eat Sawachi in the situation of \"Enkai\" which refers to a gathering of family, friends and relatives. They surround \"Sawachi\", feasts on large dishes, and take own portions by themselves. The style represents the cultural climate of Kochi Prefecture, which dislikes formal arrangements and respects freedom.\nSports.\nThe sports teams listed below are based in K\u014dchi.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It is a group of related taxonomic orders. Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are domain, kingdom, phylum, order, family, genus, and species, with class ranking between phylum and order.\nHistory.\nThe class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name \u2013 and not just called a \"top-level genus\" () \u2013 was first introduced by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in the classification of plants that appeared in his \"El\u00e9ments de botanique\" of 1694.\nInsofar as a general definition of a class is available, it has historically been conceived as embracing taxa that combine a distinct \"grade\" of organization\u2014i.e. a 'level of complexity', measured in terms of how differentiated their organ systems are into distinct regions or sub-organs\u2014with a distinct \"type\" of construction, which is to say a particular layout of organ systems.

Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient \"artificial key\" according to his \"Systema Sexuale\", largely based on the arrangement of flowers. In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the APG system in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the flowering plants up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal clades. Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.\nThe class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until George Cuvier's \"embranchements\", first called Phyla by Ernst Haeckel, were introduced in the early nineteenth century.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61763", "revid": "1313699834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61763", "title": "Order (biology)", "text": "Taxonomic rank between class and family\nOrder () is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between family and class. In biological classification, the order is a taxonomic rank used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the nomenclature codes. An immediately higher rank, superorder, is sometimes added directly above order, with suborder directly beneath order. An order can also be defined as a group of related families.\nWhat does and does not belong to each order is determined by a taxonomist, as is whether a particular order should be recognized at all. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a different position. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing or recognizing an order. Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognized only rarely.\nThe name of an order is usually written with a capital letter. For some groups of organisms, their orders may follow consistent naming schemes. Orders of plants, fungi, and algae use the suffix (e.g. Dictyotales). Orders of birds and fishes use the Latin suffix meaning 'having the form of' (e.g. Passeriformes), most orders of insects use the suffix meaning 'wing', but orders of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are not so consistent (e.g. Artiodactyla, Anura, Crocodylia, Actiniaria, Primates).\nHierarchy of ranks.\nZoology.\nFor some clades covered by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, several additional classifications are sometimes used, although not all of these are officially recognized.\nIn their 1997 classification of mammals, McKenna and Bell used two extra levels between superorder and order: \"grandorder\" and \"mirorder\". Michael Novacek (1986) inserted them at the same position. Michael Benton (2005) inserted them between superorder and magnorder instead. This position was adopted by \"Systema Naturae 2000\" and others.\nBotany.\nIn botany, the ranks of subclass and suborder are secondary ranks pre-defined as respectively above and below the rank of order. Any number of further ranks can be used as long as they are clearly defined.\nThe superorder rank is commonly used, with the ending that was initiated by Armen Takhtajan's publications from 1966 onwards.\nHistory.\nThe order as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a \"higher genus\" ()) was first introduced by the German botanist Augustus Quirinus Rivinus in his classification of plants that appeared in a series of treatises in the 1690s. Carl Linnaeus was the first to apply it consistently to the division of all three kingdoms of nature (then minerals, plants, and animals) in his \"Systema Naturae\" (1735, 1st. Ed.).\nBotany.\nFor plants, Linnaeus' orders in the \"Systema Naturae\" and the \"Species Plantarum\" were strictly artificial, introduced to subdivide the artificial classes into more comprehensible smaller groups. When the word was first consistently used for natural units of plants, in 19th-century works such as the \"Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis\" of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and the \"Genera Plantarum\" of Bentham &amp; Hooker, it indicated taxa that are now given the rank of family (see ordo naturalis, \"'natural order\"').\nIn French botanical publications, from Michel Adanson's (1763) and until the end of the 19th century, the word (plural: ) was used as a French equivalent for this Latin . This equivalence was explicitly stated in the 's (1868), the precursor of the currently used \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\".\nIn the first international \"Rules\" of botanical nomenclature from the International Botanical Congress of 1905, the word \"family\" () was assigned to the rank indicated by the French , while order () was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the 19th century had often been named a 'cohort' (, plural ).\nSome of the plant families still retain the names of Linnaean \"natural orders\" or even the names of pre-Linnaean natural groups recognized by Linnaeus as orders in his natural classification (e.g. \"Palmae\" or \"Labiatae\"). Such names are known as descriptive family names.\nZoology.\nIn the field of zoology, the Linnaean orders were used more consistently. That is, the orders in the zoology part of the \"Systema Naturae\" refer to natural groups. Some of his ordinal names are still in use, e.g. Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, midges, and gnats).\nVirology.\nFrom 1991 to 2017, order was the highest rank used to classify viruses in a system that ranged from order to species. In 2018, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which oversees virus taxonomy, added ranks higher than order up to the highest taxonomic rank of realm. Virus orders are indicated by the suffix -\"virales\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of several locations claimed to be the biblical Mount Sinai, the place where, according to the sacred scriptures of the three major Abrahamic religions (Torah, Bible, and Quran), the Hebrew prophet Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.\nIt is a mountain near the city of Saint Catherine in the region known today as the Sinai Peninsula. It is surrounded on all sides by higher peaks in the mountain range of which it is a part. For example, it lies next to Mount Catherine which, at , is the highest peak in Egypt.\nGeology.\nMount Sinai's rocks were formed during the late stage of the evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Mount Sinai displays a ring complex that consists of alkaline granites intruded into diverse rock types, including volcanics. The granites range in composition from syenogranite to alkali feldspar granite. The volcanic rocks are alkaline to peralkaline, and they are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and subvolcanic porphyry.\nReligious significance.\nJudaism and Christianity.\nImmediately north of the mountain is the 6th-century Saint Catherine's Monastery. The summit has a mosque that is still used by Muslims, and a Greek Orthodox chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th-century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical Tablets of Stone. At the summit also is \"Moses' cave\", where the Hebrew prophet Moses is believed to have waited to receive the Ten Commandments from God.\nIslam.\nThe Jabal Musa is associated with the Islamic prophet M\u016bs\u0101 ibn \u02bfImr\u0101n (i.e., Moses). In particular, numerous references to Jabal Musa exist in the Quran, where it is called \"\u1e6c\u016br Sain\u0101\u02be\", \"\u1e6c\u016br S\u012bn\u012bn\", and \"a\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u016br\" and \"al-Jabal\" (both meaning \"the Mount\"). As for the adjacent \"W\u0101d \u1e6cuw\u0101\" (Valley of Tuwa), it is considered as being \"muqaddas\" (sacred), and a part of it is called \"Al-Buq\u02bfah Al-Mub\u0101rakah\" (\"The blessed Place\").\nAscent and summit.\nThere are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route, \"Siket El Bashait\", takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though camels can be used. The steeper, more direct route (\"Siket Sayidna Musa\") is up the 3,750 \"steps of penitence\" in the ravine behind the monastery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61770", "revid": "45653001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61770", "title": "Bedouin", "text": "Nomadic Arab tribes\nThe Bedouin, Beduin, or Bedu ( ; , singular ) are pastorally nomadic Arab tribes who have historically inhabited the desert regions in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, the Levant, and Mesopotamia (Iraq/Kuwait). The Bedouin originated in the Syrian Desert and Arabian Desert but spread across the rest of the Arab world in West Asia and North Africa after the spread of Islam. The English word \"bedouin\" comes from the Arabic \"badaw\u012b\", which means \"desert-dweller\", and is traditionally contrasted with \"\u1e25\u0101\u1e0dir\", the term for sedentary people. Bedouin territory stretches from the vast deserts of North Africa to the rocky ones of the Middle East. They are sometimes traditionally divided into tribes, or clans (known in Arabic as \"\u02bfa\u0161\u0101\u02beir\"; or \"qab\u0101\u02beil\" ), and historically share a common culture of herding camels, sheep and goats. The vast majority of Bedouins adhere to Islam, although there are a small number of Christian Bedouins present in the Fertile Crescent.\nBedouins have been referred to by various names throughout history, including \"Arabaa\" by the Assyrians (\"ar-ba-ea\"), being a nisba of the noun \"Arab\", a name still used for Bedouins today. They are referred to as the \"\u02beA\u02bfr\u0101b\" () \"a\u025br\u0101b\" in Arabic. While many Bedouins have abandoned their nomadic and tribal traditions for a modern urban lifestyle, others retain traditional Bedouin culture such as the traditional \"\u02bfa\u0161\u0101\u02beir\" clan structure, traditional music, poetry, dances (such as \"saas\"), and many other cultural practices and concepts. Some urbanized Bedouins often organise cultural festivals, usually held several times a year, in which they gather with other Bedouins to partake in and learn about various Bedouin traditions\u2014from poetry recitation and traditional sword dances to playing traditional instruments and even classes teaching traditional tent knitting. Traditions like camel riding and camping in the deserts are still popular leisure activities for urban Bedouins who live in close proximity to deserts or other wilderness areas.\nSociety.\nA widely quoted Bedouin adage is \"I am against my brother, my brother and I are against my cousin, my cousin and I are against the stranger\" sometimes quoted as \"I and my brother are against my cousin, I and my cousin are against the stranger.\" This saying signifies a hierarchy of loyalties based on the proximity of some person to oneself, beginning with the self, and proceeding through the immediate family as defined by male kinship, and then, in principle at least, to an entire genetic or linguistic group (which is perceived as akin to kinship in the Middle East and North Africa generally). Disputes are settled, interests are pursued, and justice and order are dispensed and maintained by means of this framework, organized according to an ethic of self-help and collective responsibility (Andersen 14). The individual family unit (referred to as a tent or \"\") usually traditionally comprised three or four adults (a married couple plus siblings or parents) and any number of children.\nBedouin tribes were not controlled by a central power, like a government or empire, but rather were led by tribal chiefs. Some chiefs exercised their power from oases, where merchants would organise trade through the territory controlled by the tribe. The structure of Bedouin tribes were held together more so by shared feelings of common ancestry rather than a tribal chief atop the hierarchy.\nThe Bedouins' ethos comprises courage, hospitality, loyalty to family and pride of ancestry. Bedouin society typically revolved around \ntraditional Honor codes of the Bedouin, and Bedouin systems of justice, such as the well known \"bisha'a\", or ordeal by fire, a well-known Bedouin practice of lie detection.\nTraditions.\nHerding.\nLivestock and herding, principally of goats, sheep and dromedary camels comprised the traditional livelihoods of Bedouins. These were used for meat, dairy products, and wool. Most of the staple foods that made up the Bedouins' diet were dairy products.\nCamels, in particular, had numerous cultural and functional uses. Having been regarded as a \"gift from God\", they were the main food source and method of transportation for many Bedouins. In addition to their extraordinary milking potentials under harsh desert conditions, their meat was occasionally consumed by Bedouins. As a cultural tradition, camel races were organized during celebratory occasions, such as weddings or religious festivals.\nSome Bedouin societies live in arid regions. In areas where rainfall is very unpredictable, a camp will be moved irregularly, depending on the availability of green pasture. Where winter rainfall is more predictable in regions further south, some Bedouin people plant grain along their migration routes. This proves a resource for the livestock throughout the winter. In regions such as western Africa, where there is more predictable rainfall, the Bedouin practice transhumance. They plant crops near permanent homes in the valleys where there is more rain and move their livestock to the highland pastures.\nOral poetry.\nOral poetry is the most popular art form among Bedouins. Having a poet in one's tribe was highly regarded in society. In addition to serving as a form of art, poetry was used as a means of conveying information and social control. Bedouin poetry, also known as nabati poetry, is often recited in the vernacular dialect. In contrast, the more common forms of Arabic poetry are often in Modern Standard Arabic.\nRaiding or \"ghazw\".\nThe well-regulated traditional habit of Bedouin tribes of raiding other tribes, caravans, or settlements is known in Arabic as \"ghazw\".\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHistorically, the Bedouin engaged in nomadic herding, agriculture and sometimes fishing in the Syrian steppe since 6000 BCE. By about 850 BCE, a complex network of settlements and camps was established. The earliest Arab tribes emerged from Bedouins.\nBy the time of the Roman Empire's establishment, the Bedouin national identity had been established and they were recognizable as a single people with often warring \"families, clans, and tribes\". A major source of income for this people was the taxation of caravans, and tributes collected from non-Bedouin settlements. They also earned income by transporting goods and people in caravans pulled by domesticated camels across the desert. Scarcity of water and of permanent pastoral land required them to move constantly.\nThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta reported that in 1326 on the route to Gaza, the Egyptian authorities had a customs post at Qatya on the north coast of Sinai. Here Bedouin were being used to guard the road and track down those trying to cross the border without permission.\nThe Early Medieval grammarians and scholars seeking to develop a system of standardizing the contemporary Classical Arabic for maximal intelligibility across the Arabophone areas, believed that the Bedouin spoke the purest, most conservative variety of the language. To solve irregularities of pronunciation, the Bedouin were asked to recite certain poems, whereafter consensus was relied on to decide the pronunciation and spelling of a given word.\nOttoman period.\nA plunder and massacre of the Hajj caravan by Bedouin tribesmen occurred in 1757, led by Qa'dan al-Fayez of the Bani Sakher tribe (modern-day Jordan) in his vengeance against the Ottomans for failing to pay his tribe for their help protecting the pilgrims. An estimated 20,000 pilgrims were either killed in the raid or died of hunger or thirst as a result including relatives of the Sultan and Musa Pasha. Although Bedouin raids on Hajj caravans were fairly common, the 1757 raid represented the peak of such attacks which was also likely prompted by the major drought of 1756.\nUnder the Tanzimat land reforms of 1858, a new Ottoman land law was issued, which offered legal grounds for the displacement of the Bedouin (Turkish: Bedeviler). As the Ottoman Empire gradually lost power, this law instituted an unprecedented land registration process that was also meant to boost the empire's tax base. Few Bedouin opted to register their lands with the Ottoman Tapu, due to lack of enforcement by the Ottomans, illiteracy, refusal to pay taxes and lack of relevance of written documentation of ownership to the Bedouin way of life at that time. Some scholars, such as Nora Elizabeth Barakat, believe the displacement of the Bedouin had its roots in events even earlier than the 1858 land reforms, for example in an 1844 Anatolia-specific decree recognizing the \"tribe\" as a formal unit of administration. The goal of these early reforms was to weaken local Bedouin magistrates and limit what she terms as \"rural mobility\", the ability of these local Bedouins to, independently of the Ottoman state, accumulate wealth through the wheat trade and other means.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II settled Muslim populations (Circassians) from the Balkans and the Caucasus among areas predominantly populated by the nomads in the regions of modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine, and also created several permanent Bedouin settlements, although the majority of them did not remain. The settlement of non Arabs in the traditionally Bedouin areas was a big cause of discontent. This became even severe because every Arab tribe, including the settled ones, have ancestry as a Bedouin.\nOttoman authorities also initiated private acquisition of large plots of state land offered by the sultan to the absentee landowners (effendis). Numerous tenants were brought in order to cultivate the newly acquired lands. Often it came at the expense of the Bedouin lands.\nIn the late 19th century, many Bedouin began transition to a semi-nomadic lifestyle. One of the factors was the influence of the Ottoman authorities who started a forced sedentarization of the Bedouin living on its territory. The Ottoman authorities viewed the Bedouin as a threat to the state's control and worked hard on establishing law and order in the Negev. During the First World War, the Negev Bedouin initially fought with the Ottomans against the British. However, under the influence of British agent T. E. Lawrence, the Bedouins switched side and fought against the Ottomans. Hamad Pasha al-Sufi (died 1923), Sheikh of the Nijmat sub-tribe of the Tarabin, led a force of 1,500 men who joined the Ottoman raid on the Suez Canal.\nIn Orientalist historiography, the Negev Bedouin have been described as remaining largely unaffected by changes in the outside world until recently. Their society was often considered a \"world without time\". Recent scholars have challenged the notion of the Bedouin as 'fossilized,' or 'stagnant' reflections of an unchanging desert culture. Emanuel Marx has shown that Bedouin were engaged in a constantly dynamic reciprocal relation with urban centers. Bedouin scholar Michael Meeker explains that \"the city was to be found in their midst.\"\nAt the time of World War I, a Qays Bedouin tribe from Harran, not far from Urfa, settled in L\u00fcleburgaz in East Thrace under their last Sheikh Salih Abdullah. It is said that this tribe was originally from Tihamah.\nIn the 20th century.\nGhazzu was still relevant to the Bedouin lifestyle in the early 20th century. After a 1925 stay with Sheikh Mithqal Al-Fayez of the Bani Sakher, William Seabrook wrote about his experience of a ghazzu from the Sardieh tribe on Mithqal's 500 Hejin racing camels. The ghazzu was intercepted by Mithqal when he was notified about the Sardieh tribe's intentions from a man from the Bani Hassan tribe, who rode continuously for over 30 hours to reach Mithqal before their plot matured. Mithqal, using the information, prepared a trap for them, which resulted in the imprisonment of one of the Sardieh warriors. William notes that although the warrior was a prisoner, he was nonchalant and was not treated aggressively, and that the ghazzu wasn't a war, but a game in which camels and goats were the prizes.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, large numbers of Bedouin throughout Midwest Asia started to leave the traditional, nomadic life to settle in the cities of Midwest Asia, especially as hot ranges shrank and populations grew. For example, in Syria, the Bedouin way of life effectively ended during a severe drought from 1958 to 1961, which forced many Bedouin to abandon herding for standard jobs. Similarly, governmental policies in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Tunisia, oil-producing Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Libya, as well as a desire for improved standards of living, effectively led most Bedouin to become settled citizens of various nations, rather than stateless nomadic herders.\nGovernmental policies pressing the Bedouin have in some cases been executed in an attempt to provide service (schools, health care, law enforcement and so on\u2014see Chatty 1986 for examples), but in others have been based on the desire to seize land traditionally roved and controlled by the Bedouin. In recent years, some Bedouin have adopted the pastime of raising and breeding white doves, while others have rejuvenated the traditional practice of falconry.\nIn different countries.\nSaudi Arabia.\nThe Arabian Peninsula was one of the original homes of the Bedouin. From there, they started to spread out to surrounding deserts, forced out by the lack of water and food. According to tradition, Arabian Bedouin tribes are descendants of two groups: Qahtanis, also known as Yaman, who originate from the mountains of Southwestern Arabia, and claim descent from a semi-legendary ancestral figure, Qahtan (often linked to the biblical Joktan), and Adnanis, also known as Qays, who originate in North-Central Arabia and claimed descent from Adnan, a descendant of the Biblical Ishmael.\nA number of Bedouin tribes reside in Saudi Arabia. Among them are Anazzah, Juhaynah, Shammar, al-Murrah, Mahra, Dawasir, Harb, Ghamid, Mutayr, Subay', 'Utayba, Bani khalid, Qahtan, Rashaida, and Banu Yam. Saudi Arabia pursued a policy of sedentarization in the early 20th century, which was initially linked with the establishment of the Ikhwan. As a result of this policy and subsequent modernization, the number of Bedouin that retain their nomadic lifestyle has decreased rapidly.\nAccording to Ali Al-Naimi, the Bedouin, or Bedu, would travel in family and tribal groups, across the Arabian Peninsula in groups of fifty to a hundred. A clan was composed of a number of families, while a number of clans formed a tribe. Tribes would have areas reserved for their livestock called dirahs, which included wells for their exclusive use. They lived in black goat-hair tents called bayt al-shar, divided by cloth curtains into rug-floor areas for males, family and cooking. In Hofuf, they bartered their sheep, goats and camels, including milk and wool, for grain and other staples. Al-Naimi also quotes Paul Harrison's observation of the Bedouin, \"There seems to be no limit at all to their endurance.\"\nSyria.\nThe Syrian Desert was the original homeland of the Arab Bedouin tribes which have been mentioned as far back as the Neo-Assyrian era where they're referred to by Tiglath-Pileser III as being among the Syrians integrated into the Assyrian administrative system. Today there are over a million Bedouin living in Syria, making a living herding sheep and goats. The largest Bedouin clan in Syria is called Ruwallah who are part of the 'Anizzah' tribe. Another famous branch of the Anizzah tribe is the two distinct groups of Hasana and S'baa who largely arrived from the Arabian peninsula in the 18th century.\nHerding among the Bedouin was common until the late 1950s, when it effectively ended during a severe drought from 1958 to 1961. Due to the drought, many Bedouin were forced to give up herding for standard jobs. Another factor was the formal annulling of the Bedouin tribes' legal status in Syrian law in 1958, along with attempts of the ruling Ba'ath Party regime to wipe out tribalism. Preferences for customary law ('urf) in contrast to state law (qanun) have been informally acknowledged and tolerated by the state in order to avoid having its authority tested in the tribal territories. In 1982 the al-Assad family turned to the Bedouin tribe leaders for assistance during the Muslim Brotherhood uprising against al-Assad government (see 1982 Hama massacre). The Bedouin sheikhs' decision to support Hafez al-Assad led to a change in attitude on the part of the government that permitted the Bedouin leadership to manage and transform critical state development efforts supporting their own status, customs and leadership.\nThere are numerous types of Bedouins in Syria:\nHourani Bedouins, which are from the Daraa Governorate &amp; Quneitra Governorate, these Bedouins are closely related to Jordanians.\nMesopotamian Bedouins, which are from East and South of the Aleppo Governorate, Raqqa Governorate, Al-Hasakah Governorate &amp; Deir ez-Zor Governorate, these Bedouins are closely related to Iraqis.\nThere are also a few Bedouin tribes in the Rif Dimashq Governorate, Homs Governorate, and Hama Governorate.\nMany Syrians have some Arab origin if not predominantly Arab. Religion does not play a role in the genetic makeup of a Syrian. There are Christian Syrians who have a more predominant Arab origin than Muslim Syrians. Therefore many Syrians have some sort of Bedouin Arab origin, since Arabs migrated from Yemen and Saudi Arabia into Syria.\nAs a result of the Syrian Civil War, some Bedouins became refugees and found shelter in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and other states.\nLebanon.\nBedouins are concentrated in the Beqaa Governorate, although they form a minority there. Many Lebanese people from all over Lebanon have some Arab Bedouin origins, since Arabs migrated to Lebanon from Yemen &amp; Saudi Arabia.\nIn the present day, Bedouin communities, particularly in Lebanon\u2019s southern border region, have undergone significant socio-cultural changes, shifting from a traditionally nomadic lifestyle to settled farming, including tobacco cultivation. Additionally, increased border demarcations, such as those between Lebanon and Israel, have separated many Bedouin families, although kinship ties do remain. \"Bedu\" have become increasingly connected to the sectarian political system. According to Munira Khayyat, \"[t]oday the main identifying quality of \"bedu\", like all of the communities that inhabit the borderland (and all citizens of Lebanon), is their sectarian identity\", with Bedouin communities being \"claimed and cultivated\".\nPalestine.\nPalestinian Bedouins were originally from the Negev Desert. In the course of the 1948 Palestine war, they fled or were displaced from their land. Other Bedouins were expelled from the Negev in 1953 and had relocated to the West Bank, which at the time belonged to Jordan. Today, there are 40,000 Bedouins in the whole of the West Bank, including 27,000 people under Israeli military control in Area C. Unlike Negev Bedouins, West Bank Bedouins are not Israeli citizens. Bedouin communities in the West bank have been targeted with forcible relocations to townships to accommodate the growth of illegal Israeli settlements on the outskirts of East Jerusalem. Bedouins also live in the Gaza Strip, including 5,000 in Om al-Nasr. However, the number of nomadic Bedouins is shrinking and many are now settled.\nIsrael.\nPrior to the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence, an estimated 65,000\u201390,000 Bedouins lived in the Negev desert. According to \"Encyclopedia Judaica\", 15,000 Bedouin remained in the Negev after 1948; other sources put the number as low as 11,000. Another source states that in 1999 110,000 Bedouins lived in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee and 10,000 in the central region of Israel. All of the Bedouins residing in Israel were granted Israeli citizenship in 1954. As of 2020, there are 210,000 Bedouins in Israel: 150,000 in the Negev, 50,000 in Galilee and the Jezreel Valley, and 10,000 in the central region of Israel. Galilee Bedouins have been living in the northern part of Israel for four centuries. Today, they live in 28 settlements in the north. They also live in mixed villages with other non-Bedouin Arabs.The Bedouin who remained in the Negev belonged to the Tiaha confederation as well as some smaller groups such as the 'Azazme and the Jahalin. After 1948, some Negev Bedouins were displaced. The Jahalin tribe, for instance, lived in the Tel Arad region of the Negev prior to the 1950s. In the early 1950s, the Jahalin were among the tribes that, according to Emanuel Marx, \"moved or were removed by the military government\". They ended up in the so-called E1 area East of Jerusalem.\nFamously, Bedouin shepherds were the first to discover the Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of Jewish texts from antiquity, in the Judean caves of Qumran in 1946. Of great religious, cultural, historical and linguistic significance, 972 texts were found over the following decade, many of which were discovered by Bedouins. In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year economic development plan called the \"Prawer plan\". One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships. In a 2012 resolution the European Parliament called for the withdrawal of the Prawer plan and respect for the rights of the Bedouin people. In September 2014, Yair Shamir, who heads the Israeli government's ministerial committee on Bedouin resettlement arrangements, stated that the government was examining ways to lower the birthrate of the Bedouin community in order to improve its standard of living. Shamir claimed that without intervention, the Bedouin population could exceed half a million by 2035.\nIn May 2015, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees have combined forces. Both organizations called on Israel to stop its plans to relocate Bedouin communities currently living in the West Bank to land outside of Jerusalem for better access to infrastructure, health, and education. Officials stated that a \"forcible transfer\" of over 7000 Bedouin people would \"destroy their culture and livelihoods.\"\nJordan.\nMost of the Bedouin tribes migrated from the Arabian Peninsula to what is Jordan today between the 14th and 18th centuries. They are often referred to as a backbone of the Kingdom, since Bedouin clans traditionally support the monarchy.\nMost of Jordan's Bedouin live in the vast wasteland that extends east from the Desert Highway. The eastern Bedouin are camel breeders and herders, while the western Bedouin herd sheep and goats. Some Bedouin in Jordan are semi-nomads, they adopt a nomadic existence during part of the year but return to their lands and homes in time to practice agriculture.\nThe largest nomadic groups of Jordan are the Bani Hasan (Mafraq, Zarqa, Jarash, Ajloun and parts of Amman) Bani \u1e62akher (Amman and Madaba) Ban\u016b Laith (Petra), and Ban\u016b al-\u1e24uway\u1e6d\u0101t (they reside in Wadi Rum). There are numerous lesser groups, such as the al-Sir\u1e25\u0101n, Ban\u016b Kh\u0101lid, Hawazim, \u02bfA\u1e6diyyah, and Sharaf\u0101t. The Ruw\u0101lah (Rwala) tribe, which is not indigenous, passes through Jordan in its yearly wandering from Syria to Saudi Arabia. The region encompassing Wadi Musa and Petra is inhabited by the prominent Liyathnah tribe alongside the smaller Bedul community, believed to have Jewish or Nabataean ancestry. The Hijazeen are a Christian Bedouin tribe located in Jordan with roots in the Hejaz of present-day Saudi Arabia.\nThe Jordanian government provides the Bedouin with different services such as education, housing and health clinics. However, some Bedouins give it up and prefer their traditional nomadic lifestyle.\nIn the recent years, there is a growing discontent of the Bedouin with the ruling monarch Abdullah II of Jordan. In August 2007, police clashed with some 200 Bedouins who were blocking the main highway between Amman and the port of Aqaba. Livestock herders were protesting the government's lack of support in the face of the steeply rising cost of animal feed and expressed resentment about government assistance to refugees.\nArab Spring events in 2011 led to demonstrations in Jordan, and Bedouins took part in them. But the Hashemites did not see a revolt similar to turbulence in other Arab states. The main reasons for that are the high respect to the monarch and contradictory interests of different groups of the Jordanian society. The King Abdullah II maintains his distance from the complaints by allowing blame to fall on government ministers, whom he replaces at will.\nEgypt.\nBedouins in Egypt mostly reside in the Sinai Peninsula, Matruh, Red Sea governate, eastern parts of Sharqia governate, Suez, Ismailia and in the suburbs of the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Traditional Bedouin culture was affected by the establishment of resort towns on the Red Sea coast, such as Sharm el-Sheikh. In the wake of urbanization and educational opportunities, many Bedouins now marry outside their tribe, a practice that once was frowned upon.\nBedouins living in the Sinai Peninsula did not benefit much from the construction boom due to the low wages offered. Sudanese and Egyptian workers were brought in as construction workers instead. When the tourist industry started to bloom, local Bedouins became cab drivers, tour guides and managers of campgrounds and coffee shops. Tarabin and other Bedouin tribes living along the border between Egypt and Israel have been involved in inter-border smuggling of drugs and weapons, as well as infiltration of prostitutes and African labour workers.\nIn most countries in the Middle East, the Bedouin have no land rights, only users' privileges, and it is especially true for Egypt. Since the mid-1980s, the Bedouins who held desirable coastal property have lost control of much of their land as it was sold by the Egyptian government to hotel operators. The Egyptian government did not see the land as belonging to Bedouin tribes, but rather as state property.\nIn the summer of 1999, the Egyptian army bulldozed Bedouin-run tourist campgrounds north of Nuweiba as part of the final phase of hotel development overseen by the Tourist Development Agency (TDA). The director of the Tourist Development Agency dismissed Bedouin rights to most of the land, saying that they had not lived on the coast prior to 1982. Their traditional semi-nomadic culture has left Bedouins vulnerable to such claims.\nThe Egyptian Revolution of 2011 brought more freedom to the Sinai Bedouin, but since they were \ninvolved in drug smuggling into Gaza, the Egyptian army demolished over 120 tunnels that were used as smuggling channels, compelling them to cooperate with state troops and officials. After negotiations, the military campaign ended with a new agreement between the Bedouin and Egyptian authorities.\nMaghreb.\nThe Arab migration to the Maghreb had been a centuries-long process that continuously occurred since the 7th century. The initial waves of migration from the 7th to the 10th centuries mostly involved sedentary Arabs who established communities in cities, towns and surrounding rural areas. However, the Arab migrations from the 11th to the 15th centuries involved a significant influx of a great amount of nomadic Bedouin tribes to the region.\nIn the 11th century, the Bedouin tribes of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, who originated from central and north Arabia respectively, living at the time in a desert between the Nile and the Red Sea, moved westward into the Maghreb areas and were joined by the Bedouin tribe of Ma'qil, which had its roots in South Arabia, as well as other Arab tribes.\nThe 11th century witnessed the most significant wave of Arab migration, surpassing all previous movements. This event unfolded when the Zirid dynasty of Ifriqiya proclaimed its independence from the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. In retribution against the Zirids, the Fatimids dispatched large Bedouin Arab tribes, mainly the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, to defeat the Zirids and settle in the Maghreb. These tribes followed a nomadic lifestyle and were originally from the Hejaz and Najd. They were later joined by the Bedouin tribe of Ma'qil, which had its roots in South Arabia, as well as other Arab tribes.\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun, they were accompanied by their wives, children and stock. They settled in the Maghreb after repeatedly fighting battles against the Berbers, such as the Battle of Haydaran. They heavily transformed the culture of the Maghreb into Arab culture, and spread nomadism in areas where agriculture was previously dominant. It played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara. In addition, they destroyed the Berber Zirid state and most of its cities, sparing only the Mediterranean coastal strip at al-Mahdiyya, and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadid dynasty and the Zenata. Their influx was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural, genetic and ethnic Arabization of the Maghreb. According to Ibn Khaldun, the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become desertified and turned into completely arid desert. The journey of Banu Hilal is recounted in the Arabic oral poem of Sirat Bani Hilal.\nTo persuade the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym to migrate to the Maghreb, the Fatimid caliph gave each tribesman a camel and money and helped them cross from the east to the west bank of the Nile river. The severe drought in Egypt at the time also persuaded these tribes to migrate to the Maghreb, which had a better economic situation at the time. The Fatimid caliph instructed them to rule the Maghreb instead of the Zirid emir Al-Mu'izz and told them \"I have given you the Maghrib and the rule of al-Mu'izz ibn Balk\u012bn as-Sanh\u0101j\u012b the runaway slave. You will want for nothing.\" and told Al-Mu'izz \"I have sent you horses and put brave men on them so that God might accomplish a matter already enacted\".\nBerber armies were defeated in trying to protect the walls of Kairouan. The Zirids abandoned Kairouan to take refuge on the coast where they survived for a century. Ifriqiya, the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym spread is on the high plains of Constantine where they gradually choked the Qal'a of Banu Hammad, as they had done Kairouan few decades ago. From there, they gradually gained the upper Algiers and Oran plains, some were taken to the Moulouya valley and in Doukkala plains by the Caliph of Marrakesh in the second half of the 12th century. Ibn Khaldun, a Muslim historian wrote: \"Similar to an army of locusts, they destroy everything in their path.\" As Arab nomads spread, the territories of the local Berber tribes were moved and shrank. The Zenata were pushed to the west and the Kabyles were pushed to the north. The Berbers took refuge in the mountains whereas the plains were Arabized. The arrival of the Banu Hilal, followed by the Banu Sulaym in the 12th century, broke the balance between nomads and sedentary populations in favor of the nomads. For strategic reasons, the Almohads gave over the Atlantic plains of the western Maghreb to them.\nSources estimated that the total number of Arab nomads who migrated to the Maghreb only in the 11th century was at around 1 million Arabs.\nThe Ma'qilis also entered the Maghreb during this wave of Arabian tribal immigration in the 11th century. They later allied with the Banu Hilal and entered under their protection. They adapted to the climatic desert conditions of the Maghreb, discovering the same way of life as in the Arabian Peninsula. In the 13th century, they occupied southern Algeria and dominated the oases of Tuat and Gourara. For some authors, at this point, the Maqil group had already disintegrated into different populations in the Maghreb and had given rise to the Beni Hassan along with other related groups. The Beni Hassan expanded southwest and occupied Sanhaja lands in the 13th century after invading and defeating the Berber confederation. The Sanhaja has long had to pay tribute to the nomadic Bedouin Hassani invaders. This took place during the Char Bouba War in modern-day Western Sahara and Mauritania from 1644 to 1674, which after decades of confrontations ended up completely Arabizing the native Berber population, destroying their language and culture and giving rise to the contemporary Sahrawi people. Harry Norris noted \"the Moorish Sahara is the western extremity of the Arab World. Western it certainly is, some districts further west than Ireland, yet in its way of life, its culture, its literature and in many of its social customs, it has much in common with the heart lands of the Arab East, in particular with the Hijaz and Najd and parts of the Yemen\".\nThese Bedouin tribes emerged into several contemporary sub-tribes. The most well known Bedouin tribes in Algeria include Awlad Sidi Shaykh, Ouled Nail, Chaamba, Doui-Menia and Hamyan, who primarily live in the Algerian Desert.\nThe Maghrebi Bedouin dialects, often called Hilalian dialects, are used in the regions of Morocco Atlantic Coast, in regions of High Plains and Sahara in Algeria, in regions of Tunisian Sahel and in regions of Tripolitania. The Bedouin dialects has four major varieties:\nIn Morocco, Bedouin Arabic dialects are spoken in plains and in recently founded cities such as Casablanca. Thus, the city Arabic dialect shares with the Bedouin dialects \"gal\" 'to say' (qala); they also represent the bulk of modern urban dialects (Koin\u00e9s), such as those of Oran and Algiers.\nTribes and populations.\nThere are a number of Bedouin tribes, but the total population is often difficult to determine, especially as many Bedouin have ceased to lead nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles. Below is a partial list of Bedouin tribes and their historic place of origin.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known for his portrayal of King Mongkut in the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical \"The King and I\" (1951), for which he won two Tony Awards, and later an Academy Award for Best Actor for the 1956 film adaptation. He played the role 4,625 times on stage, and became known for his shaved head, which he maintained as a personal trademark long after adopting it for \"The King and I\".\nConsidered one of the first Russian-American film stars, he was honored with a ceremony to put his handprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in 1956. He also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\nIn 1956, Brynner received the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his portrayals of Rameses II in the Cecil B. DeMille epic \"The Ten Commandments\" and General Bounine in \"Anastasia\". He was also well known as the gunman Chris Adams in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960) and its first sequel \"Return of the Seven\" (1966). He had roles as the android \"The Gunslinger\" in \"Westworld\" (1973) and its sequel \"Futureworld\" (1976).\nIn addition to his film credits, he worked as a model and photographer, and wrote several books.\nEarly life.\nIn Russia.\nYul Brynner was born Yuliy Borisovich Briner on July 11, 1920, in the city of Vladivostok. He had Swiss-German, Russian, and Buryat (Mongol) ancestry. He also identified as having Roma ancestry; however, recent findings do not support that claim. He was born at his parents' home, a four-storey house on 15 Aleutskaya Street, Vladivostok, into a wealthy Swiss Russian family of landowners and silver mining developers in Siberia and the Far East. He was named after his grandfather merchant Yuliy Ivanovich Brinner.\nThe Briner family enjoyed a good life at their four-storey mansion. At the time of his birth Vladivostok was under Japanese occupation, while the territory was controlled by the Far Eastern Republic\u2014a communist Russian buffer state. The Red Army occupied Vladivostok in October 1922, and most of the Briner family's wealth was confiscated by the state at the end of the Russian Civil War. The Briner family, including Yul's elder sister Vera, continued living in their house under a temporary status, even though the house had been seized.\nLater in his life, Brynner humorously enjoyed telling tall tales and exaggerating his background and early life for the press, claiming that he was born Taidje Khan of a Mongol father and Roma mother on the Russian island of Sakhalin. He occasionally referred to himself as Julius Briner, Jules Bryner, or Youl Bryner. The 1989 biography by his son, Rock Brynner, clarified some of these issues.\nBrynner's father, Boris Yuliyevich Briner, was a mining engineer and inventor of Swiss-German and Russian descent. He had graduated from Mining University in Saint Petersburg in 1910. The actor's grandfather, Jules Briner (), was a Swiss citizen who had moved to Vladivostok in the 1870s and established a successful import/export company.\nBrynner's paternal grandmother, Natalya Yosifovna Kurkutova, was a native of Irkutsk and a Eurasian of partial Buryat ancestry.\nBrynner's mother, Maria (Marousia) Dimitrievna (n\u00e9e Blagovidova, \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430), hailed from the Russian intelligentsia and had studied to be an actress and singer. According to her son, she was of Russian Roma ancestry, but documents examined by modern historians of Vladivostok claimed the Briner family had no blood connections with Roma. Yul came into close contact with this culture in exile while working with his sister, singer Vera Brinner, and they were looking for a stage image. Vera later sharply objected to this appropriation. Brynner felt a strong personal connection to the Roma. In 1977 he was named honorary president of the International Romani Union, a title that he kept until his death.\nIn 1922, after the formation of the Soviet Union, Yul's father Boris Briner was required to relinquish his Swiss citizenship. All family members were made Soviet citizens. Brynner's father's work required extensive travel, and in 1923, in Moscow he fell in love with an actress, Katerina Ivanovna Kornakova. She was the ex-wife of actor Aleksei Dikiy, and stage partner of Michael Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre. Many years later, Katerina Kornakova would help Brynner with her letter of recommendation asking Michael Chekhov to employ him in his theatre company in the United States.\nIn 1924, Yul's father divorced his mother Marousia, but continued to support her and their children. His father also adopted a girl, because his new wife was childless. Many years later, after the death of his father, Brynner would take this adopted sister into his care. The father and son relationship remained complex and emotionally traumatic for Brynner.\nAfter leaving his children and his former wife in Vladivostok, Boris Briner lived briefly in Moscow with Katerina Ivanovna Kornakova, but eventually they moved to Harbin, Manchuria. At that time it remained under Japanese control. Briner established a business in international trade.\nIn China.\nIn 1927, Marousia Briner took her children, Yuliy and Vera (January 17, 1916 \u2013 December 13, 1967), and emigrated from Vladivostok to Harbin, China. There, young Yul and Vera attended a school run by the YMCA.\nIn 1930, Boris gave Yuliy an acoustic guitar as a birthday present. That guitar and the following music lessons made a lasting impression on Brynner's artistic development. His natural curiosity, creativity, and imagination became focused on mastering the guitar technique and studying classical and contemporary music. Brynner studied music under the guidance of his sister Vera, who was a classically trained opera singer. After several years of arduous studies, Brynner became an accomplished guitar player and singer.\nIn France and Switzerland.\nIn 1933, fearing a war between China and Japan, Marousia Briner moved with her children to Paris. Many Russians had moved there in exile after the Revolution. There, on June 15, 1935, the fourteen-year-old Brynner made his debut at the \"Hermitage\" cabaret, where he played his guitar and sang in the Russian and Roma languages. After initial success, he continued performing at various Parisian nightclubs, sometimes accompanying his sister, and playing and singing Russian and Roma songs. At that time, Brynner was a student at a lyceum in Paris, where he studied French. His classmates and teachers were aware of his strong character, as he was often involved in fist fighting. \nIn the summer of 1936, Brynner worked as a lifeguard at a resort beach in Le Havre. There he joined a French circus troupe, trained as a trapeze acrobat and worked with a circus troupe for several years. After sustaining a back injury, he left the circus troupe. In nearly unbearable pain, Brynner took narcotics for relief. He soon developed a drug dependency. \nOne day, while buying opium from a local dealer, Brynner met Jean Cocteau (1889\u20131963) and the two became lifelong friends. Cocteau introduced Brynner to Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Josephine Baker, Jean Marais, and the bohemian milieu of Paris. The experience and connections eventually helped him in his multifaceted career of acting, directing, and producing.\nSeventeen-year-old Brynner realized he had become addicted to opium and the family tried to help him treat the illness. He spent a year in Lausanne, Switzerland treating his addiction at a Swiss clinic and at Lausanne University Hospital with financial support from his aunt Vera Dmitrievna Blagovidova-Briner, his mother's sister. Blagovidova-Briner was a physician trained at medical school in Saint Petersburg, Russia, before the revolution. She later practiced in China and Switzerland. The year-long treatment in Switzerland, which included hypnotherapy, had a lasting effect on Brynner's health. Yul never used illicit drugs again in his life. He later became addicted to cigarettes, which damaged his lungs and ruined his health as he aged. \nIn Harbin, Brynner's father had a lucrative trade business and lived with his second wife, actress Katerina Ivanovna Kornakova. She gave Brynner his first professional acting lessons by showing him scenes from her repertoire at Moscow Art Theatre. She instructed him in how to respond to her lines using his voice tone and body language. During their first lessons, Katerina Kornakova demonstrated and explained to Brynner the principles of Konstantin Stanislavsky's school of acting, and the innovative ideas of Michael Chekhov. Brynner was excited and impressed with the new experience. His father initially tried to prepare his son for a management position at their family business, but changed his mind after watching several acting lessons and witnessing Brynner's happiness.\nKaterina Kornakova was impressed with Brynner's intellectual and physical abilities and recommended him to study acting with her former partner Michael Chekhov. Brynner took the letter of recommendation from his stepmother and also accepted money and blessings from his father. With the generous support from both his father and stepmother, Brynner became encouraged and confident in his future success as an actor. \nAt the same time, Brynner's mother's illness (she had been diagnosed with leukemia) progressed and required special medical treatment that was available only in the United States. Brynner traveled with his mother on a long trip across the world.\nIn the US.\nIn 1940, speaking little English, Brynner and his mother emigrated to the United States aboard the , departing from Kobe, Japan. They arrived in San Francisco on October 25, 1940. His final destination was New York City, where his sister already lived. Vera, a singer, starred in \"The Consul\" on Broadway in 1950. She also appeared on television in the title role of the opera \"Carmen\". She later taught voice in New York.\nDuring World War II Brynner worked as a French-speaking radio announcer and commentator for the US Office of War Information, broadcasting to occupied France. He also worked for the Voice of America, broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet Union. At the same time, during the war years, he studied acting in Connecticut with the Russian actor Michael Chekhov. He worked as a truck driver and stage hand for Chekhov's theatre company.\nCareer.\n1940s.\nBrynner made his Broadway stage debut in a production of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" that premiered on December 2, 1941. He appeared as Fabian, a character with only a few lines, as his English was limited and he had a noticeable Russian accent. The job helped him to start adding English to the list of languages he spoke, which included Russian, French, Japanese, and Hungarian. That show, along with many other Broadway productions, closed after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when America declared war on Japan and Nazi Germany. \nSoon Brynner found a job as a radio commentator presenting war propaganda in French and Russian at the Voice of America radio station. He had little acting work during the next few years, but did co-star in a 1946 production of \"Lute Song\" with Mary Martin. He also did some modeling work and was photographed nude by George Platt Lynes.\nIn 1944, Brynner married actress Virginia Gilmore. Soon after, he began working as a director at the then-new CBS television studios. In 1948 and 1949, he directed and also appeared on television alongside his wife in the first two seasons of \"Studio One\". He also appeared in other shows.\nBrynner made his film debut in \"Port of New York\", released in November 1949.\n1950s.\n\"The King and I\".\nThe next year, at the urging of Martin, Brynner auditioned for Rodgers and Hammerstein's new musical in New York. He recalled that, as he was finding success as a director on television, he was reluctant to go back on the stage. Once he read the script, however, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to perform in the project.\nBrynner's role as King Mongkut in \"The King and I\" (4,625 times on stage) became his best known. He appeared in the original 1951 production opposite Gertrude Lawrence and later touring productions, as well as a 1977 Broadway revival, a London production in 1979, and another Broadway revival in 1985. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for the first of these Broadway productions and a special Tony for the last. \nHe reprised the role in the 1956 film version, for which he won an Academy Award as Best Actor. He also played it in \"Anna and the King\", a short-lived TV series on CBS in 1972. Brynner is one of only ten people who have won both a Tony and an Academy Award for the same role.\nIn 1951, Brynner shaved his head for his role in \"The King and I\". Following the huge success of the Broadway production and subsequent film, he continued to shave his head for the rest of his life, wearing a wig when it was necessary for a role. It was unusual for a man to have a shaven head at the time, and his striking appearance helped to give him an exotic appeal. Some fans shaved off their hair to imitate him, and a shaven head was often referred to as the \"Yul Brynner look\".\nBrynner's second motion picture was a film version of \"The King and I\" (1956) with Deborah Kerr, which was a huge success critically and commercially.\nCecil B. de Mille hired Brynner for \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) to play Ramesses II opposite Charlton Heston after seeing him in the stage version of \"The King and I\", telling Brynner backstage that he was the only person for the role. He rounded out his year with \"Anastasia\" (1956), co-starring with Ingrid Bergman under the direction of Anatole Litvak. Both films were big hits and Brynner became one of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood. \nMGM cast Brynner as one of \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (1958), which was another commercial success. Less so was \"The Buccaneer\" (1958), in which Brynner played Jean Lafitte; he co-starred with Heston, Inger Stevens, Claire Bloom and Charles Boyer in a historically accurate tale of the Battle of New Orleans. The film was produced by De Mille and directed by Anthony Quinn.\nMGM used Brynner again in \"The Journey\" (1959), opposite Kerr under the direction of Litvak, but the film lost money. So too did \"The Sound and the Fury\" (1959) based on the novel by William Faulkner with Joanne Woodward.\nBrynner then received an offer to replace Tyrone Power, who had died during the making of \"Solomon and Sheba\" (1959) with Gina Lollobrigida. The movie, a huge hit, caused the development of a planned Brynner film about Spartacus to be postponed. When the Kirk Douglas film \"Spartacus\" came out in 1960, Brynner elected not to make his own version.\n1960s.\nBrynner tried comedy with two films directed by Stanley Donen: \"Once More, with Feeling!\" (1960) and \"Surprise Package\" (1960), but public response was underwhelming. He made a cameo in \"Testament of Orpheus\".\nAlthough the public received him well in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), a Western adaptation of \"Seven Samurai\" for The Mirisch Company, the picture proved a disappointment on its initial release in the U.S. However, it was hugely popular in Europe and has had enduring popularity. Its ultimate success led to Brynner's signing a three-picture deal with the Mirisches. The film was especially popular in the Soviet Union, where it sold 67million tickets. He then made a cameo in \"Goodbye Again\" (1961).\nBrynner focused on action films. He did \"Escape from Zahrain\" (1962), with Ronald Neame as director, and \"Taras Bulba\" (1962), with Tony Curtis for J. Lee Thompson. Both films were commercial disappointments; \"Taras Bulba\" was popular but failed to recoup its large cost.\nThe first film under Brynner's three-picture deal with Mirisch was \"Flight from Ashiya\" (1963) with George Chakiris. It was followed by \"Kings of the Sun\" (1963), also with Chakiris, directed by Thompson. Neither film was particularly popular; nor was \"Invitation to a Gunfighter\" (1964), a western. \"Morituri\" (1965), opposite Marlon Brando, failed to reverse the series of unsuccessful movies. He had cameos in \"Cast a Giant Shadow\" (1966) and \"The Poppy Is Also a Flower\" (1966).\nBrynner enjoyed a hit with \"Return of the Seven\" (1966), reprising his role from the original. Less popular were \"Triple Cross\" (1966), a war movie with Christopher Plummer; \"The Double Man\" (1967), a spy thriller; \"The Long Duel\" (1967), an Imperial adventure tale opposite Trevor Howard; \"Villa Rides\" (1968), a Western; and \"The File of the Golden Goose\" (1969).\nBrynner went to Yugoslavia to star in a war film, \"Battle of Neretva\" (1969). He supported Katharine Hepburn in the big-budget flop \"The Madwoman of Chaillot\" (1969). Brynner appeared in drag (as a torch singer) in an unbilled role in the Peter Sellers comedy \"The Magic Christian\" (1969).\nLater career.\nBrynner went to Italy to make a spaghetti Western, \"Adi\u00f3s, Sabata\" (1970) and supported Kirk Douglas in \"The Light at the Edge of the World\" (1971). He remained in lead roles for \"Romance of a Horsethief\" (1971) and a Western, \"Catlow\" (1971).\nBrynner had a small role in \"Fuzz\" (1972) then reprised his most famous part in the TV series \"Anna and the King\" (1972) which ran for 13 episodes.\nAfter \"Night Flight from Moscow\" (1973) in Europe, Brynner created one of his iconic roles in the cult hit film \"Westworld\" (1973) as the 'Gunslinger', a killer robot. His next two films were variations on this performance: \"The Ultimate Warrior\" (1975) and \"Futureworld\" (1976).\nBrynner returned to Broadway in \"Home Sweet Homer\", a notorious flop musical. His final movie was \"Death Rage\" (1976), an Italian action film.\nPersonal life.\nBrynner became a naturalized U.S. citizen, aged 22, in 1943, while living in New York as an actor and radio announcer, and renounced his US citizenship at the U.S. Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, in June 1965 to avoid being bankrupted by taxes and penalties from the Internal Revenue Service; he had stayed in the United States long enough to lose the tax exemption given to American residents working abroad.\nYul Brynner was married four times and had five children. His first wife (1944\u20131960) was the American actress Virginia Gilmore (1919\u20131986), with whom he had a son, Yul (better known as Rock) Brynner Jr. (1946\u20132023), a historian, novelist, and lecturer. His second wife (1960\u20131967) was the Chilean model Doris Kleiner (1931\u20132025), with whom he had a daughter, Victoria Brynner (born 1962), a businesswoman and consultant in the fashion and luxury industry, the founder of Stardust Brands. His third wife (1971\u20131981) was the French noblewoman and socialite Jacqueline Thion de la Chaume (1932\u20132013), with whom he adopted two Vietnamese children, Mia and Melody Brynner, in 1974 and 1975. Yul also adopted another daughter, Lark Brynner (born 1958 or 1959), who was born to him out of wedlock by Frankie Tilden (born 1939). His fourth wife (1983\u20131985) was the much younger ballerina Kathy Lee (born 1957). They had no children together.\nIn 2006, Brynner's son Rock wrote a book about his father and his family history titled \"Empire and Odyssey: The Brynners in Far East Russia and Beyond\". He regularly returned to Vladivostok, the city of his father's birth, for the Pacific Meridian Film Festival.\nHealth.\nIn 1979, Brynner settled out of court after allegedly contracting trichinosis at Trader Vic's in New York City.\nIn September 1983, Brynner suffered a sore throat, his voice changed and doctors found a lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in \"The King and I\", he received the test results, which indicated that he had inoperable lung cancer, though his throat was not affected. Brynner had begun smoking heavily at age 12. Although he had quit in 1971, his promotional photos often still showed him with a cigarette in hand, or a cigar in his mouth. He and the national tour of the musical were forced to take a few months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which damaged his throat and made singing and speaking difficult. The tour then resumed.\nIn January 1985, the tour reached New York for a farewell Broadway run. Aware he was dying, Brynner gave an interview on \"Good Morning America\" discussing the dangers of smoking and expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial. The Broadway production of \"The King and I\" ran from January 7 to June 30 of that year. His last performance, a few months before his death, marked the 4,625th time he had played the role of the King.\nOther interests.\nIn addition to his work as a director and performer, Brynner was an active photographer and wrote two books. His daughter Victoria put together \"Yul Brynner: Photographer\", a collection of his photographs of family, friends, and fellow actors, as well as those he took while serving as a UN special consultant on refugees.\nBrynner wrote \"Bring Forth the Children: A Journey to the Forgotten People of Europe and the Middle East\" (1960), with photographs by himself and Magnum photographer Inge Morath, and \"The Yul Brynner Cookbook: Food Fit for the King and You\" (1983).\nHe enjoyed singing gypsy songs. In 1967, Dimitrievitch and he released a record album \"The Gypsy and I: Yul Brynner Sings Gypsy Songs\" (Vanguard VSD 79265).\nRelationships and marriages.\nBrynner married four times, his first three marriages ending in divorce. He fathered three children and adopted two. His first wife (1944\u20131960) was actress Virginia Gilmore with whom he had one child, Yul \"Rock\" Brynner (1946\u20132023), nicknamed \"Rock\" when he was six years old in honor of boxer Rocky Graziano. Rock was a historian, novelist, and university history lecturer at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York and Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut.\nYul Brynner had a long affair with Marlene Dietrich, who was 19 years his senior, beginning during the first production of \"The King and I\".\nIn 1959, Brynner fathered a daughter, Lark Brynner, with Frankie Tilden, who was 20 years old. Lark lived with her mother and Brynner supported her financially. His second wife, from 1960 to 1967, Doris Kleiner (1931\u20132025) was a Chilean model whom he married on the set during shooting of \"The Magnificent Seven\" in 1960. They had one child, Victoria Brynner (born November 1962), whose godmother was Audrey Hepburn. Belgian novelist and artist Monique Watteau was also romantically linked with Brynner, from 1961 to 1967.\nHis third wife (1971\u20131981), Jacqueline Simone Thion de la Chaume (1932\u20132013), a French socialite, was the widow of Philippe de Croisset (son of French playwright Francis de Croisset and a publishing executive). Brynner and Jacqueline adopted two Vietnamese children: Mia (1974) and Melody (1975). The first house Brynner owned was the Manoir de Criqueb\u0153uf, a 16th-century manor house in northwestern France that Jacqueline and he purchased. His third marriage broke up, reportedly owing to his 1980 announcement that he would continue in the role of the King for another long tour and Broadway run, as well as his affairs with female fans and his neglect of his wife and children.\nOn April 4, 1983, aged 62, Brynner married his fourth wife, Kathy Lee (born 1957), a 26-year-old ballerina from Ipoh, Malaysia, whom he had met in the London production of \"The King and I\". They remained married for the last two years of his life. His longtime close friends Meredith A. Disney and her sons Charles Elias Disney and Daniel H. Disney attended Brynner and Lee's final performances of \"The King and I\".\nDeath.\nBrynner died of lung cancer on October 10, 1985, at New York Hospital at the age of 65. His remains were cremated and the ashes were buried in the grounds of the Saint-Michel-de-Bois-Aubry Orthodox monastery, near Luz\u00e9, between Tours and Poitiers in France.\nAnti-smoking campaign.\nPrior to his death, with the help of the American Cancer Society, Brynner created a public service announcement using a clip from the \"Good Morning America\" interview. A few days after his death, it premiered on all major US television networks and in other countries. Brynner used the announcement to express his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial after discovering he had cancer, and his death was imminent. He then looked directly into the camera for 30 seconds and said, \"Now that I'm gone, I tell you: Don't smoke. Whatever you do, just don't smoke. If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that.\" His year of birth, in one version of the commercial, was incorrectly given as 1915.\nLegacy.\nIn Russia.\nOn September 28, 2012, a 2.4-m-tall statue was inaugurated at Yul Brynner Park, in front of the home where Brynner was born at Aleutskaya St. No. 15 in Vladivostok, Russia. Created by local sculptor Alexei Bokiy, the monument was carved in granite monolith that was acquired in China and delivered to Vladivostok, Russia. It depicts him in the role of King Mongkut of Siam from \"The King and I\". The grounds for the park were donated by the city of Vladivostok, which also paid additional costs. Vladivostok Mayor Igor Pushkariov, US Consul General Sylvia Curran, and Brynner's son, Rock, participated in the ceremony, along with hundreds of local residents.\nThe Briner family cottage in suburban Vladivostok is now a Yul Brynner museum.\nIn the U.S..\nIn 1956, Brynner imprinted his hands and feet into the concrete pavement in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. In 1960, Brynner was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6162 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn 2022, a podcast was launched celebrating his filmography, entitled \"Here's Looking at Yul, Kid,\" and has included guests such as Ron Howard.\nIn France.\nBrynner spent many years living, studying, and working in France, and his last will stated his wish to be buried there. His resting place at has a memorial mention dedicated to him.\nIn Japan.\nThe Japanese dubbing of his voice in various movies was handled by Osamu Kobayashi and others.\nFilmography.\nShort subjects:\nBox office ranking.\nAt the height of his career, Brynner was voted by exhibitors as among the most popular stars at the box office:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61814", "revid": "1315360005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61814", "title": "List of Bulgarian monarchs", "text": "The monarchs of Bulgaria ruled Bulgaria during the medieval First (c. 681\u20131018) and Second (1185\u20131422) Bulgarian empires, as well as during the modern Principality (1879\u20131908) and Kingdom (1908\u20131946) of Bulgaria. This list includes monarchs from the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire until modern times, omitting earlier mythical rulers as well as rulers of separate states such as Old Great Bulgaria and Volga Bulgaria.\nVarious titles have been used by the rulers of Bulgaria. The only recorded title, used before Bulgaria's conversion to Christianity, is \"kanasubigi\", likely meaning \"Khan, Lord of the Army\" or \"the sublime Khan\". When Bulgaria converted to Christianity in the ninth century, the ruler Boris I (852\u2013889) was using the title \"knyaz\" (prince). For much of its later history under the first and second empires, Bulgaria functioned as a multi-ethnic imperial state modelled on the neighbouring Byzantine Empire, which contributed to the adoption of the title of \"tsar\" (emperor) by Bulgarian monarchs beginning with Simeon I (893\u2013927) in 913. Some powerful medieval Bulgarian rulers challenged Byzantine authority by proclaiming themselves as both Bulgarian and Roman emperors.\nWhen Bulgaria re-emerged as a state in 1878 in the form of the Principality of Bulgaria, the rulers initially used the title \"knyaz\" since they were autonomous vassals of the Ottoman Empire and not fully independent. From Bulgaria's complete independence from the Ottomans in 1908 until the abolition of the monarchy in 1946, Bulgarian monarchs once more used the title \"tsar\", though this time generally translated internationally as \"king\" rather than \"emperor\".\nTitles.\nTitles in the First Bulgarian Empire (681\u20131018).\nEvidence concerning the titles used by the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire (681\u20131018) prior to the conversion to Christianity in the 860s is scant. The only title known from contemporary sources is \"kanasubigi\", recorded in ten Greek-language inscriptions (as \u039a\u0391\u039d\u0391\u03a3\u03a5\u0392\u0399\u0393\u0399) from the ninth century in reference to Omurtag (814\u2013831) and his son Malamir (831\u2013836). Two gold medallions struck for Omurtag also use the same title. \nUpon his conversion to Christianity in 864/865, Boris I (852\u2013889) adopted the new ruling title \"knyaz\", generally translated as \"prince\" (though sometimes alternatively as \"king\"). This title was used by the Bulgarian rulers until 913, when the \"knyaz\" Simeon I (893\u2013927), Boris I's son, invaded the Byzantine Empire. Simeon aspired to make Bulgaria into the new \"universal monarchy\" (a role the Byzantines viewed themselves as having) by absorbing and replacing the empire centered in Constantinople. Due to the threat presented by Simeon, who reached the walls of Constantinople, the Byzantines relented and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nicholas Mystikos, granted him an imperial crown. The only other monarch recognized as a \"basileus\" (i.e. emperor) by the Byzantines was (at times) the Holy Roman emperor. The Byzantines did not consider Simeon as outranking their own emperors and designated him as the \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\". Simeon himself used the grander title \"Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans\". The title of emperor was in Bulgarian translated as \"tsar\" (deriving from the Latin \"caesar\"), seen as equivalent to the Greek \"basileus\" or Latin \"imperator\".\nBulgarian rulers from the death of Simeon I in 927 until the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018 used the simpler \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\", ceasing to claim Byzantium's universal monarchy.\nTitles in the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185\u20131422).\nThe first rulers of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185\u20131422) revived the style used by Simeon I's successors, \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\", rendered \"tsr\u2019 Bl\u2019garom\" in Bulgarian documents and \"imperator Bulgarorum\" in Latin. The second empire's third ruler, Kaloyan (1196\u20131207), adopted the grander title \"Emperor of Bulgarians and Vlachs\" (\"imperator Bulgarorum et Blachorum\"). He unsuccessfully sought recognition of this title from the Papacy, though Pope Innocent III merely recognized him as \"King of the Bulgarians and Vlachs\" (\"rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum\"), not wishing to recognize any other emperor than the Holy Roman emperor.\nThe fifth ruler of the second empire, Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241) after 1230 extended his original title \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\" to the grander \"Emperor of the Bulgarians and Greeks\" (\"tsr\u2019 Bl\u2019garom i Gr\u2019kom\", Latin: \"imperator Bulgarorum et Grecorum\"). This title was taken to reflect his extensive conquests in formerly Byzantine territory and was effectively a revival of Simeon I's title since both \"Greeks\" and \"Romans\" were envisioned as referring to the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire. Ivan Asen II also introduced the element \"autocrat\" (Bulgarian: \"samodrzac\", Latin: \"moderator\") into the Bulgarian imperial title, modelled on its usage in the Byzantine imperial title, and eventually in full styled himself as the \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians and Greeks\" (Bulgarian: \"tsr\u2019 i samodrzac Bl\u2019garom i Gr\u2019kom\", Latin: \"imperator et moderator Bulgarorum et Grecorum\").\nIvan Asen II's successors kept \"autocrat\" in the title but returned to the simpler style \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians\". His extended title was later revived by Ivan Alexander (1331\u20131371), who also proclaimed himself as the \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians and Greeks\" to challenge the authority of the then weakened Byzantine Empire. Ivan Alexander's son Ivan Shishman (1371\u20131395) is also recorded to have used this extended imperial title.\nTitles in modern Bulgaria (1878\u20131946).\nThe Tarnovo Constitution of the modern Principality of Bulgaria (1878\u20131908) stipulated that the monarch was to use the title \"\"Knyaz\" of Bulgaria\" (i.e. \"Prince of Bulgaria\") rather than \"tsar\" due to the principality being an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire rather than a fully independent country.\nWhen Bulgaria achieved complete independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908, the former \"knyaz\" Ferdinand I (1887\u20131918) adopted the higher title of \"\"Tsar\" of the Bulgarians\", as had been used by Bulgarian monarchs in the Middle Ages. The assumption of the title of \"tsar\" was met with opposition from both the Ottomans and the Russian Empire. Although \"tsar\" had been understood as equivalent to emperor in medieval times, the title of the new Bulgarian \"tsars\" was generally translated as \"King of the Bulgarians\" internationally.\nNames and regnal numbers.\nRegnal numbers for monarchs have only been officially used in Bulgaria in modern times, beginning with Alexander I in 1879. Modern historiography retroactively also assigns sequential regnal numbers to medieval Bulgarian rulers, even if they ruled different Bulgarian states and used different titles; Boris I (852\u2013889) ruled the First Bulgarian Empire as a prince (\"knyaz\"), his great-grandson Boris II (967\u2013977) ruled the same state as emperor, and Boris III (1918\u20131943) ruled the modern Kingdom of Bulgaria as \"tsar\" (king).\nThere were three different types of names used by medieval Bulgarian monarchs after Bulgaria converted to Christianity; names drawn from Bulgar or Slavic tradition (i.e. Boris, Boril, Vladimir, Presian), names drawn from Christian tradition (i.e. Michael, Simeon, Peter, Ivan, Samuel), or double names combining both (i.e. Ivan Vladislav, Gavril Radomir, Ivan Sratsimir, Theodore Svetoslav). When using a double name, the Christian name always preceded the name drawn from local tradition. Very rarely, Bulgarian rulers used double names combining two Christian names (i.e. Ivan Stephen, Ivan Alexander).\nThe use of double names by Bulgarian monarchs, sometimes not used consistently in contemporary sources, has in cases led to confusion and misunderstanding in modern efforts to assign regnal numbers. In particular, it has sometimes erroneously been assumed that the usage of double names indicated that the monarchs employed family names; this interpretation has in the past resulted in the use of names such as Ivan II Asen (for Ivan Asen II), George I Terter (for George Terter I) and Michael III Shishman (for Michael Asen III). Names of clans were prominently used in Bulgaria in pre-Christian times, though disappeared from usage sometime after the conversion to Christianity, despite family names being used in some of Bulgaria's closest neighbours (such as the Byzantine Empire). Although names such as \"Asen\" or \"Terter\" could serve as genealogical and political markers to demonstrate a ruler's position in an illustrious lineage they were also fully part of the ruler's regnal names, as demonstrated by those rulers whose double names excluded genealogical connections (such as Ivan Alexander). Double names with genealogical connotations were at times also claimed by rulers not belonging to the same dynastic lineage, such as Mitso Asen (1256\u20131257; who married into the Asen dynasty). \nFirst Bulgarian Empire (c. 680\u20131018).\nEarly Bulgarian rulers (c. 680\u2013803).\nThe First Bulgarian Empire is regarded to have been established c. 680 when the Bulgarian ruler Asparuh crossed the Danube. Asparuh's family, the Dulo clan, claimed descent from the Hunnic ruler Attila, through Attila's son Ernak. References to political developments within Bulgaria prior to the reign of Krum (c. 803\u2013814) are extremely scant, making the dates and family relationships of the rulers recorded in contemporary and later sources highly uncertain. The rulers below may all belong to the Dulo clan or might alternatively have belonged to various competing clans. Several alternate chronologies of early Bulgarian rulers have been proposed, with some presented below, with the names standardized across sources:\nPretenders during Byzantine rule (1018\u20131185).\nVarious Byzantine military governors (with the title \"strategos\") were appointed in formerly Bulgarian lands over the course of the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria, from the 970s onwards. Following the completion of the conquest of Bulgaria in 1018, Emperor Basil II organized much of the central Balkans into the Theme of Bulgaria, which was governed by an imperially appointed official titled (depending on the time) as the \"doux\" (duke) or \"katepano\" of Bulgaria. The capital of Byzantine Bulgaria was Skopion (modern-day Skopje). There were several attempts at restoring the Bulgarian Empire during the nearly two centuries of Byzantine rule.\nSecond Bulgarian Empire (1185\u20131422).\nSuccessors of the Asenids (1256\u20131280).\nThe end of the male line of the House of Asen plunged Bulgaria into a chaotic period of fragmentation and civil wars between numerous lines of claimants.\nHouse of Sratsimir (1331\u20131422).\nThe rulers of the House of Sratsimir, patrilineal descendants of the despot Sratsimir, are in lists of monarchs often designated as part of the Shishmanid dynasty, with which they only share matrilineal descent. Through their matrilineal descent from the House of Shishman, the rulers of the House of Sratsimir were also descendants of the House of Asen.\nPretenders during Ottoman rule (1422\u20131878).\nFollowing the gradual conquest of Bulgaria in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Ottomans incorporated the Bulgarian lands into the vast province of Rumelia. In the late 16th century, the new province of Silistra was created due to persistent northern attacks from the Cossacks. Later on, much of modern-day northern Bulgaria was organized into the Danube vilayet, which in terms of borders closely corresponded to the succeeding autonomous Principality of Bulgaria. Like under the period of Byzantine rule, the Ottoman authorities were sometimes faced with Bulgarian uprisings aimed at independence, at times also involving the proclamation of new Bulgarian monarchs.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61820", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61820", "title": "Alistair MacLeod", "text": "Canadian writer and academic (1936\u20132014)\nAlistair MacLeod (July 20, 1936 \u2013 April 20, 2014) was a Canadian novelist, short story writer and academic. His powerful and moving stories vividly evoke the beauty of Cape Breton Island's rugged landscape and the resilient character of many of its inhabitants, the descendants of Scottish immigrants, who are haunted by ancestral memories and who struggle to reconcile the past and the present. MacLeod has been praised for his verbal precision, his lyric intensity and his use of simple, direct language that seems rooted in an oral tradition.\nAlthough he is known as a master of the short story, MacLeod's 1999 novel \"No Great Mischief\" was voted Atlantic Canada's greatest book of all time. The novel also won several literary prizes including the 2001 International Dublin Literary Award.\nIn 2000, MacLeod's two books of short stories, \"The Lost Salt Gift of Blood\" (1976) and \"As Birds Bring Forth the Sun and Other Stories\" (1986), were re-published in the volume \"Island: The Collected Stories\". MacLeod compared his fiction writing to playing an accordion. \"When I pull it out like this,\" he explained, \"it becomes a novel, and when I compress it like this, it becomes this intense short story.\"\nMacLeod taught English and creative writing for more than three decades at the University of Windsor, but returned every summer to the Cape Breton cabin on the MacLeod homestead where he did much of his writing. In the introduction to a book of essays on his work, editor Irene Guilford concluded: \"Alistair MacLeod's birthplace is Canadian, his emotional heartland is Cape Breton, his heritage Scottish, but his writing is of the world.\"\nEarly life and education.\nMacLeod's Scottish ancestors emigrated to Cumberland County, Nova Scotia from the Isle of Eigg in the 1790s. They settled at Cape d'Or on the Bay of Fundy where they appear to have leased farmland. In 1808, the parents with their seven daughters and two sons walked from Cape d'Or to Inverness County, Cape Breton, a distance of 362 kilometres, after hearing they could farm their own land there. An account of the journey, written by MacLeod himself, says the family took their possessions with them, six cows and a horse. He adds there were few roads at the time, so his great-great-great-grandparents followed the shoreline.\nMacLeod was born in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. His parents, whose first language was Canadian Gaelic, had migrated to Saskatchewan from Cape Breton to homestead during the Great Depression. The family moved on to Edmonton when MacLeod was five and then to the town of Mercoal, Alberta where his father worked as a coal miner. However, the MacLeods suffered from homesickness and when Alistair was 10, they returned to Cape Breton and the farmhouse in Dunvegan, Inverness County, that his great-grandfather had built in the 1860s.\nMacLeod enjoyed attending school and apparently did well there. He told a CBC Radio interviewer that as a student, he liked to read and write, adding, \"I was the kind of person who won the English prize in grade twelve.\" After graduating from high school in 1954, MacLeod moved to Edmonton where he delivered milk for a year from a horse-drawn wagon.\nIn 1956, MacLeod furthered his education by attending the Nova Scotia Teachers College in Truro and then taught school for a year on Port Hood Island off Cape Breton's west coast. To finance his university education, he worked summers drilling and blasting in mines in British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and, in the uranium mines of northern Ontario. At some point, he also worked at a logging camp on Vancouver Island rising rapidly through the ranks because he was physically able to climb the tallest trees and rig cables to their tops.\nBetween 1957 and 1960, MacLeod studied at St. Francis Xavier University earning a BA and B.Ed. He then went on to receive his MA in 1961 from the University of New Brunswick. He decided to study for a PhD at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana because Frank O'Malley taught creative writing there. MacLeod said he was used to analyzing the work of other authors, but wanted to start writing himself. That wouldn't have happened, he added, if he had not attended such a \"creative, imaginative university.\"\nHe wrote his doctoral dissertation on the English novelist Thomas Hardy whom he admired. \"I especially liked the idea,\" he told an interviewer years later, \"that his novels were usually about people who lived outdoors and were greatly affected by the forces of nature.\" MacLeod was awarded his PhD in 1968, the same year he published \"The Boat\" in \"The Massachusetts Review\". The story appeared in the 1969 edition of \"The Best American Short Stories\" along with ones by Andre Dubus, Bernard Malamud, Joyce Carol Oates and Isaac Bashevis Singer.\nAcademic career.\nA specialist in British literature of the 19th century, MacLeod taught English for three years at Indiana University before accepting a post in 1969 at the University of Windsor where he taught English and creative writing for more than three decades. A story published after his death in the student newspaper called him \"a dedicated professor, an approachable colleague, and an inspiration to young, local writers.\" It quoted Marty Gervais, one of his university colleagues, as saying that the door to MacLeod's cluttered office was always open to students, faculty and even members of the public. \"It didn't matter whether you were a good writer or a bad writer; he was open to talking with you, he would read your work, he would be honest with you, and he would be encouraging as well,\" Gervais added. \"He could talk your ear off with stories...but he was also a good listener.\"\nAlan Cumyn, who studied creative writing at the University of Windsor, remembered MacLeod as a teacher who placed great emphasis on the fundamentals of good writing such as language and metaphor, character and conflict, narrative structure and form. He wrote that MacLeod read student work carefully and always began his critiques by pointing to the best things about a story before turning to its weaknesses. \"By the end,\" Cumyn wrote, \"a story might seem in tatters, but in the oddly inspiring way that gifted teachers and editors have, issues and directions were made much clearer, and many of us felt more confident and enthusiastic about our work than we had going in.\"\nAnother student, who attended an intensive writing workshop in Toronto, wrote that if something bothered MacLeod about a student story, he would simply say, \"I have a question about that, but not a big one.\" If he noticed a glaring inconsistency, MacLeod would say, \"Some words and phrases startle me.\" When a student asked how long a good short story should be, \"MacLeod clasped his hands and looked up toward the ceiling as if in prayer, then responded in a lyrical Cape Breton accent. 'Well then. Well then. Just make your story as long as a piece of string, and it will work out just fine.'\"\nMacLeod found that his university duties left little time for creative writing. \"One time correcting all my papers and putting circles around \"their\" and \"there\" and \"they're\",\" he told a radio interviewer, \"I began to think that maybe this wasn't the most worthwhile thing I should be doing with my life and so I said...I'm going to try to write like imaginatively or creatively for two hours a day.\" The experiment failed, however, because MacLeod found that by the end of each day, he was too worn out from his academic work to produce stories that were any good. So, he did most of his writing during the summer breaks when his family lived on the MacLeod homestead at Dunvegan, Cape Breton. He would spend mornings there \"writing in a cliff-top cabin looking west towards Prince Edward Island.\"\nPublished works and methods.\nMacLeod published only one novel and fewer than 20 short stories during his lifetime. Writing in longhand, he worked slowly refining his sentences until he found what he felt were just the right words. \"I write a single sentence at a time,\" he once told an interviewer, \"and then I read it aloud.\"\n \nFellow Cape Breton writer Frank Macdonald described MacLeod as a perfectionist. \"He wouldn't set a story free,\" Macdonald said, \"until he was convinced that it was ready.\" He added that MacLeod never rewrote a story. \"He wrote a sentence, and then waited, then wrote another sentence.\" During a CBC Radio interview in 2011, MacLeod spoke about how he shaped his work. He explained that halfway through a story, he would write the final sentence. \"I think of that as the last thing I'm going to say to the reader,\" he said. \"I write it down and it serves as a lighthouse on the rest of my journey through the story.\"\nMacLeod's published works include the 1976 short story collection \"The Lost Salt Gift of Blood\" and the 1986 \"As Birds Bring Forth the Sun and Other Stories\". The 14 stories in these two volumes appear in \"Island: The Collected Short Stories of Alistair MacLeod\". The book, which also contains two new stories, was released in 2000 the year after the publication of his successful first novel \"No Great Mischief\". When asked why, as a master short story writer, he had suddenly turned to the novel, MacLeod smiled and replied: \"Well, nothing I do is very sudden. I think I just wanted more space. I needed a bus rather than a Volkswagen to put my people in.\"\nIn 2004 MacLeod published an illustrated edition of his story, \"To Everything There Is a Season\" with the new heading of \"A Cape Breton Christmas Story\".\nIn October 2012, \"Remembrance\", a story commissioned by the Vancouver Writers Fest to mark its 25 anniversary, was published and sold there as a chapbook.\nMacLeod's books have been translated into 17 languages.\nCritical reaction.\nShort stories.\nMacLeod's short stories have generated much critical acclaim, especially from Canadian reviewers. In her review of \"Island\", for example, Frances Itani calls the book of collected stories about miners, fishermen and Scottish Highlanders who came to Cape Breton \"simply stunning.\" She also praises the stories for their emotional impact. \"Whether you are reading his stories for the first or for the eighth time, they will make you wonder and they will make you weep. The quality of the writing matches the very best in the world.\" Itani describes \"The Boat\", MacLeod's first published story (1968) as possibly the most moving and powerful in Canadian literature. For her, all of the stories show a master craftsman at work. \"Every story is expertly paced. The internal rhythm has been so perfected, the stories appear to unfold by themselves. There are no tricks; there is no visible or superimposed planning or plotting. Events unfold as unpredictably as life itself.\" The essayist Joshua Bodwell wrote about discovering MacLeod while traveling in Cape Breton just months before his first child was born, and then later reading \"The Boat\" aloud to her near her tenth birthday in his piece \"The Great Salt Gift of Alistair MacLeod's \"The Boat.\"\"\nThe English literary critic, James Wood, on the other hand, criticized what he saw as \"a certain simplicity, even sentimentalism\" in many of the stories in \"Island\". He also found some of them overly melodramatic adding: \"Several of MacLeod's stories have a quality of emotional genre-painting, and display a willingness to let the complexities of character die into stereotype. The men are white-haired and silent, the women dark-haired with sharp tongues.\" Although Wood conceded MacLeod's status as a writer, he pointed to certain flaws. \"MacLeod is a distinguished writer, but his strengths are inseparable from his weaknesses: the sincerity that produces his sentimentality also stirs his work to a beautifully aroused plainness.\" Wood singles out one story, \"The Tuning of Perfection\", however, for its \"complete lack of sentimentality.\" He writes that by delicately retrieving the past, MacLeod achieves a fineness removed from much contemporary North American fiction. He concludes that in this story, MacLeod \"becomes only himself, provokingly singular and rare, an island of richness.\"\nNovel.\nMacLeod's 1999 novel, \"No Great Mischief\" tells the story of the red-haired and dark-eyed MacDonald clan from 1779 when they left Scotland to settle in Cape Breton to more recent times. The judges, who awarded MacLeod the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2001, described the novel as \"a story of families, and of the ties that bind us to them. It is also a story of exile and of the ties that bind us, generations later, to the land from which our ancestors came.\" They went on to predict that the quality of MacLeod's writing would soon make his name a household word. \"The music of the Cape Breton rings throughout this book, by turns joyful and sad but always haunting. Written in a hypnotic, stately prose where every word is perfectly placed, \"No Great Mischief\" has the same haunting effect, and shows why the master craftsman took more than ten years to write it.\"\nThose observations were echoed by many reviewers. In \"The New York Times\", for example, Thomas Mallon praised the book's lyricism and reported that \"MacLeod's world of Cape Breton \u2013 with its Scottish fishermen and their displaced heirs, the miners and young professionals it has mournfully sent to the rest of the nation \u2013 has become a permanent part of my own inner library.\" Mallon's main criticism was that parts of the novel came across as heavy handed, lacking the deftness of MacLeod's short fiction. He ended, however, by noting that MacLeod's entire body of work would soon be published in the U.S. granting American readers \"a new land that their imaginations can seize like a manifest destiny.\"\nIn the British newspaper \"The Observer\", Stephanie Merritt pointed out that when it was first published, \"No Great Mischief\" drew \"unqualified praise\" from the critics. Her review of the paperback edition concluded: \"In its poetic and emotional range, this is one of the richest novels of recent years.\"\nThe \"Globe and Mail's\" critic Kenneth J. Harvey heaped praise on both the book and its author: \"The book has it all: beauty,\ntragedy, grittiness, humour, darkness, love, music, raunchiness, poetry and a glut of fully drawn, extraordinary characters whose words and deeds and circumstances compel the reader to laugh and blush and weep and swell with bighearted pride...MacLeod is MacLeod, the greatest living Canadian writer and one of the most distinguished writers in the world. \"No Great Mischief\" is the book of the year \u2013 and of this decade. It is a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.\"\nScholarly studies.\nMacLeod's fiction has been studied extensively by post-graduate students. Their master's and doctoral theses explore many aspects of his work including issues concerning regional and ethnic identity; the influence of island boundaries; magical thinking; and, the traditional roles of men and women. MacLeod's work has been compared and, in some cases contrasted, with other Canadian authors such as David Adams Richards, Alden Nowlan, Wayne Johnston, Margaret Laurence, Hugh MacLennan and Ann-Marie MacDonald.\nFamily.\nMacLeod was married for nearly 43 years to the former Anita MacLellan. She grew up in a house on Cape Breton Island that was just a couple of miles from his. They were married on September 4, 1971. They had seven children: six sons and a daughter, with one son dying in infancy. Their oldest son, Alexander MacLeod, is also a writer, whose debut short story collection \"Light Lifting\" was a Scotiabank Giller Prize finalist in 2010.\nDeath.\nMacLeod died on April 20, 2014, after suffering a stroke in January 2014. He was 77. His Requiem Mass was held at St. Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church, in Broad Cove, near his home in Dunvegan. He was laid to rest in the nearby graveyard where generations of MacLeods are buried.\nFilm about MacLeod.\nHe was the subject of a documentary film by the National Film Board, \"Reading Alistair MacLeod\", released in 2005. The 88-minute film, directed by Bill MacGillivray, includes interviews with MacLeod, his wife Anita and other family members. Prominent writers such as Russell Banks, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and David Adams Richards read from and comment on MacLeod's writing. The film also features excerpts from composer Christopher Donison's opera \"Island\" based on one of MacLeod's short stories.\nAwards and honours.\nMacleod's 1999 novel \"No Great Mischief\" won several awards including the International Dublin Literary Award, the Trillium Book Award, the Thomas Head Raddall Award, the Dartmouth Book &amp; Writing Award for Fiction, the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards for author of the year as well as fiction book of the year (2000) and the Atlantic Provinces Booksellers' Choice Award. In 2009, \"No Great Mischief\" was voted Atlantic Canada's greatest book.\nMacLeod won the Portia White Prize in 2001. The prize, awarded by the Province of Nova Scotia, honours artistic excellence and achievement.\nIn 2003, he won the Lannan Literary Award for fiction.\nIn 2008, MacLeod was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, the same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.\nIn 2009, MacLeod received the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction along with Amy Hempel.\nIn 2015, MacLeod was awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.\nMacLeod has been awarded more than a dozen honorary degrees including ones from his alma mater, St. Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University, McGill University and the University of Prince Edward Island.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Traditionally, three films have been nominated each year with exceptions in the early 1980s and 2002 when there were only two nominees; in 1999, when there were four nominees. Beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards, five films were nominated.\nThe competitive category was created in 1981 as the Academy Award for Best Makeup, after the academy received complaints that the makeup work in \"The Elephant Man\" (1980) was not being honored. Although no award was given to \"The Elephant Man\", an entire category dedicated to honoring makeup effects in film was created for subsequent ceremonies. Previously, makeup artists were only eligible for special achievement awards for their work.\nAhead of nominations, a shortlist of titles is chosen by the makeup branch's executive committee and clips are screened by the members of the branch at an annual \"bake-off.\" After only two films were shortlisted in 2002, rules were installed requiring that seven finalists be chosen each year with the top three becoming nominees. Beginning in 2020, the shortlist expanded from seven finalists to ten.\nIn 2012, the category was given its current name for use in the 85th Academy Awards and onward. Makeup artist Rick Baker holds the record for both most wins (7) and most nominations (11) for this award.\nSpecial Achievement Awards.\nBefore 1981, Special Achievement Oscars were twice awarded to makeup artists for their work on a specific film:\nHairstylists.\nStarting in 1993, the award is to be shared with hairstylists if hair effects \"contribute greatly to the appearance and effect of the characters\".\nWinners and nominees.\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release; the ceremonies are always held the following year.

It has been awarded since the 9th Academy Awards to an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role in a film released that year. The award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Supporting Actor winner. However, in recent years, it has shifted towards being presented by previous years' Best Supporting Actress winners instead. In lieu of the traditional Oscar statuette, supporting acting recipients were given plaques up until the 16th Academy Awards, when statuettes were awarded to each category instead.\nThe Best Supporting Actress award has been presented a total of 89 times, to 87 actresses. The first winner was Gale Sondergaard for her role in \"Anthony Adverse\" (1936). The most recent winner is Zoe Salda\u00f1a for her role as Rita Mora Castro in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" (2024). The record for most wins is two, held jointly by Dianne Wiest and Shelley Winters. Each other recipient has only won once, in this category. Thelma Ritter has received the most nominations in the category, with six, followed closely by Amy Adams with five, although neither has ever won\u2014yet, in the latter's instance.

{"id": "61830", "revid": "1319608800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61830", "title": "Academy Award for Best Animated Feature", "text": "Film award\nThe Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is an Academy Award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the best animated feature film. An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.\nFor much of the Academy Awards' history, AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration. Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as Academy Honorary Award for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 1938, and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" in 1989 and \"Toy Story\" in 1996. In fact, prior to the award's creation, only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture: 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast\", also by Disney.\nBy 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards, held on March 24, 2002.\nWinners and nominees.\nWhen the category was first instated, the nomination went to the person(s) most involved in creating the film. This could be the producer, the director, or both. For the 76th Academy Awards in 2003, only the director(s) of the film received the nomination. For the 86th Academy Awards ten years later, this was amended to include one producer and up to two directors. For the 91st Academy Awards, this was amended once again to include up to four individuals, one of whom must be a director and one of whom must be a producer; an exception to this is that \"[i]n the case of a TWO-PERSON TEAM with shared and equal director or producer credit, an additional statuette may be awarded.\"\nThe Academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters. In regards of the Academy, it allows for all members to make voting for animated films more acceptable.\nAt the same year, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as \"A Christmas Carol\" (2009) and \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. The new rule now reads \"An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of greater than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters\u2019 performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique. Motion capture by itself is not an animation technique. In addition, a significant number of the major characters must be animated, and animation must figure in no less than 75 percent of the picture\u2019s running time.\" This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as \"Avatar\" (2009).\nOnly three films (most are live-action/animation hybrid) have been disqualified for not meeting the 75 percent of animation threshold under submission. With exceptions, it was unclear whether \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\" would be eligible for the award at the 95th Academy Awards due to being a stop-motion animated film with the use of live-action elements. Director Dean Fleischer Camp said that he and A24 had to submit documentation in order to prove the film had enough animation to meet the award's minimum requirements. The AMPAS officially deemed the film eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature category and was eventually nominated for said category.\nMultiple wins and nominations.\nStudios.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInternational films.\nA number of non-English-language or non-dialogue films have been nominated or won. Almost all non-English language films on this list have also been released with English-language dubbing. Winners are highlighted in bold below.\nLegacy.\nThe winners of non-Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks Animation films led its significant influence among animation studios for its aesthetics as well as displaying statuettes at museums, solidifying the animation's recognition in mainstream cinema.\nCriticisms and controversies.\nBest Picture criticism.\nSome members and fans have criticized the award, saying it is only intended to prevent animated films from having a chance of winning Best Picture. DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for \"Shrek\", but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize. The criticism of Best Animated Feature was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which \"WALL-E\" won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered one of the best films of 2008. This led to controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of the nomination by the Academy. Film critic Peter Travers commented that \"If there was ever a time where [sic] an animated feature deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, it's \"WALL-E\".\" However, official Academy Award regulations state that any movie nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture. In 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, \"Up\" was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by \"Toy Story 3\".\nCategory bias.\nFavoritism towards mainstream films.\nMany pundits are critical of its category for snubbing non-Disney/Pixar animated films in favor of Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar films as a perennial frontrunner of the award season dominance, with animation historian Amid Amidi accusing Academy voters occasionally of ignorance about the animation medium. There have been complaints that the Best Animated Feature award is held in unfairly low regard by Academy members with many members refusing to vote for films they consider mere children's fare beneath them, or letting their own children see the films and go with their opinions instead. The dominance of Disney and Pixar allegedly as a result of this bias is suggested to be injuring the credibility of the award.\nAnonymous interviews with a selection of Academy voters in 2014 and 2015 revealed indifference towards the animation category, treating animation as being for children, and ignorance about international titles; although the biggest controversy was the omission of other animated films like \"The Lego Movie\" and \"The Book of Life.\"\nOmissions of Japanese animated films outside of Studio Ghibli.\nThe category has also been criticized for frequently snubbing critically acclaimed Japanese animated films not from Studio Ghibli, such as \"Your Name\", \"A Silent Voice\", and \"In This Corner of the World\". 2018's \"Mirai\"\nbecame the first non-Ghibli anime film to receive a nomination in this category.\nRule changes.\nIn 2017, a new rule allowed any Academy voters to vote in the category regardless of background or connection to animation, which led to the nominations of \"The Boss Baby\" and \"Ferdinand\", a decision that received significant criticism from critics and audiences alike because of their lack of solid quality to make them worthy of being nominated, especially above snubbed, but better acclaimed films. Besides being viewed as highly ignorant of this category, it was seen as a move from the Academy to put aside small, foreign and/or independent movies in favor of mainstream ones to attract audiences to something they might know and to keep a Hollywood predominance; this allowed any members of the Academy other than the Animation Branch.\nDespite these changes, other Disney and Pixar films won again since 2019, these are \"Toy Story 4\", \"Soul\", and \"Encanto\", causing outrage among pundits of the category. With the latter at the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the Academy's decision for having three actresses (Halle Bailey, Lily James, and Naomi Scott) who played Disney princesses in their live-action remakes to present the category was heavily criticized. While presenting, the three actresses joked about kids singing their favorite songs from their favorite animated feature repeatedly, leaving its ignorance of animation as a medium that can also be for adults as well (as was the case for the documentary \"Flee\" being nominated in said category).\nAlongside \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" and \"The Boy and the Heron\", the 2024 Latvian film \"Flow\" marked the first time that non-Disney films won the category in three consecutive years, breaking Disney and Pixar's winning streak, while also making history as the first time an independent animated feature won the top prize in this category.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
